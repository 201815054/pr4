0,2022-04-22,"As a candidate, Joe Biden made climate change a pillar of his campaign for the White House, promising to decarbonize the U.S. economy, end drilling on public lands, and lead the world in a historic shift away from fossil fuels.
But more than a year into his presidency, Biden has instead been forced by rampant inflation and a war in Europe to prioritize energy security, leading his administration to unleash record amounts of crude oil from strategic reserves and to urge drillers to pump harder to keep up with demand.
The jarring shift in Biden’s energy policy priorities reflects the difficulties any U.S. administration might face in attempting a sweeping, decades-long reform of the country's massive energy economy to curb global warming while simultaneously assisting geopolitical allies and keeping consumer prices in check. 
Failing to achieve that balance could have big political consequences for Biden’s fellow Democrats in November’s mid-term elections: conservatives will blame the party if pump prices stay high, while progressives will punish it if it backslides on its climate promises. 
“The reality is there has to be short-term costs for long-term gain and I'm not sure this administration is willing to pay the price,"" said Ed Hirs, an energy economist at the University of Houston, referring to the political and financial costs of fighting climate change.
White House spokesperson Jen Psaki, asked this week whether the president was still confident the U.S. could hit his climate targets given the headwinds, didn't forecast success. “We are continuing to pursue it, and we are going to continue to do everything we can to reach it,” Psaki said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Oil prices rose on Thursday, buffeted by concerns about tightened supply as the European Union (EU) mulls a potential ban on Russian oil imports that would further restrict worldwide oil trade.
Brent crude futures settled up $1.53 to close at $108.33 a barrel, after earlier reaching a high of $109.80. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures ended up $1.60, or 1.6%, to $103.79, after earlier reaching a high of $105.42.
Buyers also reacted to ongoing interruptions in Libya, which is losing more than 550,000 barrels per day of oil output due to blockades at major fields and export terminals.
Brent has gained nearly 8% in the last seven trading days, but the rally has come at a slow, grinding pace, unlike the frenzy that accompanied moves in late February when Russia invaded Ukraine and in mid-March as well. 
""It's not as easy a trade as it was a couple of weeks ago,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group. ""You have to risk more, and that may be by design with these hedge funds and algo funds trading more."" 
The market sold off somewhat after U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday that the EU needs to be careful about a complete ban on imports of Russian energy because it would likely cause oil prices to spike. 
The EU is still weighing such a ban over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise its neighbour.
Flynn said the market is weighing the possibility that, down the road, slowed growth or additional supply could undermine the bullish case for oil. In the meantime, however, the market remains tight. U.S. stocks of distillate fuels are near 14-year lows, the U.S. Energy Department said on Wednesday.
Traders also cited comments from Federal Reserve officials that suggested an aggressive path for increasing U.S. interest rates in coming months. That could drag on growth, reducing demand for energy products.

Investing.com -- Oil prices rose almost 2% Thursday as those who sold crude down in the past two sessions covered their shorts amid a return of the supply issues that had fueled much of this year’s energy rally.
Brent, the London-traded global benchmark for crude, settled up $1.53, or 1.4%, at $108.33 per barrel. 
Brent had lost almost 6% over two previous sessions largely due IMF downgrades of 2022/23 global economic growth and the scare over new Covid deaths in China, the world’s second largest consumer of oil.
New York-traded  West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, the benchmark for U.S. crude, gained $1.60, or 1.6%, to settle at $103.79 on Thursday. 
WTI lost a net of more than 5% over the past two days, despite closing up in the previous session. Prior to Wednesday’s rebound, it fell below key $100 support to a session low of $99.89.
Thursday’s higher close in Brent and WTI came as Germany suggested it will halve its Russian oil imports by the summer and end them by the end of the year. 
Oil traders have disputed for weeks that Berlin and the rest of the EU will be able to disengage with Russia as simply as stated, despite the West’s stand that the action is appropriate and in line with its sanctions against Moscow for the war in Ukraine.
“Given how big a market (Germany) is for Russia, accounting for roughly half its exports will come as a real blow” to the supply-demand situation in oil, said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “Oil prices are creeping higher again but remain pretty much in the middle of the range they've traded within for the last month.”
Oil’s narrative was also made more bullish by Libya, which said Wednesday that it was losing more than 550,000 barrels per day of oil output due to blockades at major fields and export terminals.
The North African country is one of the main contributors to the output of OPEC+, the global oil producing alliance. 
Made up of 23 countries and officially led by Saudi Arabia, with assistance from Russia, OPEC+ has struggled to meet its output targets for months due to under-investment in global oil fields during the height of the coronavirus outbreak. The situation has worsened since the start of the Feb. 24 Ukraine war and the consequent sanctions on Russia.",,,,,
3,2022-04-22,,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. West Coast is importing gasoline at a near-record pace this month to help ease supply constraints amid eye-popping pump prices just ahead of the peak summer driving season.
Around 120,000 barrels a day of gasoline and blending components are expected to reach the U.S. West Coast in April, including 95,000 barrels a day that have already arrived, marking the second-highest monthly level since oil analytics firm Vortexa began tracking the data in January 2016. The region imported 150,000 barrels a day in May 2019.
These imports underscore the need to replenish supply ahead of what’s shaping up to be a tight summer for gasoline. A heavy maintenance season that’s just now winding down left West Coast refinery rates at 84% last week. That has put additional pressure on drivers, with Californians paying more than anywhere else in the U.S. for gasoline.
 Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) is due to carry out major maintenance in June at its Richmond, California refinery, one of the West Coast’s largest, after a labor strike delayed the original schedule in April. This will tighten gasoline supplies during peak demand months. Meanwhile, signs that high fuel prices may have deterred some drivers in March have now evaporated with implied U.S. gasoline demand reverting to the seasonal rising norm, pushing inventories below the five-year average for this time of year nationally and on the West Coast.
The jump in imports is driven by increased volumes from Asia, which accounted for about 60% of the monthly volume. Indian refineries have been operating at above 100% capacity in order to capture high export margins, while China is ramping up fuel exports as a Covid-19 resurgence weighs on local demand.
Pump prices in California are still hovering near record levels, while the rest of the country saw a reprieve earlier this month. Californians are now paying an average of $5.689 a gallon for gasoline, 4% lower than the peak of $5.919 a gallon reached on March 29, according to auto club AAA. Meanwhile, national pump prices are heading higher once again at $4.12 a gallon.

4,2022-04-22,"U.S. companies can help rebuild Ukraine with digital infrastructure, clean energy and more in the aftermath of Russia's invasion, U.S. Export-Import Bank President Reta Jo Lewis said on Thursday before a meeting with Ukraine finance officials.
""We want Ukraine to win. That's why we're doing everything we can to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to strengthen Ukraine's position on the battlefield and at the negotiating table,"" Lewis said.
Ukraine's finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, welcomed the strong U.S. support and said his country is looking for bridge financing to fill gaps in its budget.
The country's central bank governor, Kyrylo Shevchenko, said the Ukrainian banking system was in good shape and that payment systems are functioning, nearly two months after Russia launched its Feb. 24 assault on its Eastern European neighbor.
Ukraine is expected to lose a third of its gross domestic product in 2022 under a moderately optimistic scenario, Shevchenko said.
He said Ukraine had received nearly $4 billion in aid from the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and European Union, among others, but would need continued funding to cover gaps in its budget.

""In order to keep sufficient level of these resources, it will be crucial for us to continue to continue receiving official finances from our international partners,"" Shevchenko said, adding that his government was counting on U.S. support.
The Ukrainian delegation met with Lewis and other officials at EXIM's headquarters in Washington on the sidelines of the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank.

5,2022-04-22,,,,,,"U.S. farmers are off to a slow start in their corn planting this year and farmers in many key growing areas will likely remain sidelined for much of the next two weeks as the latest forecasts show showers and cool temperatures in the southern Midwest and Mississippi River Delta.
A big U.S. crop is needed this year to help fill the gap in supply left by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has left grain stocks from last year stranded in that key export country and threatens to curtail production in 2022 as farmers there are unable to plant due to the fighting.
""It is incredibly important that we produce a maximum crop to keep prices stable,"" said Sterling Smith, director of agricultural research at AgriSompo North America. ""We are going to need perfect weather and right now we do not have perfect weather."" 
Chicago Board of Trade corn futures have surged 17.5% since Russia's invasion, with the most-active contract nearing a 10-year high, as importers have scrambled to find alternative suppliers for their grain with Ukraine's export ports shut down.
The International Grains Council cut its forecast for 2022/23 world corn production by 13 million tonnes to 1.197 billion on Thursday. Ukraine is the world's fifth biggest corn producer, with farmers harvesting 41.9 million tonnes in 2021.
The U.S. Agriculture Department said that 4% of the U.S. corn crop had been seeded as of April 17, down 3 percentage points from a year earlier and below the five-year average of 6%. Farmers in major production states such as Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and North Dakota had not seeded any corn yet. [US/COR]
""This has been a spring that's had trouble getting started,"" said David Streit, a Commodity Weather Group meteorologist.

More rain was in the forecast this weekend for southern areas of the Midwest where farmers are typically running planters by now. And then cold temperatures return next week following a brief warm-up, Streit added.
U.S. farmers aim to have their corn seeding finished by the middle of May as yield potential can be reduced by about a bushel per acre for each day their crop is planted past that deadline.

6,2022-04-22,,,,,," Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). estimates there will be a $4 trillion market by 2050 for capturing carbon dioxide and storing it underground, the company said in a presentation on Tuesday.
That is about 60% of the $6.5 trillion market the U.S. largest crude producer estimates for oil and gas by then.
Carbon capture is an important emissions reduction technology, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). It involves the capture of CO2 from fuel combustion or industrial processes, transporting it via ship or pipeline, to be stored underground in geological formations or used as a resource to create products.
Large oil companies have been investing to make carbon capture and storage (CCS) a relevant business as international bodies such as Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) point the technology as key to mitigate the effects of global warming.

Exxon is under public pressure to reduce its total emissions as its energy transition strategy does not include renewable sources of energy like solar and wind. It has recently hired Dan Ammann, who led the Cruise self-driving unit of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) until December, to lead its Low Carbon business starting on May 1. 
U.S. oil producer Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), developing the world's largest project to extract CO2 from the air, has previously estimated CCS could become a $3-5 trillion global industry. The technology could generate as much in earnings and cash flow for Occidental than oil and gas today, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said at a conference in March.

8,2022-04-22,,,,,,"OPEC told the International Monetary Fund's steering committee on Thursday that the surge in oil prices was largely due to the Ukraine crisis, in the latest signal that the producer group would not take further action to add supply.
In a statement to the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) seen by Reuters, OPEC said the price of global benchmark Brent crude had averaged near $98 a barrel in the first quarter, up about $18 from the last three months of 2021.
""Oil prices have been on the rise, particularly in March this year ... mainly due to the escalating geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and concerns this might result in large oil supply shortages, amid trade dislocations,"" OPEC told the IMFC.
The IMFC is part of the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank's Board of Governors. 
OPEC, which took part in a meeting of the IMFC last year, has been resisting calls by the United States and European Union to pump more oil to cool prices, which reached a 14-year peak above $139 last month after Washington and Brussels imposed sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
OPEC+, which consists of OPEC and other producers including Russia, will raise output by about 432,000 barrels per day in May, as part of a gradual unwinding of output cuts made during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

OPEC said that OPEC+ had shown its commitment to ensuring that oil supply and demand fundamentals were in balance during the Ukraine crisis to support the global economy.
OPEC also highlighted the negative short-term impact of the Ukraine crisis and ongoing pandemic, adding: ""The strong rise in commodity prices, in combination with ongoing supply chain bottlenecks and COVID-19-related logistical constraints are fuelling already high global inflation"".

9,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Some U.S. oilfield firms whose Venezuelan operations were frozen by sanctions are joining an appeal to Washington for authorizations to restart oil drilling in the South American country, according to eight sources with knowledge of the talks.
If they are allowed to resume work, Venezuela could quickly ramp up production capacity beyond 1 million barrels per day (bpd), analysts said. 
The new supply could also fill a void left by U.S. ban on Russian energy imports over its invasion of Ukraine that has contributed to crude prices above $100 per barrel. 
Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Baker Hughes and Weatherford International (NASDAQ:WFRD) have been barred since 2019 from helping Venezuelan state-run PDVSA and its joint ventures produce oil. Any easing by the U.S. Treasury Department of a restricted license the four companies share with  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) could let them expand operations.
Since the United States first imposed oil trading sanctions on Venezuela, many firms removed equipment and staff and wrote off hundreds of millions dollars of their assets there. But over a dozen rigs remain stored near the nation's largest oilfields.
A high-level meeting last month between U.S. and Venezuelan officials opened the door to a possible return of Venezuela's oil to the United States. Sanctions were first imposed in 2019 to choke oil exports and deprive Caracas of its main source of revenue in its bid to see the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. 
The talks coincided with Washington's ban on Russian oil imports, a measure that will take full effect this week, potentially hurting U.S. refiners and contributing to rising fuel prices. 
Oil companies that still have a presence in Venezuela could promptly reactivate equipment in the country, the sources said, potentially reviving crude output, which remains at 40% of pre-sanction levels.
""If PDVSA's joint ventures are seeking to obtain licenses to operate, they will need the oil services companies,"" Reinaldo Quintero, president of Venezuela's Petroleum Chamber told Reuters. 
Several U.S.-based and local oilfield firms have approached the chamber to express their desire to resume work in Venezuela, he added, declining to provide details on the talks.
Baker Hughes said it would not comment on speculation or future activity. Schlumberger said its policies do not permit lobbying or political contributions. Halliburton declined to comment on future plans in Venezuela. 
Investment firm Amos Global Energy has submitted requests to the United States to participate in Venezuela's energy sector and has an oilfield company ready to provide services if granted, founder Ali Moshiri said.
Weatherford and PDVSA did not reply to requests for comment.
LINING UP 
Chevron has requested authorization from U.S. President Joe Biden's administration to take operating control of its projects with PDVSA. The oil major also has begun readying a team for returning Venezuelan crude to the United States.
But U.S officials are still debating whether to revamp the current license, set to expire in June, sources in Washington familiar with the talks said. The move would be widely seen as an easing of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector. 
Prospects for a change dimmed after an outcry from Republican lawmakers and some of Biden's fellow Democrats following the Caracas talks. U.S. officials are mindful that there could be further blowback if it proceeds, the people added. 
Some U.S. oilfield firms have communicated individually to the U.S. Treasury through intermediaries support for Chevron's efforts to get an expanded license and could provide services if an approval is granted, one of the Washington sources said.
The talks were not made through formal lobbying, according to two company sources. 
Even though the companies' current petition is for resuming some operations using mothballed drilling units in Venezuela, they hope to later secure U.S. permits to bring in additional equipment, the person added. 
The U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment. 
LETHARGIC OUTPUT 
Small firms hired by PDVSA since 2021 to revive oil output mainly by coil tubing techniques and well maintenance have helped stop a free-fall in production and exports.
But Venezuela's active drilling rig count remains at zero since 2020, versus 87 units in 2013, according to Baker Hughes' statistics. A portion of equipment once operated by local contractors and Russia-controlled firms is now inactive.
Only a handful of big drilling rigs are deployed in the Orinoco Belt, Venezuela's main oil region, and the ones there"

By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% higher at $103.79 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.4% to $108.29 a barrel.
U.S. Gasoline RBOB Futures were up 0.9% at $3.3131 a gallon.
Russian troops have continued their assault on the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, prompting finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven nations to state that they want to isolate Moscow from the global economy for its unprovoked “war of aggression.”
The European Union is still weighing a ban on Russian oil, but although nothing formal has been agreed a number of consumers appear to be taking matters into their own hands by going elsewhere for their crude, adding to the overall tightness of the global market.
Bloomberg reported that Russian oil output averaged 10.11 million barrels of oil a day from the start of this month to April 19, which is down from 11.01 million barrels a day in March.
“Given the large amount of self-sanctioning we are seeing with Russian oil, it is likely that output will only decline further as term contracts expire,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
The European Union, in partnership with the International Energy Agency, has outlined a number of steps for its citizens to take to try and reduce the continent’s dependence on Russian energy, including turning down heating, lowering car speeds, and remote working.
The announcement of these steps suggests that an immediate EU ban on the use of Russian oil is unlikely in the immediate future.
“More likely will be a gradual phasing out of Russian oil, much like we are seeing with coal. A gradual phasing out would give time for trade flows to adjust in a more orderly fashion and so the impact on price would be more limited compared to an immediate ban,” added ING.
Elsewhere, Libya, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, stated on Wednesday that it was losing more than 550,000 barrels per day of oil output due to blockades at major fields and export terminals.
Turning to the demand side, investors continue to monitor the COVID outbreak and associated lockdowns in China, the world’s largest import of crude, as the country struggles to contain a surge in cases including the first fatalities since the original outbreak.
Crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, released Wednesday, showed a draw of 8 million barrels last week, suggesting demand remains strong in the world’s largest consumer."

Bullion has flipped between gains and losses each day so far this week, and fell as much as 0.8% on Thursday as 10-Year yields rose amid a debate around whether inflation is peaking. Real rates turned positive for the first time in two years this week, a sign investors believe the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates to cool inflation without severely hurting the economy.
Still, a Fed anecdotal survey showed inflationary pressures have remained strong, clouding the outlook for future growth. Gold prices are proving resilient -- gaining about 6% this year -- as haven demand stays robust with investors focusing on political and economic risk. That’s supporting purchases through gold-backed exchange-traded funds, which have seen holdings rise to the highest in more than a year, according to initial data compiled by Bloomberg.
“While higher interest rates may weigh, worries about inflation, growth, and increased market volatility, together with the war in Ukraine, remain the key reasons why asset managers continue to accumulate exposure,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S.

Energy saving has long been needed to meet climate goals, but months of soaring energy prices and a scramble to cut reliance on Russian fossil fuels following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine have pushed the issue up the political agenda.
In a guide launched with the European Commission on Thursday, the Paris-based IEA recommended Europeans work from home where possible, share cars, avoid driving on Sundays in large cities, and use bikes, public transport or walk more.
The IEA said if followed, the recommendations could save 450 euros per year on the energy bill of a typical EU household, depending on factors such as the type of home and car owned. 
Just turning down the thermostat by 1C could shave 70 euros off a household's heating bill, while driving on average 10 km per hour slower on motorways could save another 60 euros per year on fuel, it said.
If done EU-wide, the measures could save 220 million barrels of oil per year and 17 billion cubic metres of gas, the IEA said. 
The 27-country EU has pledged to stop Russian fuels by 2027, but in the short term remains dependent on Moscow for 26% of its oil imports and 40% of its gas"
14,2022-04-22,"The San Francisco Bay will soon have a new fossil fuel-free ferry floating in its waters, propelled completely by hydrogen fuel cells, and officials hope it heralds change on the high seas.
Aptly named Sea Change, the 70-foot (21-meter), 75-passenger ferry will service multiple stops along San Francisco's waterfront. It was built at All American Marine shipyard in Bellingham, Washington, and was undergoing tests with the U.S. Coast Guard in nearby Puget Sound.
    ""We're here in the water, under hydrogen fuel cell power and it's the first commercial vessel in the world that's got that propulsion system,"" said Pace Ralli, chief executive of  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) Maritime, standing on the bow of the ferry in Bellingham Bay.
Sea Change marks another industry exploring fuel cells as clean-energy cars, trucks, trains and pleasure boats are being developed.
Advocates assert hydrogen fuel cells are cleaner than other carbon-cutting methods as they only emit water and heat, but the high cost and bulky fuel cell systems have limited the use of the technology.
    Ralli conceived the idea for the fuel cell-powered ferry while living in New York City, trying to find ways to decarbonize the maritime industry.
""There was a project in California that was being sponsored by the California Air Resources Board, and they were working on hydrogen fuel cell as a method for decarbonizing ships, so we joined up with them and funded their project in 2019,"" Ralli said.
    As he spoke, three hydrogen fuel cell stacks whirred in the engine room, helping power two propellers that move the ferry along at a top speed of 20 knots. All American Marine project manager Jeff Sokolik helmed Sea Change, pressing buttons on a touchscreen that engage automated systems communicating with the engine room.
""This is going to be the next standard in fuel-cell driven vessels. They're clean, they're efficient and they make sense economically on scale,"" said Sokolik, who believes this eco-friendly maritime innovation could be widely adopted as soon as 10 years from now.
As companies move toward a zero-emission world, the desire to hit their sustainability targets has risen.
    The International Maritime Organization's Greenhouse Gas Study conducted in 2020 states that greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased from 977 million tonnes in 2012 to 1,076 million tonnes in 2018, a 9.6% increase in six years. 
""We're focused on the shipping industry because that's where we have expertise, but I don't think any industry can really wait at this point,"" Ralli said.

    ""We're really paving the regulatory framework that's needed to take this to a larger harbor craft, whether it's tugs and other larger ferries or even ocean-going vessels like container ships and cruise ships and tankers,"" he adds.
    If all goes to plan, Ralli said the boat will be delivered to the Bay Area in late May and serve passengers in June, just in time for San Francisco's summer season.

Gold futures edged down 0.13% to $1,953 by 1:08 AM ET (5:08 AM GMT). The dollar, which normally moves inversely to gold, inched up on Thursday.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were back on an upward trend after falling from three-year highs on Wednesday. U.S. bond yields have been climbing over expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will aggressively hike interest rates.

Oil has rallied by more than a third this year, hitting the highest since 2008 after Russia’s invasion of its smaller neighbor sent shockwaves through the global energy market. The conflict has boosted inflation and spurred a rerouting of crude flows. The U.S. and U.K. have moved to ban Russian oil, and there’s rising pressure on the EU to follow suit.

21,2022-04-22,"Russia's customs service has decided to temporarily suspend publication of import and export data in order to exclude errors and ""speculation"", the head of the service said on Thursday.

""The Federal Customs Service is not publishing statistics on imports and exports. I support this decision, I think it is justified in order to avoid incorrect estimates, speculation and discrepancies regarding imports. This is a temporary measure,"" Interfax news agency quoted the head of the service, Vladimir Bulavin, as saying. 
The customs service used to disclose import and export data for the country's most important products in the first 10 days of each month.

That decline demoted Russia to Germany's 12th-biggest export market outside the European Union, down from fifth in February.
Russian troops invaded Ukraine in what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24, prompting the West to impose tough sanctions. These include export restrictions.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) -New Zealand's consumer prices rose at the fastest pace in three decades last quarter, underlining the need for the central bank to stay on its hawkish course to contain price pressures without tipping the economy into recession.
The New Zealand dollar slipped after the data showed inflation was not quite as hot as feared though, slightly softening expectations the central bank would again hike rates by 50 basis points in May.
Annual inflation rose 6.9% in the first quarter from 5.9% in the fourth quarter, the fastest since a 7.6% clip in the June quarter of 1990, Statistics New Zealand said in a statement on Thursday
CPI rose 1.8% in the quarter ending March from a 1.4% rise in the fourth quarter. But the data was below economists’ expectations in a Reuters poll that forecast a 2.0% rise for the quarter, and an annual rise of 7.1%.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) raised interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points to 1.50% last Wednesday, its fourth increase in a row. It has signalled that further hikes will be needed if it wants to get ahead of inflation.
BROAD BASED PRICE RISES
Inflation pressures were broad based with domestic price pressures continuing to intensify. Statistics New Zealand data showed rising prices for food, petrol, construction and housing.
""This domestic inflation is the kind that doesn't go away quickly,"" ANZ Bank economists said in a research note. ""This continued rise in domestic inflation pressures only reinforces the need for ongoing interest rate rises by the RBNZ.""
ANZ believes higher interest rates will squeeze indebted households this year and engineering a soft landing for the overheated economy could be challenging, especially with the housing market already softening.
The kiwi dollar eased 0.4% to $0.6772, from $0.6804 just before the data hit dealing screens. Two-year swap rates dipped as much as six basis points to 3.52%.

With global inflation expected to stay elevated for some time, and prices of commodities and goods affected by supply issues, economists expect RBNZ to hike interest rates again. 
""Uncertainty is high but we could still see a 7% annual inflation print delivered in Q2 of this year,"" ASB Bank economists wrote in a note. It added the bigger issue for them was not when inflation would peak, but how persistent it was.

25,2022-04-22,,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea’s early trade data indicate exports are set to post strong gains in April, underscoring the resilience of global commerce to upheavals caused by war in Ukraine and China’s lockdowns.
Exports advanced 16.9% in the first 20 days of the month from a year earlier, led by semiconductors, the customs office reported Thursday. Imports advanced by 25.5%.
South Korea releases trade data earlier than most countries and its 20-day performance is closely watched as an indicator of global demand due to Korean companies’ deep integration into the world’s supply chains.
Exports are a major component of South Korea’s economy, which is expected to miss growth estimates this year as inflationary pressures overshadow consumption worldwide. Russia’s war on Ukraine is compounding difficulties, while China’s measures to contain Covid are weighing on the export outlook.
Exports to China, the biggest buyer of Korean goods, rose 1.8% between April 1-20 from a year earlier, while shipments to Hong Kong plunged 32.3%. 
Exports to the U.S. advanced 29.1%, while those to the European Union climbed 12.3% and those to Japan increased 9.6%. 
Overall semiconductor shipments increased 22.9%. Exports of cars edged down 1%, while oil products jumped 82%. Sales of wireless communication devices fell 10.7%.

LONDON (Reuters) -British Finance Minister Rishi Sunak and his Canadian counterpart Chrystia Freeland walked out of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting in Washington to protest the invasion of Ukraine when Russia's delegate spoke on Thursday, a British finance ministry spokesperson said.
Before walking out, Sunak ""described (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's assault on Ukraine as an assault on the rules and norms that are the foundation of our economic way of life,"" the spokesperson said.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, who walked out of a G20 meeting in Washington on Wednesday for the same reason, said on Thursday there should be ""no appeasement"" of Russia due to the economic problems caused by the invasion of Ukraine.
The G20 includes Western countries that have accused Moscow of war crimes in Ukraine, as well as China, India, Indonesia and South Africa which have not joined Western-led sanctions against Russia over the conflict.
G20 finance ministers and central bank governors met on the sidelines of a semi-annual conference held by the IMF and World Bank in Washington, with the Ukraine war, food security and ongoing recovery from the coronavirus pandemic the key topics.
After Canada's Freeland returned to the meeting, she directly addressed Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, who was attending virtually, a source familiar with what happened in the meeting room said.
""It is perverse and absurd to hear you speaking today when your war is making us poorer,"" she said, according to the source. 
""Your war is causing food prices to rise and will cause people to go hungry. Your war is causing energy prices to rise. Your war is driving inflation, which hurts the most vulnerable.""
Canada's finance ministry declined to comment.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory, but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
Freeland, who is of Ukrainian descent and has made impassioned pleas on behalf of the country, went on to speak about how women were ""the particular targets of this war.""
""Rape is being used systematically as a weapon of war by Russia,"" Freeland said, according to the source.

Addressing Siluanov by name, she concluded by saying Ukraine would win the war and ""Russia and the Russian leadership will bear full responsibility for the crimes being committed today"". 
Earlier on Thursday, Britain ramped up trade sanctions on Russia, targeting luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds through import bans and higher tariffs, seeking to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A White House adviser on Thursday suggested the United States could lower tariffs imposed on a host of non-strategic Chinese goods such as bicycles or apparel to help combat inflation.
Deputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh said tariffs imposed by the former Trump government may have given the administration some negotiating leverage, but these tariffs served no strategic purpose, and China had similar non-strategic retaliatory tariffs in place.
""So that's the opportunity,"" he told an event hosted by the Bretton Woods Committee. ""It could be that in this moment of elevated inflation and China having its own very serious supply chain concerns ... maybe there's something we can do there."" 
Inflation is a critical concern for President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings are falling as the costs of energy, food and other staples increase, and his Democrats are at serious risk of losing their majorities in Congress in midterm congressional elections in November.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai has restarted an exclusion process that could lower tariffs on some Chinese goods, but has made no major moves to wholesale remove tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods.
The United States could use tariffs to advance strategic priorities such as strengthening critical supply chains and maintaining U.S. preeminence in foundational technologies and to support national security, Singh said.
""For product categories that are not implicated by those objectives, there's not much of a case for those tariffs being in place,"" he said. ""Why do we have tariffs on bicycles or apparel or underwear?"" 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in December said lowering Trump-era tariffs on imported goods from China through a revived exclusion process could help ease some inflationary pressures, although she stressed it would be no ""game-changer."" 
Singh's comments come as Washington is urging Beijing to refrain from undermining sweeping sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine.
Singh said the Biden administration believed Chinese banks and companies were largely being cautious and steering clear of helping Russia to evade Western sanctions, and underscored China's interest in continuing to trade with the West.

Singh said it was clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping wanted to achieve supremacy through economic and technological dominance, but there were areas where the two countries could cooperate, including to combat climate change.
He said Xi was likely to continue to rely on state-owned enterprises and national champions, and they would continue to receive very heavy government subsidies.

Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD)'s board said the proposal was not credible as it had no evidence of financing and required multiple months of exclusivity, among other reasons.
Spear Point said it had also offered to enlist the services of its data valuation and monetization partner, Silverback United, to value Rite Aid when it presented the bid, and also offered to share the valuation with the drugstore chain so it can seek a higher value.
However, as Rite Aid rejected the offer, Spear Point said it plans to discuss with the company's shareholders and management about how Rite Aid is ""significantly undervalued and explore management's inability to unlock that value"".
Shares in Rite Aid closed 6% lower at $7.68 on Thursday.
The New York Post had reported late on Wednesday the private-equity firm had made an offer valuing Rite Aid at more than $800 million.

Rite Aid had a market capitalization of $428.4 million as of Thursday's close.

30,2022-04-22,,,,,,"China has committed to joining Zambia's creditor committee, International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday, amid complaints from Zambia's finance minister about delays to its debt restructuring.
People's Bank of China governor Yi Gang said that China intended to co-chair the committee, two sources with knowledge of the International Monetary and Finance Committee meeting told Reuters.
Zambia became the first pandemic-era default in 2020 and is buckling under a debt burden of almost $32 billion, around 120% of GDP.
""We were very pleased to hear from Governor Yi Gang... a very specific commitment to join the creditor committee on Zambia and work expeditiously for debt resolution,"" said Georgieva at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Spring Meetings.
She added that he had also committed to the Common Framework debt restructuring process, launched by the Group of 20 (G20) leading economies in 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Zambia's finance minister Situmbeko Musokotwane said at public events on Thursday that the debt restructuring process had ""stalled"" and that the Zambian team had ""come here to complain"".
An IMF spokesperson said that they did not have any more details of Yi's statement, noting that it was at a closed door meeting.
""This augurs well, for coordination, in resolving debt for various African countries,"" Zimbabwe's finance minister Mthuli Ncube tweeted of the Chinese position.
Ethiopia and Chad also signed up to the Common Framework more than a year ago and have yet to receive debt relief.
""China is a very significant lender to many of these low-income countries, and China needs to participate, along with the Paris Club and private creditors,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said at a press conference before Georgieva's.

""I've called on China to specifically for example participate right away in a meeting for Zambia, that wishes to undergo debt restructuring. And I am hopeful that China will agree to play a more constructive role.""

32,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Canada's ruling Liberals are eyeing more measures to curb housing speculation after introducing a foreign buyer ban and heftier taxes on property flippers in their budget earlier this month, the housing minister said on Thursday. 
Minister Ahmed Hussen, asked about imposing further measures to slow investor activity such as requiring larger down-payments for second, third or subsequent homes, did not rule out the option.
""We are curbing speculation by doing a number of things ... but also we haven't closed the door to further measures,"" Hussen told Reuters in an interview. He noted that Canada's tax and real estate systems are complex, which complicates the process.
""We have to study further and really examine closely what further measures we can take to deal with issues around speculation,"" he said.
Housing prices have surged more than 50% in the last two years, driven by low interest rates, a desire for more space and speculative activity. The Bank of Canada found investors now buy one in every five homes. 
GRAPHIC: Canadian home prices skyrocket https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-HOUSING/PRICES/klpyklgaypg/chart.png 
Hot housing helped drive Canada's inflation rate to a 31-year high in March. Price and sales growth are expected to stay elevated this year, but moderate by late 2023 or early 2024, Canada's national housing agency said Thursday.
To curb speculation, the government is putting in place a temporary ban on foreign buyers and a new measure to more fully tax properties resold within a year of purchase.
Under the current tax system, a home buyer who leaves property empty only to sell it a few months later is taxed the same as the one who owns a property and rents it out for decades, before selling.
""Right now our tax system treats two scenarios the same, and we have to change that,"" said Hussen.
The minister was confident that the ban on foreign buyers, which will be in effect for at least two years, will ""certainly create more homes for Canadians.""

34,2022-04-22,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s premier economic and financial club may be irrevocably broken.
The Group of 20, conceived in the 1990s to bring the biggest developed and emerging markets into a single forum to address key global challenges, failed this week to issue a joint communique following a meeting of its finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Washington.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also led a partial walkout from a session that featured Russian officials, in protest over their inclusion given Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
The G-20 has weathered tensions in the past, including the Trump administration’s opposition to language over protectionism in previous declarations from the group. But it’s no longer clear that the likes of the U.S., China and Russia share the same fundamental objectives -- raising the risk that it will fail to serve as a coordinating body for tackling problems ranging from looming food and debt crises to climate change.
“Our system of global governance and ability to tackle key global challenges is being disrupted,” said Mark Sobel, a former top Treasury Department international-affairs official who’s now U.S. chairman for the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think tank.
A confrontation had been brewing since last month, when U.S. President Joe Biden called for the Russians, in the wake of their attack, to be excluded from the G-20. But China and Indonesia, which holds the group’s rotating presidency, wouldn’t go along.
‘Profound Question’
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati of Indonesia, in a Wednesday press briefing following the G-20 finance chiefs’ meeting, said the group “continues as a premier forum for all of us to continue to discuss and talk about all of the issues,” despite the tensions.
But former U.S. Treasury Lawrence Summers, who helped set up the G-20, says it’s now a “very profound question” as to whether it retains its original premise of shared interests in mutual economic development and a determination to jointly solve problems to further that endeavor.
“Self evidently, it is not the objective of most of the other members of the G-20 to support Russia’s economic flourishing,” Summers, a Harvard University professor and paid Bloomberg TV contributor, said on Bloomberg’s Stephanomics podcast last week. “It is a substantial question whether we are hoping for the success of the Chinese economy, and whether China is hoping for the success of our economy.”
A “variable architecture” could emerge, with different forums featuring participants with more in common but having less reach, and bigger ones where there’s less in common but more reach, Summers said.
Pivotal Forum
While the G-7 grouping of democratic, advanced-economy nations remains as a long-standing forum for that group, it’s not big and broad enough to address issues like food insecurity and climate change, Sobel said. (The body included Russia as the Group of Eight from 1998 until the country’s invasion of Crimea in 2014.)
The G-20 was pivotal last year in generating a consensus behind the biggest overhaul in global corporate tax rules in decades -- something the G-7 likely wouldn’t have been able to coordinate. Amid the U.S.-China trade war in 2019, it also served as a forum where Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping could at least meet, averting a deeper breakdown in ties.
“It’s the only body where you would have Russia, China and India meet face-to-face for days at a time.” said Josh Lipsky, director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “It was more than just a group for talk, it was a group of action.”
While G-20 communiques weren’t binding sets of commitments, they could be used to call governments to account if they later failed to live up to pledges made.
Wednesday Dust-up
Formed first as a gathering of finance officials following the emerging-market crises of the 1990s, the G-20 became the pre-eminent forum for steering the world economy after the turmoil of 2008, when its leaders began convening summits. An April 2009 gathering in London was a high point, when countries coordinated action to support the world economy and limit further financial fallout.
Those heights mark a big contrast with Wednesday’s dust-up, when U.S., Canadian, Danish, British and Ukrainian officials walked out of a morning G-20 session in Washington -- conducted in a hybrid in-person and video format -- just as a Russian representative began speaking. Some others participating remotely reportedly turned off their cameras as part of the protest.
The moment didn’t stop the proceedings, and Spanish, French and German officials didn’t leave the room. A person familiar with the situation said Spain felt compelled to stay, given its status as the current head of an important panel at the International Monetary Fund. Some other European officials opted to remain out of solidarity, the person said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The split over Russia wasn’t the only symptom of a breakdown over global economic coordination. While Yellen insisted during a press conference Thursday that the group was continuing to get important work done, she also said she was “deeply disappointed” with efforts to organize a debt-service suspension initiative for developing nations that are now struggling after their borrowing swelled to address the pandemic.
Value Unclear
Yellen also said she “specifically called out China” for needing to step up its participation in debt relief. 
John Kirton, director for the G-20 Research Group at the University of Toronto, said the rift over Russia is harmful in the short run, but not debilitating. Below the level of cabinet ministers, important work will continue among deputies and technical experts, he said. Lipsky agreed.
For that reason, and because of Russia’s declining influence, Kirton was even more optimistic. The disruption this week “does have an impact, but not a serious, prolonged or existential one.”
An important gauge of the G-20’s continuing relevance looms later this year, when members’ leaders are scheduled to gather in Bali, Indonesia, for a summit. Indonesia has invited President Vladimir Putin to attend, despite Washington’s call for Russia to be ejected.
“The longer-term question of how we have some steering to cope multilaterally with these kinds of global issues is an open question,” said Sobel, the former U.S. Treasury official.

Investing.com -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said  Thursday that a 50 basis-point rate hike was on the table for the May meeting as the central bank aims to step up the pace of monetary policy tightening to curb elevated inflation.  
""I would say that 50 basis points will be on the table for the May meeting,"" Powell said in an IMF panel discussion Thursday. The Fed chairman also backed the idea of the central bank hiking aggressively at the start of the tightening cycle, or front loading more than one 50 basis-point hike at future meetings.    
Pointing to the minutes of the Fed's March meeting, Powell said that ""many on the committee thought it would be appropriate for there to be one or more 50 basis point hike.""
Traders expect the Fed to hike rates by 50 basis points at each of the next three meetings in an attempt to curb demand, and overall inflation, which is well above the central bank's 2% target.  
Last week’s data showed that U.S. inflation rose at the fastest rate since 1981. It increased 8.5% over the 12 months to March.
In the wake of more a hawkish Fed, many are worried that the U.S. central bank could overshoot on monetary policy, slowing the economy by too much into a recession. The Fed chief stressed, however, that central bank isn't on a one-way monetary policy tightening mission and it seeks to deliver a soft landing.     
""Our goal is to use our tools to get demand and supply back in sync so that inflation moves down and does so without a slowdown that amounts to a recession,"" Powell said, though admitted that it was going to be ""very challenging."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States will give Ukraine another $500 million in to help its government continue critical government operations, doubling the $500 million aid pledge by President Joe Biden in March, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday.
Yellen told a news conference that she shared the aid plans during a meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal on Thursday.
""The needs of Ukraine are urgent, and we plan to deploy this direct aid to Ukraine as soon as possible,"" Yellen said. ""We know this is only the beginning of what Ukraine will need to rebuild, and I'm committed to working with Congress and our international allies and partners to build on this support in the medium and long term."" 
The new aid will help Ukraine pay government salaries, pensions and fund social programs necessary to avoid a worsening of the humanitarian crisis caused by Russia's invasion of its southwestern neighbor.
Yellen said the $1 billion in direct aid will require the Biden administration to make a supplemental budget request to Congress and she was committed to asking lawmakers for further help for Ukraine.
""We've got to find ways to meet Ukraine's needs,"" she said.
Shmyhal, who is in Washington to attend the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings, is also due to meet with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Later, he is due to address an event hosted by the World Bank about Ukraine's financing needs.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Wednesday said that Ukrainian government estimates that the country needs $5 billion in aid per month to keep its economy operating seem accurate, and the immediate priority was filling that gap for over the next three months. 
The World Bank last week estimated that half of Ukraine's businesses are closed, the rest are operating at well below capacity and its GDP this year will collapse by 45% as Russia's invasion rages. 

The Treasury official's statement came after G7 finance ministers on Wednesday announced that they had provided and pledged additional support to Ukraine exceeding $24 billion for 2022 and beyond, and vowed to do more as needed.
International aid for Ukraine between 2014, when Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine, and 2021 exceeded $60 billion, the Treasury official said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia's refusal to agree to strong language condemning its war in Ukraine prevented the steering committee of the International Monetary Fund from issuing a formal communique on Thursday, the panel's chair said.
""Unfortunately due to one member country breaking away we didn't have the unanimity so as to have the communique,"" Spanish Finance Minister Nadia Calvino, who heads the committee this year, said at a press conference. 
Ahead of Calvino's remarks, two sources had told Reuters that Russia's objections were preventing a full consensus being reached on a formal communique that would have included a strong condemnation of the war that began with its invasion of Ukraine in February. The IMFC issued a ""Chair's Statement"" in its place.
""The chair statement reflects an overwhelming majority view on all the elements...in these dark times, where multilateralism...is more important than ever,"" Calvino said.
The 24-member International Monetary and Financial Committee meets twice a year at the spring and fall meetings of the IMF and World Bank, and advises the IMF Board of Governors. While it has no formal decision-making powers, the IMFC's regular communiques provide strategic direction for the fund's work.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its massive impact on the global economy have dominated this year's spring meetings of the bank and fund, and high-level meetings held on the sidelines.
The meetings have ""not been business as usual,"" Calvino said, repeating what has become a stock turn of phrase to describe the semi-annual gathering of global finance leaders that has featured walkouts by major western economy officials from sessions attended by Russian officials. U.S., British and Canadian officials again left Thursday's meeting as the Russian delegate spoke.
The IMF on Tuesday slashed its forecast for global economic growth by nearly a full percentage point, noting that Russia's war in Ukraine had fueled inflation, making it a ""clear and present danger"" for many countries.
Over five million Ukrainians have fled abroad since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945. 
The United States accuses Russia of committing war crimes in what Moscow calls a ""special military operation."" Russia denies the allegations.
The G20 also failed to issue a communique, although Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, who chaired the meeting of G20 finance officials, said many members spoke to condemn Moscow's war in Ukraine.
The G20 and the IMFC include Russia, Western countries that have accused Moscow of war crimes in Ukraine, and China, India, and other countries that have not joined Western-led sanctions against Russia over the conflict. 

Adding to the drama unfolding in Washington, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner tested positive for COVID-19 late on Wednesday after participating in a series of bilateral meetings and the G20 and G7 finance gatherings earlier in the day.
Lindner announced the news on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and said he had only mild symptoms thanks to having received three vaccinations. He will isolate in the United States instead of returning to Berlin as planned on Thursday, sources said.

41,2022-04-22,"Russia said on Thursday it plans to have a ""digital"" rouble capable of making international payments ready by next year and also wants to expand the number of countries that accept its Visa- and Mastercard-style banking cards that are administrated by the central bank.
With Western sanctions cutting off Russia from large parts of the global financial system, Moscow is looking for alternative ways to make key payments both at home and abroad.
The country's central bank governor, Elvira Nabiullina, said the bank plans for real-world ""digital"" rouble transactions to be possible next year, and that the digital currency could be used in some international settlements.
""The digital rouble is among the priority projects,"" Nabiullina told Russia's lower House of Parliament. ""We have fairly quickly created a prototype ... now we are holding tests with banks and next year we will gradually have pilot transactions.""
Russia, like many other countries around the world, has been developing digital money over the last couple of years to modernise its financial system, speed up payments and head off the threat of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin gaining influence.
Some central bank experts have also suggested the new technologies mean countries would be able to deal more directly with each other, making them less dependent on Western-dominated payment channels such as the SWIFT system.
The Bahamas was the first to launch a national digital currency back in 2020, while China is the most advanced among major economies having carried out a mass trial of a digital yuan at the Beijing Winter Olympics this year.
Nabiullina also said Russia aims to extend the number of countries that accept the central bank's MIR banking cards, an alternative to  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and MasterCard Inc which have joined other Western firms and suspended operations in Russia.
MIR and China's UnionPay are among the few options left for Russians to make payments abroad since Russian banks were isolated from the global financial system in response to what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
Efforts by the West to close possible routes for circumventing sanctions continued on Thursday.

The world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, said it was deactivating the accounts of Russian nationals and companies based there that hold the equivalent of more than 10,000 euros ($10,900).
Those affected would still be able to withdraw their money but they will now be banned from making new deposits or trading, a move Binance said was in line with European Union sanctions.

42,2022-04-22,"(Reuters) -Russia's central bank will consider cutting its key interest rate further at upcoming board meetings, Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Thursday, flagging economic challenges the country faces as it tries to blunt the impact of Western sanctions over Ukraine. 
Nabiullina also said Russia is looking at adjustments to its foreign exchange controls to avoid situations where the rouble exchange rate deviates on a shadow market from official levels.
As she begins her new five-year stint in charge of monetary policy, Nabiullina will have to deal with a full-scale economic crisis, tackling uncertainty stemming from Western sanctions.
The central bank's emergency rate hike to 20% in late February helped stabilise the rouble and overcome a spike in inflation, Nabiullina said. The bank then cut the interest rate to 17% on April 8. Its next board meeting is on April 29.
""We will consider the possibility of its further reduction at upcoming meetings,"" Nabiullina said, speaking in the lower house of parliament, the Duma. She did not say if a cut was likely at next week's meeting.
Andrei Kostin, head of Russia's second-largest lender VTB, which is targeted by Western sanctions, said on Thursday he expected the central bank to cut the key rate to 15% this month and to 12-13% by the end of the year, TASS news agency reported.
Inflation in Russia now stands at 17.6% and is on track to accelerate to 22% this year, while the economy is set to shrink by 9.2% in 2022, according to a poll of economists conducted by the central bank in April.
Nabiullina warned that Russia, which saw its strongest economic growth in 13 years in 2021, at 4.7%, will now undergo structural changes as its access to the global financial system and trade is limited by tough Western sanctions.
""Problems may arise even when there is a production with a high degree of localisation, when there has already been a fairly high import substitution,"" Nabiullina said.
For example, she said, Russia produces its own paper but uses foreign bleaching agents, or urgently needs foreign-made packing materials for food stuff produced in Russia.
""It all takes time,"" she said.
The country is facing capital flight while grappling with a possible debt default after the West imposed sanctions on banks, businesses and individuals following what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

Nabiullina also said Russia aims to extend the number of countries that accept Russia's Mir banking cards, an alternative to VISA and MasterCard which have joined other Western firms and suspended their operations in Russia.
Mir and China's UnionPay are among the few options left for Russians to make payments abroad since Russian banks were isolated from the global financial system as part of the sanctions.

43,2022-04-22,,,,,,"(Reuters) -The Chicago Federal Reserve Bank's board of directors has begun a search for a new bank president to succeed Charles Evans, who reaches the mandatory retirement age next January, and on Thursday announced he'd be leaving his post early next year. 
The bank has hired recruiting firm Diversified Search Group to assist on the nationwide effort, it said in a statement.
Whoever gets the job will help set interest rates for the world's biggest economy as it faces the fastest inflation in 40 years -- made worse by the biggest military conflict in Europe since World War Two and a pandemic that has killed millions and continues to disrupt global supply chains as well as daily life in much of the world. 
It is also a time of unprecedented change among the ranks of U.S. monetary policymakers themselves, a group of 19 when all vacancies are filled. The Fed has historically been dominated by white men. With as many as seven new policymakers coming on by early next year, that will change.
The U.S. Senate is expected to confirm two new members of the Fed's Board of Governors in coming weeks, both Black economists joining what is now an all-white leadership. University of Michigan provost Susan Collins will take the top job at the Boston Fed this summer, making her the first Black woman to lead a regional Fed bank. 
The Dallas Fed, which like the Boston Fed lost its chief last fall amid a trading and ethics scandal, is in the middle of its own search for a new president. And Kansas City Fed chief Esther George will, like Evans, reach the regional banks' mandatory retirement age of 65 at the start of next year, and that bank will also need to seek a new leader. 
Evans, who started at the Chicago Fed in 1991, is the longest-serving current Fed policymaker and has been an influential voice at the U.S. central bank since he took his current job in 2007. 

He was a key architect of Fed communications in the wake of the financial crisis and the Great Recession as the bank sought to anchor market expectations for the path of interest rates, and helped develop the Fed's ""dot plot"" of policymaker rate forecasts. 
Regional Fed bank presidents are picked by the non-bank directors of those banks, with input and approval by the Fed's Board of Directors.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Makers of chocolate bars and coffee to lawn mowers and industrial robots succeeded in passing on soaring costs to consumers, first-quarter earnings showed on Thursday, allaying fears higher prices could dent demand for their products.
Some of Europe's biggest companies reported first quarter sales increases, with KitKat maker Nestle, Evian water owner Danone and Dulux paint maker Akzo Nobel (OTC:AKZOY) saying they were able to accomplish the gains while raising their prices.
Engineering company ABB and gardening equipment maker Husqvarna also reported strong demand despite both increasing prices.
""Pricing power does exist. Across multiple categories. In European food, it is called Nestle,"" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne.
Outside Europe, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged past Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, as higher prices helped insulate the electric vehicle maker from supply chain chaos and rising costs. [nL3N2WI3AV]
The big U.S. airlines United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc reported that high fares have not dented demand for domestic travel. Both airlines forecast a return to profitability. 
""The demand environment is very strong,"" American Airlines Chief Executive Robert Isom said in a statement.
But while cheering investors, with Nestle, ABB and Akzo Nobel enjoying share price gains, the strategy is stirring worries about households' ability to cope and the outlook for the rest of the year.
Rising interest rates and lagging pay deals are squeezing consumers, who are seeing their disposable incomes shrink and shopping bills rise.
There have been some signs in U.S. retail data that consumers have begun cutting back on discretionary spending amid high inflation and companies that thrived during the pandemic have lost some of their edge.
On Tuesday, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) blamed inflation, the war in Ukraine and fierce competition on a loss of subscribers for the first time in more than a decade.
And while Nescafe owner Nestle was among the winners on Thursday, reporting a 7.6% rise in organic sales during the first three months of the year, its CEO later warned that inflation has made its profit margin target more challenging.
Nestle beat a 5.0% average forecast for the sales measure that strips out currency swings and M&A deals in a company-compiled consensus thanks to price increases of 5.2%.
""We stepped up pricing in a responsible manner and saw sustained consumer demand,"" the Swiss company, whose products include Purina pet food and Nespresso, said. 
MORE HIKES LIKELY
Still the world's biggest food group said the current price rises were unlikely to be the last.
""Cost inflation continues to increase sharply, which will require further pricing and mitigating actions over the course of the year,"" Nestle added.
French peer Danone, whose product line up includes Activia yoghurt and Evian water, said it was also ready for further rounds of price increases ""if needed"" after reporting a 7.1% sales increase late on Wednesday.
The world's biggest yoghurt maker benefited from price increases at the start of the year as well as easier comparisons and stronger demand for baby formula in China.
Higher prices could be a sensitive topic in its French home market where the cost of living crisis sets the tone for the presidential runoff between incumbent Emmanuel Macron and his right-wing challenger Marine Le Pen.
Price rises have also not hurt demand for Dutch paint and coatings maker Akzo Nobel, which beat quarterly core earnings estimates on Thursday while reporting a 17% increase in prices compared with a year earlier.
CEO Thierry Vanlancker said that the group's ""vigorous pricing initiatives"" had helped it manage ""the unprecedented variable cost inflation that impacted our industry during the quarter"".
Beyond the consumer area, factory robots and industrial drive maker ABB also reported a 21% jump in orders during its first quarter despite increasing prices.
CEO Bjorn Rosengren said there were was no end in sight to price increases for components and metals, as well as rising transport costs.
This meant ABB would have to continue to lift prices to deal with it, he said, although there was no sign of customers holding back from equipping their factories with new products. 
""They are still placing orders, I guess they are accepting it,"" Rosengren told reporters. ""We are not the only one lifting prices, everyone is doing that in the market. That is the new reality.""

Also on Thursday, Husqvarna, the world's biggest maker of gardening power equipment, said it was raising prices further this month in response to rising supply and energy costs and said it had no indication retailers were holding back. 
""They accept the price increases,"" Henric Andersson, CEO of the Swedish group told Reuters after the earnings report.

45,2022-04-22,,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans plans to retire early next year, the bank said Thursday.
“It has been an honor to serve as a president of the Chicago Fed and as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee for the last 14 years,” Evans, who has served as the regional Fed bank’s president since 2007, said in a statement.
The Chicago Fed has formed a committee to find a replacement, the bank said. The committee “is conducting a nationwide search to identify a broad, diverse and highly qualified pool of candidates” and has retained Diversified Search Group, an executive search firm, to assist with the search.
Evans had previously said he’d be stepping down when he reached the age of 65 in January 2023, in line with Fed guidelines for regional bank presidents.

47,2022-04-22,,,"(Reuters) -A Moscow court on Thursday ruled that it was lawful for Russia's anti-monopoly regulator to open an antitrust case against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) over an App Store payment dispute, dismissing a case brought by the U.S. company, the RIA news agency reported.
Russia began the antitrust case against Apple in October, accusing it of failing to allow app developers to tell customers about alternative payment options when using its App Store. It said Apple could face a fine based on its revenue in Russia if found guilty.
Apple and Russia's Federal Anti-monopoly Service (FAS) did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
RIA said the Moscow Arbitration Court had dismissed Apple's case in its entirety. It said the decision can be appealed. 

Separately, law firm Chernyshov, Lukoyanov & Partners on Wednesday said it was preparing a lawsuit against Apple for what it said was a violation of Russian consumers' rights after the company restricted the use of Apple Pay on March 1 in response to Russia sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The same law firm is behind a similar lawsuit against streaming company Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which in March suspended its service in Russia and said it was temporarily stopping all future projects and acquisitions in the country.

49,2022-04-22,,,,,,"(Reuters) -San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly on Thursday said she supports raising the U.S. central bank's target for overnight borrowing costs to 2.5% by the end of this year, but whether or how much further it will need to rise will depend on what happens with inflation and labor markets.
Daly's support for a path of policy tightening that would bring borrowing costs to the Fed's estimate of the neutral level in nine months has helped cement expectations in recent weeks for interest rate hikes in bigger-than-usual 50 basis-point increments at the Fed's next couple of policy meetings. 
""Is it 50, is it 25, is it 75? Those are things that I'll deliberate with my colleagues, but my own starting point is we don't want to go so quickly or so abruptly that we surprise Americans"" already dealing with 40-year-high inflation, Daly told Yahoo Finance. 

""I'm watching over this year to see how much our move to neutral restrains the economy, along with the repair of supply chains and the fiscal rolloff,"" all of which should contribute to easing inflation, she said.
Whether rates will then need to rise beyond neutral where they would begin to actually restrict economic growth, Daly said, ""is an open question and one I don't want to get prematurely to before we see the data.""

Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose parents were from Puerto Rico, was the sole dissenter. Sotomayor pointed out that as the island does not have voting representation in Congress, its people cannot rely on Congress to recognize their rights.
""Equal treatment of citizens should not be left to the vagaries of the political process,"" Sotomayor wrote.
A provision extending SSI benefits to Puerto Rico is part of Democratic-backed social spending legislation that has stalled in Congress. 
'A DEVASTATING DAY'
Jose Luis Vaello Madero, the disabled 67-year-old man at the center of the case, received SSI benefits when he lived in New York but lost eligibility when he moved to Puerto Rico in 2013. The U.S. government sued him in federal court in Washington in 2017 seeking more than $28,000 for SSI payments he received after moving to Puerto Rico.
""It is unfortunate the court failed to see the discrimination faced by the most needy Puerto Rican Americans whose only distinguishing feature is that they choose to remain in Puerto Rico, their home on U.S. soil. This is a devastating day for Mr. Vaello Madero and for Puerto Rico,"" said Hermann Ferre, Vaello Madero's lawyer. 
The Justice Department declined comment.
Many Puerto Ricans have long complained that the island's residents are treated worse than other Americans despite being U.S. citizens. Puerto Rico, which is not a state, is the most-populous of the U.S. territories, with about 3 million people.
SSI benefits are available to American citizens living in all 50 states, Washington, D.C. and the Northern Mariana Islands, but not the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam.
The Supreme Court has been instrumental in defining the legal status of Puerto Ricans dating to a series of rulings starting more than a century ago called the Insular Cases, some suffused with racist language. Those rulings endorsed the notion that the people of newly acquired U.S. territories could receive different treatment than citizens living in U.S. states. 
Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch in a separate opinion said the court in a future case should overturn the Insular Cases, saying they ""rest on racial stereotypes"" and ""deserve no place in our law.""

Congress decided not to include Puerto Rico when it enacted the SSI program. Puerto Ricans are eligible for a different benefits program, called Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled, that allows for more local control but not as much federal funding. 
The government's appeal originally was filed by former President Donald Trump's administration. Biden's administration continued the appeal while also urging Congress to extend SSI to Puerto Rico.

“The rebuilding costs, ultimately, in Ukraine are going to be enormous,” Yellen said at a press conference in Washington Thursday. “And certainly looking to Russia -- one way or another -- to help provide some of what’s necessary for Ukraine to build is something I think we ought to be pursuing.”
Yellen said she was “unclear” whether, for the U.S., using sequestered Russian assets for Ukraine would require congressional legislation authorizing such use.
“That is a very significant step, and it’s one we would carefully need to think through the consequences of before undertaking it. I wouldn’t want to do so lightly,” Yellen said. American allies and partners would “need to feel comfortable with and be supportive of” such a move, she added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on dozens of people and entities, including a Russian commercial bank and a virtual currency mining company, hoping to target Moscow's evasion of existing sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The U.S. Treasury Department said it designated a virtual currency mining company for the first time, alongside more than 40 people, and entities led by U.S.-designated Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev.
“Treasury can and will target those who evade, attempt to evade, or aid the evasion of U.S. sanctions against Russia, as they are helping support Putin’s brutal war of choice,” Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Brian Nelson, said in a statement. 
The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The United States and its allies have imposed several rounds of sanctions https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/SANCTIONS/byvrjenzmve on Moscow since its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, including targeting the country's largest lenders and Russian President Vladimir Putin himself. 
Wednesday's move targets Russia's virtual currency mining industry, reportedly the third largest in the world, sanctioning the holding company of Moscow-based bitcoin miner BitRiver, which operates a data center in Siberia, and 10 of the holding company's Russia-based subsidiaries. 
In a statement, Igor Runets, the founder and chief executive of BitRiver, said his company has ""never provided services to Russian government institutions and has not worked with customers already targeted by Washington's sanctions.""
""These U.S. actions should obviously be viewed as interference in the crypto mining industry, unfair competition and an attempt to change the global balance of power in favor of American companies,"" Runets said. 
The Treasury also put sanctions on Russian commercial bank Transkapitalbank, whose representatives it said serve several banks in Asia, including in China, and the Middle East, and have suggested options to evade international sanctions.
Its subsidiary, Investtradebank, was also designated.
Wednesday's action freezes any U.S. assets of those designated and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.
But Washington issued two general licenses related to Transkapitalbank alongside the sanctions, authorizing the wind down of dealings with the bank until May 20 and certain transactions destined for or originating from Afghanistan until Oct. 20 ""in support of efforts to address the humanitarian crisis.""
The United States also imposed additional sanctions on Russian oligarch Malofeyev, whom U.S. authorities have long accused of being one of the main sources of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea. He was first designated under the Obama administration in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Justice Department charged Malofeyev with violating sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.
""The United States will work to ensure that the sanctions we have imposed, in close coordination with our international partners, degrade the Kremlin’s ability to project power and fund its invasion,"" Nelson said.
The U.S. State Department is also imposing visa restrictions on over 600 people in a bid to promote accountability for human rights abuses and violations, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement, barring them from traveling to the United States.

Three Russian officials were also hit with visa restrictions over ""gross violations of human rights"" alongside 17 others hit with restrictions over accusations of undermining democracy in Belarus.
""We will use every tool to promote accountability for human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine,"" Blinken said.

54,2022-04-22,,,,,,"The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell moderately last week, still suggesting that April was another month of strong job growth.
The report from the Labor Department on Thursday also showed unemployment rolls shrinking to the lowest level in 52 years in the first week of April, reinforcing the tightening labor market conditions. An acute shortage of workers is keeping layoffs low, helping to fuel inflation, and forcing the Federal Reserve to adopt a restrictive monetary policy stance.
The U.S. central bank faces a tricky balancing act of slowing demand without plunging the economy into recession. So far, households continue to spend and businesses are hungry for workers to meet consumer demand. 
But trouble could be brewing, with other data on Thursday showing a measure of future business activity in the mid-Atlantic region tumbling in April to a level last seen 14 years ago, when the economy was in the throes of the Great Recession.
""Economic growth may eventually hit a wall without more workers for companies to hire, but not today,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Jobless claims at near-record lows mean worker wages will continue to go up and up, guaranteeing that inflation remains more persistent and at more worrisome levels for longer than Fed officials believe."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 184,000 for the week ended April 16. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 180,000 applications for the latest week. Claims plunged to a more than 53-year low of 166,000 during the week ending March 19. 
There is probably limited scope for further declines.
Last week, applications tumbled by 7,656 in Missouri. There were also substantial declines in Ohio, Texas, New York and Michigan, which offset increases in Connecticut and California. 
The Fed in March raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first rate hike in more than three years. Economists expect a half-percentage-point rate increase next month, and for the U.S. central bank to soon start trimming its asset holdings.
Claims, which have dropped from a record high of 6.137 million in early April 2020, will be closely watched for signs of whether rising borrowing costs are curbing demand. 
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
WORKER SHORTAGE
Demand for labor is holding strong for now. The Fed's Beige Book, based on information collected on or before April 11 from the central bank's business contacts, showed on Wednesday that ""demand for workers continued to be strong across most districts and industry sectors,"" but noted ""hiring was held back by the overall lack of available workers.""
There were a near record 11.3 million job openings at the end of February. The unemployment rate is at 3.6%, just one-tenth of a percentage point above its pre-pandemic level.
But there are signs labor supply will soon improve. The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 58,000 to 1.417 million during the week ending April 9. The was the lowest level for the so-called continuing claims since February 1970.
The demand-supply imbalance is stoking wage inflation. A second report from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday showed 80% of firms in the mid-Atlantic region reported wages and compensation costs had increased over the past three months.
A majority of firms in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, said they had adjusted their 2022 budgets for wages and compensation since the beginning of the year, with 65% reporting they were planning to increase wages and compensation by ""more than originally planned,"" and a third intending ""to increase wages and compensation sooner than originally planned."" 
The Philadelphia Fed's business activity index dropped to 17.6 this month from 27.4 in March. A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing sector. 
Manufacturers' assessment of business activity over the next six months was downbeat, with the index dropping 15 points to 8.2, the lowest reading since December 2008. 
Still, firms hired more workers, with the survey's gauge of factory employment reaching an all-time high. Companies planned to retain their workforces over the next six months.
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of April's employment report. Claims rose marginally between the March and April payrolls survey periods. 

Economists are expecting strong employment growth in April. Payrolls increased by 431,000 jobs in March, marking the 11th straight month of employment gains in excess of 400,000.

55,2022-04-22,"The war in Ukraine has shown the limitations of the decades-long German approach of seeking to change Russia through trade and spells the end of globalisation as we know it, the European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said on Thursday.
Speaking at the Peterson Institute in Washington, Gentiloni said the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 would also reshape global alliances and put further strain on global supply chains, already fragile after two years of the pandemic.
""The notion of 'Wandel durch Handel', of bringing about change through trade, has shown its limitations,"" Gentiloni said, referring to Germany's policy towards Eastern European states started in the early 1970s. ""We need to rethink our relations with autocratic regimes and strengthen our ties with like-minded partners,"" he said.
For decades Germany has pursued close economic ties with Moscow, making itself heavily dependent on Russian gas, oil and coal in a policy that now makes it difficult for Europe to stop buying Russian energy and therefore stop indirectly financing the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
""This crisis will also spell the end of globalisation as we have known it and reshape global alliances,"" Gentiloni said.
""The war and its consequences – including the successive rounds of sanctions that the EU and the US have imposed on Russia – are exacerbating pressures on already strained global supply chains,"" he said.
Gentiloni said the invasion also forced the 27-nation European Union to sharply boost spending on defence, on top of the already large planned investment on fighting climate change and adapting the economy to the digital age.
This expenditure might need to be reflected in EU fiscal rules that are now under review, he said, and possibly in some new joint borrowing, possibly modelled on the EU's post-pandemic recovery fund of 800 billion euros of joint debt.
""We are talking about mobilising hundreds of billions of additional investments each year. While most of these investments will need to come from the private sector, financing them will require a more supportive framework of fiscal rules and potentially new tools at the European level,"" he said.

Germany and several other northern European countries are strongly opposed to such new joint borrowing. 
Gentiloni said the cost of the Ukraine war for Europe would depend on how long it lasts, but that economic and material support to Ukraine, assistance to refugees, as well as continued support to the EU economy to deal with high energy prices and disruptions in production will boost the aggregated EU budget deficit by at least 0.6% of GDP this year.

56,2022-04-22,"Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina will have to deal with a full-scale economic crisis, tackling unprecedented uncertainty stemming from Western sanctions, as she begins her new five-year stint in charge of monetary policy.
A majority of lawmakers in the Russian lower house of parliament voted on Thursday in favour of Nabiullina's reappointment as central bank chief, supporting the choice made by President Vladimir Putin.
Nabiullina will now have to steer the commodity-dependent economy through its steepest contraction since the years following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, fighting inflation that accelerated this month to a 20-year high of 17.62%.
Nabiullina told lawmakers on Thursday that her priority task was to secure the availability of financial resources for an imminent structural transformation of the economy.
""Our task is to ensure that our economy is competitive. In my view, we don't need to pursue the policy of self-isolation in all directions,"" the 58-year-old central bank veteran told the lower house of parliament, the Duma.
""Combating inflation is also the most important task, that no one has abandoned."" 
The central bank will consider cutting the key interest rate from 17% at upcoming board meetings, Nabiullina said, repeating her intention to return inflation to its 4% target by 2024 and flagging the economic challenges Russia will face.
""Nabiullina is facing another challenging term, no doubt,"" said Tatiana Orlova, lead emerging market economist at Oxford Economics.
There are several challenges the central bank will have to deal with, including when and how to lift capital controls, as well as the possible need to recapitalise some Russian banks.
""So in short, the CBR Governor has her work cut out for her. I wouldn't want to be in her shoes right now,"" Orlova said.
Nabiullina, an economist and former Kremlin adviser who became the first woman to chair the Bank of Russia, has strong support from Putin who has repeatedly praised her in the role since appointing her in 2013.
Widely respected as one of the world's top central bankers, partly for her efforts to rein in inflation, Nabiullina was targeted by sanctions in April as part of sweeping Western penalties against Russia for what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24.
Sanctions have also frozen nearly half of Russia's $640 billion in gold and FX reserves controlled by the central bank, spurred capital flight from Russia and pushed it towards a possible debt default, while denting the country's access to the global trade and financial systems.
""Hence the CBR will have a task of rebuilding the country’s FX buffer, in the meantime facing the challenge of investing it into assets that would be well-protected from seizure by the U.S. and its allies,"" Orlova said.

Adopting to new economic realities where well-established trading links with other countries are damaged will also be on the central bank's radar.
""We need to move forward... Sanctions have now disrupted normal payments for goods and services, many companies have encountered that. And the priority is international settlements for companies and citizens,"" Nabiullina said.

HANOI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Vietnam is preparing new rules requiring social media firms to take down content it deems illegal within 24 hours, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The planned amendments to current law will cement Vietnam, a $1 billion market for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), as one of the world's most stringent regimes for social media firms and will strengthen the ruling Communist Party's hand as it cracks down on ""anti-state"" activity.
The 24-hour time frame to take down ""illegal content and services"" will not have a grace period, while active ""illegal livestreams"" must be blocked within three hours, the people said. Companies that do not meet the deadlines could see their platforms banned in the country, they added.
Social media companies have also been told content that harms national security must be taken down immediately, according to two of the people and a third source. 
Currently, social media platforms often have a few days to handle requests from the Vietnamese government, the sources said.
The amendments, which have not been made public, are expected to be signed by Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh next month and enforced from July, five people said.
Sources who spoke with Reuters for this article declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Vietnam's foreign ministry said amendments to law concerning online information are being reviewed by the government.
""Vietnam demands that businesses actively coordinate with the government in building a safe and healthy online environment, removing contents that are inappropriate or against legal regulations and national traditions of Vietnam,"" it said in an emailed statement.
Representatives for Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, which owns YouTube and Google, declined to comment.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) said it had no immediate comment. 
TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will continue to comply with applicable local laws to ensure TikTok remains a safe space for creative expression, its Vietnam representative Nguyen Lam Thanh told Reuters, adding it would take down content that breaks platform guidelines.
Most governments do not have laws imposing the taking down of content on social media firms, but Vietnam's move comes amid intensifying crackdowns in some parts of the world on online content that have alarmed activists.
Indonesia's government is also preparing to impose a similar 24-hour time frame for government requests, sources have told Reuters.
India requires government requests to be met within 36 hours.
A MAJOR MARKET
Vietnam, with a population of 98 million, is among Facebook's top 10 markets by user numbers with 60-70 million people on the platform, according to 2021 company data. 
The country generates around $1 billion in annual revenue for Facebook and is more profitable than many European markets, according to sources familiar with the matter.
YouTube has 60 million users in Vietnam and TikTok has 20 million, according to 2021 government estimates. Twitter is not as popular as most Vietnamese see it as an English forum.
But the market poses ethical quandaries. Vietnam's Communist Party tolerates little criticism and the country's courts have handed out lengthy jail terms to dissidents and activists for posts critical of the government on Facebook and YouTube. 
Government efforts to exert control over online content have only intensified. A cybersecurity law introduced in 2019 was followed up by national guidelines on social media behaviour in June last year. 
In 2020, Facebook agreed to significantly increase the censorship of ""anti-state"" posts for local users after Vietnamese authorities slowed traffic to its platform and threatened to shut it down entirely, company sources have previously told Reuters.
Facebook said at the time it had reluctantly complied with the government's request to ""restrict access to content which it has deemed to be illegal"".
HARD TO IMPLEMENT
The planned changes stem from the government's dissatisfaction with current take-down rates for its requests, the sources said.
According to data from Vietnam's communications ministry, during the first quarter of 2022, Facebook complied with 90% of the government's take-down requests, Alphabet complied with 93% and TikTok complied with 73%.
The sources said in addition to removing ""illegal"" content, the government wants social media firms to change algorithms to limit content concerning sexually suggestive material, gambling and the sale of unregulated medicines and supplements.
The government is also keen to take down accounts of celebrities it believes are using their influence to sell unsuitable products, defame others and promote false charitable causes, they said.

Social media firms will have difficulty complying with take-down requests in 24 hours, the sources added.
They noted that while obvious infractions of their own company rules like depictions of extreme violence can be handled very quickly, other requests take longer to assess and finding qualified staff is a challenge.

58,2022-04-22,"LONDON (Reuters) -Britain ramped up trade sanctions on Russia, targeting luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds through import bans and higher tariffs, seeking to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.
Latest sanctions will include import bans on silver, wood products and high-end goods from Russia including caviar, Britain's department for international trade said. 
They added that tariffs will increase by 35 percentage points on some products from Russia and Belarus, including diamonds and rubber. 

In an initial wave of trade sanctions on March 15 Britain announced import bans on some luxury goods and additional tariffs on a range of Russian products, including vodka, metals, fertilisers and other commodities.
The restrictions on trade come in addition to 26 new sanctions announced by the government targeting Russian military generals responsible for what it called atrocities in Ukraine.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Carlsberg, the Western brewer most exposed to the Russian market, expects its decision to sell its business there to result in a writedown of about 9.5 billion Danish crowns ($1.39 billion), it said on Thursday.
The company, which has eight breweries and 8,400 employees in Russia, said late last month that it would sell its business in the country, joining an exodus of Western companies since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The writedown did not take into account any external offers for the business and was subject to a ""very high degree of volatility and uncertainty"", Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) said, adding that the sale could take up to 12 months. 
In addition, Carlsberg reported a currency loss adjustment to its Russian business worth 4 billion crowns triggered by a recent depreciation of the Russian rouble. 
Dutch rival Heineken (OTC:HEINY) has also said it will exit Russia and last month said it expected to book related charges of about 400 million euros ($437 million).
Carlsberg had non-current assets in Russia worth 19.2 billion Danish crowns by the end of 2021, its annual report said. 
""The writedown isn't quite as grim as one might have feared,"" Sydbank analyst Per Fogh told Reuters. 
""This is what they consider to be fair value of the asset now, but the question still remains what a potential buyer would pay for it.""
Carlsberg last year generated 10% of its revenue and 6% of its operating profit in Russia, where it took full control of the Baltika group of breweries in 2008. 
Since then, however, it has faced sluggish sales in a sanctions-hit economy while facing Russian regulations aimed at curbing alcohol abuse.
Carlsberg lowered its operating profit growth forecast for this year to between minus 5% and plus 2%, compared with previous guidance of 0% and 7%.
Shares in Carlsberg, which have shed nearly a quarter of their value since the start of the year, fell slightly on the news but were up 1% by 1026 GMT. 

The brewer said it also expected 300 million crowns of Ukraine impairment charges along with goodwill writedowns of 700 million crowns for the Central and Eastern Europe region, which includes Ukraine.

60,2022-04-22,,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -The European Central Bank should end its stimulus programme in July and could raise interest rates that same month, in September or later, ECB vice-president Luis de Guindos said in an interview published on Thursday.
The ECB said last week that it would stop buying bonds in the third quarter of the year and raise interest rates some time after that, ending years of monetary largesse in the face of surprisingly high inflation.
De Guindos was joining a growing number of ECB policymakers, including the Bundesbank's President Joachim Nagel, in calling for an early end to the Asset Purchase Programme.
""My opinion is that the programme should end in July and for the first rate hike we will have to see our projections, the different scenarios and, only then, decide,"" de Guindos told Bloomberg.
""From today’s perspective, (raising rates in) July is possible, and September or later is also possible,"" he added.
Speaking to global policymakers in Washington on Thursday, ECB President Christine Lagarde also said future steps ""will depend on the incoming data and (the ECB's) evolving assessment of the outlook"".
""In the current conditions of high uncertainty, we will maintain optionality, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy,"" she told the International Monetary and Financial Committee.
But Belgian central bank governor Pierre Wunsch, a policy hawk, was more outspoken, saying in a Bloomberg interview that raising the ECB's policy rate, currently at minus 0.5%, to zero or slightly above by year-end would be a ""no brainer"". 
The ECB will update its macro-economic projections in June and again in September.
These estimates will be crucial because the ECB has said it would only raise rates when it is confident that inflation would stay at its 2% target over its forecast horizon.
Inflation in the euro zone hit a record 7.5% last month and de Guindos hinted at it staying above the ECB's current projections for the rest of the year. 
""Inflation will start to decline in the second half of the year,"" he said. ""But even so, it will be above 4% in the final quarter.""

The ECB said in March it saw inflation at 5.6% in the second quarter, 5.2% in the third quarter and 4.0% in the final three months.
Further out, it saw inflation at 2.1% in 2023 and 1.9% in 2024.

Investing.com -- The euro surges as officials put a July rate hike back on the agenda. Jerome Powell and Christine Lagarde both speak on the sidelines of the IMF meeting later. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) beats earnings expectations, but raises a few eyebrows in the process. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) forecasts good times ahead, but Equifax (NYSE:EFX) is downbeat about the outlook for the mortgage credit market. Russia declares 'victory' over a city where Ukrainian forces are still fighting, a day after it defaulted on a dollar bond payment due to the lack of cooperation from its U.S. bankers. AT&T (NYSE:T) results, jobless claims and the Philly Fed business survey are due. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 21st April.
1. Tesla’s earnings blow past expectations, raise eyebrows
Tesla reported another stronger-than-expected quarter in the three months through March, with a net profit of $3.32 billion. That included a $679 million contribution from regulatory emissions credits, but an operating profit of $3.6 billion indicated solid underlying momentum in its core business.
CEO Elon Musk said the group should be able to produce over 1.5 million cars this year, despite challenges from a three-week shutdown at Shanghai that only ended earlier this week.
Some cast doubt on the group’s accounting, suggesting that Tesla either wasn’t recognizing steep input price inflation or faced a big jump in costs in coming quarters. The company reported a 15% increase in operating expenditure, but an 80% rise in revenue. The disparity may lie partially in the company using up raw material inventories that were bought before prices for inputs such as battery metals went through the roof earlier this year.
Tesla stock rose over 7% in premarket trading, more than reversing Wednesday’s declines.
2. ECB officials put July rate hike in play
The euro rose to its highest in over a week after Vice President Luis de Guindos joined a chorus of European Central Bank officials acknowledging the possibility of a rate increase in July. That would be the bank’s first in 12 years, and represents a significant shift after President Christine Lagarde soft-pedaled the outlook for tightening policy at her press conference last week.
Lagarde and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell both speak on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meeting later, an event that has gathered the world’s central bankers at a time when inflation is running amok globally.
By 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), the euro was at $1.0915, up 0.6% on the day and just off its intraday high.
3. Stocks set to open higher; United soars, Equifax slumps
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher later, with Tesla’s well-received earnings helping to calm the fears stoked by Netflix’s results on Tuesday. 
By 6:20 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 208 points, or 0.6%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.1%. The Nasdaq had underperformed sharply on Wednesday, due to the heavy weighting of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which suffered its biggest one-day drop in 18 years. Netflix stock fell another 1.2% in premarket trading.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include United Airlines, which reported upbeat guidance after the bell on Wednesday despite showing another big quarterly loss, and Equifax, which fell nearly 10% in after-hours trading after forecasting a sharp slowdown in mortgage credit inquiries over the rest of the year.
AT&T dominates the early reporters, along with Danaher (NYSE:DHR), NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP), while Swiss giant Nestle (OTC:NSRGY) already reported a thumping 7.6% rise in first-quarter sales, over 5% of which was due to price increases.
4. Jobless claims, Philly Fed survey due
The number of people making initial claims for jobless benefits is expected to stay close to 60-year lows at 8:30 AM ET, a reflection of the continuing tightness of the U.S. labor market. Analysts expect initial claims to tick back down to 180,000 after last week’s increase to 185,000. Continuing claims are expected to grind lower to 1.455 million, a drop of 20,000.
The numbers will be released at the same time as the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s monthly manufacturing survey, which is expected to show a slight cooling of activity from February.
Of more interest than either may be the auction of inflation-protected 5-year Treasury notes at 1 PM ET. The last auction sold at an average yield of -1.508%. That’s unlikely to be repeated given the sharp rise in real bond yields in recent weeks.
5. Russia declares 'victory' in Mariupol
Russian President Vladimir Putin declared victory in the country’s battle for the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, even though elements of the defending forces continue to fight on. Putin told Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu in a choreographed video clip that Russian forces should rather conserve lives than storm the remaining Ukrainian positions in the Azovstal steel mill.
Putin’s comments come a week after the loss of the Black Sea Fleet’s flagship Moskva. Moscow’s failure to account for a crew that it says was fully evacuated prior to the sinking has revived long-standing suspicions of the state’s disregard for its servicemen.
Russia was declared in potential default on Wednesday by an international committee overseeing credit derivatives. However, the failure to pay occurred because the western banks acting as payment agents refused to handle Russia’s dollars, rather than because Russia had chosen not to pay. Separately, Bloomberg reported that Russia's oil output fell to its lowest this year last week amid increasing practical problems in getting its product to willing buyers."

63,2022-04-22,,,,,,"With even the most dovish U.S. central bankers now calling for a key interest rate to hit its ""neutral"" level by year's end to tame high inflation, the Federal Reserve appears headed for perhaps its swiftest shift in monetary policy since the 1960s, with all the risks that ride along with such an abrupt change.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday is expected to further cement the case for an aggressive set of moves through year end, first in remarks to an inflation conference and later in an International Monetary Fund discussion.
Since their meeting in March, policymakers have grown uniformly more hawkish, led by Powell's insistence on a do-whatever-it-takes approach to contain inflation. Now joining him are policymakers like San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans who had been among the most persistent in arguing inflation could ease with less action by the Fed. 
""I see an expeditious march to neutral by the end of the year as a prudent path,"" Daly said on Wednesday, referring to the interest rate level that officials see as neither fanning nor restricting the economy, a key but often difficult-to-estimate touchstone for policymaking.
That remark placed her, like Evans, in support of raising the federal funds rate by half a percentage point at coming meetings rather than just a quarter point, a step that until recently was the province of more hard-core Fed inflation fighters.
If officials follow through, they will have moved the federal funds rate from near zero to neutral in nine months after a first hike in March. Other tightening cycles have involved larger absolute increases in rates but came when estimates of neutral were higher, so policy remained ""accommodative"" for longer.
In the cycle starting in mid-2004, for example, it took about two years to reach what a New York Fed model estimates the neutral rate was then, around 5.25%. It took a year, beginning in late 1993, to reach neutral during a cycle often cited as a possible parallel to this one by bringing inflation down without a recession.
A 'VOLCKER MOMENT'
Officials hope that some of the current inflation fades on its own, letting them bring it back towards their 2% target without highly restrictive rates that would increase the risk of recession.
Given the complexities of the moment, from the Ukraine war to the pandemic's continued impacts on global supply chains, achieving that is tough"

India abstained in a UN vote condemning Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, causing concern among major western countries. 
But Johnson's office had said before his visit that he would not lecture Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the matter. Moscow has called the war a ""special operation."" 
""India and Russia have, historically, a very different relationship, perhaps than Russia and the UK have had over the last couple of decades. We have to reflect that reality but clearly I'll be talking about it to Narendra Modi,"" Johnson said.

Visits to retail and recreation locations increased by 8% to 91% of their pre-coronavirus levels in the week to April 15, which included the Good Friday bank holiday, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday.
Seated diner reservations were 138% of 2019 levels, the highest relative level since early September 2021, the ONS said.
The Bank of England and private economists are keeping a close eye on how consumers respond to the sharp rise in inflation that is squeezing household incomes and threatens to slow the economy after its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The ONS said interbank CHAPS payments data was broadly unchanged from the previous week at 105% of its February 2020 average level in the week to April 14.
But work-related spending, which includes the purchasing of road fuel, increased by 8 percentage points, reflecting how the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed global oil prices higher.
In late March, 29% of functioning businesses reported that their production or suppliers or both had been affected by recent increases in energy prices, up from 25% in early March.
Accommodation and food service firms reported the highest percentage at 56%, the ONS said.
Average gas prices fell by 22% in the week to April 17 and were 41% off their recent peak on March 10. But they were 234% higher compared with the same period last year.

The BoE is also keeping a close eye on the labour market as it worries about the risk that a shortage of candidates for jobs pushes up pay and creates a longer-term inflation problem.
Total online job adverts increased by 4% in the week to April 14 April to 144% of their February 2020 average level, the ONS said, using data from jobs website Adzuna.

The Shanghai government did not respond to questions regarding the death toll.
State media reported on Thursday that the Shanghai government was investigating three funeral home officials for refusing to provide funeral services using COVID as an excuse.
Shanghai ordered virtually all residents to stay home at the start of April after COVID-19 cases began to surge. Residents have faced income losses, difficulty getting food, family separations and poor conditions in quarantine.
With public resentment rising, city officials said on Thursday they would look into complaints made by residents over the quality and expiry dates of products such as duck meat and cooking oil provided in government ration packs. 

Businesses are beginning to reopen, though they have to operate under ""closed loop management"", which entails living on site, daily testing and rigorous disinfection.
U.S. electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is among 666 companies allowed to resume operations, and its reopening was given generous airtime on state media this week. Industry bodies caution, however, that factories face logistical nightmares and are far from resuming full production.

69,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Euro zone inflation in March was marginally lower than earlier reported, the EU's statistics office said on Thursday, but still at record highs because of a surge in the cost of energy.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 2.4% month-on-month in March for a 7.4% year-on-year increase.
An earlier estimate by Eurostat put March inflation at 2.5% in the month and 7.5% from a year earlier.
Eurostat said that out of the year-on-year total, 4.36 percentage points was due to surging energy prices while 1.12 points came from more expensive services and 1.07 points from food, alcohol and tobacco.
The European Central Bank wants to keep inflation at 2.0% over the medium term and has signalled it would be tightening policy by ending its bond purchasing scheme later this year and moving towards a rate rise afterwards.

Energy prices were 44.4% higher than a year earlier in March, Eurostat said, while unprocessed food cost 7.8% more.
But even when these two most volatile components were excluded from inflation measurements, annual inflation was 3.2% in March -- well above the ECB's target.

71,2022-04-22,,,,,,"BOAO, China (Reuters) -A prolonged slowdown in China would have substantial global spillovers, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday, but added that Beijing has room to adjust policy to provide support. 
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its growth forecast for China this year to 4.4%, well below Beijing's target of around 5.5%, on the risks of widespread COVID-19 lockdowns and supply chain disruptions.
In a video speech to the annual Boao Forum for Asia, Georgieva said China's actions to counter its economic slowdown are vital for the global recovery. 
""Fortunately, China has policy space to provide macroeconomic policy support, including shifting the focus toward vulnerable households to strengthen consumption, which can also help support China's climate goals by steering economic activity to lower-carbon sectors,"" Georgieva added. 
""Stronger policy efforts in the property sector can also help secure a balanced recovery.""
At the same venue, China's President Xi Jinping said China's economy is resilient and that its long-term trend had not changed.
In light of growing headwinds, foreign brokerages have also been slashing GDP forecasts for China, after weakness in March activity data raised outlook risks as the lockdown in the mega city of Shanghai drags on.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) on Tuesday cut their already below-consensus forecast to 4.3%, from 4.5% previously, while BofA downgraded their forecast for this year to 4.2%, from 4.8% before. 
Nomura on Thursday revised their forecast to 3.9% this year, from 4.3% previously, and second-quarter growth is expected to expand by a meagre 1.8%, according to their baseline estimates. 
BOOSTING CONSUMPTION
""What we see in China is that consumption is falling short, it is not recovering as strongly as necessary,"" Georgieva told a news conference at the IMF and World Bank spring meetings on Wednesday. ""So rather than moving money into public investments, move it into the pockets of people, so there is more dynamism coming from a consumption boom."" 

China's commerce ministry said on Thursday it would roll out targeted measures to boost a recovery in consumption. Spending has been hit hard by lockdowns across the country that began last month to contain the spread of COVID-19.
Final consumption accounted for 69.4% of China's GDP growth in the first quarter, according to official data.

72,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Japan's government upgraded its view of the economy for the first time in four months in April as authorities turned more optimistic about the outlook for private consumption following the end of COVID-19 curbs, the monthly economic report showed on Thursday.
However, private sector analysts have said the outlook is still clouded by challenges including a relentless surge in raw material and energy prices, which could further delay the recovery of the world's third-largest economy from the pandemic.
""The economy appears to be picking up as the severe situation due to COVID-19 is easing,"" the government said in its April report, removing a reference to ""some weaknesses in recovery"" in the March issue.
The overall upgrade was due mostly to a brighter assessment of private consumption, which also marked the first upgrade since December, as policymakers welcomed the lifting of months-long coronavirus curbs on face-to-face services by March 21.
""Credit card spending data showed a pick-up in service consumption such as restaurants, travel and hotels towards late March,"" a government official told a media briefing before Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's cabinet approved the report.
However, rising energy and food prices have dampened consumer sentiment, even as Japan enters an annual holiday week in early May.
""The chance of a 'revenge spending' burst is becoming smaller than we had expected earlier,"" as lingering uncertainties around the Ukraine crisis and COVID-19 keep households cautious about spending, said the official.
The yen's recent weakening to 20-year-lows has increased the inflationary pain for consumers and domestic-focused firms by swelling import costs.
In the risk assessment section of the April report, the government listed ""financial and capital market volatilities"" among other downside risks to the economy, such as rising raw material prices and supply constraints, repeating the previous month's description.

The note was meant to include currency moves, the official said, although he added the government has not confirmed any data yet on the impact of the latest yen weakening on economic fundamentals.

73,2022-04-22,"The global travel and tourism sectors are projected to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023 and grow at a rate that will outpace global gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) said on Thursday.
The industry is expected to post an annual average growth rate of 5.8% from 2022 to 2032 versus the 2.7% increase in global GDP, and create 126 million new jobs, WTTC said in a report released during the industry group's conference in Manila.
In 2019, tourism accounted for a tenth of global GDP and jobs but the coronavirus pandemic decimated the $9.6 trillion industry, halving its output value and leaving 62 million people jobless.
""The recovery is going to be so stellar that it's going to recover really powerfully. This does depend of course on China reopening,"" said WTTC President Julia Simpson, calling on all governments to reopen borders.
China's ""zero COVID"" policy and persistent lockdowns have disrupted global trade and domestic and international travel.
The travel and tourism industry's GDP is seen hitting $8.35 trillion this year and $9.6 trillion in 2023, a return to its pre-pandemic level.
Tourism jobs are projected to recover to 300 million this year and 324 million in 2023, close to the 333 million seen in 2019, WTTC said.

In Asia-Pacific alone, the hospitality industry's GDP will likely hit $3.4 trillion in 2023, already above the $3.3 trillion it saw in 2019, it said.
Compared with North America and Europe, travel has trailed in Asia-Pacific because of strict border restrictions in many countries. In Southeast Asia, travellers are now getting back on planes as the region's entry and COVID-19 quarantine rules are lifted. But a full recovery will be slow, industry members say.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The yen's recent declines have been driven by fundamentals and would be no reason for Japan to change its economic policy, including the central bank's ultra-low interest rates, a senior International Monetary Fund (IMF) official said.
The remarks highlight the difficulty Tokyo may face if it sought international consent to intervene in the currency market to stem further yen falls, as G7 and G20 countries agree such action is justified only if exchange rates move out of line with fundamentals.
""What we're seeing so far on the yen is driven by fundamentals,"" Sanjaya Panth, deputy director of the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department, told Reuters late on Wednesday.
""Economic policymaking should continue to look at fundamentals. We don't see any reason to change economic policy because what's happening right now reflects fundamentals.""
The yen has plunged to two-decade lows against the dollar, with the Bank of Japan (BOJ) continuing to defend its ultra-low rate policy in contrast with heightening chances of aggressive rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
""We do not see disorderly market conditions right now in the foreign exchange market. It's been driven by fundamentals,"" Panth said, when asked whether yen-buying currency intervention by Japanese authorities would be justified.
Markets are rife with speculation Japan may act to resist further yen declines, perhaps by buying yen, raising interest rates or tweaking the BOJ's dovish guidance on the future path of monetary policy.
""As you know, a weak yen hasn't been bad for Japan,"" Panth said. ""At the same time, it does affect households. It's a little bit of a mixed bag,"" he said in the interview.
With inflationary pressure still muted, there was no need for the BOJ to change its ultra-loose policy, Panth said.

While temporary factors, such as the dissipating effect of past cuts in cellphone fees, could push up headline consumer price inflation, Japan was unlikely to see inflation sustainably reach the BOJ's 2% target in the near term, he added.
""Japan is in a very different situation compared with other advanced countries who have begun tightening monetary policy,"" he said. ""We do not see any need to change the accommodative monetary policy stance.""

75,2022-04-22,"Top officials from Britain, the United States and Canada walked out on Russia's representatives at a Group of 20 meeting on Wednesday and many members spoke to condemn Moscow's war in Ukraine, exposing deep divisions in the bloc of major economies.
Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, who chaired the meeting of G20 finance officials in Washington, acknowledged the body faced unprecedented challenges but called for cooperation to overcome headwinds slowing global growth.
""This is an extraordinary situation,"" Indrawati told reporters after the daylong meeting. ""It's not business as usual, a very dynamic and challenging one.""
The G20 includes Western countries that have accused Moscow of war crimes in Ukraine, as well as China, India, Indonesia and South Africa which have not joined Western-led sanctions against Russia over the conflict. 
Indrawati said many countries spoke out against the war at the meeting, although she did not identify them.
""In order for us to be able to recover together ... we need more and even stronger cooperation,"" Indrawati told a briefing. ""The G20 is still ... the premier forum for all of us to be able to discuss and talk about all the issues.""
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told attendees she strongly disapproved of a senior Russian official's presence at the meeting before she walked out, two sources told Reuters.
She was joined by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.
Ukrainian officials, in Washington seeking billions of dollars of additional funding, also walked out of the meeting, a source familiar with the meeting said.
Russian Deputy Finance Minister Timur Maksimov represented Moscow in person, while Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Russia's central bank governor joined virtually, a second source said.
Over five million Ukrainians have fled abroad since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945. 
The United States accuses Russia of committing war crimes in what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"". Russia denies the allegations.
NO 'BUSINESS AS USUAL'
One source added that Yellen told participants there could be ""no business-as-usual"" for Russia in the global economy, a view echoed by Indrawati, whose government is heading the G20 group this year.
British Finance Minister Rishi Sunak said in a tweet: ""We are united in our condemnation of Russia's war against Ukraine and will push for stronger international coordination to punish Russia.""
Russia's finance ministry did not mention the walkout in a statement issued after the meeting. It cited Siluanov as calling on the G20 not to politicize dialogue between members and stressing the grouping had always focused on the economy.
He also complained about the damaging effect of Western sanctions, the statement said.
""Another aspect of the current crisis is the undermining of confidence in the existing international monetary and financial system,"" it said. ""The safety of international reserves and the possibility of free trade and financial transactions are no longer guaranteed.""
Lagarde urged Maksimov to convey to Moscow a clear message",,,,,
76,2022-04-22,,,,,,"The cost of a comprehensive car insurance policy in Britain touched an 18-month high in the first quarter and will continue to increase on the back of rising inflation and regulatory changes, a survey showed on Thursday.
UK motorists now have to pay about 550 pounds ($718.08) for a comprehensive car insurance premium, according to the latest index from price comparison site Confused.com in association with insurance broker Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WTW).
Car insurance premiums had fallen for a year till the autumn of 2021 as lockdowns kept motorists off the roads and competition in the UK car insurance industry intensified.
""As people return to more normal patterns of work and life, we are seeing those reductions in premiums gradually unwind,"" said Tim Rourke, UK Head of P&C Pricing, Product, Claims and Underwriting at WTW.
Rourke also expects premiums to continue rising through 2022 as Britain battles high inflation and insurers face new rules by the Financial Conduct Authority that ensure consumers renewing policies are not charged more than new customers.
Britain's annual inflation rate climbed to 7% in March, its highest since 1992.
""Prices could continue to increase simply because insurers are likely to be facing more claims than last year, as people start to drive more frequently, and this just means insurers will have to be as competitive as possible,"" said Louise O'Shea, CEO at Confused.com.
""And in turn consumers will need to continue to shop around, as the assumption that renewal prices won't increase clearly isn't true.""

Eighteen-year-old drivers continue to pay the most of any demographic, taking their average premiums to 1,419 pounds, the survey showed.

77,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Brazil's central bank said on Wednesday it would resume data release that were suspended due to a strike by its employees, including a weekly survey seen as critical for the monetary policy conduction. 
The central bank's weekly FOCUS survey compiles data from over 100 private economists for macroeconomic indicators, including inflation and interest rates. 
It was last released on March 28 and will be returned to normal next Tuesday, said the central bank. 
Central bank workers suspended the release of the survey and several other indicators in protest over wage demands. The strike, however, was paused on Tuesday, after the government signaled some disposition to grant salary adjustments.
In charge of an aggressive monetary tightening to curb double-digit inflation, the Brazilian central bank has repeatedly said it will consider the convergence of market expectations to the official inflation targets in its policy dosage.

Monitoring this data was seen as crucial at a time when consumer prices continue to surprise upwards, casting doubt on how far the tightening cycle would go. Rates stand at 11.75% from a 2% record low in March 2021, and policymakers had said one last hike of 100 basis points could wrap the process in May. 
The central bank said that it continued to have internal access to such information despite its interruption to the general public.

78,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Mexican inflation likely slowed very slightly during the first half of April, but remained well above the central bank's target, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday, reinforcing bets the monetary authority will continue raising interest rates.
The median forecast of 10 analysts surveyed was for inflation to reach 7.60%, marginally down from 7.62% in the second half of March.
Core inflation, which strips out some volatile food and energy items, was seen climbing to 7.06%, its highest level since January 2001.
The Bank of Mexico, which targets inflation of 3%, with a one percentage point tolerance range above and below that, has increased the benchmark rate by 250 basis points in its last seven monetary policy meetings to 6.50%.
Its next decision is scheduled for May 12. 
Analysts have forecast the lending rate could end the year at 8%, according to the central bank's latest monthly poll.

Compared to the previous two weeks, Mexican consumer prices are predicted to have risen by 0.07%, with core prices seen advancing 0.34%, the poll showed.
Mexico's national statistics agency will publish consumer price index data for the first 15 days of April on Friday.

79,2022-04-22,,,,,,"The U.S. dollar rose from a one-week low on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell all but confirmed a half a percentage-point tightening at the policy meeting next month, including consecutive rate increases this year.
The dollar index, which gauges the strength of the currency versus a basket of rivals, gained 0.2% to 100.53, after trading lower for most of the session. The index has advanced 2.3% so far this month, on pace for its best monthly gain since June 2021.
Powell said a half-point interest rate increase will be ""on the table"" when the Fed meets on May 3-4 to approve the next in what is expected to be a series of rate increases this year.
Fed funds futures have started to price in bets of three straight 50 basis-point hikes starting with next month's policy meeting, with an implied rate of about 2.71% in December. 
""Rising fears over an increasingly aggressive Fed policy posture weighed heavily on Treasuries, especially at the short end, and the pop in rates knocked Wall Street lower,"" Action Economics said in its blog after Powell's comments. ""However, the dollar was the beneficiary."" 
The euro slid from a more than one-week high after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the ECB may need to cut its growth outlook further as the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine weighs on households and businesses.
Lagarde's comments were in contrast to hawkish comments from ECB officials who seemed to suggest European Central Bank officials raised bets that euro zone interest rates will rise soon. 
Joachim Nagel, president of Germany's Bundesbank, joined a chorus of policymakers in saying the ECB could raise interest rates at the start of the third quarter.. 
Money markets, which had eased rate hike bets following last Thursday's ECB meeting, were now pricing in a more than 20 basis-point (bps) rise by July and over nearly 80 bps of tightening by year-end.
That would take benchmark interest rates above zero for the first time since 2013.
European political news was also supportive, with French President Emmanuel Macron clearing a major hurdle ahead of Sunday's runoff election with a combative performance in a TV debate against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
With the deciding vote just four days away, some 59% of viewers found Macron to have been the most convincing in the debate, according to a snap poll for BFM TV, suggesting Macron's 10 percentage point lead in the polls was not under threat.
In late trading, the euro fell 0.2% to $1.0832, after hitting $1.0936, its highest level since April 11. 
The dollar rose 0.3% against the yen to 128.30. 
Against the Swiss franc, the dollar rose 0.5% to 0.9532 francs.

80,2022-04-22,,,,,,"The U.S. dollar edged lower in early European trade Thursday as the world’s key finance ministers meet, but remains elevated amid expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve monetary tightening.
At 3:15 AM ET (0715 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.3% lower at 100.165, retreating from the more than two-year peak of 101.03 seen earlier in the week.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have pulled back from the highest level since December 2018 at close to 3%, helping the dollar to hand back some recent gains.
However, the buck remains particularly strong against the Japanese yen, with USD/JPY up 0.1% to 128.05, off the two-decade high of 129.43 seen earlier in the week after the Bank of Japan once more stepped in to the bond market to defend its record low yield target.
Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Thursday he had explained the yen's ""somewhat rapid"" declines to his Group of Seven counterparts and is due to meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen later this week. 
In a statement issued after their meeting, the leaders said they were closely monitoring global financial markets that have been ""volatile,"" creating a degree of nervousness about whether the G7 might move to combat the rapid moves.
“We had felt that FX intervention would not be seen until the 130 level and even now it is hard to describe market conditions as disorderly enough to justify intervention,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later Thursday at the IMF-World Bank spring meetings in Washington. 
His comments will be carefully studied with the Fed’s meeting in early May at the forefront of minds, amid expectations that the central bank will hike more aggressively than the quarter percentage point move it announced at its March meeting.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD rose 0.4% to 1.0890, as Vice President Luis de Guindos joined a growing chorus of European Central Bank officials acknowledging the possibility of an interest rate hike as early as July with inflation running at record levels in the European Union.
That said, the pair remains marginally above the 20-month low of 1.0757 with the war in Ukraine weighing along with the uncertainty surrounding the French political presidential election.
There could be further weakness ahead as the euro is being used less often as a global payment currency, posting its biggest percentage-point drop in more than a decade in March, according to data from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, or SWIFT. 
AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7436, while USD/CNY rose 0.5% to 6.4501, climbing to its highest level since October 2021 amid concerns about a COVID-induced growth slowdown at the world’s second largest economy.

Investing.com -- The euro rose in early trading in Europe on Thursday as Vice President Luis De Guindos joined a growing chorus of European Central Bank officials acknowledging the possibility of an interest rate hike as early as July.
De Guindos' comments follow similar ones from Deutsche Bundesbank head Joachim Nagel, and his Belgian and Latvian counterparts Pierre Wunsch and Martins Kazaks within the last 24 hours. All four are attending the International Monetary Fund's spring meeting.
They represent a coordinated change in messaging from the bank after President Christine Lagarde had played down the chances of an early rate hike at her press conference only last week. While it's common for the German central bank to take a more hawkish line than the bank's official one, the comments have a greater weight coming from Lagarde's deputy.
By 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the euro was up 0.4% at $1.0894, its highest in a week. It had hit a 20-month low of $1.0757 after Lagarde's press conference on Thursday.
Newswires quoted De Guindos as saying that there was ""no reason"" why the bank can't end its net asset purchases in July, which would pave the way for an interest rate hike almost immediately after. However, he stressed that any raising of rates would be ""data-dependent,"" given that the risks to the economic outlook have increased considerably with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier in the week, the IMF had downgraded its growth forecast for the Eurozone this year to 2.8% from an earlier estimate of 3.9%. Inflation, meanwhile, is running at an all-time high for the single currency at 7.5%, although De Guindos said he expects it to moderate by the year-end.
Overnight, Belgian National Bank Governor Wunsch had told Bloomberg in an interview that a sequence of rate hikes this year was likely.
""Without any really bad news coming from that front, hiking by the end of this year to zero or slightly positive territory for me would be a no brainer,” Wunsch said.
On Wednesday, meanwhile, Bundesbank head Nagel had said “It seems we’ll be able to end net purchases, possibly already at the end of the second quarter,” paving the way for a first rate increase “at the beginning of the third quarter."""

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan explained to its G7 counterparts the yen's recent ""somewhat rapid"" declines, finance minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Thursday, underscoring Tokyo's growing alarm over the currency's sharp fall to a two-decade low against the dollar.
Suzuki did not comment on how the G7 finance leaders responded, saying only that the meeting in Washington, D.C., focused on discussions over the global economy and Russia's invasion of Ukraine rather than exchange-rate moves.
In a statement issued after their meeting, the leaders said they were closely monitoring global financial markets that have been ""volatile,"" but made no direct mention of exchange rates.
Suzuki said the G7 likely stuck to its agreement that markets ought to determine currency rates, that the group will closely coordinate on currency moves, and that excessive and disorderly exchange-rate moves would hurt growth.
""I believe the G7's basic thinking on exchange rates remains intact,"" Suzuki told reporters after the meeting with finance leaders of the Group of Seven advanced economies, held on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) gatherings.
Markets are focusing on Suzuki's meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen expected later this week.
The yen slightly extended losses from earlier in the day, falling to 128.63 yen per dollar just after the remarks, but was still off a 20-year low of 129.40 hit on Wednesday.
The currency has plunged against the dollar, with the Bank of Japan (BOJ) continuing to defend its ultra-low rate policy in contrast with heightening chances of aggressive rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Investors believe the yen has even further to fall, with most betting that even a government intervention wouldn't be enough to turn around the momentum.
Highlighting the difficulty Tokyo may face if it sought global consent to intervene, a senior IMF official told Reuters the yen's recent declines have been driven by fundamentals with no sign of disorderly exchange-rate moves.
""The finance ministry will find it hard to intervene and probably continue jawboning markets,"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) DS Asset Management.
""The BOJ isn't in charge of currency policy, so will focus on achieving its price goal by maintaining a loose monetary policy.""

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who also attended the G7 meeting, said excessive exchange-rate volatility could affect business activity.
""The BOJ will carefully watch how currency moves could affect Japan's economy and prices,"" he said.

84,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Bearish bets on most Asian currencies firmed, a Reuters poll found on Thursday, as several regional central banks trail the U.S. Federal Reserve in tightening their monetary policies to fight red-hot inflation.
Analysts turned short on the Chinese yuan for the first time since early-October due to worries of an economic slowdown in the country caused by COVID-19 lockdowns, the fortnightly poll of 14 respondents showed.
""A combination of a lack of policy support and zero-COVID stance has weakened China's growth prospects and weighed on yuan sentiments,"" analysts at Maybank wrote in a note.
Southeast Asian central banks have sought to balance lifting interest rates off historic lows — to tackle price pressures exacerbated by the Ukraine war — and supporting economic growth as the region emerges from a coronavirus-driven downturn.
Market participants raised short positions on the Malaysian ringgit to their highest since late-August, while the position was the largest since early-December in case of the Thai baht.
Thailand's central bank said last week it will focus monetary policy efforts on shoring up sluggish growth in Southeast Asia'a second-largest economy, as it continued to see inflationary pressures as transitory.
Bearish bets were also raised on the Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee and the Philippine peso. 
The dim view on emerging market currencies comes against the backdrop of a steady rise in the U.S. dollar amid expectations of more rate hikes from the Fed. The currency hit a two-year peak against a basket of currencies this week.
""Asian currencies have generally faced pressure this month as U.S. yields have moved higher, helping propel the USD, and capital outflows from the region have accelerated,"" Mitul Kotecha, senior EM strategist at TD Securities said.  
""It's hard to see any turnaround in Asian currencies unless U.S. yields take a decisive turn lower and in turn the USD reverses course more broadly.""
Bets on the Indonesian rupiah inched closer to a bearish territory after the country's central bank cut its 2022 economic growth outlook amid risks from inflation and geopolitical tensions.
Meanwhile, short positions on South Korea's won rose and long positions in the Singapore dollar were cut despite central banks in both countries recently tightening their monetary policy.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A decorated U.S. Air Force veteran who helped lead a fundraising campaign to build former President Donald Trump's promised wall along the U.S.-Mexican border pleaded guilty on Thursday to conspiring to defraud donors.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Brian Kolfage told prospective donors he would ""not take a penny"" as he raised more than $25 million for the ""We Build the Wall"" campaign, yet took more than $350,000 and spent money on a boat, a luxury SUV, a golf cart, jewelry and cosmetic surgery.
Kolfage, who also pleaded guilty to three tax charges, created the private campaign in December 2018, 14 years after losing his legs and right hand in a rocket attack in Iraq.
The Miramar Beach, Florida, resident had led the fundraising push alongside former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who was also charged in August 2020.
Bannon's case was dismissed after Trump granted him a presidential pardon during the final hours of his presidency.
At a remote hearing on Thursday, Kolfage said he told potential donors that their money would be used exclusively to build a wall, but instead kept a large sum for himself and concealed it from authorities to avoid paying taxes.
""I knew what I was doing was wrong and a crime,"" Kolfage told U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres.
A co-defendant, Andrew Badolato, also pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy on Thursday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden pledged $800 million in more weaponry for Ukraine on Thursday and said he would ask Congress for more money to help bolster support for the Ukrainian military as it faces a fresh onslaught by Russia on its eastern flank. 
Addressing Americans from the White House's Roosevelt Room, Biden pledged to send heavy artillery, dozens of howitzers, and 144,000 rounds of ammunition, as well as tactical drones, as he called on Congress for supplemental funding to provide additional aid for Kyiv.
Biden also announced $500 million in direct economic assistance to the Ukrainian government as it battles to save the lives of people under siege by Russian forces.
""We’re in a critical window now of time where they’re going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,” Biden said, referring to Russia's tactical shift to the east. The United States and allies are “moving as fast as possible” to provide Ukraine with the equipment and weapons it needs.
Biden said the new assistance will expend most of the remaining funds available for this purpose and that he will make a supplemental funding request to Congress next week. He said the amount is being discussed.
""That’s being decided now. I’m asking the Defense Department to put together a proposal,"" he said.
The U.S. House of Representatives will consider the additional aid for Ukraine as soon as next week, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters. There is strong support among Democrats and Republicans for assisting Ukraine. 
The Pentagon said that the new package would include 75 155mm long-range howitzers, 72 tactical vehicles to tow them, and more than 100 Phoenix Ghost drones.
Biden spoke after face-to-face talks with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who is in Washington for a variety of meetings.
The president announced plans to ban Russian-affiliated ships from docking at U.S. ports, as previously reported by Reuters, further ratcheting up pressure on Moscow. A senior administration official said the move was aimed at further isolating Russia. 
Biden also said his administration will allow Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion of their home country to come to the United States temporarily if they have American sponsors, a move that could affect thousands of refugees.
The new arms package is the same size as an $800 million one announced last week 
Biden said the new weapons are needed as Ukraine battles a major offensive from Russia in the east, where the flatter terrain requires a different set of weaponry.
On Wednesday, he convened U.S. military leaders in an annual White House gathering that took on special significance as the war enters a risky new phase. 
Russia has said it has entered a new stage of its operation and is methodically seeking to ""liberate"" the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Western allies anticipate Russia's campaign could last many months, grind to a stalemate and test the battlefield capabilities of Ukrainian fighters.
Biden disputed Russian claims of control of the embattled city of Mariupol, saying that ""there's no evidence that Mariupol has completely fallen."" He added that Russia ""should allow humanitarian corridors to let people at that steel mill and other places (that) are buried under rubble to get out.""
Russia says it launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24 to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext. 
U.S. forces are not fighting in Ukraine but are indirectly engaged, arming, training and financing its forces.

The U.S. aid announced last week included artillery systems, artillery rounds, armored personnel carriers and unmanned coastal defense boats, broadening the scope of materiel sent to Kyiv to include new types of heavy equipment.
Adding this week's package brings total U.S. military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded to well over $3 billion.

Chile, the world's top copper producer, earlier this month sued BHP, among other miners, over alleged environmental damages caused by its operations in the Atacama salt flats.
The road blockades, threats of work stoppage over alleged worker contract breaches, and surging COVID-19 infections at Escondida affected production at the project, which houses the world's largest copper deposit.
""Our Chilean assets experienced a challenging operating environment in the March 2022 quarter due to a reduction in our operational workforce as a result of a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in Chile,"" the miner said in its third-quarter production report.
Copper production from Escondida is now expected between 1,000 thousand tonnes (kt) and 1,030 kt for 2022, down from its previous range of 1,020 kt to 1,080 kt, resulting in a slight downgrade to total copper output forecast to between 1,570 kt and 1,620 kt.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -MoneyGram International Inc was sued on Thursday by two regulators that said it repeatedly and unfairly violated a federal rule designed to make it easier for people to send money to friends and family outside the United States. 
The complaint against MoneyGram, one of the largest U.S. providers of remittance transfers, was filed in Manhattan federal court by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and New York Attorney General Letitia James.
Remittance transfers let people in the United States send money electronically to people in other countries, and exceed $100 billion annually.
MoneyGram was accused of having repeatedly ""stranded"" recipients waiting for their money, given senders inaccurate information about when transfers would be completed and failed to address customer complaints in accordance with the 2013 rule.
Problems persist despite a series of software and technology updates, with some transactions still getting ""stuck"" in MoneyGram's systems, the complaint said.
""MoneyGram spent years failing its customers and failing to follow the law, ignoring customer complaints and government warnings in the process,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. ""MoneyGram's long pattern of misconduct must be halted.""
In a statement, Dallas-based MoneyGram said it plans to defend against the ""frivolous"" lawsuit, and that its compliance program was effective and consumers suffered no harm.
""The CFPB and its director entered into discussions with closed minds and unfortunately chose to make increasingly unjustifiable and unprecedented demands,"" the company said. ""Ultimately, MoneyGram refused to be strong-armed into an unfair settlement.""
MoneyGram agreed in February to be acquired by private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners in a $1.8 billion transaction.
In afternoon trading, MoneyGram shares were down 49 cents, or 4.6%, at $10.16, after earlier falling to $9.76.
Thursday's lawsuit seeks unspecified refunds, restitution and civil damages. It is the CFPB's fifth remittance-related case since 2019.

""We will be looking to seek a broader set of remedies to halt repeated law-breaking and disregard for the rule of law,"" Chopra told reporters. ""I am committed to stamping out misconduct by firms that break the law over and over again.""
The case is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau et al v MoneyGram International Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-03256.

Melvin, which lost nearly $7 billion early last year by betting on stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) would tumble, is targeting a size of between $4.5 billion-$5 billion and told investors that its maximum total assets under management should remain between $6.5 billion and $7 billion until June 2027, when this threshold could be changed, the source said.
To remain within this limit, Melvin intends to return capital to investors every time it reaches $7 billion for more than 90 consecutive days, according to the source who did not want to be identified because the discussions are private. 
Gabe Plotkin, the founder of Melvin, had been betting since 2014 that GameStop shares would tumble as the world shifts away from the brick-and-mortar video retailer's offerings.
But retail investors banded together to support GameStop, sending it surging more than 2,500% in January 2021. By the end of the month, Plotkin had closed the short position on the so-called meme stock, but the hedge fund lost 39% last year.

Melvin intends to charge fees ranging from 15% to 25% under this new structure, down from its previous performance fee of 20% to 30%, the source said.

(Reuters) -Snap Inc on Thursday forecast a rosy outlook for user growth on its Snapchat app, but said supply-chain disruptions and inflation could continue to hurt advertising demand.
Shares of Snap (NYSE:SNAP) fell as much as 10% immediately after the results, but pared losses later on as investors digested the mixed results.
Snap forecast second-quarter daily active users at between 343 million and 345 million, above Wall Street estimates of 340 million.
However, the company warned that inflation, labor shortages and other economic challenges could pressure revenue. It forecast second-quarter revenue growth between 20% and 25% over the previous year. The growth rate so far in the current quarter has been 30%.
The Santa Monica, California-based company is the first of the major tech apps to report first-quarter earnings, and the results could cast a shadow over Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), which also earn revenue by selling digital advertising and will report results next week.
A large number of advertisers paused their ad campaigns in the days following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February, said Snap Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen, in prepared remarks released before an earnings call with analysts.
While the majority of advertisers resumed their campaigns, many remained concerned about inflation and continuing geopolitical risk, he said. 

Revenue for the first quarter ended March 31 was $1.06 billion, an increase of 38% from the prior-year quarter. The figure missed analyst expectations of $1.07 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Daily active users on Snapchat rose 18% year-over-year to 332 million, beating consensus estimates of 329.7 million users.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1%, or 368 points, the S&P 500 fell 1.5%, the Nasdaq slumped 2%.
""I would say that 50 basis points will be on the table for the May meeting,"" Powell said in an IMF panel discussion Thursday.
The Fed Chairman didn’t shy away from hinting that the central bank could hike aggressively at the start of the tightening cycle, by front-loading 50 basis-point rate hikes at future meetings.    
U.S. Treasury yields were quick to respond, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising close to 3%, pushing growth corners of the market including tech lower.

Investing.com – The latest word from the Federal Reserve sent stocks lower in late afternoon trading on Thursday, and now the central bank enters a quiet period before its next policy meeting.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a panel at the IMF spring meeting that a 50-basis-point rate hike was “on the table” at the meeting, which is scheduled for early May.
That wasn’t much of a surprise –the markets are expecting it to make more than one such move in the coming months. But Powell’s words sent technology stocks into a tailspin anyway.
More corporate earnings are due in the coming days. So far, big companies have been relatively positive on the outlook for the current quarter and the remainder of the year.
President Joe Biden is on the road again Friday as he tries to persuade the American people that spending on clean energy is a good choice for the future, hawking administration efforts to build out a network of electric vehicle chargers and bring broadband capabilities to underserved areas.

106,2022-04-22,"As Russia teeters on the brink of a historic default, foreign investors in the country's debt have few palatable options to recover their money: bet on costly legal action, trust bilateral agreements will stand, or sit on their hands. 
Foreign creditors would typically try to band together to negotiate, go to court or in some cases seek arbitration in cases of default, but Western sanctions in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and the peculiarities of Russian sovereign bonds make those options hard at the moment, lawyers said.
Some $40 billion of Russian sovereign debt issued in dollars and euros is outstanding, with about half of that held by foreigners. Under terms of most of that debt, Moscow must pay investors in the currency in which the bonds are denominated. 
Western sanctions cut off Moscow’s access to some $300 billion in gold and foreign currency reserves it held in banks abroad. That means Moscow must either use whatever hard currency it has at home to pay investors, or default on its obligations.
Russia says it has the money and is willing to pay but cannot do so because of the sanctions imposed in response to what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. It said it would use its own currency if it cannot pay in foreign currency until its reserves are unfrozen.
It has made a $649 million payment that was due on April 4 on two of its bonds in roubles rather than the dollars it was mandated to pay under the terms of the debt, a move a derivatives watchdog ruled a ""potential failure to pay"". 
Rating agencies have said Russia may be in default because the payment must be made in dollars or due to a perceived lack of willingness to repay, with S&P lowering its foreign currency ratings to ""selective default"".
Once a 30-day grace period to the April 4 bond payments passes in early May, investors would have three options, said Dennis Hranitzky, head of sovereign litigation at law firm Quinn Emanuel. 
They could wait and see what happens, take legal action against Russia in court, or seek arbitration under bilateral treaties that Russia has with dozens of countries, he said.
With the situation around sanctions changing as the war rages on, the first option is the most likely one, said Hranitzky and other lawyers who are in touch with bondholders.
""I don't think we know enough about how this is going to unfold, we don't know how long the war is going to last,"" said Hranitzky.
LEGAL ACTION
The situation with Russia is unprecedented. 
One lawyer said the closest historical parallels, where geopolitics are the main driving force in a potential default scenario, are when U.S. President Jimmy Carter cut off Iran's oil sales and froze its assets abroad in response to the 1979 hostage crisis at the American embassy in Tehran, and when Britain encouraged banks to declare Argentina in default in the wake of the 1982 Falklands/Malvinas war.
In both cases, the crisis eventually abated as did the political pressure, said veteran debt lawyer Lee Buchheit.
""It's been 40 years since we have seen anything quite like this,"" said Buchheit, who has worked on such sovereign debt restructurings as Greece and Argentina. ""This is not a financial problem; it is a pure political one."" 
Bondholders can try to take matters to court but this is often a costly and lengthy process aimed at either getting compensation or seizing assets. In the case of Russia, legal action will be even more fraught, the lawyers said.
For one, the contracts of the bonds in question do not define a jurisdiction in case of a dispute, which will make it more challenging for bondholders to decide on the venue they use to sue.
Lawyers also expect Moscow to mount a defense blaming sanctions for its inability to pay after Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia would take legal action if the West forces it to default. 
The bond contract is bound by English law, under which the argument of frustration of purpose could be made, meaning that Moscow could argue that it tried to pay but the West wouldn’t let it because of the sanctions.
""Russia is going to argue this,"" said Mitu Gulati, a law professor at the University of Virginia and expert on debt restructurings. However, he expected Moscow would have limited success. ""Yes, this is a war, but it is a war caused by Russia.""
Another option for investors would be to seek arbitration directly against Russia. An investor-state arbitration allows creditors from jurisdictions with bilateral investment treaties to bring claims and seek monetary damages and other relief directly against the state.
Russia has dozens of such treaties, including with most of the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

An arbitration award like that could be enforced in U.S. courts, said Hranitzky, whose firm also represents Ukraine's government in financial disputes with Russia.
""The nightmare scenario is that the situation in Ukraine is not resolved and sanctions remain in place for months, maybe longer,"" Buchheit said.

PARIS (Reuters) -Disruptions from COVID-19 lockdowns in China cast a cloud on forecast-beating first-quarter sales from Gucci owner  Kering  (EPA:PRTP) on Thursday, even as the group pointed to sustained demand from the United States and Western Europe for its high-end fashion and leather goods labels. 
Group sales for the three months ending in March came to 4.96 billion euros ($5.4 billion), up 21% and slightly above a consensus forecast of 4.69 billion euros cited by Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet.
Kering SA's star label Gucci, which accounts for over half of the French luxury group's annual sales, clocked 13.4% growth, with a strong performance in the United States, Western Europe and Japan, while COVID lockdowns disrupted business in mainland China. 
This figure fell below Chauvet's estimate for 23% growth and marked a deceleration from last quarter. 
""The quarter is ahead of expectations overall by 5.6%,"" said Luca Solca, analyst with Bernstein, noting that Gucci was ""one step behind"" consensus forecasts while flagging an ""impressive performance"" from smaller labels.
Yves Saint Laurent posted 37.2% growth, while sales at Bottega Veneta grew 16.3%. After a few years of expanding Saint Laurent's store network, the group is shifting investments to other areas like communication and marketing, as well as expanding its product range. 
“The fundamentals of the luxury market in China remain intact,” Kering Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Duplaix told journalists in a call, noting the resilience of Chinese consumers after crisis periods, the growing middle class and appetite in the country for luxury brands, echoing comments from other luxury groups including LVMH and Hermes, which both recently reported a strong start to the year.
The executive cautioned, however, that the lockdowns were tougher than the intermittent disruptions last summer, and noted an impact on consumer sentiment in the country.
Kering has been expanding Gucci's product range with an emphasis on the higher end and executives flagged good traction at higher price points.
Store closures in China, in March and April, however, adversely affected lower price points and slowed the label's ability to draw in new, younger clients, they said in a call with analysts. 
CFO Duplaix said it was a bit early to comment on expectations for earnings at Gucci, noting ""a lot of moving parts,"" citing the lockdowns in China, where currently nearly a third of the group's store network is in cities affected by restrictions, and the war in Ukraine. 

He also said it was too early to measure the impact of inflation on luxury demand and costs, noting there was room for price increases at some labels including Gucci, which raised some prices toward the end of the quarter in the low and mid-single-digit percentages.

109,2022-04-22,,,,,,"(Reuters) -Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said on Thursday he had no interest in making a bid for Southwest Gas (NYSE:SWX) Holdings Inc, days after the utility said it would evaluate a sale following interest from an unnamed potential buyer.
In an open letter to Southwest's shareholders, Icahn said his ""only interest is to replace the incumbent board of directors"". 
If his slate of director nominees were elected, they would continue pursuing strategic alternatives for Southwest, Icahn said, but he would not consider bidding for the utility.
The billionaire also questioned the acquisition interest from the anonymous potential buyer Southwest disclosed earlier this week, saying it was ""barely credible"".
""When we state that we began this process because we received an indication of interest well in excess of Mr. Icahn's $82.50 per share offer, it is a fact,"" Southwest said in a statement on Thursday.
The company also said it encourages Icahn to participate in the sale process.
In October, Icahn sought to gain control of the Southwest Gas board and replace its chief executive officer after the company adopted a shareholder rights plan to stop his push to make it abandon a $2 billion takeover of Questar Pipelines.

The billionaire later launched a tender offer for Southwest shares, seeking to buy stock from other shareholders of the company at $82.50 each. Southwest rejected Icahn's bid as ""inadequate"" in March.
No reference to Icahn's offer was made in Thursday's letter.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 stumbled Thursday as tech returned to the firing line after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell teed up the prospect of a 50 basis-point hike at May meeting.  
The S&P 500 fell 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.5%, or 165 points, the Nasdaq fell 0.2%.
""I would say that 50 basis points will be on the table for the May meeting,"" Powell said in an IMF panel discussion Thursday.
The Fed chairman didn’t shy away from hinting that the central bank could hike aggressively at the start of the tightening cycle, by front-loading 50 basis-point rate hikes at future meetings.    
U.S. Treasury yields were quick to respond, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising close to 3%, pushing growth corners of the market including tech lower.
Meta, formerly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) led the decline in big tech, falling 6%, while Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were also in the red.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which posted its biggest one-day decline since 2004 on Wednesday, fell more than 3%. Famed investor Bill Ackman, who bought the dip in Netflix in January, said his hedge fund Pershing Square had exited its position at a loss.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) proved the exception to the broader market selloff after the electric vehicle reported quarterly results that beat analysts’ expectations on both the top and bottom lines despite supply chain and input cost pressures.

112,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Peru's leftist President Pedro Castillo has signaled a tougher stance on protests against mining companies that are roiling the Andean nation, the world's second largest copper producer, mobilizing the army in a sharp tactical shift from a previous conciliatory approach.
Mining activity has been halted at Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) Corp's Cuajone since late February as protesters from the mostly indigenous surrounding communities demand financial compensation and a share of future profits.
The government on Wednesday announced a state of emergency at the Cuajone mine, saying it would send military forces and suspend the right to protest at the mine that has been shuttered for over 50 days.
That's a significant pivot by Castillo, a former teacher who rode into office last year backed by voters in poor mining districts hoping for a greater share of Peru's mineral wealth. He has avoided clashing with protesters despite a series of blockades that have hit the country's main export sector.
""The problem has to be solved now,"" Peru's Prime Minister Anibal Torres said on Wednesday, citing ""irrational"" community demands at Cuajone, including asking for $5 billion in payments. ""That has led us to declare a state of emergency.""
Meanwhile, last week residents of the indigenous Fuerabamba community pitched tents just feet away from Chinese-owned MMG Ltd's huge Las Bambas open pit copper deposit.
The protests have taken a combined 20% of Peru's copper production offline at a time when the Andean country is battling slower growth amid high global inflation.
""Under this administration there are a greater number of mining protests and they are more serious,"" said Pablo O'Brien, a mining expert who worked as an adviser to several mining ministers, including under Castillo. 
""The protests last longer than they ever did and they have spread to regions where you didn't see social conflicts before.""
'WE COULD STAY FOR YEARS'
Protests have also hit other mines in Peru since Castillo came to office last July, including the Anglo-Swiss Glencore (OTC:GLNCY)'s Antapaccay, and Canada-based Hudbay Minerals (NYSE:HBM) Inc's Constancia and Antamina mines, co-owned by Glencore and the Anglo-Australian miner BHP.
In neighboring Chile, the No. 1 global copper producer, BHP is also facing road blockades that have disrupted operations at its major Escondida mine, forcing it to cut its annual copper production outlook this week. 
But the pinch has been felt harder in Peru, where Cuajone and Las Bambas put together add up to 1.5% of the country's gross domestic product. Shares of Southern Copper and MMG have plummeted over 5 and 8% respectively in the past week. 
Las Bambas executives have called on the government to also declare a state of emergency at the mine.
""Las Bambas currently is coordinating with the government, and we hope they can take the same action for Las Bambas,"" Wei Jianxian, MMG's Executive General Manager for the Americas, said in a call with analysts this week.
A government press representative said they were not aware of any plans for a state of emergency for Las Bambas. 
Protesters, however, say they are digging in for the long-run, indicating that disruptions to the mining sector won't be easy to dismantle and that industry will continue to pressure the government to take firmer action.
""We could stay here for years,"" Edison Vargas, 32, the president of the Fuerabamba community, told Reuters. Vargas and others have set up camp inside Las Bambas and say they are demanding the return of their ancestral lands.
The mine had resettled some 400 Fuerabamba families over a decade ago in a compact urban town dubbed Nueva Fuerabamba to make way for the construction of Las Bambas, one of the world's top copper mines. It paid residents 600 million soles ($161 million) as compensation for the move, mine executives say.

Las Bambas is notorious for mining conflicts and has faced over 450 days of road blockades since the mine opened in 2016. 
""If the government wants to turn their backs on us, we are ready,"" Vargas added. ""We prefer to die here in our old lands than back in Nueva Fuerabamba.""

Hennigan has been at the helm of Findlay, Ohio-based Marathon for two years, taking over from former Chief Executive Gary Hemminger, who spun off the independent refiner from  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) and built it into the nation's largest refiner through a series of acquisitions.
In the letter to employees, Hennigan said the tumor ""was caught early and is curable. Tests have confirmed the cancer is limited to my throat and nearby lymph nodes.""

While continuing as chief executive, Hennigan said he plans to limit travel and speaking during treatment. 
Marathon reported net income of $16.5 billion in 2021 rebounding from a $10.6 billion loss in 2020.

(Reuters) -Blackstone Inc said on Thursday its first-quarter distributable earnings jumped 63% as a strong performance from its real estate and credit businesses offset a weak showing from its hedge funds unit.
The world's largest manager of alternative assets saw distributable earnings, which represent the cash used to pay dividends to shareholders, rise to $1.9 billion from $1.2 billion a year earlier.
That resulted in distributable earnings per share of $1.55, which exceeded the average estimate of $1.06 per share of analysts compiled by Refinitiv.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) said it changed the way it accounts for the fee-related performance revenue at its real estate income trust business, booking such earnings quarterly rather than annually. That helped to boost its overall earnings beyond what analysts had expected.
""This will likely have the effect of making ongoing quarterly fee-related earnings somewhat higher, but also somewhat more volatile,"" Oppenheimer analysts wrote in a note to investors on Thursday.
Blackstone has been mindful of the prospect of rising inflation and higher interest rates for years, which has informed its decision to concentrate its investments in hard assets such as warehouses, rental housing, enterprise software, and digital and energy infrastructure, President Jonathan Gray said during an analyst earnings call on Thursday.
""We've been mindful of the prospect of rising interest rates and a normalization of market multiples for several years. This informed our investing, and we concentrated our deployment towards hard assets in the businesses where revenue could grow faster than inflationary pressures,"" Gray said.
Blackstone's shares were down 3.5% at $116.21 per share in late morning trading, in line with other listed private equity firms. The benchmark S&P 500 stock index and Dow Jones Industrial Average index were both trading higher.

For its quarterly fund performance, Blackstone said its real estate opportunistic and core plus funds appreciated by 10.3% and 7.9%, respectively. Private credit funds gained 1.7% while its private equity portfolio rose 2.8%. That compares with a decline of nearly 5% for the S&P 500 index.
Blackstone generated $23.2 billion in proceeds from asset divestments across its portfolio. That included the sale of its majority stake in medical services provider Apria Healthcare to Owens & Minor (NYSE:OMI) Inc in a $1.6 billion take-private deal.
During the quarter, Blackstone spent $22.8 billion on new acquisitions, including its $6.4 billion takeover of Australian casino operator Crown Resorts and a $5.8 billion deal to take real estate income trust  Preferred Apartment Communities  (NYSE:APTS) Inc private.
Blackstone said earnings at its hedge funds unit, the world's largest, fell to $110.8 million, down from $157 million a year earlier, due partly to lower management fees and performance revenues. 
Its hedge fund portfolio had a net return of 1% during the quarter compared with a 0.3% decline in the benchmark Fund Weighted Composite Index compiled by hedge fund data provider HFR.
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Blackstone reported a net income of $1.22 billion, down 30% from $1.75 billion a year earlier, amid higher compensation expenses and a slowdown in investment income.

Total assets under management rose to a record $915 billion, driven by strong fundraising and bringing Blackstone closer to its goal of managing $1 trillion in assets this year. Unspent capital stood at $139.3 billion.
Blackstone declared a quarterly dividend of $1.32 per share, compared with $0.82 per share in the same quarter last year.

(Reuters) -AutoNation Inc and other brick-and-mortar auto dealerships in the United States turned shortages of new and used vehicles to profitable advantage in the first quarter, but the No. 1 U.S. auto retailer's shares were volatile Thursday as analysts questioned the outlook for consumer demand.
During a conference call Thursday, analysts pressed AutoNation (NYSE:AN) Chief Executive Mike Manley on whether consumer demand for new vehicles is slowing, and why AutoNation's used car profit margins declined during the first quarter.
AutoNation shares were flat in early trading, after initially rising by 4.6% to $110.70 in premarket trading, then falling by nearly 5%. 
Rising interest rates, high gas prices and broader inflation in the U.S. economy are putting pressure on consumers. Manley told Reuters that demand for used and new vehicles remains strong.
""We haven't seen any drop-off in our inquiry levels,"" Manley said. ""They are up year over year. The industry is at a level where there is more demand"" than supply of vehicles.
Manley told analysts that while the annualized pace of U.S. auto sales has been running at recession levels, that is a reflection of the hits to production from supply chain snarls.
""We have customers for everything that’s coming,"" Manley said. 
AutoNation reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.78, beating estimates of $5.25 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Robust demand for used vehicles and sharply higher profit margins on new vehicle sales lifted profits. 
AutoNation and Lithia Motors (NYSE:LAD), two of the largest U.S. auto dealership chains with hundreds of stores each, both outperformed investor expectations in the January to March period. Online used car retailer Carvana, however, on Wednesday reported a wider loss than analysts had forecast and its shares fell before the market open.
Lithia Chief Financial Officer Tina Miller also told Reuters ""demand has continued to outpace supply"" even as vehicle prices have risen, pushing average monthly payments to about $450 from the roughly $300 level before the pandemic.
Lithia on Wednesday reported it doubled its first quarter net income compared to a year earlier as revenue rose by 54%. 
AutoNation said its average gross profit on new vehicles it sold more than doubled in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, rising to $6,112.
AutoNation's sales of used vehicles rose by 47%, but average gross profit on used vehicles sales fell by 10%.
Manley said the company became concerned about pricing and sales trends for certain used vehicles during the quarter, and moved to clear out inventory. ""We started to use the data we had available to us. We corrected very aggressively in the quarter,"" Manley said.
AutoNation, Lithia and other U.S. auto dealerships built on traditional showrooms are rapidly building the capability to sell and finance vehicles online, while expanding highly profitable repair operations that online dealers such as Carvana do not have. AutoNation reported 45.9% gross profit margins on parts and service during the first quarter. Revenue for service rose $1 billion, up 18% from last year.

AutoNation's net income was $362.1 million, or $5.78 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, compared with $239.4 million, or $2.85 per share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 14.4% to $6.75 billion, above estimates of $6.48 billion.

129,2022-04-22,,,,,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's eye-popping profit margin has raised doubts among Wall Street analysts if the company would be able to keep at it amid rising commodity costs and higher expenses to increase production. 
The world's most valuable automaker pocketed a hefty 32.9% margin, more than double that of legacy firms including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis, who too have been spending heavily for a share of the lucrative electric vehicle market.
Tesla's record margin that came on the back of higher prices is powering a nearly 9% rise in Tesla's stock price on Thursday and has led at least five analysts to raise their price target, but with a warning.
Margin could come under pressure in the coming months as the spending on rampup at the plants in Berlin and Texas gradually becomes a part of cost of production and moves out of research and development expenses, they said. 
""While the margins are impressive, some fear that they might be at their peak,"" said Julie Gillespie, head of market research at TipRanks.
Rising commodity costs too could eat into margins even though Tesla's price increases are designed to offset higher anticipated costs in the next six to 12 months.
The recent price hikes are for orders that are likely to be delivered a year later in some cases and could incur higher production costs, potentially squeezing the margins. 
For Tesla, this implies production rampup would play a crucial role. ""Its margins ultimately depend on how many cars rattle through the production line,"" Laura Hoy, analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) said. 
""That makes volume loss one of the biggest fundamental risks to the group's margins. While demand has remained strong in the face of higher prices, affordability will always be an important factor to consider.""
Still, many investors remain bullish on the company's prospects after Chief Executive Elon Musk hinted at the automaker being able to achieve 60% volume growth this year, up from 50% predicted in the fourth-quarter earnings call.

""I would be surprised if the margins came down because they just get better and better,"" said investor Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC, adding there will be some costs with investing in factories but production would also grow. 
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla has been posting record deliveries and earnings for several quarters while rivals have been battling global supply chain issues and even suspended production.

PARIS (Reuters) -France's  Carrefour  (EPA:CARR) said on Wednesday it looked to 2022 with confidence after its sales growth accelerated in the first quarter, driven mostly by Brazil, its second-largest market.
In an inflationary environment made worse by the Ukraine crisis, Carrefour would protect the purchasing power of customers and at the same time reinforce its economic model, its finance chief Matthieu Malige told analysts.
To do so, the French retailer said it would rely on its Carrefour branded products, promotional activities and loyalty programmes while also stepping up cost savings.
Europe's largest food retailer reiterated a target to generate free cash flow above 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in 2022 and with cost inflation accelerating, it said it now aimed for more than 900 million euros in cost savings this year.
Cash is key to the French food retailer's plans to step up its digital commerce expansion.
The firm also said that having achieved 400 million euros on the 750 million euros share buyback programme it announced in February, it would launch the second tranche in the coming days.
HYPER TENSION
Carrefour reported that its first quarter sales reached 20.239 billion euros ($22 billion), marking like-for-like growth of 3.4%, driven by solid growth in Brazil and Spain while in the core French market sales were flat. This was an acceleration from 0.7% sales growth for the group in the fourth quarter 2021.
But sales at French hypermarkets, whose revival has been a priority for Carrefour boss Alexandre Bompard, fell 1.1% in the quarter compared with a 1.3% decline in the fourth quarter 2021.
""This highlights the weakness of the format given that lower pricing of the hyper format should benefit in the current inflationary environment,"" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note.
Carrefour is in the last leg of a five-year plan begun in 2018 to cut costs and boost e-commerce investment to improve profit and sales, as it battles online rivals such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and discounters like Lidl and unlisted Leclerc.
Bompard, who was reappointed in May 2021 for another three years, is working on a new strategic plan and an asset review.

Carrefour shares have gained 27% so far this year, but still trade 7% below when Bompard took over in July 2017.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO’s $54.20 per share offer is seen as “fair” while Squali says that “a competing bid is unlikely given 1) how restricted the “strategics” like GOOGL/MSFT are in M&A, 2) size of investment (at $43B+), and 3) valuation.”
The analyst added that Twitter stock price could “revert to the low-to-mid $30s” if Musk’s offer fails to materialize. A move to $30 would see shares tumble roughly 35% from current levels.
Moreover, the analyst expects Twitter to report in-line Q1 results.
“We note however that both F/X and the Russia/Ukraine war are short-term headwinds.. 1Q22 is a tough comp period with the company lapping 1Q21’s 28% growth. Given Twitter’s heavier skew towards brand advertising, we see the company as somewhat insulated from Apple’s iOS14.5 changes on measurement and targeting,” Squali wrote in a client note.

The analyst believes that “XOM will be one of the key beneficiaries of a tight refined oil products market.”
“In recent years, the market has focussed more on energy transition capex than core businesses, an area where XOM appeared to be ‘lagging’ peers. With the world (and energy policy) now turned on its head, we believe XOM has two key advantages relative to peers 1) it is the largest refiner among the majors; and 2) it screens well on upstream portfolio longevity, an area we expect to be under increased scrutiny in a high commodity price environment,” Borkhataria said in a client note.
Borkhataria argues that the earnings momentum will continue fueled by refining tailwinds. On the other hand,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) shares are downgraded to Sector Perform from Outperform with a $165.00 per share price target (up from $160.00).
The analyst sees a more balanced risk-reward at current levels.
“CVX has rallied more than any other major in recent months, and we believe part of this has been a ‘safety trade’ alongside strong commodity prices… While we expect commodity prices to remain strong, we think the current valuation leaves less room for positive surprise, while headwinds with Tengizrealisations could weigh on earnings relative to peers,” Borkhataria added.

Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari lowered the price target to $612.00 (down from $648.00 prior) as supply chain issues continue to weigh on results.
“While we expect persistent cyclical concerns to offset any improvement in the supply backdrop in the near term, we maintain our Buy rating on LRCX, as we continue to see the company as a long-term share gainer with potential upside to margins, FCF generation, and capital return,” Hari said in a client note.
Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore also lowered the price target to $625.00 per share from $730.00, but reiterated a Top Pick designation.
“We still see a good setup for the stock here with high 2H backlog alleviating many of the concerns holding the multiple back,” Moore wrote.

142,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Stellantis' Citroen announced on Thursday the end of its C4 Grand SpaceTourer model, drawing a line under 30 years of minivans that embodied the brand's family image now overshadowed by SUVs.
""Because customers' aspirations have evolved, expression of modernity and enhancement is today carried by other shapes (and) the way of thinking mobility is changing, C4 Grand SpaceTourer is now bowing out"", the brand said in a statement.
In France, minivan sales fell almost to zero in the first quarter as SUVs claimed the lion's share at 46% of new car registrations, racing with traditional sedans which bring in 47% of sales.
Production of the C4 Grand SpaceTourer at the plant located in Vigo, Spain, will stop at the beginning of July after current orders are delivered, Stellantis added in a press release.

Citroen, which retains two models of electric minivans in its catalog, plans to focus on its C5 Aircross SUV and its large C5X sedan.
In 30 years, the brand sold nearly 4.5 million minivans worldwide, fuelled by the Evasion from 1994, the C8 from 2002 and, most importantly, the Xsara and C4 Picasso after 1998, whose rounded silhouettes and family-friendly designs found favour with customers.

143,2022-04-22,"Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) cut its full-year earnings forecast on Thursday, hurt by the pullback of its Russian operations, higher costs and a sluggish recovery in its Asian duty-free business. 
The tobacco giant took a charge of 3 cents per share related to the war in Ukraine in the first quarter, after discontinuing sales of a number of Marlboro and Parliament cigarette products in Russia.
The company, which is working on options to exit Russia, has also canceled product launches for the year and suspended its planned investments there following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
Philip Morris' first-quarter earnings fell 3.6% to $2.32 billion, or $1.50 per share, including the 3-cent charge.
Russia generated revenue of more than $1.8 billion last year for Philip Morris, around 6% of the New York-based company’s global sales. 

Philip Morris also slashed its forecast for 2022 adjusted earnings per share to between $5.45 and $5.56 from between $6.12 and $6.30 estimated earlier, as soaring costs wreak havoc on corporate earnings across sectors.
Separately, a Reuters review of business registries and sanctions lists showed a longtime Russian business associate of Philip Morris, Igor Kesaev, had been sanctioned in Europe for aiding Moscow's Ukraine invasion.

SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Synthesis Capital are among the investors who took part in the latest round, bringing the company's total capital raised to $608 million. 
While brands like Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc and Impossible Foods have cashed in on a boom in plant-based sources of protein, Upside produces lab-grown meat from animal cells eliminating the need to slaughter animals.
Upside has also drawn investor interest from companies including  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) and Whole Foods, as the food industry sees the need for innovative and alternative meats to appease a strong shift in consumer choices. 
There are people who want to have the taste of meat but cannot agree with the continuous destruction and environmental impact of conventional meat production, said Dr Uma Valeti, chief executive officer of Upside Foods, adding that that's where cultivated meat will come in.
Previously known as Memphis Meats, the seven-year-old company plans to use the funds to build a commercial facility to produce its cultivated meat products and also invest in research and development. 
""We picked chicken as the product we want to go to market with followed by beef and seafood,"" said Dr Valeti.

The company said its product will be available to U.S. consumers later this year, pending regulatory review.

Alcoa generated $3.29 billion in sales in the first quarter, up 15% YoY but below the consensus estimates of $3.44 billion. The company reported adjusted EPS of $3.06, up from 79c in the same period last year and beating the consensus projection of $2.84 per share.
Adjusted EBITDA stood at $1.07 billion in the period, up from $521 in the year-ago period and compared to the analyst expectations of $1.04 billion.
Aluminum production totaled 498,000 mt, down 9.1% YoY and below estimates of 526,533.
Wolfe Research analyst Timna Tanners reiterated an Outperform rating and lowered the price target to $102.00 per share (from $105.00) after “light Q1 volumes.” The analyst is still bullish on this commodity stock and sees a buying opportunity amidst an after-hours selloff.
“We would be buyers of any weakness after Q1 results, even as we trim 2022E EBITDA to $4.2B from $4.7B and EPS to $12.25 from $12.80 on lower alumina forecasts and assuming some cost pressure. Aluminum prices look well supported by limited new supply and elevated global costs, and we see structural demand resilience from favorable packaging and light-weighting trends. Investors seem keen to own miners for a hedge against inflation, and this sector rotation can support valuation, in our view,” Tanners said in a client note.
BMO analyst David Gagliano lowered the price target to $95.00 per share from $99.00 to reflect incremental cost pressures and lower expected bauxite results.
“Bigger Picture: AA remains well positioned to benefit from higher-for-longer aluminum prices, in our view. But, the rally in AA shares has brought valuations to reasonable levels… hence maintaining the Market Perform,” the analyst wrote.

148,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Hedge fund Melvin Capital is considering a new plan that would see the fund return the capital to its investors, allowing them to reinvest it in a novel fund which would also be run by Gabe Plotkin, according to CNBC.
Plotkin, founder and CEO of Melvin Capital, is looking to unwind the current fund by the end of June to start a new one on July 1 using the capital the fund’s investors decide to reinvest. If the plan moves forward, Plotkin would achieve this without having to bring Melvin investors back to even on their invested money before he could make a performance profit.
This is because it would be extremely difficult for Plotkin to bring investors back even after the fund sustained a 39% loss in 2021 and an additional 21% loss this year.
Plotkin plans to keep the new fund at or below $5 billion in capital and focus on shorting stocks once again, a strategy that yielded him substantial returns over the past years before taking a heavy blow amid the meme stock craze in January 2021.
The move would give Plotkin and Melvin Capital a second chance after a year and a half of disappointing performance, as well as enable him to retain his employees who were likely to leave due to lack of performance fees.
The impact of the new plan remains unclear as well as how much capital would Melvin investors reinvest in the new fund.

During the quarter, volumes rose 4%, led by bulk and industrial commodities. Operating ratio, a key profitability metric, improved to 59.4% from 60.1% a year earlier.

Total operating revenue in the quarter rose to $5.86 billion, from $5 billion last year.

151,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Poland's biggest fashion retailer LPP faces a surplus of merchandise this year after closing stores in Eastern Europe, which is likely to erode its profits in the first half and squeeze profit margins in 2022, Chief Financial Officer Przemyslaw Lutkiewicz told a news briefing on Thursday.
""We were preparing for a completely different year, counting on operations on Eastern markets and that our sales would exceed 20 billion zlotys ($4.70 billion)"", Lutkiewicz said. ""This surplus is due to the fact that we do not have sales on the eastern markets."" 
Instead, the company now expects revenue in its year through Jan. 31, 2023, of 16 billion zlotys, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February compelled it to close its stores in both those countries. 
Lutkiewicz said excess inventory would make for a challenging first half. The company will sell its spring stock in the autumn and sell the rest to Poland and the ""countries where we are currently operating"", he said.
For the second half of the year, the company has slashed its merchandise orders by 25-30% to account for fewer stores after the closures. 
The company said, however, that it saw no supply chain issues despite pandemic-related restrictions in China.
LPP expects a decrease in operating margin in 2022, and plans capital expenditure during the year of 1 billion zlotys, compared to 1.33 billion zlotys a year earlier. 
The company plans to expand its presence in the European Union in 2022.
LPP said the first quarter looked good despite difficulties related to the war in Ukraine.
Lutkiewicz said the company saw ""good sales in March and April. 30-40% increase in sales year on year.""

For the year through Jan. 31, the company earned a net profit of 953.5 million zlotys on revenue of 14.03 billion zlotys.

152,2022-04-22,,,,,,"MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia (TIM) has started talks with banks to raise around 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in financing that could be partly guaranteed by Italy's export insurer SACE, three sources familiar with the matter said. 
Burdened with total gross debt of more than 30 billion euros, TIM has around 3 billion euro in bonds coming due this year, the annual report shows. 
TIM is talking to UniCredit, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) and Santander (BME:SAN) over a deal to secure a credit line, the sources said. The banks involved had no comment. 
Under a guarantee scheme Italy used during the first COVID-19 wave in 2020 to help companies raise new debt, SACE is allowed to cover up to 80% of the financing.
However, there are doubts as to whether TIM is eligible to tap such a scheme, one of the sources said.
""A new credit line of this amount, possibly backed by SACE, therefore structured with more favorable terms, should be positive ... as it would help  Telecom Italia  (BIT:TLIT) boost its reserves and more easily meet some of the extraordinary payments expected during the current year,"" Bestinver said in a report.
TIM faces a 1.7 billion euro payment by the end of September as part of the amount it put in the pot to secure frequencies in a fifth-generation mobile spectrum auction.
Hit by multiple rating downgrades after a record loss last year, TIM is working to reorganise its business through an asset split after a failed 10.8 billion euro takeover approach by U.S. fund KKR.
Under pressure for years due to fierce competition in its domestic market, TIM was forced to freeze 2021 dividends after booking an 8.4 billion euro annual loss.

Looking further ahead, the performance of the group, which spans high end Bulgari hotels to Hennessy cognac, would depend on ""a number of things"", he added, citing COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the geopolitical situation in Europe.

Arnault also said it was too soon to tell whether rising inflation was hitting luxury consumer behaviour.

156,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Generali (BIT:GASI) boss Philippe Donnet, facing a challenge to his leadership from rebel investors, is confident he can deliver on his plans for the Italian insurer and says he is not concerned about the outcome of what some investors see as a ""soap opera"".
Shareholders in Europe's third-largest insurer vote next Friday (April 29) on a proposal by Generali's board to hand Donnet, 61, a third term at the helm. 
But his reappointment has been called into question by a shareholder battle pitting Italian billionaires Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio against the insurer's main investor Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY).
Caltagirone, 79, and Del Vecchio, 86, are Generali's second- and third-largest shareholders, respectively.
""I'm not concerned because this is not about my role,"" Donnet told Reuters in an interview in Milan. 
""It's about two very different visions of what Generali's governance should look like,"" citing the company's way of doing things as an example of best practice.
Caltagirone has proposed as CEO Luciano Cirina, who ran Generali's Austria and CEE business until March, and pledged to grow Generali's earnings per share almost twice as fast compared with the strategy through 2024 the group unveiled in December.
""Investors knew and liked our plan and they've given us their backing. They ... appreciate that the plan is ambitious, credible and realistic,"" Donnet said after meeting shareholders in London, New York and Boston. 
Having successfully steered Generali through the pandemic during his six years at the helm, Donnet said Generali would meet its financial goals despite the Ukraine war.
""I'm very confident we'll hit the plan's targets despite the current geopolitical difficulties,"" he said.
Asked about Generali's Russian business, Donnet said the insurer was working to wind down, as announced, its Europ Assistance operations in the country, where its sole customer is Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p), while it would keep its stake in local insurer Ingosstrakh frozen. 
""It's not a good time to sell, we don't want to enter negotiations with Russian counterparts.""
'RATIONAL BEINGS'
Donnet said institutional investors, who hold roughly a third of Generali's capital, struggled to understand the reasons behind what they saw as an Italian ""soap opera"".
""Investors are rational beings and they're very perplexed by what is happening,"" said Donnet, who holds dual Italian and French nationality. ""And I also have trouble explaining it because I'm also a rational being.""
Blaming Donnet for what they see as an overly timid acquisition strategy, the rebel investors say Generali has fallen behind rival AXA and Allianz (ETR:ALVG) in terms of market value, though Italy's top insurer has generated the sector's highest total shareholder return since 2016.
Generali has earmarked 3 billion euros for mergers and acquisitions (M&A), less than half the 7 billion euros indicated by the challengers. 
Donnet said the M&A budget was ""enough to clinch good transactions"", adding that while ""the pipeline of M&A opportunities is never empty ... good deals mature slowly"".
He pointed to the recently concluded acquisition of French healthcare professional insurer La Medicale, which had required six years of bilateral negotiations. 

Generali would not shy away if ""the dream acquisition"" came along and would turn to investors to raise capital if it had to spend more than the allotted 3 billion euros.
""We are well-placed to tap the market for cash. I am confident we could do it because we've earned trust of our investors,"" he said.

162,2022-04-22,,,,,,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. airline stocks took flight in premarket on Thursday as American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) joined rival United in giving a strong outlook for the spring and summer quarters. 
By 7:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), American Airlines stock was up 10.6% at its highest in six months, while United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock was up 8.5% at its highest since February. Delta  (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest  (NYSE:LUV) stock were both up more than 3%, while JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) stock was up 4.9%.
American said it will return to profitability in the current quarter, flying at between 92%-94% of its pre-pandemic capacity levels. It sees revenue being between 6%-8% above the comparable quarter in 2019, ""based on current trends"".
It already posted a record sales figure for March, which drove first-quarter revenue to $8.9 billion, some 3% ahead of consensus forecasts. The airline's adjusted net loss of $2.32 a share was also slightly better than a consensus forecast of $2.44, and was barely half of the $4.32 loss a year earlier. 
United, meanwhile, had said late on Wednesday that it expects to be profitable this year, thanks to the return of business travel for the first time since collapsing two years ago at the start of the pandemic.
Airline stocks already received a boost at the start of the week when a Federal judge threw out the mask mandate that the Biden administration had sought to impose on flights as part of its Covid-19 health measures. Restrictions both in the U.S. and across most of the world have been relaxed in recent months as successive new dominant strains of the disease have mutated into something less virulent and aggressive than its early strains. 
""Demand for domestic business travel has steadily improved as offices have reopened and travel restrictions have been lifted,"" American said. ""Revenue from small- to medium-size businesses and customers traveling for a mix of business and leisure remains very strong and is approaching a full recovery, and corporate bookings are the highest they have been since the start of the pandemic.""
It also noted that demand for international travel has also picked up considerably."
163,2022-04-22,,,,,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc results surged past Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, as higher prices helped insulate the electric vehicle maker from supply chain chaos and rising costs.
The results also should trigger $23 billion in new payouts to CEO Elon Musk, already the world's richest man.
Tesla has been an outlier since the pandemic outbreak, posting record deliveries and earnings for several quarters when rivals wrestling with global supply chain snarls rolled out production halts.
Shares of Tesla rose 5% after the close of regular trading.
On an investor conference call, Musk said Tesla has a reasonable shot at achieving 60% vehicle delivery growth this year and remains confident of seeing 50% annual delivery growth for several years.
Tesla raised its prices in China, the United States and other countries, after Musk said in March the U.S. electric carmaker was facing significant inflationary pressure in raw materials and logistics amid the crisis in Ukraine. 
""Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through the rest of 2022,"" Tesla said in a statement. 
The price increases are designed to cover higher costs for the next six to 12 months, which protects Tesla on orders for cars that it may not deliver for a year.
""Price increases are nicely exceeding cost inflation,"" said Craig Irwin at Roth Capital. 
""Chinese production issues seem well managed, and we expect Austin and Berlin to make up the slack from Shanghai’s 19-day outage,"" he said referring to Tesla's two new factories in Texas and Germany which have started deliveries in recent months 
The results let Musk meet a hat trick of performance goals worth a combined $23 billion in new compensation. He receives no salary and his pay package requires Tesla's market capitalization and financial growth to hit a series of escalating targets. 
The world's most valuable automaker said revenue was $18.8 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, versus estimates of $17.8 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. This is up 81% from a year earlier.
Revenue from sales of its regulatory credits to other automakers jumped 31% to $679 million in the first quarter from a year earlier, helping boost revenue and profits. 
Its earnings per share was $3.22, beatings analysts' estimates of $2.26. 
Tesla's pre-tax profit (EBITDA) per vehicle delivered rose by more than 60% to $16,203 in the latest quarter compared with a year earlier. 
Tesla said it has lost about a month of build volume out of its Shanghai factory due to COVID-related shutdowns. It said production is resuming at limited levels, which will impact total build and delivery volume in the second quarter.
Musk expected Tesla's total production in the current quarter to be similar to that of the first quarter.

LITHIUM IS SOFTWARE 
Musk said lithium is responsible for cost increases and ""a limiting factor"" to EV growth. 
He encouraged companies to get into the lithium business, which he said would generate high margins thanks to high prices.
""The lithium margins right now are practically software margins....Do you like minting money? Well, the lithium business is for you.""
He also said Tesla will have ""some exciting announcements in the months to come"" regarding securing raw materials for batteries.
Musk said its own 4680 battery cells would become a risk to production next year if it does not solve volume production by early 2023. ""But we're highly confident of doing so."" He also said as a risk mitigation, it will also use its existing, 2170 batteries for vehicles being made in Texas. 
Musk said Tesla expects to mass produce a robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedal by 2024.
During the call, Musk did not mention Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which he offered to buy last week for $43 billion. Investors are concerned that he may sell some Tesla stocks or borrow against additional Tesla shares to finance his bid.
Investors also worry about Musk being distracted by his Twitter bid at a time when Tesla is ramping up production at new factories in Berlin and Texas. 

""Factory ramps take time, and Gigafactory Austin and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg will be no different,"" Tesla said in a statement.
The new factories will be key to meeting demand and reducing reliance on its China factory, its biggest one, which is recovering from a plant shutdown.

164,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Mexico's cash-strapped state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) is under pressure to resume financial debt repayments despite promises from President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador that his government would pay them until 2024. On Thursday, Pemex is due to pay some 1 billion euros to redeem a 2015 bond, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. ""Pemex will make payment of its maturities this month with its own resources, since the finance ministry did not make capital contributions to the company in April (for that),"" said one of the sources, who asked to remain anonymous.
Neither the finance ministry nor Pemex responded to requests for comment.
Pemex, one of the world's most-indebted oil companies, has struggled with years of declining crude production and in 2020 lost its coveted investment-grade debt rating.
The source said between May and December Pemex faces outstanding principal and interest payments, mainly related to bonds, worth some $3.8 billion. ""The finance ministry notified Pemex about three weeks ago the company had to pay the eurobond, arguing it has more funds due to the increase in ... oil prices,"" the source added.
Pemex has said it must shoulder peso-denominated financial debt maturities in 2022 worth some $8.4 billion, and another $15.2 billion of debt commitments in other currencies. The ministry has in recent weeks also pressed Pemex to resume amortizations linked mainly to debt issuances, which this year amount to some $7.5 billion, another $7.4 billion in 2023 and $8.8 billion in 2024, the source said.
In 2021, debt amortizations totaled about $6.4 billion.
The second source told Reuters ""the additional income from Pemex will be significant, and that allows the company to receive less (government) support"", without giving details on how much extra income was expected due to the increase in crude oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Pemex's financial debt closed 2021 at $109.0 billion. Net losses were $10.9 billion last year.
Pemex has begun drawing up a refinancing plan for some $3.5 billion in financial debt, anticipating the funds will not come from the government for now, the first source said.
Mexico in January swapped short-term Pemex bonds for a new 10-year bond as part of a scheme to lower debt and reduce medium-term financial pressure on the firm.
Mexico's government in 2021 made capital contributions to Pemex of 202.569 billion pesos for debt repayments and granted the firm 73.280 billion pesos in tax incentives.
Pemex officials recently said the government will provide it with capital this year in accordance with its maturity profile.

Last month, Lopez Obrador said Mexico will reduce refining output at Pemex while it modernizes its refineries, as the government capitalizes on high oil prices.
Mexico has said it will use extra revenue collected from oil prices to subsidize domestic gasoline and diesel prices, helping to contain inflation.

165,2022-04-22,,,,,"A Florida official praised Elon Musk's offer to buy  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and said pension officials will tell the company its efforts to fend off the bid could hurt shareholder value.
""We're definitely very concerned about them leaving offers on the table,"" said Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis in a telephone interview late on Wednesday afternoon.
A poison pill the company adopted last week in response to Musk's interest ""hurts our state’s equity position in Twitter, and I’m not happy,"" Patronis said.
Patronis is one of three elected officials who are trustees of the State Board of Administration (SBA), with some $250 billion in retirement assets. It will vote 808,093 Twitter shares at next month's annual meeting, about the 70th largest investor.
Twitter representatives did not immediately respond to questions.
While the stake would only be decisive in a close contest, Patronis' comments show how politics has shaped the discussion around who controls the social media platform.
Musk, chief executive officer of carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, has described his interest in Twitter as an extension of his concerns for free speech.
Republicans including Patronis have criticized Twitter for steps like banning the account of former U.S. President Donald Trump due to the risk of further incitement of violence after the storming of the U.S. Capitol.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, another pension trustee, on Tuesday also made comments https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-19/desantis-says-florida-could-act-over-twitter-s-musk-rebuffal critical of Twitter's board. Patronis said he, DeSantis, and Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, the third trustee, have not yet decided how to vote on Twitter directors.

But they have told Lamar Taylor, the SBA's interim executive director, to express their concerns to Twitter's leadership. Taylor's mission, Patronis said, was to ""go and put these guys on notice, we’re sitting trigger finger itchy to make something happen.""
Patronis called himself a ""rabid Elon Musk fan"" but said he would welcome higher bids. ""If some equity group wants to come and buy the whole thing out, more power to them,"" he said.

167,2022-04-22,"Boeing (NYSE:BA) has informed airlines and parts vendors that it expects to restart 787 Dreamliner deliveries in the second half of 2022, according to Reuters.
Resuming deliveries later this year will be crucial for Boeing’s plans to gradually ramp up the 787 production and support the supply chain that has been facing significant challenges in the recent period.
Boeing initially planned to resume 787 deliveries this month, but the planemaker was forced to push back deliveries to May, with reports suggesting that further delays can be expected as the company continues to deal with inspections and repairs of structural flaws in roughly 100 787 jets.
Reuters reports that Boeing has informed clients that deliveries would continue in the second half of this year, with the third quarter appearing as the most realistic target. The company will not make a public projection of when it will be allowed to resume deliveries.
The overall cost of the production delay is estimated to be around $5.5 billion.
A spokesperson of Boeing said the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will decide when will deliveries of 787 resume.
""As we've said, we are taking the time needed to ensure conformance to our exacting specifications. Safety dictates the timeline,"" an FAA spokesperson said.
The FAA pulled Boeing’s ability to self-certify 787 airplanes two months ago, saying it would give not give back that ability until it sees that the planemaker can build jets that meet design standards.
Boeing has a well-designed plan “for the re-work that it must perform on a large volume of new 787s in storage,” said the FAA spokesperson.
Boeing is due to report earnings on April 27, with many investors interested in seeing the details of the company’s performance after it was forced to reduce production, weighing further on the already crippled supply chain.
Boeing stock price is up 1% in pre-open Thursday.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Thursday, boosted by strong after hours quarterly reports from the likes of Tesla and United Airlines as investors digest the nascent quarterly corporate earnings season.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 220 points, or 0.6%, S&P 500 Futures traded 35 points, or 0.8%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 155 points, or 1.1%.
Investors are keeping a keen eye on this quarter earnings season, looking for updates on how companies are positioning for higher interest rates amid red-hot inflation. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is trading over 7% higher premarket after the world's most valuable carmaker reported another stronger-than-expected quarter, with a net profit of $3.32 billion, as it raised prices in response to inflation, offsetting the impact of a Shanghai factory shutdown.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock gained over 8% after the carrier released an upbeat outlook after the close Wednesday, forecasting a profit in 2022 for the first time since the pandemic.
The earnings continue to pour in Thursday, with telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) reporting a 2.5% rise in core wireless revenue for the first quarter, benefiting from the expansion of its fiber internet and 5G services.
Social media giant Snap (NYSE:SNAP) reports after the close, and investors will be listening for details about average daily and monthly users and growth projections.
The three main Wall Street benchmarks had a mixed day on Wednesday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 0.7%, boosted by strong numbers from Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2%, dragged down by Netflix’s slump.
Elsewhere, weekly initial jobless claims are due later in the session, with the recent trend putting the numbers near multi-decade lows, as well as the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s monthly manufacturing survey, while Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak publicly twice on Thursday, firstly at an inflation conference and later at an International Monetary Fund panel discussion.
Oil prices edged higher Thursday, helped by signs of strong U.S. demand as the global supply situation remains tight.
Crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, released Wednesday, showed a draw of 8 million barrels for the week ended April 15, confirming the strong numbers released the previous session by the industry body American Petroleum Institute.
OPEC member Libya said on Wednesday it was losing more than 550,000 barrels per day of oil output due to blockades, while the European Union is considering a ban on Russian oil for its invasion of Ukraine.
That said, the COVID situation in China remains a concern, with Shanghai authorities keeping tough restrictions in place for now as the number of cases across the city rose again.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $102.92 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.9% to $107.79.

170,2022-04-22,,,,,"Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are up nearly 7% in premarket trading Thursday after the electric vehicle (EV) maker reported better-than-expected Q1 adjusted EPS and revenue.
How Did Tesla Perform in Q1?
The company posted Q1 adjusted EPS of $3.22, up from 93c in the year-ago period, to smash the consensus of $2.27 per share. The EV company reported revenue of $18.76 billion, up 81% YoY, and above the consensus of $17.92 billion.
Tesla’s free cash flow (FCF) in the quarter totaled $2.23 billion, compared to $293 million last year and a consensus projection of $671.8 million.
More importantly, the automotive gross margin stood at 32.9%, compared to 26.5% in the year-ago quarter, and higher than the analyst consensus of 28.4%. The company reported a gross margin of 29.1%, also above the expected 25.8%.
Forward-looking Commentary
Tesla said it plans to start expanding its manufacturing capacity immediately. The company still expects vehicle deliveries to grow by 50% annually, though it warned that supply chain challenges will likely remain throughout the rest of the year.
The carmaker says its Texas gigafactory will produce Model Y vehicles using both structural packs with 4680 cells and non-structural packs with 2170 cells later this year. Also, the industrialization of Tesla Cybertruck is seeing progress, the company said.
Musk's Compensation
With the latest earnings report, Tesla CEO Elon Musk reached three important performance goals worth a total of $23 billion in compensation.
The carmaker’s strong revenue and EBITDA in the first quarter, along with robust reports from the previous three quarters, sees the company reach milestones that activate the vesting of 9th through 11th of 12 tranches of options awarded to Musk in his 2018 pay package.
Each tranche grants Musk the option to purchase 8.4 million Tesla shares at $70.01 apiece, marking a discount of as much as 90% from the stock’s closing price of $977.20 on Wednesday.
As a result, the three options that will vest following Tesla’s strong performance in the March quarter would provide Musk with compensation of roughly $23 billion.
The new compensation comes just a few days after Musk made a $43 billion bid to acquire Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), with some analysts predicting that the billionaire could borrow billions against Tesla shares.
Analysts Reflect on Tesla's Q1 Performance
Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney reiterated a Buy rating and a $1,200 price target on Tesla as the earnings report illustrated the benefits of Tesla's model and price-cost leadership, he told clients in a note.
“While we expect input costs to rise this year (and in addition we estimate that the Giga Shanghai shutdown could represent a 50-100bps headwind to non-GAAP auto gross margin in 2Q), we think Tesla can largely offset this driven not only by higher pricing flowing through backlog but also due to improvements including with casting, internally developed 4680 cells, and ramping up the Austin and Berlin factories,” Delaney said.
Bank of America analyst John Murphy maintained his Neutral rating and a $1,300.00 per share price target after a “solid” performance.
“We have trepidation that TSLA stock may already be priced for perfection (or at least priced for hyperbolic growth), such that near-term earnings beats may be insufficient to get bulls incrementally positive on the stock. With this in mind, we reiterate our Neutral rating,” Murphy wrote to clients.
Finally, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli raised the price target on Tesla to $375.00 per share from $313.00 following an “impressive Q1.” The analyst is constructive on Tesla’s market-leading EV position but more skeptical of the company’s AV/FSD “architecture approach.”
“We think the current valuation remains challenging considering that the handful of other companies that previously achieved Tesla’s current market cap did so generating ~$100bln of gross profit (on avg.) vs. Tesla’s having just annualized ~$22bln in Q1 and as compared with our 2023E of ~$41bln. And while there’s little doubt that EV supply/demand broadly remains tight with EVs likely having also expanded the auto market, we need to be mindful that Tesla is adding sizable Model Y capacity in what are now price-points (>$60k U.S.) where the market-size is inherently smaller and where EV supply/demand might not prove as tight with other new entries ramping,” Michaeli said in a memo to clients.
Tesla stock price closed at $977.20 yesterday.

174,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Hedge fund manager William Bill Ackman sold his entire stake in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), a move that resulted in a $400 million loss after the streaming service provider’s shares tumbled due to a decline in subscribers.
Ackman, founder and CEO of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, offloaded 3.1 million Netflix shares it acquired three months ago.
Earlier this week, Netflix reported a drop in the number of global paid subscribers for the first time in ten years, sending the company’s shares declining by 35% to $226.19 per share.
Ackman invested $1.1 billion in Netflix in January shortly after its shares fell due to a weaker-than-expected subscription forecast. In its earnings report this week, Netflix reported a decline of 200,000 in the number of paid subscribers, urging the billionaire investor to make a U-turn and sell his stake.
Ackman said that Netflix’s potential business model changes such as focusing on non-paying customers and advertising seemed reasonable, however, it would make the streaming giant very unpredictable in the short run.
""While Netflix's business is fundamentally simple to understand, in light of recent events, we have lost confidence in our ability to predict the company's future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty,"" Ackman said in a statement.
He said that his hedge fund, which has a limited portfolio of just a dozen of companies, prefers to invest in companies that are highly predictable.

175,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Soaring demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) as buyers steer clear of Russian fuel is putting some long-stalled U.S. export projects back on track. But rising costs for materials and labor threaten to snarl these plants once again.
Two developers with projects sidelined due to the U.S.-China trade war –  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET) with its Lake Charles LNG and Tellurian (NYSE:TELL) Inc with its Driftwood LNG – have begun talks with construction provider Bechtel Group over costs, according to a spokesperson and regulatory filing. 
Materials prices have shot up 20% in the past two years while gas compressors are 30% costlier, construction and energy experts said. Metals required for LNG projects are in short supply due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and could add another 10% to costs, they added. 
Higher costs mean lower returns and could give an edge to rivals with newer, modular designs that rely on off-the-shelf components and, in one case, speedier construction using oil platforms for production sites. Costs of U.S. natural gas hit a 13-year high this month, adding to financial hurdles.
""Who knows what LNG terminals are going to cost now,"" warned Michael Smith, CEO of Freeport LNG, a Texas firm that started commercial production in 2019 after a four-year construction period. 
A large portion of construction material costs are steel and nickel alloy piping, Smith said at last month's CERAWeek energy conference. ""Fifty percent of nickel comes from Russia."" 
SOARING MATERIALS COST
Steel used to assemble LNG storage tanks is up about 10% this year and nickel, required to make steel and nickel alloys for piping, has gained 40% since February, according to Black & Veatch, which designs and builds LNG terminals. 
Rebar, steel used to strengthen concrete, cost more than $1,100 per short tonne on April 8, up 10% since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and up 40% from a year earlier, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Commodity Insights' Platts assessments show. [IRONORE/]
Rising costs to build a new U.S. LNG export facility makes it ""more expensive for a developer to move forward,"" said Kenneth Medlock III, a fellow in Energy and Resource Economics at Baker Institute for Public Policy. 
LNG plants built a few years ago cost about $540 per tonne of annual LNG output, putting the construction of a 10 million tonne per annum plant at $5.4 billion, said Greg Vesey, former CEO of LNG Ltd, which sold its proposed export project in 2020. 
""At a 25% increase, the range is going to be between $600 and $700 a tonne,"" Vesey added. 
REVISITING DESIGNS
The cost hikes are, however, not likely to halt new construction. Wall Street analysts now expect four multi-billion-dollar plants to be approved this year, versus a previous projection of two or three plants. 
U.S. LNG exports in March rose to a record 11.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), versus an average 9.7 bcfd for calendar 2021, according to U.S. government data. 
But soaring raw materials prices may lead to a revision in contracts and financing needs, weakening potential returns.
Lake Charles LNG's 2015 regulatory filing estimated construction goods and services would cost $1.68 billion and wages would be $2.72 billion. 
The Energy Transfer's Lake Charles, Louisiana, project would need ""an updated cost assessment,"" investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co said last month. 
Energy Transfer did not reply to requests for comment.
However, it told U.S. energy regulators on March 7 it was working with the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) provider Bechtel that will ""enable EPC pricing updates"" this summer. It did not offer an estimated cost increase. 
Tellurian added $300 million to its original $15.2 billion EPC contract with Bechtel for Driftwood LNG, spokesperson Joi Lecznar said. She did not say when the increase went into effect or if another is pending. 
Bechtel declined to comment. 
LIKE LEGO
To cut costs, newer plant developers including New Fortress Energy (NASDAQ:NFE) are employing modular liquefaction units made by Baker Hughes Inc that are prebuilt in factories and can be snapped together like Legos. 
New Fortress claims it could put together a plant atop an offshore drilling rig in 12 months. 
""Using modular units has the potential to offer savings in both time and money compared with building a complex large-scale project from scratch,"" said Robert Songer, LNG analyst at data intelligence firm ICIS. 
Sean Morgan, a director at investment bank Evercore Partners (NYSE:EVR) ISI, pointed out that the designs allow for ""lower upfront capital expenditure commitments by capital providers and the project builders."" 
LNG developer Venture Global is installing 18 modular units at its Calcasieu Pass project in Louisiana. The project's $580 per tonne cost is about 26% cheaper than early LNG export terminals, according Ross Wyeno, an analyst at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

Such designs slash on-site construction labor costs, said Paul Varello, chairman of Commonwealth LNG, which is targeting a 2023 financial decision for its proposed U.S. Gulf Coast plant. 
""One benefit is their tendency to not be as sensitive to inflationary impacts,"" he said. ""By having that savings, we're able to be competitive on our prices.""

177,2022-04-22,"Today, Amazon announced Buy with Prime—a new benefit for Prime members that will extend the convenience of Prime shopping to online stores beyond Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Buy with Prime will initially be available by invitation only for merchants using Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) and will roll out through 2022 as merchants are invited to participate, including those not selling on Amazon or using FBA.
Expanded Shopping Benefits for Prime Members
Buy with Prime will allow millions of U.S.-based Prime members to shop directly from merchants’ online stores with the trusted experience they expect from Amazon—including fast, free delivery, a seamless checkout experience, and free returns on eligible orders. Prime members will see the Prime logo and delivery promise on eligible products in merchants’ online stores, which signals the item is available for free delivery, as fast as next day, with free returns. When shopping with Buy with Prime, checkout is simple and convenient. Prime members will use the payment and shipping information stored in their Amazon account and receive timely shipping and delivery notifications after an order is placed.
“We always aim to exceed Prime members’ expectations by offering more selection, exclusive deals, quality content, and convenient features,” said Jamil Ghani, vice president of Amazon Prime. “With the introduction of Buy with Prime, we’re expanding where members can enjoy trusted and convenient Prime shopping benefits beyond Amazon, adding even more value to their membership. Members will have the flexibility to shop from merchants directly, all while enjoying the fast, free delivery, seamless checkout, and easy returns they’ve come to know and love from Amazon.”
A New Way for Merchants to Grow their Online Stores
“For over 20 years, we’ve been empowering small and medium-sized businesses with opportunities to grow,” said Peter Larsen, Amazon’s vice president of Buy with Prime. “Allowing merchants to offer Prime shopping benefits on their own direct-to-consumer online stores is an exciting next step in our mission to help merchants of all sizes grow their business—whether on Amazon or beyond. With shoppers purchasing directly from merchants’ online stores, Buy with Prime will allow merchants to build customer relationships and brand loyalty while offering conversion-driving benefits like fast, free shipping.”
For merchants already using FBA, Buy with Prime can be added to their online store within minutes because their inventory is already stored in Amazon fulfillment centers. To get started, merchants sign up for Buy with Prime, link an Amazon Seller Central account, use Multi-Channel Fulfillment to offer one pool of inventory for multiple channels, and link an Amazon Pay account to offer a seamless checkout experience for Prime members. Then, by installing a JavaScript widget in their online store, merchants can easily add Buy with Prime to one or more products. With Buy with Prime, merchants will receive shopper order information, including email addresses for customer orders, which they can use to provide customer service and build direct relationships with shoppers.
Using Buy with Prime, merchants simply pay for what they use. Pricing is based on a service fee, a payment processing fee, and fulfillment and storage fees that are calculated per unit.

Investing.com -- THG (LON:THG) shares rose 5.5% in London on speculation that the Direct-to-Consumer specialist could be bought, after CEO Matt Moulding said it had received tentative approaches from possible buyers in recent weeks. 
""You will all be aware that there has been significant speculation about possible third party interest in THG,"" Moulding said in a press release accompanying THG's preliminary first-quarter results. ""I can confirm that the Board has received indicative proposals from numerous parties in recent weeks. The Board has concluded that each and every proposal to date has been unacceptable, failing to reflect the fair value of the Group, and confirms that THG is not currently in receipt of any approaches.""
Moulding, whose performance has come under criticism due to the poor performance of the group's stock since it listed in London 19 months ago, added that he would continue executing the group's existing strategy.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), THG stock in London was up 7.5% at a seven-week high. It's still lost around five-sixths of its value since listing.
THG's quarterly figures were slightly better than expected, and the company upheld its prior guidance for an increase of between 22%-25% in currency-adjusted revenue this year. Revenue was up 17% on the year, with the beauty segment growing 19.7% and the nutrition segment growing 12.6%. The number of websites powered by the group's technology rose to 202 from 187 at the end of the fourth quarter.
It warned though that its margins may come under pressure as it tries to absorb at least some of the cost pressure currently affecting it. The company said it will aim to raise prices ""at a lower rate to underlying input costs.""  
""We believe the recent and rapid inflationary environment is largely transitory, and THG will, as far as possible, continue to shield consumers from these adverse macro-economic conditions,"" Moulding said, going against the recent trend of increasingly alarmist rhetoric about inflation from companies across the spectrum. Moulding noted the importance of retaining customers, saying that 78% of its revenue comes from repeat business. Most of that comes from high-frequency purchases in the beauty and nutrition segments. "

(Reuters) -Elon Musk will not be subjected to a ""gag order"" preventing him from discussing a lawsuit claiming he defrauded Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shareholders by tweeting in 2018 about taking his electric car company private, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday.
U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco agreed with Musk and Tesla that the proposed temporary restraining order appeared overbroad because it prevented Musk from speaking to ""anyone"" about the case.
Chen also found no proof that letting Musk, the world's richest person according to Forbes, talk publicly posed a ""clear and present danger"" or ""serious and imminent threat"" to a trial.
But the judge also said he plans to tell jurors at the scheduled January 2023 trial he had already ruled that Musk's tweets were false, and made with sufficient knowledge they were false.
Shareholders sued over losses resulting from volatility in Tesla's shares after Musk tweeted on Aug. 7, 2018, that he had ""funding secured"" to potentially take Tesla private at $420 per share, and that ""investor support is confirmed.""
Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer for the shareholders, in an email said he was pleased that jurors will be instructed that the tweets ""were false and were made fraudulently by Elon Musk."" He said the primary remaining issue is the amount of damages owed.
Lawyers for Musk and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The April 15 request for a gag order came one day after Musk told the TED conference in Vancouver that he had lined up funding to privatize Tesla, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud anyway over his tweeting.
Musk and Tesla said the proposed gag order ""evokes a level of censorship"" that could not be reconciled with the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of free speech.
They also said an order could block Musk from communicating with Tesla shareholders, discussing his proposal to buy  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), and trying to end his consent decree with the SEC, which requires Tesla lawyers to vet some of his tweets.

Musk has said he would never lie to shareholders. He has offered to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share.
The case is In re Tesla Inc Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-04865.

185,2022-04-22,,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) reported a healthy gain in revenue as the world’s largest food company started the year with its strongest first-quarter pricing in more than a decade. 
Sales rose 7.6% on an organic basis in the first quarter, the company said Thursday. Analysts expected 5.1%. The figures exclude Russia, where Nestle has halted some activities.
Food and beverage companies have been raising prices amid strong demand as consumers return to offices and eat outside of home more often. The sector has benefited from resilient appetite for basic necessities while European industrial companies and carmakers suffer from higher costs and supply-chain bottlenecks.

Nestle shares gained as much as 1.9% in early trading. 
Rival Danone SA (OTC:DANOY) reported its fastest quarterly sales growth in seven years Wednesday, while Heineken (OTC:HEINY) NV’s unusually big price increases helped revenue increase by 36% in the period. While the ability to raise prices on consumers may blunt the impact of higher raw material costs, the risk is that it may eventually drive some shoppers to cheaper alternatives. 
“We are getting used to companies beating consensus sales growth expectations this quarter -- L’Oreal, Danone and Heineken have all done it -- but in our view Nestle is the most impressive yet,” James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC, wrote. He said that the company’s shipment growth is admirable in the context of such strong pricing.
The war in Ukraine has exacerbated food inflation because the country is a major supplier of wheat and sunflower oil. Meanwhile inflation in prices for coffee, plastic and shipping are cutting into profitability at the maker of KitKat chocolate and San Pellegrino water. 
“Cost inflation continues to increase sharply, which will require further pricing and mitigating actions over the course of the year,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider said in a statement.
Schneider had faced criticism for continuing to do business in Russia, with Ukrainian politicians even calling him out by name and demanding a full exit. Nestle eventually suspended the vast majority of its production in the country, but Schneider maintains that access to food is a basic right. Nestle now focuses on selling essential products like infant formula and medical nutrition there.
The CEO stuck to his forecast for revenue growth to decelerate to about 5% in 2022. Schneider said in February the company should achieve its previous long-term guidance in coming years, which is for annual revenue increases of 5% to 6%.
The maker of Purina pet food repeated that profitability may decline for a second year in 2022, with its adjusted operating profit margin expected to be 17% to 17.5% this year. The margin was 17.4% in 2021.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday appealed a judge's ruling ending a mask mandate on public transportation and airplanes after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the measure was still needed. 
A U.S. district judge ruled on Monday that the mandates, which apply to planes, trains and other public transportation, were unlawful. The Justice Department said it would appeal the ruling if the CDC determined the 14-month-old mandate was still needed.
The Justice Department filed notice appealing the ruling to the 11th Circuit Court, but did not detail if it intended to seek an emergency order to reinstate the requirement or detail the grounds for the appeal.
The CDC said on Wednesday it had asked the Justice Department to proceed with the appeal and that ""an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health.""
Airlines quickly dropped the mandate Monday evening soon after the White House informed reporters and industry officials that the government would no longer enforce the mandate. Social media users posted videos of airline employees on some trips announcing the mandate had ended mid-flight with many cheering the news, while some expressed anger that the mask rules were abruptly dropped.
The mandate applied to planes, trains, ride-share vehicles and other public transportation and, prior to Monday's ruling, had been due to expire on May 3 unless the CDC sought a new extension.
The U.S. Travel Association said Wednesday that ""masks were critically important during the height of the pandemic"" but in the current environment ""required masking on public transportation is simply out of step with the current public health landscape.""

The ruling followed other court judgments against Biden administration directives to fight the infectious disease that has killed nearly 1 million Americans, including vaccination or COVID testing mandates for employers.
The CDC also lost court battles on COVID-19 mandates, notably when the Supreme Court in August ended the pandemic-related federal moratorium on residential evictions.

LONDON (Reuters) -Pepco Group, owner of European discount retailer brands PEPCO, Poundland and Dealz, pledged to ""protect prices"" for cash-strapped shoppers, as it reported a 17.5% increase in first-half revenue driven by new store openings.
The group, which listed on the Warsaw stock market last May with a valuation of 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion), said it would continue to pursue growth while cutting the costs of doing business.
""This will enable us to offset the majority of our input inflation, allowing us to protect prices for our cost-conscious customers,"" said interim Chief Executive Trevor Masters.
He cautioned that the market Pepco operates in is likely to stay volatile in the near term, because of inflationary pressures and the conflict in Ukraine, which borders three of the company's largest operating territories.
Britain's inflation hit a 30-year high of 7% in March, with households facing the biggest cost-of-living squeeze since records began in the 1950s.
In the 19-country euro zone it surged to 7.5% in March, hitting another record, with months to go before it is set to peak.
A spokesperson for Pepco said it was working with key suppliers to secure better terms, while stock efficiency programmes were reducing required stock levels and enhancing working capital.
Pepco said revenue rose to 2.37 billion euros in the six months to March 31 as it opened a net 192 new stores, taking the total to 3,696 across 17 countries.
It said like-for-like sales growth was 5.3%, driven by growth of 12.1% in the second quarter.
The group said COVID-19 restrictions continued to impact its stores in the first half. However, by the end of that period restrictions had eased, and it exited March with a like-for-like sales growth rate of 19.4%.
Pepco said this demonstrated ""the strong underlying customer demand for the group’s offer, supporting our confidence for the second half"".
The group, which does not trade online bar a small Poundland trial, forecast first-half core earnings (EBITDA) within a range of 342 million euros to 350 million euros.
""Within this range, the group remains on track to meet guidance for the full year in the absence of any further significant deterioration in the macro environment,"" it said.
Shares in Pepco, priced at 40 zlotys at the IPO, were trading at about 44.5 zlotys.

Masters succeeded Andy Bond, who stepped down for health reasons at the end of March.

191,2022-04-22,"Several Russian banks plan to issue payment cards that use the network of China UnionPay as well as that of home-grown payment system Mir, after  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and MasterCard Inc joined other Western firms in suspending operations in Russia.
UnionPay and Mir are among few options left for Russians to make payments abroad since Russian banks were isolated from the global financial system following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
Whereas many Western nations have condemned Russia's conduct, ally China has refrained from direct criticism, effectively allowing Chinese companies such as UnionPay to continue business as usual with Russian partners.
Several Russian lenders already issue cards with UnionPay. Still, the Chinese payment service is wary of cooperating with sanctioned Russian banks for fear that could lead to itself being sanctioned, the RBC business daily reported on Wednesday, citing five unidentified people at major Russian banks.
UnionPay did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
WHAT IS UNIONPAY?
China approved the central bank's creation of UnionPay as a coalition of banking operators in 2002 to allow domestic inter-bank transactions and settlements across different platforms.
Funded by the government and China's largest commercial lenders, UnionPay clears and settles payments directly with banks and licensed lenders by issuing debit, credit and prepaid cards.
It has 87 shareholders including affiliates of the People's Bank of China, commercial lenders such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd and China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp, and rural credit providers.
It enjoyed a monopoly before China allowed foreign payment networks to set up onshore operations in 2020, and in recent years has rapidly expanded overseas.
UnionPay ranked first by number of cards in circulation worldwide as at the end of 2021 with 9.4 billion, showed data from researcher Nilson. Visa had 3.7 billion and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) 2.5 billion.
HOW HAS IT GROWN INTERNATIONALLY?
Increased Chinese tourism spurred UnionPay to build offshore ties with banks and merchants, first in Hong Kong in 2004 and United States in 2005.
In 2012, UnionPay founded overseas arm UnionPay International which has formed partnerships with over 2,500 institutions worldwide, making the card accepted in 180 territories, UnionPay's website showed.
UnionPay cards are issued in over 70 countries and regions, it said.
Its expansion has involved several European financial firms including HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) PLC, Travelex and Moneycorp. UnionPay card holders can withdraw sterling in Britain from Barclays and Travelex cash machines.
Holders of UnionPay cards issued by HSBC can also make withdrawals from that bank's cash machines in Britain.
UnionPay is fast catching up with global competitors in absolute volume processed, benefiting largely from the rising purchasing power of Chinese buyers domestically and overseas.
About 40% of global card purchase transaction volume was through Visa in 2020, but UnionPay is a close second at 32%, followed by MasterCard at 24%, Nilson data showed.
HOW BIG IS UNIONPAY IN RUSSIA?
Over 55 million merchants globally accept UnionPay cards as of March 2021. Acceptance coverage is 95% in Russia where over 1.6 million point-of-sale terminals support UnionPay QuickPass payment technology, UnionPay statements showed. More than 4 million UnionPay cards have been issued in Russia, it said.
The high penetration rate has prompted Russian banks to turn to UnionPay after Western nations imposed an array of sanctions.

National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), a UnionPay partner, publicly asked UnionPay to stop processing transactions in Russia and those involving cards issued by Russian banks and used abroad.
""We kindly ask you to make a contribution into restoring peace in Ukraine and cease your operation in the Russian Federation,"" NBU Governor Kyrylo Shevchenko said in a March 17 statement.

""The strong rebound in passenger traffic and the levels reached over the Easter holidays show that our customers are keen to resume their travels"", Chief Executive Officer Yann Leriche said in a statement.
Getlink said that the first quarter of 2022 was marked by strong organic growth and high booking levels for the summer period.
The company's January-March revenue rose 46% to 227.8 million euros ($247.03 million), as revenue generated from shuttle services and railway network grew 55% and 57%, respectively.
The traffic under the Channel has been recovering due to a gradual lifting of travel curbs, with passenger traffic jumping 154% year-on-year in January-March, and truck traffic rising 23%.
Eurostar, one of Getlink's main clients operating trains between France, Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands, saw a 1,032% rise in cross-Channel traffic in the first quarter, Getlink said.

However, the cross-Channel rail freight saw a 15% reduction in the number of trains due to the disruption of international supply chains.

Radisson, one of the world's largest hotel groups, is in the midst of a five-year plan to double its properties to 3,200 hotels in 120 countries by 2025.
""Overall, Asia plays a significant role in our business plans because of the significant presence that we can build in the future,"" Radisson CEO Federico Gonzalez told reporters.
Radisson last year signed deals to put up 200 hotels worldwide, of which 137 are in Asia-Pacific. It takes three to five years for hotel deals to reach operation stage.
Radisson sees its China and India portfolios increasing to 1,000 and 200 hotels, respectively, by 2025, Gonzalez said, adding that around 150 deals will be signed this year. But China's stringent lockdown measures could impact the completion of new hotels, he said.
Travel in Asia-Pacific is trailing the rest of the world and should expect a bumpy recovery, because of slower border reopenings, a Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG).com executive said in March.

At the end of the company's expansion programme, Asia-Pacific will account for most of Radisson's hotel rooms though much of revenues will still come from Europe.
Revenues and profits are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by next year, Gonzalez said, as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted around the world.

The stocks soared 28.8% to CNY13.91 ($2.18) by 12:42 AM ET (5:42 AM GMT), after starting trading at CNY12.96, which was above the offering price of CNY10.8. Trading in the shares was suspended after they hit the upper limit of the daily allowable price band for new listings after the SSE cited abnormal fluctuations.
The company’s Hong Kong shares (HK:0883) fell 3.23% to HK$10.8 after hitting a daily high of HK$11.64 ($1.48).
""CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) is being chased by investors who are seeking shelters in big caps with relatively low valuation and high dividends,"" First Shanghai Group chief strategist Linus Yip told Reuters.
""The stock also whets market appetite at a time when oil prices are climbing and inflation accelerating.""
China's largest offshore oil producer will use the proceeds to fund one gas and seven oilfield projects both in China and overseas, as well as replenish capital.
""CNOOC represents historic investment opportunities due to high oil prices, low valuation, and consistent high dividend yields,"" Cinda Securities analyst Chen Shuxian said in a note, adding CNOOC's market cap has the potential to double over the next few years.
The company’s debut comes amid a bleak market that saw an increasing number of stocks falling below initial public offering (IPO) prices. A third of the roughly 100 companies that have been listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen to date in 2022 dropped below offer prices on debut, according to data from East Money Information. Chipmaker Vanchip Tianjin Technology Co. Ltd. (SS:688153) and electronics firm Rigol Technologies Co. Ltd. (SS:688337) both saw their shares tumble by more than 30%.
The latest COVID-19 outbreak in China and the ensuing lockdowns, alongside heightened geopolitical tensions, also saw the main benchmark stock index tumble 18% in 2022 to date.
CNOOC’s Shanghai listing comes after it was delisted by the New York Stock Exchange in October 2021. Peers including PetroChina Co. Ltd. (SS:601857), as well as China Petroleum (NYSE:SNP) Engineering Corp. (SS:600339), are already listed in Shanghai."

For the quarter ended March 31, the South Korean automaker is expected to report a net profit of 1.37 trillion won ($1.11 billion), according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate drawn from 14 analysts, up from 1.32 trillion won a year earlier.
But analysts said the ongoing global chip shortage remains a major problem for Hyundai, which when grouped with affiliate Kia Corp is among the world's top 10 automakers by sales.
Hyundai's production could be further squeezed by shortages of other parts, those that it buys from China, where many factories have shut due to COVID-19 lockdowns, they said.
""A weak won was a key booster for Hyundai,"" said Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment Securities.
""The speed of won depreciation has been drastic enough to offset all the problems, including chip shortages, a spike in raw material prices and poor sales in Russia after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.""

Ten-year yields continued to fall, with healthy demand at a 20-year bond auction adding fuel to the rally.

203,2022-04-22,,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stock traders are losing enthusiasm over hopes of a rebound, key market data show, as policy stimulus falls short of expectation while the economy remains mired in a Covid Zero trap.   
The CSI 300 Index has erased most of its mid-March rally triggered by a sweeping set of policy promises to stabilize markets. The gauge is now just 2.2% above its March 15 close, when a historic rout pushed the benchmark to the lowest since June 2020. 
Investors who had expected authorities to ramp up monetary stimulus have since been underwhelmed, with Wednesday’s decision by Chinese banks to keep lending rates unchanged serving as the latest disappointment. Lockdowns in major cities across the country coupled with capital outflow risks as the Federal Reserve hikes rates have also dampened sentiment.

Here are three charts that highlight investor caution over China’s onshore equities market:
Falling Leverage
The amount of outstanding margin financing dropped for nine consecutive sessions on Tuesday, the longest streak of declines since January. Falling demand for leveraged trade indicates sluggish risk appetite. History suggests stock leverage demand tends to rise alongside a market rebound.
“Matters have taken a turn for the worse with the latest round of the Covid-19 resurgence that has led to lockdowns of key economic hubs,” BofA Securities Inc. strategists led by Ritesh Samadhiya wrote in a note this week. “A significant ramp up in policy easing is paramount in attaining the ‘about 5.5%’ growth target.”
Fleeing Foreigners
Overseas investors are pulling money from mainland shares as lockdowns amplify growth risks and the yuan’s weakness against the dollar falls to multi-month lows. Foreigners offloaded 45 billion yuan ($7 billion) of shares onshore through the stock connect in March, the most in two years. Net outflows amounted to 6 billion yuan so far this month through Wednesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Dwindling Trading
Daily turnover on Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges dipped below 800 billion yuan earlier this week, marking the lowest level since May last year. The slump underscores investor caution as China sticks to its strict Covid Zero approach. Decreasing trading turnover in a down-trending market could indicate a short-term bottom, at least according to past occurrences, though investors say a meaningful rebound is unlikely barring a shift in Covid policy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Delta Air Lines said on Wednesday it plans to restore flight privileges to about 2,000 customers who were barred from flights after failing to comply with mask rules.
The Biden administration on Monday said it would no longer enforce a U.S. mask mandate on public transportation and airlines after a federal judge struck down the directive as unlawful.
Atlanta-based Delta Reuters it will restore passengers ""only after each case is reviewed and each customer demonstrates an understanding of their expected behavior when flying with us. Any further disregard for the policies that keep us all safe will result in placement on Delta's permanent no-fly list.""
The change will not impact Delta's separate list of about 1,000 people ""who demonstrated egregious behavior and are already on the permanent no-fly list."" 
Delta's announcement follows a similar decision by United Airlines on Tuesday to allow some of the roughly 1,000 people who have been banned for not wearing masks to return to flights on a ""case by case basis."" Chicago-based United said those people would be allowed to return to flights ""after ensuring their commitment to follow all crewmember instructions on board.""
Delta said that of the 2,000 passengers barred over mask violations, ""any further disregard for the policies that keep us all safe will result in placement on Delta's permanent no-fly list."" The airline has urged the Justice Department to back a federal permanent no-fly list for those who exhibit egregious or violent behavior. 

The Justice Department said Wednesday it plans to appeal the order that forced the government to halt enforcement of the mask mandate.
The Federal Aviation Administration said separately on Wednesday that it plans to make a zero tolerance policy for unruly passengers adopted in January 2021 permanent.

BOSTON (Reuters) -T. Rowe Price Associates, one of the biggest investors in Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS), said it plans to back all of the department store's directors, dealing a setback to activist hedge fund Macellum Advisors as it tries to take control of the board. 
""We intend to vote FOR the 13 nominees presented by the Kohl’s board. We do not intend vote on the Macellum card,
and we will not support any of its 10 nominees,"" T. Rowe Price said in a case study about how it intends to vote. 
Investors will be able to vote at the May 11 meeting. T. Rowe Price owned 6.8 million shares or 5.29% of the company at the end of December. 
Macellum, led by Jonathan Duskin, has accused Kohl's of not doing enough to improve its business. The fund called for the company to put itself up for sale, which it is now doing by reviewing potential bidders. 
The battle for control of Kohl's boardroom has become one of this year's most contentious proxy battles and occurs as the company is reviewing bids from potential buyers. 
Last week Franchise Group (NASDAQ:FRG) Inc, owner and operator of retail stores such as The Vitamin Shoppe and Buddy's Home Furnishings, entered the bidding with a $9 billion indicative offer.

Kohl's has said that its investment bankers have held conversations with more than 20 potential buyers in the last months. 
This is also the second time in two years that Macellum has pushed for changes at Kohl's. It sought to replace nine board directors last year in a campaign conducted with hedge funds Ancora Holdings Inc and Legion Partners Asset Management LLC. The investors agreed to drop that challenge when Kohl's expanded the size of its board by three directors.

Shanghai is the main point of entry for Brazilian meat imports to mainland China, which is Brazil's top trade partner.
Last week, Reuters reported at least one shipping line operator had stopped sending Brazilian meat to Shanghai, instead offering clients the alternative of sending cargo to Xingang and Ningbo.

211,2022-04-22,,,,,,"(Reuters) -BHP Group on Thursday fell short of estimates for iron ore production for the March quarter, as a pandemic-related labour crunch weighed on the miner's efforts to boost production in the mineral-rich Pilbara region of Western Australia. 
The world's largest listed miner warned June-quarter production of the steel-making commodity is also expected to be impacted by lingering worker absenteeism, but said it remained on track to meet fiscal 2022 costs and volume forecast. 
Copper production at BHP's massive Escondida copper mine in Chile declined 9% to 226.4 thousand tonnes (kt) in the third quarter, primarily due to a reduced workforce from COVID-19 quarantine regulations and public road blockades that affected access to the site for both workers and supplies. 
Fiscal 2022 production guidance for the metal was cut to between 1,000 kt and 1,030 kt, from 1,020 and 1,080 kt.
Iron ore production from Western Australia came in at 66.7 million tonnes (Mt) for the period, flat from a year earlier but lower than a consensus estimate of 70 mt compiled by Visible Alpha.
Not until early March did Western Australia lift hard-line border restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the pandemic. The measures have left miners struggling to hire mine workers and train drivers even as pent-up demand fuelled a rally in commodity prices.
Rival Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) on Wednesday reported lower-than-expected iron ore shipments for the three months to March end and warned of risks from sustained high inflation, a resurgence of COVID-19 lockdowns in China and a prolonged Russia-Ukraine war.

BHP Chief Executive Mike Henry also said market volatility and inflationary pressures have increased further due to the Ukraine crisis. 
While conditions are expected to improve during the course of the 2023 calendar year, we anticipate the skills shortages and overall labour market tightness in Australia and Chile to continue in the period ahead, he said.

Workers United has filed petitions to represent Starbucks workers at about 200 U.S. locations, and has won about two dozen elections since December.
Starbucks in the complaints said union organizers have blocked store entrances and exits, made threats and yelled profanities during demonstrations.

The Dow ended up 0.71% , while the S&P 500 fell 0.06% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.22%.
The MSCI all-country stock index was up 0.28% firmer.

Investors got a fresh glimpse into the Federal Reserve's economic outlook on Wednesday when it issued its ""Beige Book"" of economic conditions from late February to early April. The central bank reported the economy expanded at a moderate pace during that time, though business reported issues with high inflation and worker shortages.
The Fed is expected to continue to roll out rate hikes at upcoming meetings in its bid to get a grasp on spiking inflation as several officials have struck a more hawkish tone.
San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly, typically a more dovish Fed official, said she would support getting the Fed's overnight interest rate up to about 2.5% by the end of the year, underscoring how aggressively the Fed is expected to move to combat inflation. 
""The Fed's record shows that achieving soft landings whilst attempting to rein in inflation with rate hikes of this magnitude is next to impossible. On top of this, in virtually all previous hiking cycles, inflation started at much lower levels than in this one,"" wrote  Deutsche Bank  (ETR:DBKGn) analysts in a note.
Complicating matters were signs of a slowdown in the U.S. housing market, as home sales dropped to their lowest level in nearly two years in March amid rising prices and mortgage rates.
The dollar stepped back slightly after hitting a fresh two-decade peak to the yen, buoyed as the Bank of Japan stepped into the market again to defend its ultra-low interest rate policy. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, was down 0.64% to 100.311.
Oil prices stabilized after large losses earlier in the week and another trip into negative territory on Wednesday. Oil prices have proven volatile recently as investors balance a drop in U.S. oil inventories and concerns over tighter supplies from Russia and Libya with broader concerns about economic growth.

Tesla reported quarterly revenue of $18.76 billion and so-called adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $5.02 billion. Combined with the previous three quarters' results, that surpasses milestones that trigger the vesting of the ninth through 11th of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk in his 2018 pay package. 
Musk said Wednesday there were no discussions underway about incremental compensation. 
Musk, who is also a major shareholder and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, receives no salary at Tesla. His pay package requires Tesla's market capitalization and financial growth to hit a series of escalating targets.

Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 8.4 million Tesla shares at $70.01 each, a discount of about 90% from Wednesday's closing price of $977.20. At the stock's current price, the three options tranches that will vest as a result of Tesla's March-quarter performance could generate a profit of about $23 billion, or almost $7.7 billion per tranche.
Late last year, Musk netted $16.4 billion from selling about 10% of his stake in Tesla to meet to meet tax withholding obligations related to the exercise of stock options.

216,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s satellite venture, SpaceX's Starlink network and other satellite firms on Wednesday won a combined $278.5 million in contracts from NASA to demonstrate communications in space as the U.S. space agency moves to replace its current satellite network in orbit with privately-built systems.
NASA is increasingly looking to rely on private space companies for its operations and wants to stimulate more commercial activity in areas from space communications to sending humans to orbit.
Amazon's Project Kuiper, a planned network of over 3,000 satellites built to beam broadband internet to remote regions, won $67 million, while SpaceX's Starlink venture, a larger satellite-internet network with some 2,000 satellites in space already, received $70 million.
NASA uses its current system, called the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite network, to communicate with spacecraft in orbit, such as SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule when it ferries astronauts to and from the International Space Station.
""The goal here is really to get industry to kick in with us and develop these capabilities for customers that are not just NASA, but other space-based customers as well, hopefully bringing down our costs,"" Eli Naffah, the head of NASA's Communications Services Project, told Reuters.
Each company is expected to complete development and demonstrations of their satellites under the contract by 2025, NASA said in a statement.

The other awardees include Inmarsat, SES, Telesat and  ViaSat  (NASDAQ:VSAT). Competition is fierce primarily among Elon Musk's SpaceX, Amazon and Telesat to provide broadband internet from space, a costly commercial endeavor that could generate billions in revenue once fully operational, analysts say.
Starlink, while not yet completed, has thousands of customers in various countries. Amazon, further behind, aims to launch its first two prototype satellites in late 2022.

220,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s plans to get tough on account sharing failed to reassure Wall Street that the world's largest streaming video company had found a way to spark new growth.
The company's stock was down 36% in trading Wednesday, a day after Netflix said it would ask subscribers who share their accounts with people outside of their households to pay more. It blamed password sharing, in part, for failing to hit its subscriber growth targets.
The extent of the shared accounts -- estimated at 100 million around the world, including 30 million in the United States and Canada -- was a warning sign of its own.
Media analyst Michael Nathanson wrote that the crackdown on password sharing signals Netflix thinks it's ""hitting a wall"" at 221.6 million subscribers. ""Any company with large out-year subscriber and (revenue) targets should be a bit more nervous today,"" he wrote.
Netflix Chief Operating Officer Gregory Peters on Tuesday told investors the company would not stop a subscriber sharing with a sister. ""But we're going to ask you to pay a bit more to be able to share with her and so that she gets the benefit and the value of the service, but we also get the revenue associated with that viewing.""
Netflix has been working on the issue for two years and conducting tests. In March, Netflix began charging users in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru an additional fee to share their accounts with up to two people. On Tuesday, the company said it plans to introduce the new charge for password sharing globally, within a year. 
Some analysts were skeptical.
""We don’t believe that this strategy will be the panacea that some investors have outlined over the last few years,"" said Morningstar analyst Neil Macker. ""Netflix may be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of some of the primary households, but we think that other ones will look at the new sharing fee as another pricing increase and cancel.""

Others simply scoffed at the notion that password sharing accounted for Netflix's loss of 200,000 subscribers in its first quarter and predictions that it would lose even more members in the spring.
""It seems more like an excuse for the poor performance than anything else,"" said Manuel Muhl, an analyst with DZ Bank AG. ""Password sharing has been a problem for years, this cannot be cited as a valid reason for disappointing user growth.""

(Reuters) -A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked Kentucky officials from enforcing a sweeping new abortion law that Planned Parenthood said would force abortion clinics to stop offering the procedure until they can meet certain requirements.
U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings in Louisville issued a temporary restraining order https://tmsnrt.rs/3OrRFTg at Planned Parenthood's request a week after the Republican-led legislature overrode a veto by the state's Democratic governor to enact the law.
The measure, HB 3, made Kentucky the first U.S. state without legal abortion access since the 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade established the right to end a pregnancy before the fetus is viable nationwide, abortion providers say.
Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union filed separate lawsuits challenging the law, which calls for a combination birth-death or stillbirth certificate to be issued for each abortion and bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
Jennings, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, said because the law went into effect immediately, there was not enough time for related regulations governing abortion to be written that clinics must comply with.
Those clinics included a Planned Parenthood affiliate, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, that runs one of Kentucky's two remaining abortion clinics.
""Because plaintiff cannot comply with HB 3 and thus cannot legally perform abortion services, its patients face a substantial obstacle to exercising their rights to a pre-viability abortion,"" she wrote.
Jennings said she was not at this stage considering the constitutionality of the law's requirements and would consider at a hearing on whether to grant a preliminary injunction whether any parts could be complied with.
""This is a win, but it is only the first step,"" Rebecca Gibron, the Planned Parenthood affiliate's chief executive, said in a statement.
A spokesperson for Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican, did not respond to a request for comment.
Republican-led states this year have been rapidly passing anti-abortion legislation in anticipation that the U.S. Supreme Court will back a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi this spring.
The U.S. Supreme Court now has a 6-3 conservative majority and appeared open to rolling back or overturning Roe v. Wade during case arguments in December.
While only in effect for eight days, abortion rights advocates say the Kentucky law caused significant disruptions for women seeking abortions.

The Kentucky Health Justice Network, which provides financial assistance to patients seeking abortions, facilitated patients' travel to Indiana and Ohio to terminate pregnancies in the last week, said operations director Ashley Jacobs.
""I am kind of shocked,"" she said of the ruling. ""It wasn't expected that this judge would be friendly to the injunction.""

(Reuters) -Thirteen unnamed sexual abuse survivors of Larry Nassar are seeking $130 million from the FBI over allegations that it botched the investigation into the former USA Gymnastics doctor, their lawyers said on Thursday.
The individuals say they suffered further abuse as a result of the FBI's failure to properly investigate Nassar after being made aware of some of the accusations against him. Each is submitting an administrative tort claim.
""This is the largest failure on the part of law enforcement in the history of the world as it pertains to the protection of children, and there must be institutional accountability to make sure this doesn’t happen again,"" attorney Jamie White said in a statement.
The FBI responded to a request for comment by referring Reuters to remarks https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/dereliction-of-duty-examining-the-inspector-generals-report-on-the-fbis-handling-of-the-larry-nassar-investigation-091521 made by Director Christopher Wray before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in September.
The U.S. Justice Department's internal watchdog said in July that the FBI dragged its feet in probing sexual abuse allegations against Nassar, who was sentenced in 2018 to up to 175 years in prison for abusing young female gymnasts in his care.
It also accused two FBI officials of lying to cover up ""numerous and fundamental errors"" that allowed Nassar's abuse to continue.
McKayla Maroney, a member of the Olympic gold medal-winning London 2012 team, told the Senate Judiciary Committee in September that she spent three hours on the phone with the FBI in 2015 detailing her story, but that the law enforcement agency failed to document it for a year and a half and misrepresented her remarks.
Attorneys for the 13 individuals said the tort claims could be a precursor to a civil lawsuit and that the FBI has six months to respond.

""No one should have been assaulted after the summer of 2015, because the FBI should have done its job,"" Grace French, a Nassar survivor and founder of advocacy group The Army of Survivors, said in a statement. 
""To know that the FBI could have helped to avoid this trauma disgusts me,"" she said.

224,2022-04-22,"The port city of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, reduced to a wasteland littered with bodies by nearly two months of siege and bombardment that Ukraine says killed tens of thousands of civilians, is a big strategic prize for Russia.
President Vladimir Putin on Thursday declared the city ""liberated"" after nearly two months of siege, despite leaving hundreds of defenders still holed up inside the giant Azovstal steel works.
Here is why the city matters so much:
STRATEGIC LOCATION
Mariupol, home to more than 400,000 people before the war, is the biggest Ukrainian city on the Sea of Azov and the main port serving the industries and agriculture of eastern Ukraine. It is also the site of some of Ukraine's biggest metals plants.
On the eve of the war, it was the biggest city still held by Ukrainian authorities in Luhansk or Donetsk, the two eastern provinces known as the Donbas that Moscow has demanded Ukraine cede to pro-Russian separatists.
Control of Mariupol means Russia commands the entire coastline of the Sea of Azov, and has a secure overland route linking the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, with mainland Russia and the parts of eastern Ukraine held by separatists.
It links up two of the main axes of Russia's invasion, and frees Russian forces to join the main offensive being waged against the bulk of Ukraine's army in the east.
Control of Mariupol could also give Russia a stronger position to negotiate at any peace talks.
AZOV BATTALION
Prominent among the Ukrainian forces that have defended Mariupol is the Azov Battalion, a nationalist militia started by far-right volunteers after Russian-backed separatists took control of parts of the eastern Donbas region in 2014.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Putin on Thursday that Mariupol had symbolic importance because it was what he called the de facto headquarters of the Azov Battalion.
Russia has said the destruction of that group is one of its main war aims as it tries to ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv says the unit has been reformed and incorporated into the National Guard",,,,,
225,2022-04-22,,,,,,"seek to challenge, and in certain instances, seek to tear down and even destroy,"" he said, referring to the People's Republic of China.
Analysts note that this is the first time China has argued for ""indivisible security"" outside the context of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, with implications on U.S. actions in Asia.
""If China deems actions by U.S. and its allies on Taiwan or the South China Sea as disregarding its security concerns, it could evoke the concept of 'indivisible security' to claim the moral high ground in retaliation,"" said Li Mingjiang, associate professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.
Xi also reiterated China's opposition to unilateral sanctions and ""long-arm jurisdiction"", without directly mentioning the West's punitive actions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
China has repeatedly criticised Western sanctions, including those against Russia, but it has also been careful not to provide assistance to Moscow that could lead to sanctions being imposed on Beijing.
Xi said efforts are needed to stabilise global supply chains, but also said China's economy is resilient and that its long-term trend had not changed.

Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Xi's speech was likely an attempt to project existing elements of Beijing's foreign policy as solutions to current global instability.
""I don't see how new architecture could be built around this, so I think instead this is an attempt to weave China's world view into the fabric of international security discourse,"" Blanchette said.

226,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Republicans in Florida's House on Thursday approved a new congressional map backed by Governor Ron DeSantis that gives the party a major advantage in November's elections while eliminating two majority-Black districts.
After passage by the state Senate on Wednesday, the new district boundaries only await DeSantis' signature to go into effect. 
The House vote came soon after Black lawmakers disrupted the proceedings by staging a sit-in protest. During debate on the proposed map, Black Democrats joined by white colleagues sat on the floor and sang the civil rights anthem ""We Shall Overcome,"" forcing the Republican House Speaker Chris Sprowls to call a recess.
""We cannot allow the elimination of Black representation. This is a direct attack on democracy,"" said Representative Angie Nixon, a Democrat, as she live-streamed the protest while wearing a T-shirt that read ""Stop the Black Attack.""
Several Republicans attacked Democrats, whom they said were obstructing legislative business.
""I hope the insurrection on the House Floor is dealt with appropriately. #LockThemUp,"" Republican Representative Randy Fine wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Republicans eventually returned to the floor and approved the map on a 68-38 party-line vote even as Democrats shouted objections. 
Voting rights groups are expected to challenge the map in court as an illegal racial and partisan gerrymander after DeSantis signs it into law.
The governor, who is seen as a top Republican contender for the 2024 presidential campaign, had previously vetoed a map drawn by Republican lawmakers and ordered the legislature into special session this week to consider his administration's proposal.
With all but two other states finished with the once-a-decade redistricting process, the outcome in Florida could play a major role in determining control of Congress.

DeSantis' map would likely give Republicans 20 of the state's 28 districts, four more than they currently hold. Republicans need to flip five seats nationally to take the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, which would allow them to block much of Democratic President Joe Biden's agenda.
Advocates have said the plan violates the law by reducing the number of Black districts from four to two. DeSantis has argued that the map is ""race neutral"" and that the current map is racially gerrymandered in an unconstitutional way.

227,2022-04-22,,,,,,"Macron in a Paris suburb with a strong left-wing vote, and Le Pen in the north of the country where she has a loyal following.
""Why wait for Macron to step down when, by using your vote, you can fire him?"" Le Pen told a rally in the town of Arras in which she urged a ""silent majority"" opposed to Macron not to facilitate his victory by abstaining.
The latest polls suggested the incumbent was gaining momentum: Three separate surveys all including responses gathered on Thursday after the TV debate showed Macron's score either stable or slightly rising to reach between 55.5% and 57.5%. 
But they also put the turnout rate at between 72% and 74%, which would be the lowest for a presidential run-off since 1969.
Viewers of Wednesday's televised encounter between the two final candidates deemed Macron prone to bouts of high-handedness with Le Pen but also found him more convincing and fit to be president, a separate Elabe poll for BFM TV showed.
Le Pen, who focused on expressing empathy with people she said had ""suffered"" since Macron beat her in 2017, was judged slightly more in tune with voters' concerns but her far-right views were still considered much more worrying, the poll showed.
""Did she give the impression she is ready to govern?"" Le Parisien said in an editorial on Thursday. ""Judging by the debate, she did not dispel that doubt.""
Other analysts said the debate should be taken with a pinch of salt as only 15.5 million people tuned in to watch it, the smallest audience ever recorded for such an event. 
STARK CHOICES
The centrist, former merchant banker Macron is a staunch supporter of the European Union and the kind of internationalism which has in recent years suffered setbacks from events such as Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president.
Le Pen says he embodies an elitism that has failed ordinary people. Her policies include a ban on Muslim headscarves in public, giving French nationals priority on jobs and benefits, and limiting Europe's rules on cross-border travel.
Macron on Thursday sought to win new supporters in a photo opportunity at a boxing club in the Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis: a key target for both candidates which voted heavily for hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon in the first round.
""Things are not changing quickly enough,"" he acknowledged to a gathering of locals there, promising to put more resources into housing, security, education and job opportunities for underprivileged communities. 
It is unclear whether the last two days of campaigning will change any votes. Macron's lead in polls is currently narrower than five years ago, when he beat Le Pen with 66.1% of the vote. 
""Recent history is littered with shock election results, so it would be naive to think that Le Pen cannot deliver a surprise win,"" said Dean Turner, chief eurozone and UK economist at UBS Global Wealth Management's Chief Investment Office.
The premium investors demand to hold French bonds over their German equivalent was largely stable on Thursday following the debate, suggesting they are sanguine about Sunday's vote.
Whoever wins on Sunday will only have done so after a bitter campaign which could bode ill for their capacity to win a parliamentary majority in June and implement reforms.

If Macron wins, he could face a difficult second term, with voters of all stripes likely to take to the streets again over his plan to continue his pro-business reforms.
If Le Pen wins, radical changes to France's domestic and international policies would be expected, and street protests could start immediately.

(Reuters) -Like Batman forming the Justice League of superheroes, or Iron Man helping assemble the Avengers, comic book editor Scott Dunbier needed to put together a team of stars.
The call went out and Dunbier quickly signed up the biggest names in the U.S. comic book industry to collaborate on a special anthology to raise money for Ukrainian war refugees.
The result is ""Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds,"" a 96-page book produced by the best writers, artists, colorists, letterers, designers and editors that Dunbier could find.
Proceeds, estimated to reach $200,000 to $500,000, will go to Operation USA, a Los Angeles-based disaster relief agency raising money for Ukrainian war refugees. Over five million Ukrainians have fled abroad since Russia invaded on Feb. 24.
By Thursday, three days after launching, it had raised $78,000 on the Zoop crowdfunding site https://zoop.gg/c/comicsforukraine. The publication date remains uncertain, depending on how much is raised through pre-orders after a month, Dunbier said.
As many comic books do, the Ukraine project has an origin story.
""It was basically me being glued to my TV watching the horror, the atrocities unfold, and just feeling like I had to do something. And, you know, then it clicked. I thought in some small way, maybe this would help,"" Dunbier said.
The project makes no pretense of being unbiased, depicting Ukraine as David confronting the Russian Goliath.
Russia calls its incursion a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine. 
The front of the hardcover edition, selling for $60, was painted by Alex Ross, one of the industry's best-known cover artists, with a blue-and-yellow-clad Ukrainian standing up to a faceless giant brandishing a hammer and sickle.
Three different soft covers, on sale for $40 each, were designed by three other heavy hitters: Arthur Adams, Dave Johnson and Bill Sienkiewicz.
""If I can put my finger in the eye of an authoritarian, or step on the bully, and trip them, I love that kind of stuff,"" Sienkiewicz said. ""I despise Putin.""
His cover shows a Ukrainian wielding a shield and a sword before a giant bear, nose bloodied, who is surprised to meet resistance. The sword has impaled a teddy bear resembling Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Others donating work include Brent Anderson, Sergio Aragones, June Brigman, Kurt Busiek, Howard Chaykin, Joshua Dysart, Mark Evanier, Emil Ferris, Dave Gibbons, Rob Guillory, John Layman, Gabriel Rodriguez, Stan Sakai, Louise Simonson, Walter Simonson, Chris Sprouse, Jill Thompson, Matt Wagner and Mark Waid.

While some of the stories are set in Ukraine, others are allegorical.
Sakai is creator of the Usagi Yojimbo comic, about a rabbit warrior set in feudal Japan. His story depicts villagers being run off by an evil warlord, Dunbier said.

""We'll learn about that in the next day or so, to be taken up as soon as we can next week,"" she told reporters at a photo opportunity with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal before a bipartisan meeting at the Capitol about the needs of Ukraine.
Support for Ukraine is one of the few areas of agreement between Biden's fellow Democrats and Republicans. Previous aid packages for Ukraine, including $13.6 billion approved last month, have passed nearly unanimously in the Democratic-controlled Congress.
Biden, who announced an additional $800 million in military assistance for Ukraine on Thursday, said the amount of additional help in the upcoming request was still being decided.
""I think it will be met with strong bipartisan support,"" Republican Senator Thom Tillis told reporters on a conference call from Kosovo, part of a bipartisan trip to Europe that also included stops in Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Belgium.

""If you take a look at what President Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian army and the population as a whole have done, we owe them a debt of gratitude and one way we can pay it back is to make sure that we provide strong bipartisan support for additional funding,"" Tillis said.
Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Europe subcommittee, also thought Congress would act quickly. ""I believe there is strong bipartisan support to do everything we can to support the Ukrainians in this unprovoked war against Russia,"" she said.

During the 2020–21 school year, vaccination coverage among kindergartners nationwide for three required vaccines was approximately 1% lower than the previous school year, according to the study conducted by researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
""As schools return to in-person learning, high vaccination coverage is necessary to continue protecting students from vaccine-preventable diseases,"" the study's authors said. 
The researchers looked at coverage for three commonly required vaccines: the MMR vaccine to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella; DTaP, which prevents diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis; and the varicella shot for chickenpox.
Coverage for all three vaccines decreased in a majority of states to about 94%, just under the target of 95%, the CDC said.

""But it amounts to at least 35,000 more children across the United States that entered kindergarten without documentation of complete vaccination against common diseases like measles, whooping cough, and chickenpox.” 

The study included data collected for the 2020–21 school year by state and local immunization programs in 47 states and the District of Columbia.
The study authors noted some limitations to their data, including variations in states' vaccine requirements and documentation processes, non-inclusion of three states and barriers created by the pandemic, such as the shift to virtual learning.

231,2022-04-22,"a process another official said could take a week to complete. 
Facing pressure from lawmakers and refugee advocates, President Joe Biden's administration said last month the United States would accept up to 100,000 Ukrainians.
About 5 million people have fled Ukraine, mostly for neighboring countries, since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. While most Ukrainians will want to remain in Europe, the Biden administration says, the new initiative will make it easier for those with family or other sponsors in the United States to travel there.
""This program will be fast, it will be streamlined, and will ensure the United States honors its commitment (to) the people of Ukraine,"" Biden said during remarks at the White House.
Any person outside the United States can already apply for humanitarian parole but must demonstrate an urgent reason to be allowed to enter the country or that their entry will significantly benefit the United States. 
More than 350 Ukrainians have already sought humanitarian parole to enter the United States since the start of the conflict through early April, Reuters reported this month.
The new program set to begin on Monday will require U.S. sponsors to apply on behalf of Ukrainians and will offer an accelerated process, one of the officials said on Thursday. Approved Ukrainians will be eligible for work permits, DHS said.
In addition to humanitarian parole, Biden aims to improve access to other pathways for Ukrainians to enter the United States, including the U.S. refugee resettlement program and existing visa avenues.
The effort to bring up to 100,000 Ukrainians to the United States could stretch beyond the current fiscal year ending on Sept. 30, the administration has said.
While thousands of Ukrainians have entered the United States via the border with Mexico and some on legal visas, only 12 Ukrainians came through the U.S. refugee program in March.
Ukrainians in Europe should apply to the new parole program from there and not travel to Mexico to enter the United States, DHS said.

About 3,300 Ukrainians were encountered by U.S. southern border authorities in March, according to U.S. government data.
The number of Ukrainians attempting to enter at the border rose sharply in April, according to internal U.S. government figures reviewed by Reuters, with an average of about 1,000 per day arriving from April 10-16.

232,2022-04-22,,,,,,"A lawyer for Alec Baldwin said on Thursday that an investigation by New Mexico has cleared his client of wrongdoing in the fatal shooting on the set of ""Rust,"" pointing out that its report stated the actor believed his gun held only dummy rounds.
New Mexico's Occupational Health and Safety Bureau on Wednesday released the findings of a six-month investigation of the shooting during the filming of the Western movie last October. It blasted Rust Movie Productions LLC for ""willful"" safety lapses leading to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and fined the company $137,000, the maximum amount possible.
In response to the findings, Baldwin's attorneys said in a statement that his authority on the production was limited to approving script changes and creative casting and that he had no authority over matters that were subject to the investigation. 
""We appreciate that the report exonerates Mr. Baldwin by making clear that he believed the gun held only dummy rounds,"" the statement posted on Baldwin's Instagram account said. ""We are pleased that the New Mexico officials have clarified these critical issues.""
The agency was not immediately available to comment on the statement. 
Hutchins was killed during a rehearsal when a revolver that Baldwin was holding fired a live round that passed through her and struck the movie's director Joel Souza in the shoulder, wounding him.
The investigation found the production firm had been aware that firearm safety procedures were not being followed and demonstrated ""plain indifference"" to the hazards, the New Mexico Environment Department said in a statement. 
Rust Movie Productions spokesman Stefan Friedman said in a statement on Wednesday that the company disagreed with the findings and planned to appeal. 
The probe found that Rust management ignored concerns raised by crew members about firearm and pyrotechnics misfires on set. 

The report said Rust management failed to give staff responsible for firearms safety sufficient time to inspect ammunition received to ensure no live rounds were present.
The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office and the Santa Fe County District Attorney have ongoing criminal investigations into the death of the cinematographer.

234,2022-04-22,,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) -Queen Elizabeth celebrated her 96th birthday at her Sandringham estate on Thursday as gun salutes rang out across London and Windsor and military bands played ""Happy Birthday"".
Britain's longest serving monarch, who celebrates a historic platinum jubilee this year, was pictured with two white ponies in a photo released for the occasion.
Government ministers joined members of the royal family in sending their best wishes to the queen, who has stepped back from most public duties this year over concerns about her health. 
She has travelled from Windsor Castle, west of London, to spend her birthday at her estate in Sandringham, Norfolk.
""An inspiration to so many across the UK, the Commonwealth and the world, it's particularly special to be celebrating in this Platinum Jubilee year,"" her grandson Prince William and his wife Kate said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is visiting India, wished the queen a happy birthday and paid a ""heartfelt tribute"" to her ""70 years of dedicated and faultless service to our country and the Commonwealth"" in a video message.
Toymaker Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) launched a commemorative Barbie doll of the queen dressed in an ivory gown with a blue sash and wearing her wedding tiara to mark the jubilee.
Elizabeth became the queen of Britain and more than a dozen other realms including Canada, Australia and New Zealand on the death of her father King George VI on Feb. 6, 1952, while she was in Kenya on an international tour.
The news was broken to her by her husband Prince Philip, who died last year aged 99 after more than seven decades by her side.
When she ascended the throne, Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong and Harry Truman were running the Soviet Union, China and the United States, respectively, while Winston Churchill was British prime minister.

Elizabeth has largely avoided the public spotlight after spending a night in hospital in October for an unspecified ailment and being ordered to rest. She tested positive for COVID-19 in February and has said she was left very tired.
She has missed events including the Remembrance Sunday gathering and Easter service, but she joined other members of her family and dignitaries at a memorial service for her husband at London's Westminster abbey last month.

236,2022-04-22,,,,,,"India's Supreme Court will soon rule on whether the demolition of shops in a residential area on the outskirts of New Delhi is legal but, for Mohammed Akbar, whatever decision it makes will come too late.
Authorities say they want to remove illegal stores in Jahangirpuri, where clashes broke out between Muslims and Hindus over the weekend near a mosque and temple in which several people, including police officers, were injured.
As the bulldozers moved in on Wednesday, India's highest court intervened to stop them, but not before Akbar's shop selling cigarettes and cold drinks was destroyed.
""They took my only source of earning. How will I feed my children?"" the father-of-three asked. ""I have loans to pay and how will I pay for clothes for children for Eid?"" added Akbar, whose daily earnings are less than $5.
He, along with some other Muslims in the area, suspect that authorities are punishing those they blame for recent communal violence. Akbar, who said he was not involved in the clashes, has had his small shop in Jahangirpuri for the past 20 years.
Residents said fighting broke out on Saturday when a crowd of Hindu worshippers, some carrying sticks and knives, moved through the area during a Hindu religious festival. At least 20 people were arrested. 
Similar clashes in other parts of India have been followed by demolition drives, which critics say are an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to intimidate India's 200 million Muslims.
Vinit Goenka, a BJP spokesman, said the demolitions were not related to religion or retribution.
""Indian criminal procedure code deals with rioters and municipal law deals with illegal structures and illegal construction,"" he said, when asked about the criticism. ""When implementing the law, name and religion is never asked.""
Goenka added that people who attacked peaceful celebrations should be punished.
""A message has to be sent to rioters as prescribed in law, irrespective of his language, community, religion or belief.""
The Commissioner of Municipal Corporation of Delhi responsible for overseeing the demolitions, which target buildings that authorities say encroach on to roads and pathways, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
'JUSTICE FOR ALL'
Hundreds of police in riot gear armed with batons, guns and tear gas canisters were deployed on Wednesday morning in the area before the drive to remove illegal structures.
After intervening on Wednesday, the country's top court on Thursday asked authorities to halt demolitions until further notice. The Jahangirpuri case will be heard in two weeks.
Home to scores of low-income families, some residents of the area in northwest Delhi complained that the heavy security presence made it hard for them to worship freely during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
""We have been locked in our alleys for the past four days. In the month of Ramadan police have restricted our movement. We cannot even go to pray,"" Mohammed Ishtiyaq shouted from a locked gate in an residential alley besides the main mosque.
Marginalized members of India's Hindu majority and Muslim minority live in close quarters along the narrow alleys of Jahangirpuri. Around a dozen shops were flattened before the court's intervention, of which one was Hindu-owned.
The area was peaceful during riots that swept parts of India in 2019 and 2020, in the country's worst communal clashes in decades over Modi's new citizenship law that Muslims said discriminated against them.
Now residents fear those tensions have reached them.

An imam, who declined to be named, said the mosque where he worked had been damaged during the clearance operation.
""Justice should be equal for all, they have broken parts of the mosque and not touched the mandir,"" he said through the mosque's gate, referring to the nearby Hindu temple.

240,2022-04-22,,,,,,"U.S. President Joe Biden will unveil a new strategy for dealing with drug addiction and overdoses on Thursday that aims to expand access to medications for opioid overdoses, increase funding for law enforcement, and expand sanctions against traffickers.
The Biden administration is keen to show it is taking action on a worsening U.S. opioid crisis, which fueled more than an estimated 106,854 drug overdose deaths in the year to November 2021, a 15.6% increase from the same period a year earlier, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.
""That's an American life lost every five minutes around the clock,"" said Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of National Drug Control Policy at the White House.
""For too many years, the overdose crisis has been unraveling the very social fabric of our nation and destroying American lives and livelihoods,"" Gupta told reporters on a press call.
The National Drug Control Strategy, which Biden will send to Congress on Thursday, seeks to double treatment admissions for populations that are most at risk of overdose deaths and ensure universal access to medications for opioid use disorder by 2025.
Currently, key tools like naloxone, a medication that can reverse opioid overdoses, and syringe service programs are often restricted or underfunded. There are legal barriers limiting access to naloxone in some states, and even in others the drug is not always available to those most at risk of an overdose.
Patients are more likely to receive a naloxone prescription if they had a prior diagnosis of opioid misuse or dependence along with an overdose compared with individuals who had those diagnoses without an overdose.

The administration also aims to triple the number of drug traffickers it sanctions and increase border security, said Gupta. Biden in December signed two executive orders aimed at fighting drug trafficking and criminal networks.
One order allowed for new sanctions on Chinese companies trading ingredients of the opioid drug fentanyl and on criminal gangs in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A security scare at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday prompted evacuation of Congress after a small airplane from the U.S. Army's Golden Knights parachute demonstration team flew over a baseball game, police said.
House speaker Nancy Pelosi called the alarm an ""outrageous and frightening mistake"" by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for its failure to alert Capitol Police to the pre-planned performance over the Washington Nationals baseball stadium.
She said Congress would examine the results of a review into the incident to determine what went wrong.
The U.S. Capitol Police first said they were tracking an aircraft that posed a ""probable threat"" to the Capitol complex, and then minutes later said there was no threat and that the building had been evacuated out of an abundance of caution. 
Police later said the plane was a military aircraft carrying members of the U.S. Army's Golden Knights parachute demonstration team. The FAA did not notify police in advance about the approved military flight for military appreciation night at Nationals Stadium, Capitol police told congressional staff in a letter.
The FAA said late Wednesday it would ""conduct a thorough and expeditious review of the events this evening and share updates. We know our actions affect others, especially in our nation's capital region, and we must communicate early and often with our law enforcement partners.""
The FAA statement did not say whether the agency had alerted Capitol Police to the flight, which took off from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.
The Golden Knights parachuted into the Washington Nationals' baseball stadium, Nationals Park, a little over a mile away from the U.S. Capitol, before returning to the Maryland base.
""The unnecessary panic caused by this apparent negligence was particularly harmful for members, staff and institutional workers still grappling with the trauma of the attack on their workplace on January 6th,"" Pelosi said in a statement late on Wednesday, referring to the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

""Congress looks forward to reviewing the results of a thorough after-action review that determines what precisely went wrong today and who at the Federal Aviation Administration will be held accountable for this outrageous and frightening mistake,"" Pelosi said.

(Reuters) -South Carolina's Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily halted the execution of a condemned man planned for next week that would have been the first firing-squad execution in the United States in more than a decade.
Richard Moore, 57, was convicted in 2001 of murdering a store clerk in a 1999 robbery. The jury voted to recommend he be sentenced to death.
South Carolina's highest court agreed to Moore's request to stay his execution date, set earlier this month for April 29, because of his ongoing legal challenges to his sentence and to the Southern state's execution methods.
The court's order, which was signed by all five justices, did not state the grounds for the stay, but said ""a more detailed order"" would soon follow. A spokesperson for the state's Department of Corrections said the department was awaiting the fuller order before commenting.
Several state governments and the federal government have struggled in recent years to obtain lethal-injection drugs, in part because pharmaceutical companies generally forbid the sale of their medicines for use in executions. 
As a result, execution officials have had to substitute those specific drugs with more easily obtained ones or revive older execution methods, such as gas asphyxiation or the electric chair. The new or revised execution protocols have drawn an array of legal challenges from people on death rows across the country, bolstered by a number of ghastly ""botched"" executions by lethal injection. 
Moore and other death row inmates who are suing the South Carolina Department of Corrections in a lower-level state court say the execution methods available to them violate the South Carolina constitution, which forbids cruel or unusual punishments. Unlike the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment, the state's constitution explicitly forbids corporal punishment.
South Carolina last carried out an execution in 2011, using lethal injection. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican, signed a law in 2021 making electrocution the state's main method of execution, and added a firing squad as an option.
Earlier this month, the Department of Corrections asked Moore to choose either to be killed by electric chair or by a firing squad after telling him that execution officials were unable to secure lethal-injection drugs.
Last week, Moore chose a firing squad, a method that has been used only three times in the United States since 1950, and is viewed by some as a quicker, more painless and less easily botched death, if harder for witnesses to watch.
Those three firing squad executions were all carried out by the state of Utah -- in 1977, 1996 and 2010 -- according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.
""I do not believe or concede that either the firing squad or electrocution is legal or constitutional,"" Moore said in a statement informing the Department of Corrections of his choice. He said that if he refused to make a choice, the department had said it would default to the electric chair.

Lindsey Vann, a lawyer for Moore, said she was glad the state Supreme Court was ""allowing for more time"" for Moore's cases to be reviewed.
Moore also sought the stay to allow him to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to find the death penalty excessive in his case. His lawyers have argued that because he entered the store unarmed and used the clerk's own gun after grabbing it in a scuffle, that the murder was not premeditated.

246,2022-04-22,"President Joe Biden convened U.S. military leaders on Wednesday in an annual White House gathering taking on special significance as the war in Ukraine enters a risky new phase and Washington plans more weapons assistance.
A ""variety of topics"" were set to be discussed by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and senior military leaders, a National Security Council spokesperson said. The event includes a formal West Wing meeting as well as a dinner in the president's residence with leaders' spouses afterward. 
While the annual military policy meeting rarely makes news, weighty issues are on the agenda this year, topped by a conflict in Ukraine that officials fear could imperil European security for years to come. 
Russia has said it has entered a new stage of its operation and is methodically seeking to ""liberate"" the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Western allies anticipate Russia's campaign could last many months, grind to a stalemate and test the battlefield capabilities of Ukrainian fighters.
Opening the meeting, Biden touted the toughness of the Ukrainian military and said that NATO's unity has shocked Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""They're tougher and more proud than I thought; I'm amazed what they're doing with your help,"" Biden said. ""I don't think that Putin counted on it being able to hold us together.""
The United States is expected to announce another military aid package for Ukraine in coming days that could match the $800 million pledged last week.
Russia says it launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24 to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext. 
U.S. forces are not fighting in Ukraine but are indirectly engaged, arming, training and financing Kyiv's forces. 
A lengthy clash could also test U.S. public support for Washington's backing of Ukraine. Last month, Biden asked Congress for record peacetime spending on the military for the upcoming fiscal year.

The meeting comes amid questions about the future of NATO forces in Europe, including whether to install a permanent presence on the defense alliance's eastern border with Russia.
During a brief portion of the meeting open to reporters, Biden also expressed pride that women represented three of the senior officials included in the gathering.

247,2022-04-22,"Ukraine proposed talks with Moscow over evacuating troops and civilians from Mariupol after a Russian surrender-or-die ultimatum expired on Wednesday, leaving many trapped at a steel plant, the last main stronghold of resistance. 
A few dozen civilians managed to leave the strategically important southeastern port in a small bus convoy, according to Reuters witnesses, escaping the fiercest battle of the nearly eight-week-long war.
A Ukrainian marine commander, Serhiy Volny, said fighters there may not be able to hold out for much longer. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said an estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering at the steel works. 
Ukraine is ready for a ""special round of negotiations"" with no conditions ""to save our guys, (the far right) Azov (battalion), military, civilians, children, the living and the wounded,"" negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted.
Fighters remain holed up in the plant and have ignored an ultimatum by Russia to surrender. David Arakhamia, a second negotiator, said in an online post that he and Podolyak were in constant contact with Ukrainian forces in the city.
""Today, in a conversation with the city defenders, a proposal was put forward to hold direct negotiations, on site, on the evacuation of our military garrison,"" he said. ""For our part, we are ready to arrive for such negotiations at any time as soon as we receive confirmation from the Russian side.""
Fewer civilians than hoped left on Wednesday, according to the authorities. 
Over five million Ukrainians have fled abroad since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945. Russia has yet to capture any major cities.
Ukraine said it had so far held off an assault by thousands of Russian troops attempting to advance in what Kyiv calls the Battle of the Donbas, a new campaign to seize two eastern provinces Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.
Russia's forces had carried out strikes on dozens of military facilities in eastern Ukraine and had shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter near the village of Koroviy Yar, its defence ministry said. 
On Wednesday, Russia conducted a first test launch of its Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, a new and long-awaited addition to its nuclear arsenal.
""This truly unique weapon will ... provide food for thought for those who, in the heat of frenzied aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country,"" President Vladimir Putin said. 
Russia calls its incursion a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext.
The West has responded with a slew of sanctions.
The United States on Wednesday imposed restrictions on dozens of people and entities, including a commercial bank and a virtual currency mining company, targeting the evasion of existing rules. 
BILLOWING CLOUDS OF SMOKE
Mariupol, once a prosperous city of 400,000, is now a wasteland where corpses lie in the streets and Russia was hitting the Azovstal steel plant with bunker-buster bombs, the government in Kyiv said.
Large black clouds of smoke billowed from there on Wednesday as evacuees queued to get onto buses, some clutching luggage or carrying small pets in their arms.
Pensioner Tamara, 64, said she was going to stay with her sister in Zaporizhzhia. She was leaving the city with her husband, daughter, son-in-law and grandson.
""It is a pleasure ... to leave after this nightmare. We lived in basements for 30 days,"" she said tearfully. 
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk accused Russian forces of failing to observe a local ceasefire agreement long enough to allow large numbers of people to leave.
Russia did not immediately respond to the allegation.
It denies targeting civilians and has blamed Ukraine for the failure of earlier attempts to organise humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol.
The deputy commander of the Azov Regiment in Mariupol, Svyatoslav Kalamar, said several bunkers under the plant still held about 80-100 civilians each.
Just five people in Mariupol had surrendered following Moscow's 2 p.m. (1100 GMT) surrender-or-die ultimatum, Russian-backed separatists said. 
Ukraine has proposed swapping Russian prisoners of war in exchange for safe passage for trapped civilians and soldiers. 
If Russia captured Mariupol it would link territory held by pro-Russian separatists in the east with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014.
Moscow was forced to retreat from northern Ukraine after an assault on Kyiv was repelled last month, but has poured troops back in for an assault on the east that began this week.
Putin says Ukraine mistreated Russian speakers in the Donbas, an accusation Kyiv dismisses as false.
Russia was focusing on advancing towards the strategically important Donbas city of Sloviansk, but ""so far they are not succeeding"", Ukrainian presidential advisor Oleksiy Arestovych said. 
PEACE TALKS ELUSIVE
Meanwhile, peace negotiations have stalled. 
The Kremlin accused Kyiv on Wednesday of delaying the talks and changing its positions. Kyiv accuses Moscow of blocking talks by refusing humanitarian ceasefires.
The head of Ukraine's Orthodox Church asked clergy and the faithful to forgo services on Easter Saturday night in areas affected by fighting, fearing the Russian bombardments will continue without respite.

U.S. President Joe Biden was convening top U.S. military leaders on Wednesday in an annual White House gathering that takes on special significance as the war in Ukraine enters a new phase and Washington plans more military aid.
Charles Michel, head of the European Council that groups the 27 EU member states, met Zelenskiy in Kyiv in a show of solidarity.
