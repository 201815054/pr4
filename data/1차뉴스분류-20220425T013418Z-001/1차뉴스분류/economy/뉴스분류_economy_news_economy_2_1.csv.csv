The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) called for giving more prominence to openness and transparency, and deepening reforms to the registration system for bond issuance, the summary of the Commission's 2022 Bond Supervision Work Conference held on Friday said.
The summary did not provide details on specific steps the Commission plans to take.
The CSRC will improve regulatory mechanisms, and better serve the development of the real economy and the implementation of national strategies, the summary said.
China's current internal and external environment is complex and severe, but the country's stable economic progress and its long-term development trend has not changed, the CSRC said.

Fitch Ratings said in late January that it expected China's corporate bond default rate to rise in 2022, pushed up by privately owned property developers.
Chinese developers have been squeezed by a sweeping regulatory crackdown that has reined in the most free-wheeling segments of the private sector economy.

1,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 11:40PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Major investment banks have penciled in a strong run of interest rate hikes for 2022 after hotter-than-expected inflation data ramped up pressure on the Federal Reserve to take a firmer stand against soaring prices. 
Data last week showed U.S. consumer prices rose at their fastest pace since the early 1980s, fuelling market speculation for a hefty 50-basis-point hike from the Fed's March 15-16 meeting.
The current Fed fund effective target is 0-0.25%.
As the Fed gets set to raise pandemic-era rates, here are the estimates from major global investment banks on how far and fast rates will rise:
* JP Morgan raises its Fed call to seven 25-bp rate hikes from five previously, for a total of 175 bps of tightening this year.
*  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) now expects the Fed to deliver six 25-bp hikes this year. It had previously forecast 125 bps of tightening via four 25-bp hikes plus a 25-bp fed funds equivalent runoff of the Fed's balance sheet. 
* UBS now expects 150 bps of tightening this year via six consecutive quarter-point moves from March through November. It had previously forecast 25-bp increases in March and June, then ""a potential shift toward an every meeting hike pace"". 
* BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) expects six hikes of 25 bps this year starting in March, resulting in a cumulative 150 bps of tightening. 
* Citi now expects 150 bps of tightening this year, starting with a 50-bp move in March, followed by four, quarter-point increases in May, June, September and December. 
*  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) now expects the Fed to hike a cumulative 175 bps this year, beginning with a 50-bp increase at the upcoming March meeting. 
* Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) now expects five rate hikes of 25 bps this year, starting in March. 
* Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it is raising its forecast to include seven consecutive 25-bp rate hikes at each of the remaining Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings in 2022 from a previous expectation of five hikes. 
* BofA Global Research expects the Fed to hike rates by 25 bps at each of this year's remaining seven meetings, unchanged from its previous outlook. However, it said there is a risk of a 50-bp hike in the March meeting.
* HSBC expects the Fed to roll out a 50-bp hike in March and four more quarter-point rate rises in 2022.

*  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) expects the Fed to call a 50-bp hike in March plus five more 25-bp hikes in 2022, with a hike at all but the November meeting.
*  Barclays  (LON:BARC) now expects the Fed to raise rates by 25 bps five times this year, up from three hikes forecast earlier.

JAKARTA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia and China watered down a G20 finance leaders' statement on geopolitical risks to the global economy as a contentious meeting ended on Friday, deleting a reference to ""current"" tensions as financial markets fretted over the prospect of war in Ukraine.
The gathering of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 major economies was one of the most fractious since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland strayed from the G20 economic script to issue an impassioned plea to her Russian counterparts to not invade Ukraine, warning that such action would hurt the global economy and bring ""crushing"" sanctions against Russia, according to two sources familiar with her remarks.
Other sources familiar with the meeting said China and Russia had objected to the reference to ""current tensions"" in an earlier draft communique, as well as disagreements on debt restructuring for poor countries and carbon pricing.
The group's final communique simply said: ""We will also continue to monitor major global risks, including from geopolitical tensions that are arising, and macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities.""
As the meeting concluded, U.S. and European stocks fell on worries that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was imminent after Russian-backed separatists announced a surprise evacuation of their breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.
DEBT RELIEF STANDSTILL
The G20 talks, held virtually and in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, were also marked by disagreements over the group's stalled debt restructuring framework.
The final communique failed to endorse International Monetary Fund and World Bank proposals for an immediate debt service suspension for poor countries that seek restructurings and an expansion to include some middle-income countries.
Instead, finance officials reiterated their ""commitment to step up our efforts"" to implement the framework in a ""timely, orderly and coordinated manner"" without any specifics.
Earlier, a source at the talks said China, by far the world's largest bilateral creditor, had baulked at the idea of accepting outright haircuts on debt.
World Bank President David Malpass said at the Munich Security Conference after the finance meeting that he was concerned the G20 ""is not identifying the steps forward"" to deal with a massive and growing debt overhang in developing countries.
""The G20 discussions on debt were really disappointing,"" said Eric LeCompte, executive director of the Jubilee USA Network, a faith-based organization campaigning for debt relief for poor countries. He said China was resisting steps to strengthen the bankruptcy-like G20 debt framework ""so that they can cut deals on the side"" with debtor countries.
CREDIBILITY QUESTIONS 
Indonesia's finance minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, said other sticking points involved the reticence of some countries to endorse carbon-pricing as a tool to tackle climate change and how to help low-income countries such as Chad, Zambia and Ethiopia struggling with debt burdens made yet more unsustainable during the coronavirus pandemic.
""This also concerns the reputation and credibility of the G20 as a group of countries with the biggest economies to help countries that are in an uneasy situation,"" she said.
On other subjects, the final draft of the G20 text pledged to use ""all available policy tools to address the impacts of the pandemic,"" while warning that future policy space was likely to be ""narrower and uneven.""
""Central banks will act where necessary to ensure price stability in line with their respective mandates, while remaining committed to clear communication of their policy stances.""
The diverging pace of recovery from the pandemic is complicating the policy path for central banks. Expected steady interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve have drawn attention to the potential fallout for emerging markets.

While cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 are receding in many wealthy countries, they are still rising in many developing nations including host country Indonesia.
The G20 text also pledged to ensure that a landmark deal last year setting a global minimum level of corporate tax could be put into force in 2023. [nL1N2UT0JV]

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland stepped well beyond economic policy at a G20 finance meeting on Friday to issue an ""impassioned"" warning to her Russian counterparts not to invade neighboring Ukraine, two sources familiar with her remarks said.
During a contentious G20 meeting hosted by Indonesia, Freeland directly addressed Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina and warned them that Russia would face ""crushing"" sanctions in the event of an invasion.
""If Ukraine is invaded, all of our economies and citizens will suffer,"" Freeland told them, according to one of the sources. ""The economic sanctions on Russia will be swift, they will be coordinated, they will be crushing. Like-minded countries agree on this course of action. And we are united and resolute.""
Freeland's press secretary, Adrienne Vaupshas, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on her speech. Freeland participated in the meeting on a web link from Ottawa.
The source said that Freeland, previously Canada's foreign minister, took an opportunity to speak directly to influential Russian policy makers at a critical moment as tensions intensified on the Ukraine-Russian border, where Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops.
""Do not hurt yourselves in doing this,"" Freeland said, according to the sources. ""Let's not endanger the collective here, including economically. 
A second source said that the Russian officials responded to Freeland's ""impassioned"" speech by saying that reports on the threat of an invasion were ""fake news.""
G20 finance officials on Friday argued over communique language describing geopolitical risks to the global economy, deleting a reference to ""current"" tensions in a final statement after objections by Russia and China.

The disagreements over this issue and treatment of debts for poor countries delayed the communique for hours as markets fretted over the prospect of war in Ukraine.
Freeland, a fluent Russian speaker who once served as the Financial Times' Moscow bureau chief and whose grandfather was born in Ukraine, delivered one line in Russian, according to the first source, but said in English: ""You may think that for a number of us like-minded democracies here, you may think that democracies are weak. But do not doubt us and do not doubt our resolve.""

(Reuters) -Federal Reserve officials on Friday squelched what had been rising market expectations for an aggressive initial response to 40-year-high U.S. inflation, signaling that steady interest rate hikes should be enough to do the trick.
""I don’t see any compelling argument to taking a big step at the beginning,"" New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams, the No. 2 official on the central bank's policy-setting panel, told reporters after a speech.
""I think we can steadily move up interest rates and reassess,"" he said at the online event. 
Fed Governor Lael Brainard - President Joe Biden's nominee to be vice chair at the Fed - said officials will likely kick off a ""series of rate increases"" at their upcoming meeting in March, followed by decreases in the size of the Fed's balance sheet ""in coming meetings.""
Brainard, speaking at a conference in New York, did not give a specific recommendation for the coming meeting, but said recent changes in financial markets, including a rise in mortgage rates, were ""consistent with"" where the Fed is heading.
""The market is clearly aligned with that and brought forward the changes in financing conditions in a way that's consistent with our communications and data,"" Brainard said.
Investors in federal funds futures contracts last week began leaning towards the idea the Fed would raise rates a half a percentage point in March. Those expectations have now drifted back, with a quarter point hike now anticipated and six increases in total over the year.
In remarks at the conference in New York, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans downplayed the thought the Fed needed to get more aggressive, even though he agreed policy was ""wrong-footed"" with annual consumer price increases topping 7%.
He said he remained convinced inflation would ease on its own.
""I see our current policy situation as likely requiring less ultimate financial restrictiveness compared with past episodes and posing a smaller risk,"" Evans said at a separate New York event. ""We don’t know what is on the other side of the current inflation spike... We may once again be looking at a situation where there is nothing to fear from running the economy hot.""
The remarks came at the end of a tumultuous week in which traders piled into, and then backed away from, bets that the Fed would begin a round of rate hikes next month with a bigger-than-usual half-point increase. 
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard had fanned those expectations with a call for raising rates by a full percentage point by the Fed's June meeting, a rate path that would require at least one half-point hike between now and then. 
Policymakers at the central bank have all but said they will start raising borrowing costs next month to quell inflation that has raced past their 2% target, and economists expect the Fed to kick off the longest series of rate hikes in decades.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been publicly silent since January, so Williams' and Brainard's comments provide the best steer yet on the prevailing view at the Fed's policy-setting core.
Powell, however, will have a chance to shape expectations on March 2 and 3 when he gives his semiannual monetary policy update to Congress in hearings announced on Friday by the House Financial Services Committee and Senate Banking Committee.
STEADILY, PREDICTABLY
The Fed should begin raising rates next month and, once rate hikes are underway, begin to ""steadily and predictably"" trim its $9 trillion balance sheet, Williams said. Both actions, he said, will bring demand into better balance with supply. 
At the same time, he said, other forces should also be bringing down inflation, with supply chains healing and consumers returning to pre-pandemic spending patterns. 

Williams said policymakers can speed up or slow down the pace of rate increases later as needed. A path in which the overnight federal funds rate moves to a range of 2% to 2.5% by the end of next year makes sense, he said. 
Williams said he expects real U.S. GDP to grow by slightly less than 3% this year and for the unemployment rate to drop to about 3.5% by the end of the year. He projects inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index to decline to about 3% and for it to fall further next year as supply challenges improve.

5,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 07:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell will testify before Congress on March 2 and 3 in what are likely to be his final public remarks on monetary policy before the U.S. central bank begins raising interest rates to fight decades-high inflation.
Powell will deliver his regular semiannual monetary policy update to the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on March 2 and appear before the Senate Banking Committee on March 3.
Both hearings will begin at 10 a.m., the committees said on Friday. 
Fed officials have all but promised to exit their pandemic-era zero-rate policy at their next meeting on March 15-16 to bring down inflation that has shot by the central bank's 2% target. But it has not been clear how aggressively they will respond.
Last week, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard called for a full percentage point worth of rate hikes over the next three meetings, a steeper path than the Fed has followed in decades.

This week other officials have sought to signal a gentler approach, with the influential head of the New York Fed, John Williams, on Friday saying he sees little need for the central bank to go big at the start of its rate-hike cycle.
Powell, who has not spoken publicly since January, may use his testimony to lay out what he feels is the consensus of the Fed's 16 monetary policymakers, who will be weighing the risks of an upward inflation spiral against the possibility that tightening policy too hard or fast could choke off economic growth or disrupt financial markets.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The World Bank's management has approved a plan to use some $1 billion in a frozen Afghanistan trust fund for education, agriculture, health and family programs, according to a bank paper and two sources, in what would be a major boost to efforts to ease the country's worsening humanitarian and economic crises. 
The plan, outlined in the paper seen by Reuters on Friday, is to bypass sanctioned Taliban authorities by disbursing the money in the World Bank-administered Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) through U.N. agencies. 
It is set to be discussed by the World Bank board on March 1, the sources familiar with the plan told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Donors to the fund would then need to give approval for the release of any money. 
The move would follow a successful disbursement of $280 million from the same trust fund to the World Food Program (WFP) and U.N. children's agency UNICEF to support nutrition and health in Afghanistan over the past few months. 
The World Bank paper says the plan is to ""make available just over US$1 billion in ARTF resources in calendar year 2022."" Recognizing that the situation remains fluid, the plan aims for flexibility by making four disbursals of a total $600 million and the remainder ""on a priority basis"" for the rest of the year.
The aim ""is to protect the vulnerable, help preserve human capital and key economic and social institutions and reduce the need for future humanitarian assistance,"" according to the World Bank paper. It called for the fund to be used for food security, health and education programs.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last month called for the release of the remaining $1.2 billion in the fund to help Afghanistan's people survive the winter, stressing: ""Time is of the essence.""
'ACCESS AND EQUITY'
The United Nations is warning that nearly 23 million people – about 55 percent of the impoverished country's population – are facing extreme levels of hunger, with nearly 9 million at risk of starvation.
Billions of dollars in Afghan central bank reserves, the World Bank-administered trust fund and foreign financial aid were frozen to keep it out of Taliban hands. The Islamist group seized power in August as foreign troops left after Afghanistan's most recent war, which lasted 20 years. 
Graeme Smith, senior consultant for the International Crisis Group think tank, said the World Bank plan would provide urgently needed money while circumventing the Taliban, whose leaders are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions.
""This helps to unstick a big chunk of money. It will get us rolling forward,"" he said, adding that further efforts were needed to unfreeze the central bank assets.
The World Bank's plan sets ""minimum conditions for access and equity"" aimed at ensuring girls are allowed in schools, female teachers can work, women are included in community councils, women-headed households receive food aid and female health workers are allowed to work.

It calls for some $150 million to be distributed through UNICEF for stipends to over 200,000 teachers who have not been paid for more than six months. Another $100 million would be earmarked to improve community resilience, $150 million to $200 million for food security, and $150 million for health programs.
The United States last week announced plans to free up half of the $7 billion in frozen Afghan central bank assets at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help the Afghan people. The rest was held to potentially satisfy terrorism-related lawsuits against the Taliban.

Speaking at a White House press briefing, deputy national security adviser Daleep Singh also argued that Russia would be unable to replace technology imports from other countries, including China, if the United States imposes tough export controls it has also threatened against the country.
""We are converging on the final package,"" he said. ""All options remain on the table but its probably not going to be the case that you'll see SWIFT in the initial rollout package,"" he added. His comments confirmed a Feb. 11 report by Reuters. 
Tensions are running high on the Ukrainian-Russia border after Russian-backed separatists announced an evacuation on Friday from breakaway regions in east Ukraine in a conflict the West believes Moscow plans to use as justification for an invasion of its neighbour. Russia denies it plans to attack. 

The United States has repeatedly threatened tough sanctions against Russia if President Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine, but questions remain about the scope and ordering of potential measures that have been floated by the Biden administration. 
The sanctions on the table also include export controls on components produced by Russia for the tech and weapons sectors, and sanctions against specific Russian oligarchs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Eurodollar futures, which reflect the outlook for U.S. interest rates over the next few years, have started to price in an incremental easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in 2024. If that plays out, it would be just two years after what is expected to be the start of a Fed tightening next month. 
The U.S. central bank is widely anticipated to raise its policy rate at its upcoming meeting in March by a quarter of a percentage point from about zero currently. The money markets' odds on a 50 basis point-hike the last few sessions have dwindled from as high as 80% to 37% on Friday.
Market pricing for the December 2023 eurodollar contract showed an implied yield of 2.235%, which traders said can be a proxy for the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans to meet reserves required by the U.S. central bank. 
That is looking likely to be the peak of the Fed rate-hike cycle, or the so-called ""terminal rate,"" analysts said, with implied yields declining to 2.18% in the March 2024 contract, 2.125% in June, 2.095% for September, and 2.085% for December.
Fed officials estimate the long-term neutral rate, which is neither constricting nor stimulating economic growth, is 2.5%.
""If you look at the (yield) curve out around '23-'24 it starts to flatten out and invert, which would argue for pricing in rate cuts,"" said Jim Caron, portfolio manager and head of global macro strategies for the global fixed income team at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management.
""The long end of the curve is basically telling you the same thing. It's telling you the more they hike now, and the more they slow down growth now, the more they are going to steal it from the future, and therefore long-term growth prospects aren't very high either."" 
The roughly 220 basis points of anticipated interest rate increases over the next two years suggest a faster pace of Fed tightening that may include one or two half percentage point hikes in that period, analysts said.
Dan Belton, fixed income strategist, at BMO Capital in Chicago, pointed out that at the beginning of the month, ""futures markets priced a much later peak of the Fed's hiking cycle, closer to 2028 or 2029."" 
He added that the market had also been looking for a ""much shallower path of Fed hikes too, with the peak rate being closer to 1.82%"" than it is now.
EURODOLLAR CURVE INVERSION
With the implied yield on the eurodollar futures' 2024 contracts lower than those in 2023, the curve has inverted, typically an ominous sign.
Normally, yield curves slope upward with nearer maturities yielding less than dates further out in time. Longer-term debt typically carries greater risk because of the higher probability of inflation or default, demanding a greater return. 
For instance, the spread between the December 2023 contract and the June 2025 contract , collapsed to around -14 basis points on Friday. A year ago, that curve was steeper and the spread was at 74 basis points.
""It's as if traders in the eurodollar futures market think the Fed is going to overdo it next year and then have to reverse course and push rates back down,"" said Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at Reynolds Strategy, and former money market portfolio manager for an investment firm.
The eurodollar curve has inverted a few times in the past.

In June 2018, the inversion suggested the Fed would have to cut interest rates at a time when it was in a tightening mode. Indeed, after hiking rates in December 2018, policymakers reversed course the following July with a rate cut.
In 2020, the central bank cut the benchmark overnight lending rate to near zero as the coronavirus pandemic caused economic devastation around the world.
 
"
10,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 03:05PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -The Federal Reserve adopted a new set of investing and trading restrictions for its senior officials on Friday, barring a wider range of activities than was proposed last fall in the wake of an ethics scandal that shook confidence in the U.S. central bank's integrity.
They are meant ""to ensure public confidence in the impartiality and integrity of the Committee’s work,"" the Fed said in a statement. The Fed's Federal Open Markets Committee is its policy-setting body.
Fed officials will be banned from purchasing sector funds, engaging in short sales, or buying securities on margin, as well as from holding cryptocurrencies, commodities or foreign currencies.
The restrictions come on top of rules first outlined last October that keep Fed officials from purchasing individual stocks or entering into derivatives, or from holding individual bonds and agency-backed securities. The rules require policymakers and covered staff to give 45 days advance notice and obtain approval for any transaction, and ban any trading during periods of market stress and for a slightly longer period around regularly scheduled policy-setting meetings.
All investments must be held for at least a year, under the rules. 
The sweeping new restrictions come out of review ordered by Fed Chair Jerome Powell after Boston Fed chief Eric Rosengren and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan resigned following reports of their active trading in 2020, when the central bank launched a massive effort to fight the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Fed's efforts helped bolster financial markets.
Rosengren, in announcing his retirement last September, cited health issues. Kaplan, who announced he was stepping down the same day as did Rosengren, cited his trading activities, saying they risked becoming a ""distraction"" to the Fed.
Another policymaker, former Vice Chair Richard Clarida, also came under fire after he corrected a previous financial disclosure in late December to show that he had sold a stock fund and then swiftly rebought it shortly before the Fed announced a barrage of rescue programs to stem the economic fallout from the pandemic. 
Most of the Fed's new trading restrictions will come into effect May 1 with pre-clearance and advance notice rules in force from July 1. Current Fed officials will have 12 months to come into compliance, the central bank said, while new staff and policymakers will have six months from the date they join.
Previously, the rules that guided personal financial practices for Fed officials were the same as those for other government agencies, although the Fed had supplemental rules that were stricter than those for Congress and other agencies.
However, questions remain about how much back and forth may have occurred over policymakers’ personal trading in a year when markets first cratered then rebounded on the basis of both massive federal fiscal stimulus and an aggressive rescue effort by the Fed.

An investigation by the central bank's inspector general is ongoing while Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren has called for a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into Fed officials' trading activity to determine if any trades in the past violated insider trading rules.
Last week, the Fed, responding to a Freedom of Information Act request by Reuters, said there are about 60 pages of correspondence between its ethics officials and policymakers regarding financial transactions conducted during 2020, but ""denied in full"" to release the documents, citing exemptions under the Information Act that it said applied in this case.

11,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 02:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Rapidly climbing inflation in the U.S. is accelerating calls from governors and state leaders to provide immediate tax relief to cash-strapped residents facing higher prices on everyday products such as gas, milk, and electricity.
The governors of Maine and Kentucky this week joined a sweeping number of states—including Illinois, California, Massachusetts, Florida, Alabama, Washington, and Missouri—who are considering offering quick but temporary relief to taxpayers crushed by a relentless surge in inflation in recent months. The consumer price index—which measures what Americans pay for goods and services—reached another 40-year high last month, soaring to 7.5% due to strong consumer demand and pandemic-related supply disruptions.
The swift bipartisan action by state leaders over the past few weeks comes as congressional Democrats in Washington are rushing to line up legislation that addresses rising gas, medical, and food costs ahead of the midterm elections. Democrat and Republican states flush with cash due to higher-than-expected tax revenue, a soaring stock market, and millions in unspent federal pandemic aid have been eager to move quickly to return surpluses back to taxpayers.
“2022 is shaping up to be the year of bipartisan tax relief,” said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects for the Tax Foundation. “Across the board, we’re seeing lawmakers trying to find ways to reduce tax burdens.”
Making Ends Meet
State lawmakers’ tax relief wish list runs the gamut from food store purchases to property tax to relief at the pump to household cleaning supplies, and even, retail and vehicle sales. While the adjustments are not uniform, all the proposals are moving in the same direction to rescue taxpayers even if temporarily, tax policy experts say.
Alabama lawmakers Thursday approved a bill that would allow families to avoid paying state income tax on monthly child tax credit payments they receive under President Joe Biden’s economic relief package.
A day earlier, Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed an executive order halting an increase in vehicle property taxes that have climbed substantially due to skyrocketing car values. He also endorsed a plan by the state Legislature to temporarily cut the state’s sales tax by 1% for one year starting July 1 to help families pay higher costs that are anticipated to continue to rise through 2023.
“A booming economy and the best state budget in 25 years means we can do more to help our working families and small businesses buy and sell the essential goods and services that are costing more and that are simply priced too high,” Beshear said.
Consumers have been hammered by higher costs across the economy from food to apartment rents to airfares and electricity, effectively wiping out pay raises.
In Maine, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills on Tuesday proposed sending half the state’s $411 million surplus back as one-time $500 checks to help residents keep up with surging prices. Her supplemental budget plan also calls for two more relief measures: a $1,000 refundable tax credit to roughly 100,000 low-and middle-income property owners and renters, and expanding the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit to families earning less than $57,414 annually.
Sales Tax Relief
State tax revenues have increased by 26.3% since April 2021, according to the Tax Policy Center, as personal income and corporate income taxes rose. Consumers aided with federal stimulus money also spent more, helping to bolster sales tax revenue for states.
Republican lawmakers in New York and Connecticut have introduced legislation to either temporarily exempt or reduce the state’s sales tax rate.
In New York, Deputy Minority Leader Steve Hawley (R) in the State Assembly proposed giving relief to New Yorkers by exempting a 4% sales tax on gas, personal care products, housekeeping supplies, and ready-to-eat foods for two years.
“The windfall of additional state sales tax revenue from inflated prices of goods should not be compounded on the backs of New York consumers,” the bill authors wrote. “New York State has significant revenues to account for the loss of sales tax revenue from the suspension provided in this bill.”
In Connecticut, Republican lawmakers also called for part of the state’s surplus to be returned to taxpayers by reducing the general sales tax from 6.35% to 5.99% and eliminating a 1% surcharge on prepared foods, including restaurant meals.
As Food Costs Rise
There are 13 states that tax groceries—and now, Oklahoma, Kansas, Mississippi, and Virginia are among several considering phasing out the levy applied on food purchases entirely or at least temporarily.
Earlier this month, Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt proposed eliminating the state’s 4.5% sales tax, which would save residents more than $250 million, according to a study commissioned by House Minority Leader Emily Virgin (D) last year.
Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, as part of his $25 billion state budget, wants to give residents a $160 million grocery tax credit to help cover rising food costs. The majority of the tax rebate, he said, would go to households earning less than $100,000 per year.
In the Midwest, Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who faces re-election this year, offered inflation relief as part of his budget plan, sparing consumers nearly $1 billion in taxes for the upcoming year on groceries, gasoline, and property taxes.
“The higher cost of even basic necessities is making it harder to make ends meet,” said Pritzker earlier this month during an address from the state Capitol building in Springfield. “Government ought to do more to ease the pain and put more money in the pockets of hardworking Illinoisans.”
Analysts say the proposed tax relief efforts, like Pritzker’s, are just short-term.
“These proposals are too small and too localized to deal with the fundamental problem of inflation,” said David Merriman, a professor at University of Illinois Chicago.
Help at the Gas Pump
State relief efforts come as Democrats in Washington proposed bills in the Senate (S. 3609) and House this month to temporarily suspend the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gasoline tax until Jan. 1, 2023. Some Senate Republicans have called it a “gimmick,” but the White House said it’s keeping all options on the table.
The proposal drew swift opposition from transportation and construction groups that say it would hurt the already strained Highway Trust Fund, which is supported by the gasoline tax and funds federal highway and transit programs.
“These short-sighted solutions will increase debt financing by billions and bring greater uncertainty to the solvency of the surface transportation system,” said Michael Johnson, president of the National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association.
Some opponents, including House Transportation and Infrastructure Chair Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) also argue energy companies will pocket the savings instead of lowering prices.
As Americans continue to pay hefty prices at the pump, state lawmakers from both parties are also itching to offer a reprieve.
California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to delay a hike in the state gas tax, calling it a “modest $523 million gas tax holiday.” He has received pushback from Democratic state legislators who raised concerns about its impact to the economy.
Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also wants to provide $1 billion in relief to suspend the state’s gas tax for millions of Floridians for five months, helping the average family to save $200. The state’s House Ways and Means Committee advanced a tax package Thursday that would establish temporary sales tax holidays, but doesn’t include DeSantis’ proposal to suspend the state’s gas tax.
Meanwhile, states such as Rhode Island are hoping to use their budget surpluses of $600 million to eliminate the state gas tax altogether in 2022.
“Our state budget is benefiting from inflation as the gas tax brings in new, unexpected revenue,” Rhode Island Republican Minority Whip Jessica de la Cruz said. “Meanwhile, the people of Rhode Island are struggling to balance their budgets with no relief in sight.”

New York (Reuters) -When the Federal Reserve tacked to a new brand of monetary policy 18 months ago it thought it could deliver low unemployment and tame inflation.
It may end up with neither, five top bank and academic economists wrote in a critique released on Friday.
Their paper envisions a scenario in which Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are unable to control rising prices and forced to raise interest rates so high the economy slows and unemployment rises, hurting the very people they aimed to help.
""Avoiding downturns is as important as any gains"" that workers might enjoy during a ""hot economy"", one of the authors,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities chief economist Peter Hooper said at a symposium where the paper was presented. 
It was released at a time of flux in Fed policy, with the Fed expected to begin raising interest rates in March in response to high inflation, but still debating how aggressive it may need to be.
One Fed official responding to the paper said it was still likely inflation will ease over time without putting the recovery at risk.
""I see our current policy situation as likely requiring less ultimate financial restrictiveness compared with past episodes and posing a smaller risk,"" Chicago Fed president Charles Evans said. ""We don’t know what is on the other side of the current inflation spike... We may once again be looking at a situation where there is nothing to fear from running the economy hot."" 
But others were skeptical that the new approach, dubbed the ""Powell paradigm"" by the writers, would work in its approach of using looser policy and allowing slightly higher inflation to encourage stronger employment.
The perceived benefits were valid, the authors found, with periods of low unemployment helping narrow the persistent gaps between, for example, white, Black and Hispanic workers, and between those with more education versus those with less.
But the COVID-19 pandemic and the policy responses to it have now ""upended some of the premises"" on which the new approach rested and left the Fed facing inflation not seen since the 1980s, wrote Hooper,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s Seth Carpenter, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s Ethan Harris, University of Chicago professor Anil Kashyap, and University of Wisconsin professor Kenneth D. West.
They said the Fed may be able to lower the pace of price increases with steady but ultimately modest increases to its benchmark overnight interest rate, from near zero to around 3% between now and 2024, without triggering big changes in the unemployment rate - the ideal scenario for policymakers.
Favorable public psychology, with firms and households acting as if inflation will remain under control, does ""most of the work ... Therefore, the Fed neither has to be pre-emptive in heading inflation off nor does it have to crush the economy"" to win back control, the group wrote.
But under some of the simulations they developed the Fed could be forced to raise interest rates perhaps twice as high, see inflation remain elevated, and the unemployment rate get lodged between 5% and 6% for several years.
That would be a blow to Fed hopes for a ""broad and inclusive"" recovery in the U.S. labor market, with the higher unemployment rate falling hardest on racial and ethnic minorities and less educated Americans.
The results ""raise some questions for the Federal Reserve going forward"" if, after promising it could deliver stable inflation and low unemployment, policymakers again have to make a choice.
""Either outcome, exacerbating inequality or accepting years of high inflation, is fraught with political risk,"" they concluded.
BROADENING INFLATION
The Fed is due to hike interest rates at its March 15-16 policy meeting. Yet minutes of the central bank's most recent discussion in January acknowledge the gamble officials took by leaving ultra-loose monetary policy, of near-zero interest rates and monthly purchases of bonds, in place as long as it did.
Inflationary forces that had been seen as ""transitory"" were now broadening through the economy, the minutes noted, and had begun influencing business investment and wage decisions in ways that could persist. 

That's the sort of dynamic that Carpenter, Harris and the other authors noted could force the Fed into tougher policy choices: If recent inflation experience informs what businesses or households expect to happen in the future and how they invest and spend as a result, it might require more aggressive rate increases - and worse employment outcomes - to reverse that thinking.
The emphasis on jobs ""has potentially earned the Fed some good will,"" the authors said. ""But when the next recession comes and inequality rises ... what will be the fallout?""

13,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 01:47PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard on Friday laid out a case for the role a U.S. central bank digital currency could play in bolstering financial stability as the use of stablecoins and cryptocurrency grows and other countries issue their own CBDCs. 
""It is essential that policymakers, including the Federal Reserve, plan for the future of the payment system and consider the full range of possible options to bring forward the potential benefits of new technologies, while safeguarding stability,"" Brainard said in remarks prepared for delivery to the U.S Monetary Policy Forum in New York. ""A U.S. CBDC may be one potential way to ensure that people around the world who use the dollar can continue to rely on the strength and safety of U.S. currency to transact and conduct business in the digital financial system.""
Fed policymakers are divided on the need for a central bank digital currency, even as many other central banks globally are pressing ahead on such plans. 
Brainard has emerged as a supporter of the idea, though in her remarks she emphasized the importance of considering the potential impact of a U.S. CBDC rather than making any outright claims for the need to adopt it. 
""It is important to consider how new forms of crypto-assets and digital money may affect the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities to maintain financial stability, a safe and efficient payment system, household and business access to safe central bank money, and maximum employment and price stability,"" she said Friday. 

Proponents of a CBDC say it could streamline payment systems, improve financial inclusion and even bolster financial stability, while others worry about the costs, including privacy concerns. 
On one point Fed policymakers do appear to be in agreement: the Fed will not launch one without clear support from the White House and Congress, policymakers have indicated.

(Reuters) -New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said Friday there is little need for the Fed to kick off its interest rate hiking cycle with a big move, advocating instead for the central bank to raise rates ""steadily"" and adjust the pace if needed. 
His comments push back against those of other Fed officials, including St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who say the central bank should front load some of its interest rate increases once it begins lifting rates in March from near-zero levels. 
""I don’t see any compelling argument to taking a big step at the beginning,"" Williams told reporters on Friday. ""I think we can steadily move up interest rates and reassess.""
Williams said policymakers can speed up or slow down the pace of rate increases later on depending on what happens with the economy. A path in which the federal funds rate moves to a range of 2% to 2.5% by the end of next year makes sense, he said. 
After interest rate increases are underway, the next step would be for the Fed to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, Williams said during a virtual event organized by New Jersey City University. He expects that process to start later this year. 

After the event, Williams told reporters that he thinks the Fed will be able to shrink its holdings substantially primarily by letting securities roll off the balance sheet as they mature. He said the Fed may consider selling MBS at some point to achieve its goal of moving to a portfolio that invests mainly in Treasury securities, an approach supported by some other Fed officials as well.
Williams said he expects real U.S. GDP to grow by slightly less than 3% this year and for the unemployment rate to drop to about 3.5% by the end of the year. He projects personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price inflation to decline to about 3% and for it to fall further next year as supply challenges improve.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Bank of Canada said on Friday that Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri will retire effective June 17, 2022 and, at that time, the Governing Council will return to its usual six-person complement.
Schembri, who joined the central bank in 1997 and then Governing Council in 2013, is the second-longest serving deputy governor.
""Larry has worked with dedication to this institution, and to Canadians, for more than 25 years,"" Governor Tiff Macklem said in a statement. ""His contributions to central banking, here in Canada and internationally, have been innumerable.""
Since 2016, Schembri has been tasked with the oversight of the Bank's analysis of domestic economic developments. Deputy Governor Sharon Kozicki will take over that file after April's quarterly forecasts, the central bank said.
Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers (NYSE:ROG) will take on shared oversight of the central bank's financial system activities with Deputy Governor Toni Gravelle.
The council was temporarily expanded to seven after both Kozicki and Rogers joined last year.

Bank of Canada officials will meet on March 2, when they are widely expected to hike interest rates for the first time in more than three years. Money markets are betting on a 25-basis-point increase to 0.50% from current record low 0.25%. [BOCWATCH]

PARIS (Reuters) -G20 finance ministers recommitted on Friday to implementing a global overhaul of cross-border corporate tax rules next year in the face of concerns that meeting the deadline could prove difficult.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which has shepherded negotiations on the deal from the start, said that it was ""still on track"" but would need political compromise to take effect next year.
The deadline is widely considered to be highly ambitious, not least because U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is struggling to pass legislation that would bring U.S. law in line with the global deal.
Years of negotiations culminated last October when nearly 140 countries reached a deal on a minimum tax rate of 15% on multinationals and agreed to make it harder for companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to avoid tax by booking profits in low-tax jurisdictions.
The technical details are being hammered out at the Paris-based OECD so countries can bring the new rules onto their law books by next year.
G20 finance ministers said in a joint statement after a meeting on Friday they were committed to ensuring the new rules will come into effect at global level in 2023.
""However, the task is daunting and we need your political support and steer to ensure that progress is made in a timely manner,"" OECD Secretary General Mathias Cormann said in a report to the G20 finance ministers.
""We need to count on your ability to compromise to make sure that we deliver on time,"" he added.
Previous less far-reaching tax agreements took years to be implemented as countries dragged their feet on updating their tax codes.
""The key question is the implementation of our political agreement. There is no turning back, we need to move on,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told his counterparts during the meeting.
German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said: ""It is an unquestionably ambitious timetable, but it is also a major and important project for international tax justice.""
Le Maire invited his G20 counterparts to come to Paris in June to sign the new multilateral legal framework needed to implement the agreement's first pillar, which makes it harder for digital giants to park profits in low-tax countries.

NEW DELHI/DUBAI (Reuters) -India and the United Arab Emirates signed a broad trade and investment pact on Friday that will eventually cut all tariffs on each other's goods and aims to increase annual trade between the two nations to $100 billion within five years.
The virtual signing ceremony marks the first trade deal sealed by the Gulf state since it began pursuing such pacts last September in a bid to strengthen its status as a business hub.
Piyush Goyal, India's commerce minister, told reporters the deal could create more than a million jobs for India in the next few years, particularly in labour intensive sectors such as the auto industry, plastics, leather and engineering.
Earlier, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UAE de facto ruler Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan witnessed the signing by senior officials from both nations, already major trade partners, during a virtual summit between the leaders.
""The agreement … not only deepens our economic and trading relationship with a close partner but unlocks a new phase of global cooperation for us,"" Sheikh Mohamed said in a joint statement.
The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), as it is known, is expected to boost annual bilateral non-oil trade from $60 billion to $100 billion within the next three to five years, India's Prime Minister's office said.
""There will be a huge flow of trade and investments between both nations and it's going to open the door for more business opportunities,"" Emirati Minister State for Foreign Trade Thani Al Zeyoudi told Reuters.
The CEPA is expected to be implemented by May after the UAE cabinet approval, Goyal said.
The agreement, which was not immediately made public, eliminates 80% of tariffs on UAE and India goods, while all tariffs are to be removed within ten years, Al Zeyoudi said.
UAE commodities like aluminum, copper and petrochemicals would benefit from the removal of tariffs, he said.
The deal also covers services, investments, intellectual property, and a commitment by the UAE to create 140,000 highly skilled jobs by 2030.
India is the second largest trading partner of the UAE, where each year billions of dollars in remittances are sent home by more than three million Indians working in the Gulf state.
The UAE economy ministry said by 2030 the CEPA would add $9 billion, or 1.7%, to UAE gross domestic product, exports would increase $7.6 billion, or 1.5%, and imports would rise $14.8 billion, or 3.8%.
The UAE is pursuing similar trade and investment deals with nations including Turkey and South Korea, and expects to soon finalise bilateral negotiations with Israel and Indonesia.

It has also announced a raft of regulatory and social reforms in recent years to make business and life easier in the country where most of the 10 million population are foreigners.
""We're moving from a regional to a global hub,"" Al Zeyoudi said, referring to the trade deals and policy announcements.

“We hope it will be positive and that from next week we can restart the export process on a daily basis,” Lopez Hernandez said at the president’s daily press conference.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union launched a legal challenge against China at the World Trade Organization on Friday, arguing that Chinese courts were preventing European companies from protecting their telecom technology patents.
The European Commission, which filed the challenge on behalf of the EU's 27 members, said EU companies were being deterred from going to a foreign court to safeguard their standard-essential patents (SEPs). 
The Commission has also consulted the United States and Japan, whose standard-essential patent holders face similar challenges and which want to be setting global tech standards, rather than leaving this to Beijing.
Mobile phone manufacturers need to obtain licences for SEPs for their products to meet certain international standards.
The Commission said Chinese courts had, since August 2020, been issuing ""anti-suit injunctions"", which prohibit EU companies from going to foreign courts, with the threat of heavy fines as a deterrent.
In one case, the fine was 130,000 euros ($147,758) a day, and the practice undermined the companies' negotiations on licence fees with Chinese smartphone makers, the EU executive said.
China said that it regretted the EU challenge and that it always upheld the multilateral trading system. 
The European Commission did not specify companies involved. China's largest smartphone makers are Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) and Honor, formerly owned by Huawei. European SEP holders include Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Ericsson (BS:ERICAs).
The Commission said it had raised the issue on a number of occasions with China, without resolution.
The bloc believes China is violating the WTO's agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS).

WTO challenges start with a formal 60-day period of consultations between the parties after which the EU can request a WTO panel ruling. The process, including possible appeals, can take years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Friday launched a beta version of a tool that will be used to determine where to invest bilions of federal dollars to bring clean energy and infrastructure to disadvantaged communities, a key step in fulfilling a promise by the Biden administration to prioritize environmental justice.
The Council on Environmental Quality unveiled the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, used to map and identify communities that are most in need of investment by weighing income levels and over two dozen socieconomic, health and environmental indicators.
The software has been under development since early last year with input from the White House environmental justice advisory council as a key input for President Joe Biden's ""Justice40 Initiative,"" a goal he set early in his presidency to ensure that 40% of the benefits of federal investments in clean energy get channeled to communities that are overburdened by pollution. 
“The Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool will help federal agencies ensure that the benefits of the nation’s climate, clean energy, and environmental programs are finally reaching the communities that have been left out and left behind for far too long,” CEQ Chair Brenda Mallory said. 
Using census tract data, the web-based program identifies communities as being disadvantaged if they are above the 65th percentile for income and above the 90th percentile for any of 25 indicators ranging from local asthma rates to traffic and hazardous waste site proximity to unemployment.
But an indicator that is conspicuosly absent is race. A Biden administration official told reporters that the tool was designed to be ""race neutral"" to be able to withstand potential legal challenges.
The omission has disappointed some environmental justice advocates.
Sacoby Wilson, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health who helped developed a state-level screening tool for Maryland, said the decision not to use race as an indicator is political.
""The science is clear. Race is the biggest predictor of environmental hazard,"" he told Reuters.
""We are missing an opportunity by exlcuding race in the tool,"" said Anthony Rogers-Wright, director of environmental justice at New York Lawyers for the Public Interest. ""The tool is not telling the full story of a community."" 

The Enviromental Protection Agency also on Friday launched a revamp of its own screening tool, EJSCREEN, which can be used to guide environmental rulemaking. [L1N2M11WM]

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Current high inflation requires a ""substantial repositioning"" of Federal Reserve policy, but not so much that it will restrict the economy and wreck employment, Chicago Fed president Charles Evans said Friday.
Evans, in prepared remarks, laid out the case that price pressures still stand to ease on their own without aggressive Fed interest rate increases.
He did not give details on what he thinks the Fed should do at its March or subsequent meetings through the year, or wade into the debate over whether officials should start with a larger than usual half percentage point increase to jump start the process. 
But he said his comments were meant to provide ""discipline against scary guesses that the world is about to end,"" with the Fed losing control of inflation and needing to risk sharp rises in unemployment or even a recession to control it.
""Our present monetary policy setting is wrong-footed against the current, sharp increase in inflation,"" Evans said at a conference organized by University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
However, stripping out pandemic and supply chain effects that are likely to fade, ""by my reading underlying inflation appears to still be well anchored at levels consistent with the Fed’s average 2 percent objective,"" he said. 
As a result, ""I see our current policy situation as likely requiring less ultimate financial restrictiveness compared with past episodes and posing a smaller risk"" to jobs and growth, than was needed to fix bouts of inflation in the 1970s and 1980s, he said.

""We don’t know what is on the other side of the current inflation spike... We may once again be looking at a situation where there is nothing to fear from running the economy hot,"" and capturing benefits for workers, he said.
Evans was commenting on a paper delivered at the same conference which noted the benefits of a new Fed strategy. That strategy, which Evans helped author, tries to capture jobs gains by taking more risk with higher inflation. The spike in prices during the pandemic has brought that approach into question.

24,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 10:18AM ET</span>",,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Sales of previously owned homes unexpectedly increased to a one-year high as buyers rushed in ahead of a surge in mortgage rates, further depleting tight inventories to a record low.
Contract closings increased 6.7% in January from the prior month to an annualized 6.5 million, figures from the National Association of Realtors showed Friday. All four regions saw gains on a monthly basis. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 6.1 million annualized rate in January.
“Buyers were likely anticipating further rate increases and locking-in at the low rates, and investors added to overall demand with all-cash offers,” Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist, said in a statement Friday. “Consequently, housing prices continue to move solidly higher.”
With American demand for homes still outstripping supply, the current pace of sales depends in large part on the availability of properties. January’s increase in sales came almost entirely from homes priced above $500,000, and the recent spike in mortgage rates may temper future demand.
The number of homes for sale dropped to a record low 860,000 last month, down 2.3% from a month earlier and 16.5% lower than a year ago. At the current pace it would take 1.6 months to sell all the homes on the market, also an all-time low in NAR’s data. Realtors see anything below five months of supply as a sign of a tight market.
Amid the limited supply, affordability remains a persistent problem for Americans looking to buy. The median selling price rose 15.4% to $350,300 in January from a year ago. First-time buyers accounted for 27% of sales in January, hovering near a record low.
Cash sales represented 27% of all transactions last month and investors made up 22% of the market, crowding out first-time buyers.
Builders are racing to construct more homes, but high commodities prices, shipping delays and labor shortages have ballooned backlogs and restrained building activity.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to refinance over $40 billion in debts is trudging closer to the finish line, despite protests in the South American country that has a long and uneasy history with the global lender.
The two sides have been in winding talks for over a year to revamp a failed $57 billion facility agreed in 2018 under former conservative president Mauricio Macri, which was unable to keep Argentina from sliding into debt, currency and economic crises.
A final agreement that could be worth $40-45 billion appears likely in coming weeks after an ""understanding"" with the IMF in late January. The accord would still need IMF board approval and support in Argentina's Congress, where some lawmakers have openly opposed it.
""We understand that it may be soon,"" presidential spokeswoman Gabriela Cerruti told reporters when asked about sending the agreement to Congress.
""We are going to reach the best possible agreement that will help us start finding a solution to the largest debt Argentina ever took on, and also the largest that the IMF ever gave out.""
The difficult talks have buffeted stocks and sovereign bonds, which are in distressed territory even after a major $110 billion debt restructuring with private creditors in 2020.
NOT THERE YET
Some local media reported a deal could come as early as this weekend, though officials privately talked down this possibility, signaling it would likely be later this month.
""My understanding was next Friday an agreement on the IC (letter of intent) would be sealed and after March 1 it would be sent to Congress,"" one official said.
Another government official with knowledge of the talks said: ""We keep working. No news is expected over the weekend. Of course it is closer and we will have to be attentive next week or the following one.""
Both sides are keen to seal a deal before major payments from the 2018 agreement start to come due next month, with the country grappling with depleted foreign currency reserves and a drought that is weighing on grain crops, its key export.
Argentina's central bank lifted the benchmark interest rate to 42.5% on Thursday, its steepest hike since 2019, aiming to rein in annual inflation now running at more than 50% and edge towards positive real interest rates.

Ayelen Romero, account executive at Rava Bursátil, a local brokerage, said investors were hopeful a final deal was near, which could help bolster markets.
""It would appear that the definitive signing with the IMF and the end of the negotiation on the agreement are approaching,"" she said.

Brussels has yet to approve Warsaw's National Recovery Plan, which is necessary to unblock the 36 billion euros ($40.89 billion) in funding, due to a dispute over judicial reforms the bloc says undermine the independence of the courts.
""The chances after today's talks have slightly improved,"" Mateusz Morawiecki told a news conference in Brussels broadcast by Polish television, while stressing that it remained to be seen if an agreement could be forged in coming weeks. 
Morawiecki was speaking after meeting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier in the day.
The Commission declined to comment on whether it shared Morawiecki's assessment that chances to unlock Poland's access to the EU recovery fund improved after the meeting.
The European Union's top court on Wednesday cleared the way for the EU executive to cut billions of euros of funds to Poland and Hungary by dismissing challenges by Warsaw and Budapest against a new EU sanction, which would halt funding to members that break European laws.
The current dispute with Poland focuses on the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court, which critics say is a politicised body penalising judges who oppose Warsaw's judicial reforms.
The EU's top court has demanded that it be disbanded, and last October, ruled Poland must pay one million euros a day in fines for maintaining it.
Poland's ruling nationalists Law and Justice (PiS) and President Andrzej Duda, a government ally, have both proposed legislation to try and end the standoff.
However, critics say both sets of proposals fail to tackle the underlying problem of the politicisation of the judiciary which the Disciplinary Chamber embodies.
Despite the freeze in COVID recovery financing, Poland is going ahead with its National Recovery Plan using its own funds.

""The first tenders will start soon and the money for their implementation is secured,"" Morawiecki said. ""I do not believe that it will not be refunded in the future (by the EU).""

(Reuters) - European companies hoping to fund M&A and capital expenditures on bond markets this year are facing a sudden jump in borrowing costs and wary buyers after the ECB's shock pivot towards tighter monetary policy.
Bond issues are a key source of funding for companies and have grown in importance relative to bank loans in the euro zone, particularly since the financial crisis.
Caught out by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde's hawkish tone after the bank's February meeting - which opened the door to rate hikes this year - bonds from investment-grade (IG) European firms have seen yields surge 60 basis points. 
Euro credit had been less hit by January volatility stirred by the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkishness, with IG bonds delivering less than half the losses in the United States. 
But those falls accelerated post-ECB and yields have more than doubled this year to as high as 1.18%, the highest since May 2020, according to BofA. 
That's still extremely low, but a sudden jump in borrowing costs is significant. If continued, it can impact companies' ability to invest, eventually slowing economic growth, so central banks watch credit spreads carefully. 
Nearly half of investors in BofA's February credit investor survey said IG spreads rising to 150-175 bps, from around 110 bps currently, would prompt a dovish turn from the ECB. 
A mergers and acquisitions boom and the need for capital investment has been seen by many as driving a rise in European corporate bond sales this year -- JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) for instance expects a record 645 billion euros of IG issuance. 
While moves so far are not enough to derail those expectations, Helene Jolly, head of EMEA IG corporate syndicate at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), said borrowers and investors were adjusting to ""the new normal"".
""Corporates have had to look at the new levels of coupons that are being required because of the rates being paid... and investors have had to think about what does this mean for me, what's my outlook on rates now and where do I want to play,"" Jolly said. 
Sentiment has turned rapidly -- just 16% of European credit investors are positioned net long on IG debt, the lowest since 2019 and down from 27% in December, while corporate debt funds are holding more cash than they have in years, BofA's survey found. 
One consequence has been declining bond sales -- in the two weeks since the ECB meeting companies have raised around 9 billion euros, similar to volumes in the single week up to the meeting, according to Refinitiv IFR data. Several sessions delivered zero issuance.

WARY 
Because many companies borrowed cheaply and abundantly during the pandemic, there is no panic over their ability to refinance debt, even for sub-investment grade, ""junk"" issuers. 
Just two junk issuers have sold bonds since the ECB, according to IFR. The vast majority of issuance came from Italian credit management and data group Cerved, which raised most of its funding from a floating-rate bond. Those compensate investors as interest rates rise.
""People are wary about new issues, not because they think they are bad credits, but they're concerned that if you buy a credit with a 3.5% yield today and in a week the same credit is yielding 3.75%, your bond's down a couple of points,"" said Ben Thompson, JPMorgan's co-head of EMEA leveraged finance capital markets.
ISSUANCE BOOM? 
Issuers may have to start hitting markets soon with the ECB expected to halt bond purchases by September. 
The ECB last year bought over 70 billion euros of company debt, around 6% of its total purchases during that period. 
IG spreads have widened over 25 bps this year and the additional premium companies pay for new bond sales are already higher than the average since 2015, according to BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). 
Viktor Hjort, global head of credit strategy at BNP, estimates an upcoming rush for M&A and capex-linked borrowing could widen spreads another 15 bps. 
""Corporates have significant need for spending, especially capex, which is unsustainably low... so the credit market is going to have to fund a capex cycle, and it's also facing a demand shock,"" Hjort said. 
In the junk market, critical for financing leveraged buyouts, the average coupon on BofA's index exceeds its yield, according to Refinitiv Datastream, so on average, new issuance will cost firms more than the interest on their current debt. 
Still, higher yields aren't expected to derail borrowing.
Shanawaz Bhimji, strategist at ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd), estimates that firms' total returns from equity this year will exceed the current cost of equity even when assuming a much higher cost of net debt than current rates, so they should continue investing in M&A and capex. 

To cheapen funding, borrowers may opt for shorter-dated financing or issue floating-rate notes, patterns already emerging on some deals, the bankers said. 
""Issuers are going to have to be realistic about the cost of debt,"" Thompson at JPMorgan said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - (This February 17 story corrects first line to say five million tonnes per annum, not cumulative)
India plans to manufacture five million tonnes of green hydrogen per annum by 2030, the power ministry said on Thursday, aiming to meet its climate targets and become a production and export hub for the fuel.
Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy, has some of the best environmental credentials among cleaner-burning fuels. The zero-carbon fuel is made using renewable power from wind or solar sources to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.
India will set up separate manufacturing zones, waive inter-state power transmission charges for 25 years and provide priority connectivity to electric grids to green hydrogen and ammonia producers in a bid to incentivise production, the federal power ministry said.
The five million tonnes production target is half of that of the European Union, which plans to produce 10 million tonnes of hydrogen from renewable energy by 2030.
While green hydrogen is not currently made in India on a commercial scale, the country's richest men Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani have announced plans to produce it. 
India, with a population more than three times larger than the EU, has a much lower per capita energy consumption, but among the fastest rates of energy demand growth in the world.
Mayank Bansal, chief commercial officer of ReNew Power, said the incentives announced by India could help lower cost of hydrogen manufacturing.
""Currently, manufacturing green hydrogen is a costly proposition and in cognizance of this, the government has correctly waived off inter-state transmission charges,"" Bansal said in a statement.
India's Power Minister RK Singh said on Wednesday green hydrogen manufacturers would also be allowed to transmit unused electricity to the grid.
The incentives announced on Thursday are the first part of India's national hydrogen policy. The government has not said when the rest will be released.
India also plans to provide federal financial support to set up electrolysers, as it wants to make the use of green hydrogen mandatory for refineries and fertiliser plants.

For a full story, see
SUPPORT PACKAGES 
- ""There are segments of the economy still struggling. I will therefore provide targeted help for our workers and businesses in these sectors through a S$500 million ($372.61 million) jobs and business support package."" 
- ""I recognise the immediate concerns of businesses and households and will provide significant additional support ... these amount to a significant package of S$560 million to help Singaporeans with their utility bills, children's education, and daily essentials.""
SPENDING AND REVENUE
- ""On the expenditure side, our needs are significant and growing. By 2030 we expect government expenditures to increase to more than 20% of GDP. Most of this increase in spending will go to healthcare.""
- ""We will set aside S$6 billion to maintain a multi layer public health defense. This is necessary for us to respond nimbly and confidently to the evolving COVID-19 situation."" 
- ""On the revenue side we would not have enough to cover additional spending needs... This is why we will make significant enhancements in our tax system in this budget."" 
WEALTH TAXES
- ""Wealth taxes are therefore needed to build a fairer society where everyone can aspire to succeed, regardless of their backgrounds ... Ideally, we would want to tax the net wealth of individuals. But such a tax is not easy to implement.""
- ""I will increase the property tax rates or non owner-occupied residential properties which includes investment properties. For such properties, I will increase the property tax rates from 10 to 20% ... to 12 to 36% of all non owner-occupied residential properties.
- ""When fully implemented, they will raise our property tax revenue by about $380 million a year.""
- ""I will also tax luxury cars at a higher rate to make our vehicle tax system more progressive. I will introduce an additional RFP (request for proposal) for cars at a rate of 220% for the portion of open market value in excess of $80,000."" 
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
""I also understand the concern that Singaporeans have about the GST increase taking place at the same time as rising prices. I have therefore decided to delay the GST increase to 2023 and to stagger the increase over two steps. The first increase will take place on first January 2023, from 7 to 8%. And the second increase on first January 2024, from 8 to 9%."" 
CORPORATE AND INCOME TAXES
""I will therefore increase the top marginal personal income tax, or PIT rate, with effect from the year of assessment 2020. For the portion of chargeable income in excess of $500,000 up to $1 million will be taxed at 23%, while that in excess of $1 million will be taxed at 24% both up from 22% today. This increase is expected to affect the top 1.2% of personal income taxpayers and will raise $170 million of additional tax revenue per year.
-""Our corporate tax system will need to be updated due to global tax developments.""
""What this means is that if such an MNE (multinational enterprise) were to have an effective tax rate of less than 15% in Singapore at the group level, other jurisdictions such as its home jurisdiction can collect the difference up to 15%.""
""We will adjust our tax system in response ... We are exploring a top-up tax called the Minimum Effective Tax Rate, or METR. The METR will top up the MNE group'ss effective tax rate
in Singapore to 15%.""
INVESTMENT AREAS
- ""This budget will set up the key changes we must make to invest in new capabilities we must take to invest in new capabilities, advance our green transition, review and strengthen our social compact and develop a faired and more resilient structure.""
- ""We will also invest in future technologies like 6G, to ride the next communications and connectivity wave."" 
- ""Alongside infrastructure improvements I will set aside an additional S$200 million offer the next few years to enhance schemes and build digital capabilities in our businesses and workers.""
FOREIGN EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES
- ""Let me emphasise that Singapore will continue to stay open and welcome talent from around the world. The adjustments in our foreign worker policies apply mainly to the broad middle of the workforce."" 
- ""We will update the framework for employment pass (EP) holders... From September this year the minimum qualifying salary for new EP applicants will be raise from the current S$4,500 to S$5,000. For the financial sector, which has a higher salary norms, this will be raised from the current S$5,000 to S$5,500.""
- ""We will refine how we assess EP applications to improve the complementarily and diversity of our foreign workforce and also to increase certainty and transparency of businesses.""
- ""All of us, businesses, consumers and taxpayers will have to do our part and contribute to uplifting our lower wage workers. I recognise that some firms may need time to adjust ... Others may find it difficult to raise prices in the short term to support the wage increases.""
- ""I would therefore introduce the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme, or PWCS, to provide transitional support for businesses."" 
- ""Under the PWCS, the government will co-fund the wage increases of lower wage workers between 2022 and 2026. For workers earning up to S$2,500 the PWCS co-funding rate will be 50% in the first two years 30% In the next two years before tapering to 15% in 2026."" 
- ""We will spend an average of $1 billion per year over the next five years or $9 billion in total for the PWCS ... It is a significant increase and it reflects our shared commitment to uplift our lower wage workers.""
GREEN COMMITMENTS
- ""We believe we can bring forward our net zero timeline. We will therefore raise our ambition to achieve net zero emissions by or around mid-century.""
- ""The path towards net zero will entail significant economic restructuring and changes in how we live and work in the future. Everyone ...will face difficulty choices. Costly investments may be required."" 
- ""We aim to issue $35 billion in green bonds by 2030 to fund public sector green infrastructure. This will include bonds issued by the government as well as statutory boards."" 

- ""To move decisively to achieve our new net-zero ambition. You will need a higher carbon tax. I will therefore raise our carbon tax to $25 per tonne in 2024 and 2025 and $45 per tonne in 2026 and 2027 with a view to reaching 50 to $80 per tonne by 2030. The current tax of $5 per tonne remain will remain unchanged until 2023.""

Investing.com -- The U.S. and Russia will meet for talks over Ukraine again next week, but not before Russia has staged some nuclear and missile exercises later this weekend.  Stocks are set for a weak bounce from Thursday's sell-off, with eyes on Deere (NYSE:DE) earnings and DuPont (NYSE:DD)'s latest exercise in corporate restructuring. The ECB's hawks continue to find their voice, and U.K. retail sales also point toward another rate hike soon. Crude oil prices slip, meanwhile, on reports of progress in talks to lift sanctions on Iran. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 18th February. 
1. Russian saber-rattling gets louder
Russia will hold exercises to test the readiness of its nuclear and ballistic missiles on Saturday, in the latest extravagant show of military strength.
The drills, which the Kremlin says are long-planned, will involve its armed forces in the Southern Military District (opposite Ukraine) and its Black Sea Fleet. They come at a time when the U.S. is still warning that a Russian invasion of neighboring Ukraine may be imminent. Russia says it has no plans to invade but, in a document published by the Foreign Ministry on Thursday, again warned of possible military action if NATO does not grant its demand that Ukraine never be allowed to join the alliance.
U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is to meet his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov one more time for talks to resolve the crisis next Thursday, the State Department said late on Thursday.
2.  Celanese  in $11 billion deal for DuPont Assets
Celanese (NYSE:CE) is set to buy DuPont’s mobility and materials unit for $11 billion, the latest reshuffling of DuPont’s portfolio as it focuses on electronics, automotive and water.
DuPont has already spun off its nutrition and biosciences unit and agreed to sell other businesses including. It’s also been an active buyer, agreeing to buy Laird Performance Materials for $2.3 billion and engineering materials maker Rogers (NYSE:ROG) for $5.2 billion.
The deal is expected to close around the end of 2022.
3. Stocks set to open higher on hopes for last-ditch resolution
U.S. stock markets are set to open modestly higher later, rebounding from Thursday’s losses that were triggered by fresh fears of war in eastern Europe, as well as some worryingly weak guidance from companies making their quarterly reports.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 104 points, or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.7%/. In all three cases, that’s not even a quarter of what was lost on Thursday.
Earnings season has more or less run its course now but has been distinguished by the regular and violent reactions to companies who have either missed consensus forecasts or warned of slowing growth in the months ahead. The trend has hit not just ‘profitless tech’ but also market darlings such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) and, on Thursday, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Deere, Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) and  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) report earnings later.
4. Europe’s rate path edges higher
The trajectory for interest rates in Europe nudged higher overnight, with another European Central Bank policy maker – Slovakia’s Peter Kazimir - coming out in favor of ending the bank’s asset purchases in August to give itself ‘flexibility’ for interest rate hikes thereafter.
As of today, the ECB is still – just about – holding to the notion that it won’t have to raise interest rates this year. However, an increasing number of policymakers are now questioning that. The influential German board member Isabel Schnabel earlier this week issued a strongly worded warning about the inflationary impact on house prices from the ECB’s current stance.
Elsewhere in Europe, U.K. retail sales bounced back strongly in January, keeping the U.K. on course for a third successive rate hike at the Bank of England’s next policy meeting in March.
5. Crude slips further on Iran optimism; U.S. rig count due
Crude oil prices slid on reports that Iran and the West are closer to a deal that would lift sanctions on the Islamic Republic in return for it abandoning further progress on its nuclear program.
Analysts say a deal would pave the way for the return of as much as 1 million barrels of oil a day to world markets, although its hard to predict the net effect as there is no reliable information readily available on the ability of Iran’s oil industry to ramp up production, and much of its current output is already leaking out into world markets - notably to China - via unofficial channels.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 2.3% at $89.72 a barrel, while Brent crude futures were down 2.1% at $91.06 a barrel. The Baker Hughes rig count and the CFTC’s weekly positioning data follow later Friday."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore will begin implementing a long-flagged increase to its goods and services tax next year, its finance minister said in his budget speech on Friday, while also announcing a slew of tax hikes aimed at higher income groups. 
The moves come as Singapore emerges from a pandemic-induced economic slump, but walks a tight rope in maintaining its attractiveness as a global financial hub while guarding against local concerns about rising wealth inequality and rising costs of living.
GST will rise to 8% from January next year and to 9% in 2024, Lawrence Wong said, from 7% now. The government also plans to increase income taxes for high earners, hike taxes on residential properties and impose higher levies on luxury cars.
""These tax adjustments will help to raise additional revenue and also contribute to a fairer revenue structure,"" Wong said. 
Singapore has been seeking to raise revenues to fund future spending that it estimates could reach more than 20% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030, especially as its ramps up spending on healthcare in one of the fastest ageing countries. 
Over the last two years, the government has committed close to S$100 billion to cushion its people, businesses and the economy from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Wong announced a further S$500 million ($372 million) package to support jobs and businesses as part of his budget proposals and proposed to set aside S$560 million to help Singaporeans deal with the rising cost of living. 
The government expects an overall deficit of S$5 billion for 2021 and Wong unexpectedly forecast a deficit of S$3 billion for 2022. Total expenditure for 2022 was forecast at S$102.4 billion versus S$98.4 billion the previous year. 
Analysts had expected a return to a surplus. 
The budget was more expansionary than expected, said MUFG analyst Jeff Ng, adding that the government was addressing the still uneven recovery of the economy. 
Singapore's economy, which is highly reliant on global trade, is expected to expand 3-5% this year as it continues to reopen its borders and ease COVID-19 restrictions. 
The economy grew 7.6% in 2021 after a record contraction in 2020. 
Still, recovery in some sectors such as those in aviation and tourism is expected to take longer as virus concerns linger. 
Wong said the government will spend a total of about S$9 billion ($6.70 billion) over the next five years on measures to help its low-wage workers. It will also spend on schemes to build digital capabilities for businesses and workers. 
The government will further tighten its foreign worker policy and increase salary thresholds for issuing work visas.
As part of its ambition to achieve net zero emissions, the government will also increase carbon taxes from 2024.
Wong said the corporate tax system would need to be updated, following a global agreement on a minimum corporate tax rate, and was considering a move that would increase multi-national companies' effective tax rate to 15%. 
Singapore, a low-tax jurisdiction where several multinationals including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have regional headquarters, has a rate of 17% but provides incentives and schemes which reduce the effective rate. 
Wong said the government was closely monitoring the risk of rising inflation, which has been driven by a recovery in global demand, continuing supply chain disruptions, and especially by rising energy prices.
The government has set aside a S$6.6 billion package to help cushion the impact of the GST hike. 
The Monetary Authority of Singapore tightened its policy settings in January in its first out-of-cycle move in seven years as the economic recovery gained traction and price rose. It is widely expected to tighten again at its scheduled policy meeting in April.

The city-state's 2022 core inflation is forecast at 2-3% and headline inflation at 2.5–3.5%.

""It is an unquestionably ambitious timetable, but it is also a major and important project for international tax justice,"" Lindner said when asked if he still supports the deadline.
Last October, nearly 140 countries reached a deal on a minimum tax rate of 15% on multinational companies to make it harder for companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to park profits in low-tax countries.

Earlier on Friday, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he was ""really asking for a swift implementation"" of the agreement as he also backed the 2023 deadline.
The timetable is widely considered to be ambitious, not least because U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is struggling to pass legislation that would bring U.S. law in line with the global deal.

LONDON (Reuters) -Inflation is raging, interest rates are rising and bonds look like treacherous investment waters - all of which make arguments for a dip back into the fixed income vortex intriguing at least.
To be sure, it's been a lousy year so far for most asset classes aside from oil and commodities. 
But the most interest rate sensitive securities, or long ""duration"" plays, have been under the cosh. Government bonds have lost 5-6% while U.S. technology stocks are down more than 10% - and fund managers are heavily underweight in both, with a overweight bias for global equities and cash.
Mutual fund data shows two consecutive months of outflows from global bond funds - a cumulative $32 billion exit for the year to date.
Spiking oil prices, tensions over war in eastern Europe and central banks mapping a return to pre-pandemic monetary settings all stir the water for investors who are once again fearful of an end to the 40-year bond bull market.
But JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s long-term strategists take a different tack and screen out all the turbulent news, macro forecasts and tactical trading views to model how mixed portfolios would perform a 10-year view based on past performance.
Jan Loeys and team this week updated their view of prospective 10-year returns for a standard 60/40 equity/bonds portfolio and said the recent shakeout in asset prices lifted their expected returns significantly from a year ago. 
Dispensing with different takes on macro drivers - which may be valid but impossible to predict with any certainty over 10 years - the JPM team insisted the best guide to bond returns over a subsequent decade has historically been the prevailing yield. 
The jump of more than a percentage point over the past year in yields on U.S. aggregate bond indices - which include Treasury and agency bonds as well as investment grade and high yield corporate debt - now put today's yield at some 2.7%. 
Crucially, this makes them positive again in real or inflation-adjusted terms when using 10-year market inflation expectations of 2.4% as a guide.
Along with a pullback in U.S. stock multiples that improves their annual return outlook over a next decade to 4.8%, JPM reckons a mixed 60/40 portfolio's prospects were now 4% per annum. That's a percentage point higher than last year and 1.6% positive in real terms - even if still unattractive historically and far below the real 5% average of the past century.
But their conclusion was this improvement in mixed returns may be enough to dissuade investors from the TINA (there is no alternative) phenomenon that has at least partly driven the equity price boom as bond yields were floored in recent years.
""The urge to overweight equities to bring portfolio returns closer to one's requirements has been softened,"" they told clients. ""At the margin (it's) a reason to start rebalancing towards bonds, without having to be in a hurry.""
BOUNDARY CONDITIONS?
While that's hardly consensus, the view does chime with some fundamental arguments - such as central banks acting swiftly now; peaking inflation rates and improved real returns; cooling growth and flattening yield curves; and the idea that any positive real yields in ""safe assets"" are attractive right now to risk averse funds.
Dynamics in the ""defined benefit"" pension fund industry, for example, were widely cited last year as a major factor steamrolling the yield curve and weighing on long-term yields as outsize equity gains hastened full-funding status and a mass ""de-risking"" of portfolios into bonds alone.
For more tactical active managers, there are also signs that this latest volatile period may have overdone the bond gloom.
PIMCO chief investment officer Dan Ivascyn said this week that his portfolios remained underweight bond duration but valuations had now become more interesting. ""I don't think we're too far away from levels where we'll begin to reduce that duration underweight.""
Even chartists mapping 10-year Treasury yields think calling the end of the 40-year bond bull market would premature at least.
The main criticism of that long-term JPM view of course is that it relies on past performance as a guide - reasonable unless you think we're in for a paradigm shift in the world economy where bond yields and credit spreads have nowhere to go but up.
Newton Investment Management Chief Executive Euan Munro wrote this month that markets had hit such ""boundary conditions"" and that should force a rethink of 60/40 portfolios towards a more diverse and actively managed fixed income portion at least.
His main bone of contention with modelling based on historical price performance was that it did in fact assume a questionable view the future repeated the recent past.
""Those that apply such an approach are making - or at least implying - quite a detailed forecast of future market conditions, whether they realise it or not.""

36,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 05:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Japan's domestic investors are selling foreign equities and bonds aggressively this year, on concerns over monetary tightening by the world's major central banks and its impact across global equity and bond markets.
Domestic investors have sold a total of 1.58 trillion yen ($13.72 billion) worth overseas bonds and equities this year, according to Japan's Ministry of Finance data till the end of last week. 
They sold 385 billion yen of equities and 1.2 trillion yen in bond markets, the data showed. The total selling of 1.58 trillion yen has already surpassed last year's entire sales of 1.5 trillion yen.

While the major central banks are moving into inflation-fighting mode, and starting to lift their ultra-low borrowing costs, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is in no hurry to follow suit. 
Inflation in Japan remains distant from BOJ's 2% target, its deputy governor Masazumi Wakatabe said earlier this month.
""Due to the combined effect of rising global yields, Japanese government bonds (JGBs) now offer more attractive returns to local investors,"" Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING, said in a report. 
""Combined with the risk of greater losses on bonds denominated in U.S. dollar and euro, this could make JGBs an increasingly attractive alternative.""
Analysts also said currency hedging costs have increased for domestic investors, due to the rise in interest rates in overseas markets.
Another reason for the drop in Japanese investments in foreign equities is the relatively bigger declines in overseas markets. The Nikkei index has fallen 5% this year, compared to the MSCI World's 6% drop.
Last year, Japanese investors sold 3.61 trillion yen of U.S. equities but bought U.S. bonds worth 6.85 trillion yen. During the same time, they sold equities and bonds worth 538 billion yen and 1.76 trillion yen, respectively, in the European Union.

In December 518,000 NEVs were sold in China, increasing 159.5% year on year.
China has ambitious goals in promoting NEVs as part of efforts to curb air pollution and believes the industry has matured enough to be driven by demand rather than subsidies.
Total automotive sales in the world's biggest car market rose 0.9% in January from a year earlier to 2.53 million vehicles, their first uptick after eight consecutive months of declines, according to CAAM.
In January, demand kept increasing before the lunar new year and the supply of chips continued to improve, CAAM said in a statement. But sales growth slowed thanks to impact of COVID epidemic in some areas, it added.
A global shortage of chips, used in everything from brake sensors to power steering and entertainment systems, has led automakers around the world to cut or suspend production, pushing up prices and hurting sales.

On Monday, data from CPCA showed that U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc sold 59,845 China-made vehicles in January. 
Tesla is the only foreign automaker among the top ten best selling NEV brands in China thanks to fierce competition, as local manufacturers such as Nio (NYSE:NIO), Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) Inc and Li Auto Inc cater to Chinese consumers with products more tailor made to local tastes.

38,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 05:05AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Tensions over Ukraine are set to keep markets on edge in the week ahead while U.S. consumer data and results from major U.S. retailers will give fresh insights into shoppers' minds as well as inflation and supply chains. 
PMI data could show how major economies are faring as governments dial back on COVID restrictions while flattening yield curves demand attention as the U.S. Federal Reserve's key March meeting draws closer. Meanwhile, by how much will New Zealand's central bank hike rates? 
Here's your week ahead in markets from Wayne Cole in Sydney, Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Sujata Rao, Dhara Ranasinghe and Karin Strohecker in London.
1/SHELLING AND TALKING 
Tensions over Ukraine between Moscow and Washington and other Western capitals have dominated markets in recent days, and there is little sign of this abating as major Western powers warn of a possible imminent Russian invasion.
Diplomatic efforts are continuing at full steam, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accepting an invitation to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov late in the week - provided Russia does not invade Ukraine.
Ukraine will also take centre-stage when some world leaders converge on Germany over the weekend for the annual Munich Security Conference.
Meanwhile on the ground in Ukraine, the pressure is mounting: Kyiv government forces and Russian-backed rebels in the country's east traded fresh accusations of shelling and other ceasefire violations, after artillery and mortar attacks on Thursday.

2/A GAME OF CONFIDENCE 
After blowout retail sales numbers, U.S. consumers are back in focus as markets parse consumer confidence data and watch a flood of earnings from major retailers for a readout on how soaring inflation is affecting shoppers.
January consumer confidence readings showed expectations for short-term growth ebbing, viewed by some economists as a warning sign against the backdrop of a stock market rout. Stocks have remained volatile in February as investors digest a hawkish shift from the Fed and worry over a potential escalation between Russia and Ukraine.
Earnings from retailers will add to the mix:  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), Macy's (NYSE:M) and Footlocker are among those scheduled to report fourth quarter results. In addition to bottom lines, investors will be listening out for how firms are managing the supply chain crisis and their views on inflation.

3/INFLATION SCARE VS GROWTH SCARE 
Flattening bond yield curves -- when gaps between short- and long borrowing costs narrow -- are grabbing attention these days. The U.S. 2-year/10-year curve compressed recently below 40 basis points, the flattest since mid-2020. Canada's curve narrowed to 22 bps, and the UK curve is a whisker off inversion.
An inversion, when short-dated yields rise above the longer segment, is often - though not always - followed by an economic recession. 
Bond traders appear to believe that central bankers, who earlier let inflation run hot, will now rush in with aggressive, front-loaded interest rate hikes, potentially causing a recession.
A BofA survey showed just 12% of investors expect an economic recession and most remain overweight equities. But if inflation continues to surprise to the upside, those bond yield curves may continue their path towards inversion.

4/ RATE HIKE - BUT BY HOW MUCH?
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is considered certain to raise the 0.75% cash rate for a third time in five months when policy makers meet on Wednesday.
The only question is whether Governor Adrian Orr and others will stick to quarter point moves or up the ante to 50 basis points, after recent data showed inflation and labour markets running hot. 
Policy makers have long expressed a preference for gradual moves, but swaps still imply a one-in-three chance of 50 basis points. The RBNZ is also likely to project a hike at every meeting this year, and perhaps an ultimate peak of 3.0%.

5/ LIVING WITH COVID
    As the Omicron-COVID variant surged in late 2021, many major economies chose not to return to the strictest lockdown restrictions. Now with cases easing in Europe, governments appear more confident in removing more measures. 
    Germany has flagged an easing of restrictions soon; those testing positive for COVID in Britain won't have to self-isolate from late Feb.
    Flash February PMIs due over the coming days -- euro area and UK ones are out on Monday -- could show how such developments are lifting economic activity. Sentiment in Germany has already received a boost and further positive news could encourage central banks to unwind post-pandemic stimulus fast.

    Still, policymakers will watch how other governments fare. Hong Kong and mainland China, for example, aim to suppress the virus - a strategy that could have global repercussions if it pressures supply chains.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's Eni became the latest energy group to benefit from the oil and gas boom as it posted its best result since 2012 to provide cash to cover returns to investors and also fund its green drive.
The group swung to an adjusted net profit of 4.74 billion euros ($5.4 billion) last year from a loss of 758 million euros in 2020 as surging energy prices boosted its upstream business despite lower volumes.
Production of oil and gas fell 3% to 1.682 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2021 mainly due to maintenance and lower output at its mature fields.
""Our upstream segment has kept generating the financial resources needed to fund our decarbonization strategy,"" Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi said on Friday.
Eni, which has pledged carbon neutrality by 2050, is due to present a new business plan in March.
Unlike some of its peers Eni is hanging on to lucrative fossil fuels to help fund its green shift while also spinning off assets like its Norwegian Vaar Energi venture, listed this week.
The group is teaming up with BP (NYSE:BP) in Angola in a joint venture and is listing part of its retail and renewables unit in what could be one of Italy's biggest IPOs this year.
""During 2021, we delivered excellent results and accelerated the pace of our transformation strategy,"" Descalzi said.
BOUNCING BACK
In the fourth quarter Eni's adjusted net profit came in at 2.11 billion euros from 50 million euros a year ago to beat a 1.94 billion euro consensus. 
Cash flow from operations before working capital changes at replacement cost jumped 192% in the period to 4.6 billion euros to allow it to cover 1.8 billion euros of investments and confirm its dividend policy. 
The results reflect the industry's bounce back last year after a troubled 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic triggered a collapse in energy demand and prices.
This month larger peers like BP and Shell (LON:RDSa) reported bumper profits thanks to higher energy prices, pledging to return more cash to shareholders.
Eni said it had paid out 2.8 billion euros to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.
""We see the outlook for 2022... remaining positive for the E&P sector, mostly thanks to a solid oil price scenario,"" said Italian broker IMI (LON:IMI).

One cloud on the horizon is a potential cash call at beleaguered energy service group Saipem in which Eni holds around 30%. 
At 0852 GMT Eni shares were up 1.1% while the European oil index was up 0.3%. ($1 = 0.8793 euros)

NAIROBI (Reuters) - A key IMF-supported programme funding military wages and other essential services in Somalia could expire in May if there are any further delays to elections, the chief International Monetary Fund representative in the country said.
Riven by civil war since 1991, the impoverished Horn of Africa nation has paid its bills since 2017 thanks to the IMF as it slowly rebuilds its institutions despite a ferocious Islamist insurgency.
The current three-year budget programme, worth nearly $400 million, is also a required part of a deal to slash Somalia's debt from more than $5 billion to around a 10th of that. 
But the programme will terminate automatically if a new government is not in place to conclude a review of it by May 17, Laura Jaramillo, the IMF mission chief for Somalia, told Reuters.
""It will impact the government's functioning and could have broader implications,"" she said, referring to the risk that much-delayed elections are not completed in time to renew the deal.
Somalia's Finance Minister Abdirahman Beileh, however, dismissed those concerns. 
""We are confident that elections will be concluded in time so as to not affect the reform programme,"" he said. ""There have been no major challenges in meeting the IMF conditions thus far, and we do not anticipate any.""
Elections had been scheduled for a year ago but were delayed when President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed tried to extend his four-year term by two years, a move thwarted by parliament.
DELAY HITS FINANCES
Voting for lawmakers - who will then choose the president - began on Nov. 1. It was supposed to end on Dec. 24, but now may finish on Feb. 25. 
The delay, exacerbated by a months-long dispute between the president and prime minister, has already hit finances.
Somalia expected $170 million in budget support last year but only got $38 million, the IMF said. The government covered the shortfall with new allocations that the IMF gave all members under pressure from COVID-19. But those could run out soon.
""That is when we will start to see the pressures mounting,"" Jaramillo said.
Expiry of the IMF programme would also halt Somalia's journey to debt forgiveness. Under the 2020 deal, approved by the World Bank and the IMF, Somalia's debt was reduced to $3.7 billion, or 63% of GDP, from $5.2 billion or 89% of GDP.
If completed next year, debt should drop to $557 million or 6% of gross domestic product.
""It is a dramatic debt forgiveness and Somalia is close to reaching that goal,"" said Jaramillo.
Somalia's economy is expected to have grown by 2% last year, the IMF said, thanks to household consumption driven by increased remittances and new export markets for goods. It should expand by 3.2% this year if political challenges are resolved, the fund said.

Apart from budgetary support, the IMF programme also allows other development partners to offer financing to Somalia.
The debt relief programme has enabled the government to run a cash transfer scheme to vulnerable households battling drought, COVID-19 and insecurity.

In November, the research centre had forecast the property market would normalise in 2023 following an easing of mortgage rules to revive a key sector that accounts for about 10% of gross domestic product (GDP) and employs 2.8 million people.
But the COVID-19 outbreak driven by the Omicron variant that emerged late last year had slowed domestic activity, said Vichai Viratkapan, head of the Government Housing Bank's real estate information centre.
""Rising inflation is also impacting people's income and purchasing power,"" he said. Inflation hit a nine-month high of 3.23% in January.
However, the property sector had bottomed out and should be supported by the relaxed rules and government measures, he said, adding the number of newly built houses and apartments were expected to rise by 35% to 105,000 this year.
But demand from foreign buyers will remain low this year due to the coronavirus outbreak, he said.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Kazimir said the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) could end in August but this should not be seen as paving the way for an immediate interest rate hike.
""Trading activity weakens in August so that would bea good natural timing for ending the program,” he said.
He was echoing French governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who said bond purchases could end between July and September. Board member Isabel Schnabel also saw an argument for ending the APP.

Like Villeroy, Kazimir said the ECB should change its guidance, which currently says its rates will be raised shortly after bond purchases end.
“It’s time to start thinking about separating the two,”Kazimir said.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Uncertainty over the pace of monetary policy will mean a volatile first half for risk assets followed by an upward path for equities in the second half of the year, asset managers said.
Markets will adjust well to rate hikes, but take longer to ""absorb, digest and understand"" quantitative tightening as central banks withdraw monetary stimulus, said Antonio Cavarero, head of investments at Generali (MI:GASI) Insurance Asset Management (GIAM).
""If central banks move up higher in the scale of hawkishness, then this might create more volatility and we will probably face more difficult markets,"" Cavarero, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Thursday.
As of December 2020, GIAM managed 470 billion euro ($534 billion) in assets.
Cavarero said he was more confident about the second half of the year when there should be less uncertainty around central bank action. 
Given this scenario of ""a clearer view about the future"", Cavarero said he favours value stocks, including energy, banks and those benefiting from economic reopening following the pandemic. He also backed long-dated bonds as yields rise.
Credit markets would require investing discipline and selection as higher volatility pressures spreads in both high-yield and investment-grade debt, he said.
Kevin Headland, co-chief investment strategist at Manulife Investment Management, said it was important to consider central banks were not ""raising rates from 'normal' levels to combat an overheated economy or runaway inflation"".
Rather they are removing the extra stimulus that was put in place to support economies at the height of lockdowns to contain the pandemic.
Headland was ""constructive"" on equities and U.S. high-yield or lower-rated investment-grade bonds within corporate credit.
Fed officials are not set on any particular pace of rate hikes, according to the minutes of the Jan. 25-26 policy meeting.
DBS Bank chief economist Taimur Baig expected the Federal Reserve to manage demand-side risks with a gradual cycle of four rate hikes, as he said inflation expectations in the U.S. were well-anchored.
Cavarero said the Fed knows the window to raise rates is limited, and expected the U.S. central bank to increase them ""much faster"" than in previous cycles.

The European Central Bank should wind down net bond-buying in the summer, while giving itself more flexibility on the timetable for any subsequent interest-rate increase, according to Governing Council member Peter Kazimir.
The Slovak central bank chief said the tool -- which was created to stave off deflation after Europe’s debt crisis and was expanded during the pandemic -- has outlived its usefulness. The ECB doesn’t have a firm end date for its regular purchases, known as APP.
“The risks this instrument was designed to address have subsided, while on the other hand the negative side effects are becoming more significant,” Kazimir said Thursday in an interview. “Trading activity weakens in August so that would be a good natural timing for ending the program.”
Facing unprecedented euro-area inflation, ECB officials have fallen into agreement on the need to pare back support measures that include record-low interest rates and a second bond-buying program deployed when Covid-19 struck and due to end in March. Where they differ is on the speed at which the shift should happen.
Kazimir’s proposal for ending APP is the most specific since ECB President Christine Lagarde signaled a tougher stance to soaring prices this month. His timing chimes with Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who said this week that purchases could finish in the third quarter.
Both officials suggest a change to the ECB’s forward guidance that currently calls for interest rates to rise “shortly” after asset purchases are concluded. Doing so would provide more “optionality,” according to Villeroy.
“It’s time to start thinking about separating the two,” Kazimir said. “Phasing out asset purchases should free our hands and give us room to find the most appropriate timing for returning to rates as the standard monetary-policy tool.”
Italian bonds pared declines, with the 10-year yield one basis-point higher at 1.85%. Money markets maintained wagers on a quarter-point rate hike by October.
Other officials have urged caution in reacting to inflation that many economists still predict will come in below the ECB’s 2% target in the next two years. Spain’s Pablo Hernandez de Cos said Thursday he sees “no reason to overreact.” 
Chief Economist Philip Lane echoed that line later on, while also saying the ECB shouldn’t tolerate under-reactions to emerging inflation risks. 
By contrast, other Governing Council members are keener to follow the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve in raising rates. They include Germany’s Joachim Nagel and the Netherlands’ Klaas Knot, who’ve floated the idea of a hike as soon as this year.
Investors are betting on two quarter-point increases by the end of 2022, though Latvia’s Martins Kazaks said this week in an interview that such a scenario is “somewhat too harsh.” Liftoff is nevertheless “quite likely” this year, he said. 
The challenge for policy makers is that inflation is being driven by factors including high energy prices and supply-chain bottlenecks that have lasted longer than initially thought. While the pressure is still expected to ease, unpredictable events like the tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine are muddying the outlook.   
“Our road-map toward monetary tightening still has some blank points that represent risks, and we’ll need more data that will decide whether or not a rate increase will be needed already this year,” Kazimir said. “I have no doubts that we’re headed toward monetary tightening, but I’d advocate for a path of gradual steps.”

In a joint notice, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and other regulators announced 18 measures in a notice involving fiscal, financial, environmental and more policies to prop up the industrial sector in the world's second-largest economy. 
The NDRC said the authorities would ensure supply and stabilise prices of primary products and key raw materials, including iron ore and fertiliser. 
They also pledged to reinforce futures and spot market supervision of commodities and strengthen price monitoring.
China sought with a raft of measures recently to cool rapid growth in iron ore, a key steelmaking ingredient, to maintain market order and protect downstream users. 
The most-traded iron ore futures on Dalian Commodity Exchange posted the biggest weekly decline in nearly two years.
The state planner said it will encourage companies to invest in certain domestic iron ore and copper projects and boost use of scrap metal. 
Distributed solar power projects in central and eastern regions will also be encouraged, the NDRC said, adding that it would develop large-scale wind power and solar power bases in Gobi desert regions. 

The economic planner said it would guide the financial system to transfer profits to the real economy this year, pushing state-owned banks to lend more to manufacturers and back major projects to cut carbon emissions. 
The country will also speed up construction of new infrastructure projects, and increase financial support for traditional trading firms, cross-border e-commerce companies and others, authorities said in the notice.

Markets breathed a sigh of relief after the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken agreed to a meeting with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, raising hopes of a diplomatic solution to the standoff over Ukraine. 
U.S. stock index futures gained half a percent, U.S. Treasury yields have rebounded from New York session lows and safe-haven currencies such as the yen retreated as the positive sentiment calmed jangled investors' nerves.
But markets remain far from convinced that a diplomatic solution will be found quickly with Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed rebels in the country's east trading fresh accusations of shelling and other ceasefire violations.
Reflecting the nervousness in broader markets, a gauge of implied volatility in the stock market is within touching distance of a one-year high while currency markets are strewn with large options contracts designed to shield investors in case markets fluctuate wildly if a conflict breaks out.
Away from the incessant beating of war drums, fresh comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials also provided no relief to markets before arguably the most important central bank policy meeting of the year in March.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said the Fed needs to move more aggressively to remove policy accommodation than it did following the Great Recession.
Her comments reflect an array of views among Fed policymakers in recent days with some officials supporting a measured pace of rate hikes while St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard, among the notable hawks, supports a full percentage point increase in rates by July.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Prospects of tighter U.S. monetary policy continue to drive up yields for Japan's super-long government bonds, putting to test the central bank's resolve to defend its key 10-year target.
The 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield moved back below an implicit 0.25% cap the Bank of Japan sets around its 0% target, after the central bank stepped in on Monday with a rare offer to buy an unlimited amount of the tenor at the level.
But 30-year and 40-year yields have crept up to multi-year highs, drawing investors' attention to the BOJ's response and how long it could keep defending the key 10-year target.
WHEN WOULD THE BOJ INTERVENE AGAIN?
The BOJ's focus is to avoid the 10-year JGB yield from rising above 0.25% and push up borrowing costs too much. It could step in again even before the yield hits 0.25%, if the rise in yields speeds up and risks breaching the line.
WILL THE BOJ INTERVENE TO CAP OTHER MATURITY YIELDS?
Under yield curve control, the BOJ seeks to control the shape of the curve by pinning short-term rates and the 10-year JGB yield. It does not set any target level for other zones.
As such, the BOJ likely won't intervene to stem rises in yields with maturities other than the 10-year, unless the moves could threaten to push up the 10-year yield above 0.25%.
For now, the BOJ sees the recent steepening of the yield curve as a desirable move as it widens the margin financial institutions earn from loans and investment.
WHAT'S NEXT?
If upward pressure on the 10-year yield continues to build up, the BOJ can conduct fixed-rate bond buying operations for as many consecutive days as necessary - the most powerful tool available to contain an unwelcome rise in borrowing costs.
The central bank also has the option of conducting an unscheduled bond-buying operation, or ramp up the amount of scheduled bond purchases released once every quarter.
HOW MUCH FIREPOWER DOES THE BOJ HAVE LEFT?
After years of heavy buying to pump money into the economy, the BOJ owns nearly half of outstanding JGBs. Its strong grip on the market allows it to control yields without ramping up buying much. Theoretically, the central bank can print as much money as it wants to keep buying JGBs to achieve its yield target.
WHAT ARE THE CONSTRAINTS?
The BOJ is chasing two conflicting goals. It wants to protect its yield cap to keep borrowing costs low. But it also hopes to avoid controlling yields too much and roll back recent efforts to breathe life back to a market made dormant by its huge presence.

That means the BOJ probably wants to limit the number of times it intervenes in the market. It will also avoid ramping up bond buying unless doing so becomes absolutely necessary to keep the 10-year yield from breaching 0.25%.
The yen's recent weakening won't deter the BOJ from stepping in to prevent yields from rising. But it may come under pressure to allow yields to rise more, if further yen declines boost import costs and draw public complaints about the rising cost of living.

The budget carrier's net result swung to a profit of 1.88 billion Norwegian crowns ($211.4 million) last year from a loss of 23 billion crowns in 2020.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose almost fourfold to 2.55 billion crowns from 670 million the year before even as the Omicron outbreak affected business in late 2021.
""We are looking forward to welcoming more customers on board heading into the busier spring and summer seasons,"" Norwegian Air Chief Executive Officer Geir Karlsen said in a statement.
""Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) trends show customers are planning and booking earlier in anticipation that the positive recent developments in regards to COVID-19 vaccinations and restrictions will continue in the long term,"" the company said in its earnings report.
The pandemic sent the indebted airline into bankruptcy proceedings from which it emerged in a slimmed-down version in May of last year with no long-distance network and a decimated fleet.
This year, the company plans to increase the number of aircraft in its fleet to 70 from 51 at the end of 2021. At its pre-pandemic peak, Norwegian Air had more than 160 planes.
In the fourth quarter, 3.1 million passengers travelled with Norwegian Air, up from 2.5 million in the third and far more than the 600,000 that flew with the airline in the final quarter of 2020.
Cash and cash equivalents rose to 7.7 billion crowns by the end of the fourth quarter from 7.6 billion three months earlier, Norwegian Air said.
As part of its court-ordered restructuring process, Norwegian Air converted almost all its debt to equity and struck deals with leasing firms to only pay for aircraft when they were actually in use, a so-called power-by-the-hour arrangement.

The company's shares have rise 9.6% so far this year.

55,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 01:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -A handful of Chinese cities are starting to relax down-payment rules for home purchases in a bid to re-ignite buyer interest and put a floor under local economies weakened by a regulatory crackdown on the indebted sector. 
The eastern city of Heze is allowing some home buyers to pay lower down-payments for their purchases, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said late on Thursday, among the first cities easing the borrowing rule.
Regulatory curbs on borrowing have driven China's property sector - a major economic growth driver - into a sharp downturn, squeezing the cash-flow of many developers and chilling buyer sentiment. 
For buyers with no mortgage history, the minimum down-payment ratio has been cut to 20% from 30%, while the ratio for buyers with one home has been lowered to 25%, with bank loans accounting for the rest of the payment, the sources said. 
Local media reported that some banks had agreed to extend more loans in view of the lower down-payment ratio, in a move to help bolster demand. 
""As far as I know, this is the first city cutting the down-payment ratio for mortgage loans,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. ""It signals policy easing in the property sector may have entered a new phase.""
The housing regulator of Heze, a city of 8.79 million in Shandong province, has not officially announced the move. It did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
First-time home-buyers in the southwestern city of Chongqing and Ganzhou city in southern Jiangxi province are also being allowed 20% down-payment ratios, according to the state-backed Shanghai Securities Journal.
The down-payment ratio cuts are in cities which have not implemented curbs on home purchases, the Journal said.
Since late 2021, several cities have taken measures to bolster local property markets such as increasing mortgage loans, lowering mortgage rates and providing subsidies for home purchases.
Earlier this month, China also moved to give real estate firms easier access to presale proceeds from residential projects in escrow accounts, to alleviate their funding stress. 
The easing measures came ahead of China's annual parliamentary meeting as well as the gathering of the largely ceremonial advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in March. 
""After the Two Sessions in early March, we think more local governments (especially higher-tier cities) will roll out demand-side easing,"" said JP Morgan in a note. 
Developers listed in mainland China and Hong Kong rose on Friday, with the CSI 300 Real Estate Index and the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index each up around 2% in early afternoon trade.

Consumer inflation across Japan, including in its capital, is expected to rise in the coming months due to higher energy prices, and as last year's major cuts in cellphone service fees disappear from year-on-year comparison calculations in April.
Tokyo's core consumer price index (CPI), which includes energy but excludes fresh food prices and is a leading indicator of nationwide price trends, was expected to rise 0.4% in February from a year earlier, the poll of 16 economists showed. 
That would mark the sixth month of year-on-year increase and mean that consumer price growth would be picking up from a 0.2% gain in January, when one-off factors such as the abrupt end of a national travel promotion campaign in late 2020 skewed the data.
""Electricity and city gas bills are set to grow faster due to last summer's rising imported fuel prices, such as in LNG (liquefied natural gas),"" economists at SMBC Nikko Securities said, suggesting last year's higher commodity prices give a bigger hit to consumers' wallets with a few months of lag.
""Energy prices compared to the year earlier may jump as much as 20% or more.""
While many analysts forecast Japan's consumer inflation will accelerate in coming months, price rises are still seen modest compared to those in other economies such as the United States.

The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its massive monetary stimulus as nationwide core inflation will likely remain below the central bank's 2% target for the time being.
The government will release February Tokyo CPI data on Feb. 25 at 8:30 a.m. (Feb. 24, 2330 GMT).

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Thailand's economy likely returned to growth in the fourth quarter thanks to robust exports and easing of COVID-19 curbs, but the suspension of a quarantine waiver for foreign tourists probably dented the recovery, a Reuters poll found.
Growth in the tourism-dependent economy rebounded last quarter to 0.7% year-on-year after shrinking 0.3% in the July-September period, according to the median forecast of 12 economists polled Feb. 11-17.
On a quarterly basis, gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to grow by a seasonally-adjusted 1.4% during the same period after contracting 1.1% the previous quarter. The data will be released on Feb. 21.
Forecasts ranged from 0.4% to 1.9%, highlighting the uncertainties surrounding the recovery in the Southeast Asia's second largest economy from the pandemic.
""We expect the strong improvement in merchandise exports would help the economy to slowly return to expansion in the fourth quarter,"" said Charnon Boonnuch, an economist at Nomura.
""However, with the still-sluggish recovery in foreign tourist arrivals despite the border reopening in November, we expect the recovery to be gradual and highly uneven.""
Still, growth is yet to return to pre-pandemic levels and the recovery remains fragile, with the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant weighing on the tourism industry.
Even with rising vaccination rates and the gradual easing of global travel restrictions, only a fraction of foreign tourists are expected this year compared with pre-COVID-19 levels.
The economy is expected to grow 3.9% this year and 4.1% in 2023, according to a separate Reuters poll published last month. 

""The concern over the Omicron outbreak and temporary suspension of the 'Test&Go' tourism program in late December-January would affect the economic recovery and delay an international tourism recovery in early 2022,"" wrote Lattakit Lapudomkarn, economist at Kiatnakin Phatra Securities.
""However, we expect the impact should be short-lived as the outbreak has proven less severe than expected.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose for a fifth straight month in January but at a slower pace than in the previous month, boosting the likelihood the country's central bank will lag behind other economies in raising interest rates.
Consumer inflation is expected to pick up in the coming months due to surging energy prices, while last year's mobile phone fee cuts are also set to fall out of calculations and will no longer be a drag on prices.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food prices but includes fuel costs, increased 0.2% in January from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday.
That was weaker than the median forecast for a 0.3% gain in a Reuters poll and a 0.5% rise in the previous two months.
""Consumer inflation will pick up from next month onward on higher food and energy prices,"" said Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute.
""It may jump to more than 1.5% in one go in April once the impact of mobile phone fee cuts comes to an end.""
The price data will be among factors the Bank of Japan will scrutinise at its next policy meeting, which is scheduled for the middle of next month.
The core CPI has posted a year-on-year increase every month since September. January's increase marked the slowest year-on-year rise in three months.
Accommodation prices rose just 0.6% from a year earlier to grow at the weakest rate since June 2021 after a domestic travel campaign in late 2020 came to an end.
Cellphone fee cuts pushed down the CPI by about 1.5 percentage points last month.
The tepid overall rate of increase shows price rises in the world's third-largest economy have remained extremely modest compared with much sharper gains in other advanced economies as sluggish wage growth discourages firms from hiking prices much.
The small gain reinforced expectations the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy for the time being to achieve its 2% inflation target.
Saito said any sharper rises in consumer prices in coming months were unlikely to prod the central bank to tighten monetary policy but could open the door for fresh government stimulus.
That could include expanding a subsidy scheme to mitigate a steep increase in gasoline and other fuel prices or, eventually, additional cash handouts for households, he said.

Overall energy prices soared 17.9% from a year earlier in January, posting their biggest rise in more than forty years, in part due to surging electricity bills and fuel costs.
The BOJ has stuck to massive monetary stimulus as it seeks to have inflation reach its target, despite some worries about the side-effect of a weakening yen.

(Reuters) -The Federal Reserve will need to move more aggressively to remove accommodation than it did following the Great Recession by raising interest rates at a faster pace and shrinking its balance sheet more quickly, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on Thursday. 
""Barring a material change in the economy, I anticipate that it will be appropriate to move the funds rate up at a faster pace this time and to begin reducing the size of the balance sheet soon and more quickly than last time,"" Mester said during a virtual event organized by the New York University Stern Center for Global Economy and Business. 
Policymakers are expected to start raising interest rates from near zero levels when they meet next month and to begin reducing the Fed's nearly $9 trillion portfolio soon after. Officials are debating how quickly to raise interest rates to combat the highest inflation seen in decades.
St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard is calling on the Fed to raise rates by a full percentage point by July, while others favor a smaller increase to start. Mester said she would support removing accommodation at a faster pace in the second half of the year if inflation does not abate by mid-year, and at a slower rate if inflation comes down faster than expected. 
The policymaker said she sees inflation remaining above 2% this year and in 2023, with the risks tilted to the upside.

Mester also said she supports selling some of the Fed's mortgage holdings at some point to accelerate the move to a portfolio that invests primarily in Treasury securities. She is among the officials who view asset sales as a backup plan for the central bank as it shrinks a balance sheet that doubled in size during the pandemic.
Fed officials also need to move away from providing explicit forward guidance as they reduce support, Mester said. ""Instead, we will need to convey the overall trajectory of policy and give the rationale for our policy decisions,"" she said.

Benefits from easing COVID-19 Delta infections were short-lived for Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) as the Omicron wave that soon followed dissuaded customers from venturing out, infected staff and set back the recovery of urban-centric restaurants.
""Drivers of our business such as office returns, events, travelers and the general gathering of people that contribute to Shake Shack's best results (turned) downward,"" Chief Executive Officer Randy Garutti said during an earnings call.
Shake Shack forecast first-quarter revenue of $196 million to $201.4 million, compared with analysts' average estimate of $210.9 million, according to Refinitiv IBES.
""We saw a more acute impact on SHAK sales from Omicron than its more geographically diversified peers ... expectations were just too optimistic and underestimated the Omicron impact,"" M Science analyst Matthew Goodman said.
Rising paper and food expenses as well as labor costs have also put a squeeze on Shake Shack's margins.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts noted the company's margin forecast was also below consensus estimates.
To protect its margins, Shake Shack will jack up prices in March and increase its third-party delivery menu prices, Garutti said. The company in October raised prices by 3% to 3.5%.
Nearly every U.S. restaurant, including Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), has also raised prices.
In the fourth quarter ended Dec. 29, same-store sales in Shake Shack's urban restaurants, which account for over half of its topline, declined 4% as many city dwellers moved to suburbs during the pandemic.

However, that helped comparable sales at suburban restaurants gain 9%.
Shake Shack also pointed to a sales improvement in recent days, with monthly comparable sales through Feb. 15 jumping 13%, versus a 2% rise last month.

* BofA Global Research expects the Fed to hike rates by 25 bps at each of this year's remaining seven meetings, unchanged from its previous outlook. However, it said there is a risk of a 50 bps hike in the Fed's March policy meeting.

(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell won high marks from Wall Street as he dialed up expectations late last year for a more hawkish policy stance to quell rising inflation, a survey by the New York Federal Reserve published Thursday showed. 
The report card is included in the New York Fed's quarterly survey of primary dealers who assess the U.S. central bank's communication with markets and the public, using a scale of one, for ""ineffective,"" to five, for ""effective.""
The Powell Fed received an average score of 4.08 in the Jan. 12-18 survey released on Thursday. That is up from 3.75 in late October, the last time the Fed was graded on its messaging skills.
In the intervening period, Powell shepherded an effort to radically reset policy expectations, from a view that the Fed would not even begin raising rates until after mid-2022 to what many economists now expect will be a string of hikes beginning next month, quickly followed by a reduction in its $9 trillion balance sheet.
The shift is evident in the survey itself, with dealers seeing the Fed beginning to trim its balance sheet sometime between July and September, more than a year sooner than the survey showed two months earlier.
Overall, the Fed under Powell has received better communications grades than under previous chairs. It is the only Fed to have received any above-4 average mark since the surveys were first published in 2011. 
GRAPHIC: What Wall Street thinks of the Fed's messaging - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/POWELL/lbpgnwkodvq/chart.png 
""Most dealers noted that FOMC participants were in general clear or consistent in their communications on the policy outlook,"" the survey published Thursday said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the panel of central bankers headed by Powell that sets U.S. interest rates.
""Several dealers suggested that communications on the outlook for balance sheet policy were less clear.""
Powell likely faces an even tougher communications test in coming months, as investors struggle to figure out how quickly the Fed will raise rates and shrink its balance sheet to slow the fastest inflation in 40 years. 
Investors have been particularly focused on whether the Fed will start the coming round of rate hikes at half a percentage point or a more typical quarter of a percent. 
Dueling views from policymakers have roiled markets that investors use to place bets on or hedge against interest rate moves. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard has called for a full percentage point of rate hikes by June, while San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly has signaled a gentler approach.
Powell has not spoken publicly since immediately after the Fed's January policy-setting meeting.

""Powell has been out of the limelight in recent weeks and not providing the markets any guidance on this point,"" wrote SGH Macro Advisors' Tim Duy.
It will be up to Powell's messaging to guide expectations for March and beyond, he added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wall Street's biggest banks sounded a warning over the year ahead on Thursday, citing high inflation, credit concerns, asset price depreciation and companies postponing deals due to market uncertainty.
U.S. banks reported a mixed bag of fourth quarter earnings last month as trading revenue fell after the Federal Reserve scaled back its asset purchases. They are now grappling with high inflation and the likelihood of multiple rate hikes.
Several top executives commented on market conditions at the  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Financial Services Forum in Florida.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is concerned enough about inflation to stress test its portfolio for the possibility that Fed policymakers are unable to control it and prevent the country going into recession, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said. 
""We have to run those scenarios,"" he said. ""What will hurt the industry generally will be if they have to create a recession. And that's not their goal for sure. They'll hopefully do a great job handling it. We stress test that and we're fine.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' Chief Executive David Solomon warned that rampant inflation could be a headwind to growth.
""We're moving from an environment of very easy money and below trend inflation to an environment of tighter money and above trend inflation. The economic environment is different and there will be consequences to that,"" he said. 
Solomon added that ""everybody is used to asset appreciation and we might have a period of time where there's less asset appreciation.""
Mike Santomassimo, chief financial officer at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, noted that credit spreads had been widening and ""that's an area to watch to see if there are any cracks that start to emerge"". 
High inflation and expectations of more aggressive rate hikes from the Fed have whipsawed markets this year, sending the S&P 500 down 7% year-to-date while bond yields have jumped and the yield curve flattened. 
Bank shares declined Thursday with the S&P500 banking index down 3%. The S&P 500 was down 2%.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya said the bank had seen ""a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace over the past couple of weeks"" leading to companies putting off transactions. 
""We have seen some of the pipelines, which are still healthy, being pushed out,"" she said. ""At this point it doesn't feel like the first quarter of 2022 is going to be the same as the first quarter of 2021.""
Trading and investment banking activity had slowed since 2021 but was still healthy, Solomon said.
Bank of America's Moynihan took a similar tone, saying the bank's capital markets business ""is down"" so far in 2022, even though it continues to see a strong pipeline of customer activity.
Wells' Santomassimo noted that while the bank's consumer and real estate portfolios continue to perform, there had been ""a little bit of noise"" in auto loans.

However, he said that rising rates would help the bank's ultimate goal to reach a 15% return on tangible equity. When interest rates are higher, banks make more money by taking advantage of the difference between the interest banks pay to customers and the interest they can earn by investing.
""The question will be where rates go and then what impact that has on the economy and the environment we’re in,"" Santomassimo said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -The expectation that the Federal Reserve will start hiking interest rate soon has put limits on Mexico's monetary policy, Bank of Mexico Deputy Governor Jonathan Heath said on Thursday.
Due to the close relationship between the U.S. and Mexican economies, the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy decisions could not counter those of the Federal Reserve, he said during a virtual appearance before a Mexican business summit.
""We cannot have a monetary policy that is independent or countercyclical to the Federal Reserve,"" he said. ""If the Federal Reserve begins to raise in March, well, I think that practically sets a ceiling for us.""
Heath added that Mexico's central bank was at a difficult ""crossroads"" due to stubbornly high inflation, especially core inflation, which strips out some volatile items.
Mexico's core inflation surged to 6.21% in the year through January, a level not seen since 2001, while headline inflation eased slightly to 7.07%. That is still more than twice as high as the Bank of Mexico's 3% inflation target rate.
Heath underscored that the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy actions need to balance the issues of high inflation, adverse cyclical economic conditions in Mexico and the Fed's expected interest rate hike cycle.
He said the Bank of Mexico's monetary policy stance will need to be consistent with the inflationary problems Latin America's second-largest economy is facing, while avoiding being too restrictive towards the end of year when inflation is expected to converge near the target.
At its last monetary policy meeting on Feb. 10, Mexico's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate as expected by 50 basis points to 6.00%, a sixth straight rate increase, as policymakers sought to keep high inflation in check.

Heath noted that Mexico is currently seeing low levels of private investment, hampering its economic recovery.
""We don't really have any (economic) growth engine"" for 2022, he said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -German insurer and asset manager Allianz (DE:ALVG) on Thursday said it would set aside 3.7 billion euros ($4.20 billion) to deal with investigations and lawsuits resulting from the collapse of a multi-billion-euro set of investment funds.
The provision resulted in a net loss attributable to shareholders of 292 million euros in the fourth quarter, the company said. Analysts had expected a profit.
Allianz said that the outcome of various investigations and lawsuits ""cannot be reliably estimated"" and that it ""expects to incur additional expenses before these matters are finally resolved"".
The issue centres around Allianz funds that used complex options strategies to generate returns but racked up massive losses when the spread of COVID-19 triggered wild stock market swings in February and March 2020.
Investors in the so-called Structured Alpha set of funds have claimed some $6 billion euros in damages from the losses in a slew of cases filed in the United States. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange commission have also been investigating the case.
The matter has cast a shadow over Allianz, one of Germany's most valuable companies. It is also one of the world's biggest money managers with 2.5 trillion euros in assets under management through bond giant Pimco and its Allianz Global Investors, which managed the funds at the centre of the probes.
Allianz said that it expects a settlement with major investors ""shortly"" but discussions with other investors, the DOJ and SEC ""remain ongoing"". 
The quarterly loss compares with a profit of 1.8 billion euros a year ago. Profit for the full year at 6.6 billion euros was the lowest since 2013.
""In spite of challenges in 2021, Allianz proved its resilience and adaptability,"" Chief Executive Officer Oliver Baete said. 
The $15 billion Structured Alpha funds catered in particular to normally conservative U.S. pension funds, from those for labourers in Alaska to teachers in Arkansas to subway workers in New York.
After the coronavirus sent markets into a tailspin early in 2020, the Allianz funds plummeted in value, in some cases by 80% or more. Investors alleged Allianz strayed from its stated strategy in their lawsuits. 

Allianz has publicly disclosed the SEC and DOJ investigations. It previously said it intended to defend itself ""vigorously"" against the investors' allegations. Baete has said ""not everything was perfect in the fund management"".

LORAIN, Ohio (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden used a visit to Ohio on Thursday to tout $1 billion in funding for cleaning up and restoring environmentally damaged areas in the Great Lakes region, vowing to continue his push to rebuild America and help U.S. workers.
The trip, which came amid rising risks of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, is part of the White House's efforts to showcase the benefits of the infrastructure law ahead of crucial midterm elections where the Democrats hope a results-oriented message will allow them to retain power in Washington. 
Speaking in Lorain, Ohio, which sits on Lake Erie, Biden said the $1 billion in cleanup funding came from a rare bipartisan infrastructure law signed in November, along with the biggest-ever investment in roads, bridges and highways.
""We're reinvesting in our economy and in our people, reclaiming our leadership and creating millions of jobs for building a better America,"" the Democratic president said, vowing to boost U.S. competitiveness after years of decline.
Michael Regan, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the bipartisan infrastructure law was a ""game changer for communities throughout the Great Lakes region."" 
""This is a shot in the arm of the 25 sites along the Great Lakes that are listed as areas of concern,"" Regan told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to the site. 
Biden said the United States and Canada had agreed decades ago to clean up ""dangerously polluted"" sites and habitats in the Great Lakes region that straddles the border between the two countries, which support more than 1.3 million jobs.
""For decades there was a lot of talk, a lot of plans, but very little progress. It was slow. That changes today,"" he said. 
""It's going to allow the most significant restoration of the Great Lakes in the history of the Great Lakes."" he said. ""We're going to accelerate cleanup of sites across six states.""
Ohio Republican Senator Rob Portman, who helped lead passage of the bipartisan infrastructure law, called the new funding ""great news"" for efforts to address harmful algae blooms, invasive species, pollution and habitat degradation in Lake Erie and across the Great Lakes.
The administration believes the funding will help accelerate completion of cleanups in federally designated ""Areas of Concern,"" or AOCs, which were damaged by decades of manufacturing and agricultural interests. It now expects 22 of the remaining 25 AOCs to come off the federal list by 2030.

The infrastructure package will also provide $10 billion in highway funding for Ohio, plus more than $33 billion in competitive grant funding for highway and other transportation projects. It also provides $60 billion for state and local governments to fund major projects.
This will be Biden’s second trip to northeast Ohio in less than a year. The state is home to several important elections this year, including a governor's race and a closely watched U.S. Senate race to fill the seat of Portman, who is retiring.

“If you wanted to put downward pressure on inflation, you’d actually have to get to neutral -- go beyond neutral,” Bullard said at an event by hosted by Columbia University and SGH Macro Advisers in New York on Thursday. “And I think that’s a major concern of mine -- we’re not really in a position to do that right now, but we have to get in a position to do that” in case inflation doesn’t moderate as expected, he said.
Bullard repeated his view that Fed should raise interest rate by 100 basis points by July 1, and start balance-sheet run-off in the second quarter, in response to the fastest inflation in 40 years. Even with those increases, the Fed would be well below the rate Bullard sees as neutral, while his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee view 2.5% as a long-term target interest rate, according to the median of their December projections.
Federal Reserve officials concluded in January that they would start raising interest rates soon and were on alert for persistent inflation that would justify a faster pace of tightening, according to minutes of the Jan. 25-26 meeting released Wednesday. While the Fed staff has projected that inflation will be around 2.6% this year, Bullard said policy makers need to be prepared for price surges that persist.
“We have to manage the risk that it does not dissipate, as some people might hope,” Bullard said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lockstep declines in bonds and stocks are sending investors into defensive products such as credit swaps, convertibles and even cash as they seek refuge from the market’s recent gyrations.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF has fallen by nearly 7% year-to-date to its lowest level since April 2020, as expectations of higher interest rates and persistent inflation dim the allure of bonds across the fixed-income spectrum. 
That is in line with losses across major stock indexes, which have also been hit by worries of tighter Fed policy. The S&P 500 has dropped 7.3% year-to-date and the Nasdaq Composite is down by about 11%.
The side-by-side tumbles have dealt another blow to a decades-old strategy that relied on a mix of bonds and stocks to take the sting out of equity declines, with bond prices ideally moving higher during periods of stock market volatility. 
""It's very difficult right now because there's just very few places to hide,"" said Jordan Kahn, president and chief investment officer at ACM Funds in Los Angeles. 
The search for defensive products comes amid worries of more volatility across asset markets, as an expected 150-175 basis points in rate increases over the next year threatens to further buoy bond yields and weigh on stock valuations. 
Yields on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury, which sway borrowing costs across the credit spectrum, are up 50 basis points this year, to their highest level since August 2019. Bond prices move inversely to yields. 
""Widening spreads and volatility have certainly brought back interest to products that had been basically sleepy for the past few years,” said Alfonso Peccatiello, a former portfolio manager who now authors a financial newsletter and advises institutional investors. 
For some investors, anticipation of more wild swings in asset prices has heightened the appeal of credit swaps, which are used to ensure against the risk of corporate defaults.
The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a basket of credit default swaps that serves as a gauge of credit risk, widened over 17 basis point to 64 basis points this year, its highest level since September 2020. 
Matt Smith, investment director at British fund manager Ruffer Investment Management, said he did not have any corporate credit in his portfolio but owns ""quite a lot"" of credit default swaps. 
""Credit is ... vulnerable to either yields going up, or central bank accommodation falling back, or flows out of credit, meeting quite an illiquid market. To us, it looks like the worst of all worlds"", he said. 
Michael Miller, president and chief investment officer of Wellesley Asset Management, an investment firm specializing in convertible bonds, said demand for such instruments - which allow holders to convert bonds to their underlying equities - has been on the rise.
Miller said they have almost always outperformed other asset classes such as U.S. equities or traditional fixed-income instruments during periods of inflation in the last 50 years.
""This rather forgotten asset class all of a sudden has been getting a lot of attention all over again,"" he said. 
The SPDR Bloomberg Convertible Securities ETF, an exchange-traded fund that provides exposure to the market of U.S. convertible securities, has climbed 0.3% this month. 
Kahn, of ACM Funds, increased exposure late last year to an ETF that moves inversely to Treasuries to hedge against higher rates, as well as to hybrid instruments linked to the energy transportation industry. 

He is also relying on a more traditional strategy for uncertain times: cash. The cash balance in his portfolio now stands at its highest level since March 2020, when the pandemic wreaked havoc on markets. 
""Right now I think that we're in a market where just preserving capital is more important than seeking return on capital"", he said.

LONDON/KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine is working with the United States and other Western nations on unlocking billions of dollars in funding to shore up its finances and is looking to the International Monetary Fund for another deal, the country's finance minister said. 
Serhiy Marchenko told Reuters on Thursday his government was in bilateral talks with Washington about creating a vehicle that would allow the United States and other countries to transfer reserve assets issued by the International Monetary Fund, so-called Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), to Kyiv.
""We are discussing a very sophisticated tool which can help us with SDR allocation,"" Marchenko said in an interview via video link from Kyiv. 
The push, said Marchenko, was just one of a number of initiatives to help Ukraine mitigate some of the impact from the conflict with Russia, which has amassed more than 100,000 troops on the border with its western neighbour, sparking fears in Western capitals that Moscow is planning to invade the country. Moscow has denied any invasion plans.
Marchenko also said he hoped the U.S. Congress would sign off soon on a $1 billion guarantee that was announced by U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Monday.
""The mechanism is very simple...U.S. guarantee means that we can borrow with a triple A rating,"" said Marchenko, adding he expected the funds from the loan to be in place by year-end.
MORE BOND BUY BACKS POSSIBLE
Furthermore Kyiv expected to receive the first half of a 1.2 billion euro loan from the European Union by early April and a loan from Canada in March. The government is also in talks with Japan about financial support, Marchenko added. 
""We can top up necessary finance to finance our deficit, we'll be able to support our currency as well,"" he said. 
Ukraine is relying on funding from Western capitals and the IMF after yields on its sovereign dollar bonds spiked to above 10% early in the year when the escalating tensions with Russia saw investors ditch Ukrainian bonds, effectively shutting the country out of international capital markets. 
Meanwhile Kyiv is also hoping to get the remaining $2.2 billion available under its current IMF agreement before the programme runs out in June. An IMF mission is due in Kyiv for talks this month, and if successful could see $700 million dispatched, with the remainder coming due thereafter. 
Marchenko further said his government was hoping to agree another deal with the IMF, though talks would only start in the second half of the year once the current programme was completed successfully. 
""Our interest is to have such a programme,"" he said. ""When and how we can settle it, and what mechanism we can use depends on the time when we start this discussion."" 
He said the government would continue to make use of declines in bond prices to buy back its debt, as it did in previous months. ""If we see opportunity, we'll do it,"" he said. ""But now we want to cover our deficit needs first and for most and maybe then we can decide.""

Speaking about the prospect of Washington and its Western partners imposing sanctions on Russia in case of a Ukraine invasion, Marchenko said a show of unity was key.
""If these countries agree on tough sanctions, it would be better for Ukraine to prevent any possible Russian aggression.""

JAKARTA/TOKYO (Reuters) -The crisis in Ukraine overshadowed a gathering of finance leaders from the world's top 20 economies that kicked off on Thursday, with host Indonesia's president warning ""now is not the time"" to create new risks to a fragile global recovery.
Russia's military presence on its borders with Ukraine has led to one of the deepest crises in East-West relations for decades, jolting financial markets and adding to the headwinds facing a global economy emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Geopolitical risks and the economic fallout from the pandemic will likely be among key topics of debate at the G20 finance leaders' meeting, as well as rising global inflation and tighter monetary policy in some regions.
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo urged G20 nations to focus on collaboration to revive a global economy that is ""still shaken"" from the pandemic.
""In a situation like now, it is not the time for rivalry,"" he said in opening remarks at the G20 meeting, which many ministers are attending online due to the pandemic.
""It is not the time to create a new tension that disrupts the global recovery, especially one that endangers the safety of the world like what is happening in Ukraine now.""
Analysts, however, warn the diverse membership of the G20, consisting of the United States and its allies but also rivals China and Russia, may make policy coordination hard.
GLOBAL COORDINATION
In a draft of the G20 communique to be issued at the end of the two-day meeting on Friday, the finance leaders flagged inflation and ""(current) geopolitical tensions"" as major risks to a global recovery that has become ""asynchronous"" due to uneven access to COVID-19 vaccines.
The use of brackets in the draft seen by Reuters suggests that the word ""current"" may be deleted in a final version. 
With the U.S. central bank moving toward raising interest rates and some of its counterparts expected to follow suit, the G20 finance leaders are likely to call on major central banks to communicate their intentions clearly to prevent big market swings.
The G20 policymakers are also expected to warn emerging nations to brace for potential market fallout from monetary tightening in major economies, according to a document with the agreed position of European G20 members, seen by Reuters.
""Divergent economic recovery may have significant implications, since it can lead to a different pace of policy normalisation and potentially create a tighter global financial condition,"" Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told the G20 finance leaders.
""In this regard, global coordination, including a discussion on exit strategy, will be critical,"" she said.
The G20 faces the difficult task of navigating policy amid global divergences in the pace of recovery from the pandemic.
While cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 are receding in many wealthy countries, they are still rising in many developing nations including Indonesia.
The International Monetary Fund warned on Wednesday that downside risks continued to dominate, as renewed mobility restrictions in some countries and supply-demand mismatches are likely to drag on growth.

The IMF has said it will seek G20 support for strengthening a debt restructuring framework for poor countries as default risks rise and demands for easier debt terms increase.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will urge her G20 counterparts to help international organisations address bottlenecks in the deployment of vaccines and support investment in pandemic prevention, a U.S. Treasury official said on Tuesday.

Low middle-income and middle income countries do not have enough resources and need global support to face these challenges, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told her G20 counterparts hosted at a virtual meeting by Indonesia.
G20 members should work together to address the gaps in global pandemic preparedness, which were raising ""serious concern"", Sitharaman said.
She said the World Health Organisation (WHO) needed to augment its capacity and mobilise global resources, and structural bottlenecks would have to be addressed to lessen the impact a pandemic might have. 

Earlier on Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged G20 members to back a proposed fund to invest in pandemic prevention and preparedness, warning that failure to close gaps in global health systems could result in ""devastating"" costs.
Yellen told finance ministers and central bankers from the world's 20 top economies that the new financial intermediary fund - to be hosted at the World Bank - would help channel the estimated $75 billion in investments needed to reduce global vulnerabilities to future pandemics.

Hundreds of billions of dollars have flowed into London and Britain's overseas territories from Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, raising fears among some allies that illicit money was cascading into the global financial system. 
British lawmakers on parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee warned in 2020 that more work needed to be done to tackle ""the illicit financial dealings of the Russian elite"", including overhauling the 'Tier 1' investor visa system. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's interior minister, Priti Patel, said on Thursday she had closed the Tier 1 system, which had offered a route to residency for those investing at least 2 million pounds ($2.72 million). 
""This is just the start of our renewed crackdown on fraud and illicit finance,"" Patel said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
London has long been dubbed 'Londongrad' or 'Moscow-on-Thames' as the city of choice for the super-wealthy of Russia and other former Soviet republics. 
Russian oligarchs, along with Middle Eastern oil barons and newly-minted Chinese entrepreneurs, have helped drive a spending spree on London property in the past three decades, snapping up opulent homes and iconic commercial property.
Charlie Fowler, a solicitor at Collyer Bristow LLP in London, said the Ukraine crisis had expedited plans to scrap the investor visas.
""The perception has remained in some quarters that the investor visa route is being exploited, in particular by applicants from Russia and China,"" Fowler said.

""The problem for the government is that many investor visa holders have, of course, acquired their wealth by legitimate means,"" he added.

(Reuters) -Finance leaders from the Group of 20 major economies view inflation and geopolitical risks as threats to a global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic that already is ""asynchronous"" due to uneven access to vaccines, a draft communique obtained by Reuters showed on Thursday.
The G20 finance ministers and central bank governors, meeting both virtually and in Jakarta, pledged in the draft to use ""all available policy tools to address the impacts of the pandemic,"" but warned that future policy space was likely to be ""narrower and uneven.""
""We will continue to strengthen the resilience of global supply chains. We remain vigilant of the impacts of these challenges on our economies,"" the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors said in the draft statement, which will be finalized on Friday, when their meeting concludes.
""We will also continue to monitor major global risks, including those arising from (current) geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities,"" the ministers said.
The statement contained no direct reference to the crisis on the Ukraine-Russia border, and the word ""current"" in brackets indicates that it may be deleted. Russia is a member of the G20.
Fears that Russia might invade Ukraine overshadowed the start of a meeting that was expected to focus heavily on growing risks from inflation and monetary tightening to control it. Indonesian President Joko Widodo issued a direct warning that tensions over Ukraine could disrupt the recovery, adding ""now is not the time for rivalry."" Moscow has denied it is planning an invasion of its neighbor.
The finance leaders said in the draft communique that inflation is currently elevated in many countries, prompted in part by ""supply disruptions, supply demand mismatches and increased commodity prices, including energy prices.""""Central banks will act where necessary to ensure price stability in line with their respective mandates, while remaining committed to clear communication of their policy stances,"" the ministers and governors said, adding that central bank independence was crucial for credibility.
They confirmed a commitment to ""well-calibrated, well-planned and well-communicated exit strategies to support recovery, with due consideration for individual country circumstances.""
PANDEMIC FUND, TAX DEADLINE
The G20 finance leaders voiced support for ensuring timely and affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and other medical supplies for low- and middle-income countries, according to the draft.
They asked the G20 Joint Finance-Health Task Force to report by April on options to establish a fund for pandemic preparedness, for further work in July and in October with G20 health ministers.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen earlier on Thursday urged her G20 counterparts to back the proposed fund, with needed health system investments estimated at $75 billion.
The G20 finance leaders affirmed their commitment to developing the rules and other instruments to implement a global tax agreement reached last year to put the new rules into effect in 2023.
They also pledged to ""do more to secure (the) long-term success"" of a G20 common debt restructuring framework for poor countries, although that language also was in brackets, making it subject to change.
On climate change, the G20 ministers said reaching carbon emissions ""net zero"" goals should include a full range of tools, including ""if appropriate, the use of carbon pricing mechanisms and incentives and phase out and rationalize, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption.""
The G20 finance leaders also said they would continue to study central bank digital currencies to better understand their financial system implications ""including for spillovers and capital flows.""

They also called for considering G20 principles for high quality infrastructure investment, by July 2021, but the language on the timing also was contained in brackets, meaning it may change.
The work is being conducted by the International Finance Corporation, a division of the World Bank, whose President, David Malpass, has been critical of China's Belt and Road infrastructure lending.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Two years after workers at Mexico's Tridonex auto-parts plant began a campaign to replace a union that they accused of failing to push for higher wages, they will get a chance next week to elect a new group to represent them.
Tridonex's unlisted U.S. parent Cardone faced U.S. government scrutiny last year in one of the first labor complaints under a new regional trade deal after workers said they were being denied the right to freely select their union.
The vote, scheduled for Monday, comes weeks after an established union lost its 25-year hold at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in the central city of Silao to an upstart group in an election following another complaint under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal.
Mexico's federal labor board ordered the long-awaited vote at Tridonex in the northern border city of Matamoros in a document seen by Reuters on Wednesday. 
The current union, SITPME, is part of one of Mexico's biggest labor organizations, the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), and will face independent rival SNITIS in the vote by nearly 1,700 workers.
""If they get rid of the CTM union, they will feel free,"" said SNITIS Secretary General Rosario Moreno. ""They will rid themselves of the foot on their necks.""
The union ousted at the Silao plant was also part of CTM.
Moreno called for the same scrutiny Mexican and U.S. authorities bestowed on the Silao plant to ensure a fair vote, noting that intimidation tactics by unions and companies have long marked labor disputes across Mexico.
""Silao was closely watched ... We're very unprotected,"" she said.
SITPME did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The group has previously defended its role in generating jobs and delivering perks to members.
Moreno said many Tridonex workers back SNITIS, which was founded by prominent labor lawyer Susana Prieto after she helped stage successful wildcat strikes for higher wages across industrial Matamoros.
SNITIS in late 2019 filed to challenge SITPME for the collective contract at Tridonex, the same year a Mexican labor reform enshrined workers' rights to choose their union, also a key tenet of the USMCA. 
Tridonex workers the following year led protests seeking to change their union at the plant, which refits second-hand car parts for sale in the United States and Canada.
As a result of last year's USMCA complaint against Tridonex, Cardone agreed to ensure neutrality in future union elections and provide back pay to more than 100 people fired from the plant. 
Some of those people said they were dismissed in retaliation for backing a new union.

Cardone said it will be neutral and ready to work with the group elected by workers. 
""The decision of who represents the employees is the employees' choice alone,"" Cardone said in a statement.

78,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 11:12AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -The ultra-low inflation seen in the euro zone until recently are unlikely to return even after the pandemic is over, the European Central Bank's chief economist Philip Lane said, citing changes in the global economy among other factors.
Lane had dismissed the notion of a new era for inflation until recently but he has been revising his view, setting the stage for a policy shift at the ECB after nearly a decade of ultra-low interest rates and massive bond purchases.
""There are several factors indicating that the excessively-low inflation environment that prevailed from 2014 to 2019 (a period over which annual inflation averaged just 0.9%) might not re-emerge even after the pandemic cycle is over,"" Lane told an MNI event. 
He credited the unprecedented economic support deployed by euro zone governments and the ECB itself in response to the coronavirus pandemic, but also structural changes such as fewer exports by China.
The ECB is under market pressure to raise rates on bank deposits, currently at minus 0.5%, in the face of stubbornly high euro zone inflation. This hit 5.1% in January, well over twice the ECB's 2% target.
Lane said the pace of any policy change would depend on whether the ECB expected inflation to settle below, at or above 2%.
""The size and frequency of interest rate moves depend on the kind of regime you think you're in,"" Lane said. ""I am not saying (25 basis points) is a bad increment but there are other increments possible.""
Since he did not anticipate runaway inflation, Lane said ""gradualism"" would make sense in the present circumstances - a point also made earlier by fellow ECB policymaker and Bank of Spain governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos.
The International Monetary Fund backed the ECB's easy monetary stance in a blog post on Thursday, predicting inflation would fall below the central bank's target after ""transient boosts"" from supply snags that may extend into next year.

The ECB will publish its own projections on March 10, when it is also expected to chart a path for winding down its bond-buying stimulus programme - a precursor to higher rates.
Its policymakers have credited bond purchases for keeping the economy afloat during the coronavirus pandemic but they are also growing worried about the risks of having hundreds of billion euros worth of debt on the ECB's own balance sheet.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates' plans for a corporate tax risk eroding one of its main attractions as the Gulf's premier destination for foreign firms, at a time when Saudi Arabia is opening up and pressuring multinationals to shift regional headquarters there.
As the UAE aligns itself more with the global economy, Saudi Arabia is using its clout as the world's top oil exporter and biggest Arab economy to vie for capital, giving firms until 2024 to set up regional bases in Riyadh or lose out on lucrative contracts.
The standard UAE corporate tax rate of 9%, to be imposed from mid-2023, is below the 20% Saudi levy on foreign-owned firms. But tax experts said large multinationals are likely to pay 15%, in accordance with an OECD agreement on global minimum tax to which the UAE is a signatory.
""There will be a different rate for large multinational organisations. We expect this to be 15%,"" Tatyana Rahmonova, international tax senior manager at accounting and consulting firm PwC Middle East, said in a presentation this month.
Freewheeling UAE, the region's commercial hub and a magnet for the global ultra-rich, is taking tax cooperation and the tackling of illicit finance more seriously, but still retains much of its tax-free system, including within free zones.
Saudi Arabia also imposes a 20% capital gains tax on non-residents on disposal of Saudi shares while the UAE has none, and Riyadh has tripled value-added tax to 15% versus 5% in the UAE.
But other incentives offered by the two Arab economic powers to lure foreign firms and talent are also now a factor.
The UAE advantage is narrowing in the face of opportunities offered by the opening up of Saudi Arabia, where the crown prince is pushing to wean the kingdom off oil revenues and challenging the UAE to be the region's commercial, logistics and tourism centre with ambitious mega-projects.
SAUDI RISING
Alex Nicholls of AstroLabs, which advises companies on setting up Saudi offices, said the tax differential between the two Gulf states would be less of a factor for foreign companies than the looming risk from the Saudi state to future contracts. 
""From last year the majority of our clients, who had clients in Saudi Arabia, have been told that 'we will only work with you if you have a commercially registered company in Saudi Arabia',"" he said.
As of last year, Saudi Arabia had licensed 44 international companies to set up regional headquarters in Riyadh and the city's royal commission said last year it had identified 7,000 global companies that it wanted to target.
""Saudi is being more assertive in terms of requiring corporations to hold appropriate licences to do business in the kingdom,"" said corporate lawyer Rima Mrad of BSA Ahmad Bin Hezeem & Associates. ""A lot of corporations used to do Saudi work remotely and this no longer is acceptable.""
Shane Shin, founding partner of Abu Dhabi-based venture capital firm Shorooq Partners, told Reuters start-ups were increasingly looking at Saudi Arabia for access to funding and government support, talent, infrastructure and market size.
""Once you have established yourself in Saudi Arabia, and have obtained the SAGIA licence, you will be able to take advantage of government assistance in many ways,"" he said.
The Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) became the Ministry of Investment in February 2020.
FIRST MOVER
The UAE is counting on it remaining a first mover as it evolves an economy built on open-for-business credentials and glitzy expatriate lifestyles, by pushing in directions where it may take time for conservative Saudi Arabia to follow.
Last month, the UAE adopted a Saturday-Sunday weekend instead of the traditional Muslim Friday-Saturday to move closer to global markets. It has also overhauled regulations, including decriminalising alcohol consumption and pre-marital cohabitation. 
To cushion the blow from the new tax, Dubai said it would reduce government fees on commercial activities, a move trade sources say some of the UAE's other six emirates may mimic.
And the UAE has said it would honour corporate tax incentives offered at its more than 40 free zones to firms that do not conduct business with the mainland.

Industry sources say the free zone mechanism under the new UAE regime will likely involve all firms filing returns but with no tax applied to those doing business solely overseas.
Saudi Arabia plans to offer incentives for more specialised zones focused on priority sectors, expanding the incentives for existing economic cities that enjoy exemptions from import duties, ownership of land and property, and taxation.

""We are missing our inflation target on our preferred measure... and policy is still at rock bottom lows and we’ve still got asset purchases going on,"" Bullard said in a television interview with CNN. ""This is a moment where we need to shift to less accommodation.""
Bullard's initial comments one week ago in favor of a half percentage point move at the central bank's next meeting on March 15-16 prompted traders in contracts tied to the Fed's target interest rate to temporarily raise their expectations of a half-point increase next month.

That probability has now dropped back below 50% following comments by several other Fed policymakers pushing back against such a move.
""I'm not saying that’s necessarily what we have to do,"" Bullard said in his latest interview. ""I’ve laid out this 100 basis points by July 1st and let the chair manage the committee and the expectations around that appropriately... But I do think it’s important to get moving and I do think it's important markets understand the necessity of the Fed's move.""

MADRID (Reuters) - When Spain's decade-long housing boom spectacularly bust in 2008, some 1.8 million jobs vanished and a nation littered with cranes and building sites slid into brutal recession.
Now those construction workers are urgently needed back: an unprecedented labour shortage is jeopardising multi-billion euro building and renovation projects funded by the European Union to help Spain's economy recover from COVID-19.
As elsewhere around the continent, Spain is short of at least half a million building workers, according to unions and companies. Firms are training new staff round the clock, paying better, and leaning on migrants from Africa and Latin America.
""If you have a certificate, companies will hire you,"" enthused Moustapha Diedhiou during a break in an evening class for scaffolding in Madrid. 
The 32-year-old Senegalese arrived on a rickety boat in 2019, picked fruit for a living during the pandemic, but now works as a bricklayer thanks to another previous course. 
Though scaffolding is riskier, he can earn more. 
Despite such keenness, at least seven out of 10 construction companies had to turn down contracts in 2021 due to lack of staff, according to preliminary data seen by Reuters of a survey from Spain's main building association. 
And that before the first 5 billion euros ($5.65 billion) in housing rehabilitation funds go to tender this spring.
After Italy, Spain is receiving the most EU aid: around 140 billion euros ($166 billion), half grants and half loans.
The government is pinning hopes of 7% economic growth this year on the funds, but red tape, material shortages and labour gaps are hampering investment.
STIGMA
Spain had almost 3 million real estate workers before the 2008 implosion, after which many took refuge in the equally massive tourism sector. Now they seem reluctant to come back.
So employers, unions and the government have clubbed together to run free training courses for would-be builders. They drew 90,000 people in 2021, and the target now is 200,000.
At one Madrid course earlier this month, most signing up were migrants from non-EU countries, optimistic that along with Spain, they too would see a turnaround in their fortunes. 
Francisco Dieguez, director of a training institute in Catalonia, said a construction worker's typical annual salary of 24,000 euros surpassed some architects' wages. 
Most other manual workers are on about 18,500 euros. 
Jose Adel Sosua, who teaches the Senegalese immigrant Diedhiou, is dismayed at how hard it is to attract students, blaming bad memories of the housing crash. 
""Many Spaniards don't want to do these courses, in part as they are a bit afraid of going back to work in this sector,"" said Sousa, whose 15 students only included one Spaniard. 
Spain is second only to Greece for unemployment in Europe, with nearly one in three young people out of work. A survey of those aged 15-29 in work last year found that 11% were working on building sites.
""Here in Spain they say that if you don't study you have to be a bricklayer, as if it were a punishment,"" said Sergio Estela, a leader at Spain's General Workers Union (UGT-FICA).
Crane operators, carpenters, welders and site managers are most scarce, according to a dozen sources from unions and companies, because they require officially accredited training. 
Ismael Lazaro, a 24-year-old Spaniard, took a welding course after losing his job as an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivery driver. He is the only one among his friends trying to enter construction. ""My mother told me there was a lot of demand for welders,"" he said. 
EUROPEAN PREDICAMENT
The predicament is echoed around Europe.
Though less pummelled by the pandemic, Germany, France, Ireland and the United Kingdom also lack hundreds of thousands of construction workers, employers' associations say. 
Combined with supply chain disruptions, that has pressured wages and prices in the sector, contributing to record euro zone inflation.
""It's a complicated balance between finding qualified workers, having to pay more and dealing with investors fighting hard on prices,"" said Miguel Fernandez, 42, director general in Spain for construction and design firm Tetris. 
Germany's industry lobby association ZDB said more employees were retiring than apprentices joining the construction workforce, with about 150,000 workers expected to go in the next decade. 
""Jobs remain unfilled for a long time. Even apprenticeships remain vacant, although we train more and more every year,"" said ZDB spokersperson Ilona Klein.
Germany is relying on migrants too. Building sites are dominated by central and southern Europeans, who accounted for 22% of the workforce in 2021, up from 8% in 2008.
Like Spain, Ireland haemorrhaged workers at the end of its own ""Celtic Tiger"" housing boom in 2007. 
Now, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) estimates the number of builders must increase by around a third to 180,000 to meet demand amid record foreign investment. Tech giants Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and LinkedIn are constructing massive campuses in Dublin.
Back in Madrid, dozens of undocumented migrants gather early each day in the Plaza Eliptica square, hoping to be picked by drive-by employers seeking temporary painters or bricklayers. 
Some 400,000 foreign workers left after Spain's 2008 financial crisis, many using EU residency to find work elsewhere in the region. Down to just 13% of construction workers in 2012, they are back to one in five now. 
""The square is the salvation for migrants who need work,"" said Alberto, a 54-year-old welder who arrived six months ago from Colombia.
National Chamber of Construction (CNC) president Pedro Fernández Alén wants more state support for training, including incorporating more women in the male-dominated sector.
Spain's jobless should be prioritised, but ""if we don't find workers, we will have to go abroad to bring them in,"" he said. 

""Otherwise, many of the projects we want to start up will be unmanned and we will stop receiving European funds.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A team of quantum computing engineers from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp and  Ciena  (NYSE:CIEN) Corp say they have successfully shown that a powerful, newly-developed encryption network can be used to protect communications on the blockchain, according to a paper published Thursday.
The group of researchers say it is the first time that a quantum key distribution (QKD) network, a super-secure two-way communication network powered by quantum physics, has been tested as a way to protect the blockchain from quantum computing attacks. 
Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) computers, which can process information and calculations at a radically faster rate than classical computers, are still being developed, and so experts say quantum computing cyberattacks are still some years away. But the threat they pose is so great that researchers like those at JPMorgan are searching for ways to protect banking systems now.
""Security is paramount for JPMorgan Chase,"" said Marco Pistoia, head of JPMorgan's Future Lab for Applied Research and Engineering group and one of the leaders of the research. 

""This work comes ... as we continue to prepare for the introduction of production-quality quantum computers, which will change the security landscape of technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency in the foreseeable future.""
JPMorgan has been a proponent of blockchain technology for use in the financial system, and the bank launched its own digital currency called JPM Coin in 2019.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy is working on a reform to make it easier for workers to retire early without bloating what is already Europe's second highest pensions bill, as rising borrowing costs fuel concerns over the country's mammoth public debt.
Mario Draghi's government wants to inject more flexibility into the system, officials said, while avoiding the fate of an unpopular 2011 reform which sharply raised the retirement age but was suspended in 2018 after a backlash.
A temporary replacement expires at the end of the year, and finding a permanent fix has been given added urgency as a period of low borrowing costs for Italy looks to be ending.
Draghi aims to clinch a deal with national unions over the reform by the end of March, with a key meeting between top ministers and the unions due next week. He will also need to get the backing of his multi-party coalition, meaning the former European Central Bank chief has tough negotiating ahead.
Labour Minister Andrea Orlando told Reuters the reform would not be one-size-fits-all.
""It will take account of different life expectancies, of the situation of domestic workers and women, and the fact that working lives are often not continuous,"" he said.
With one of the world's oldest populations, Italy spends more than any other European country on pensions except Greece, Eurostat data shows. According to the Treasury, Rome's pension bill reached a record 17% of national output in 2020.
The new reform will be the seventh pensions overhaul in recent decades as Rome has tried to grapple with the economic effects of its steadily ageing population.
The high pensions outlay crimps the resources available for more productive expenditure on things like schools and infrastructure investments, and makes it hard to reduce a public debt of around 150% of gross domestic product.
RISING BOND YIELDS
The debt, proportionally the second largest in the euro zone, is gradually becoming harder to service. Yields on Italy's 10-year government bonds have spiked to almost 2%, from below 1% two months ago, due to the prospect of the European Central Bank ending its asset purchases and raising interest rates.
In essence, people wishing to retire early will be able to do so on the understanding that their pensions are limited by the amount they have paid into the system, the officials said.
This approach has the backing of the unions. What will be harder to agree is how much pensions will be reduced for those who get to leave work early.
Rome plans to expand mechanisms already in place which allow the unemployed, the disabled, carers and people with ""strenuous"" jobs to get an early pension. This is something the unions have called for.
Roberto Ghiselli, a national coordinator of the country's main union, the CGIL, praised the decision to explore ways to allow early retirement, but said Rome should also set aside enough resources to ensure pensioners have an adequate income.
The Treasury, which has targeted a steep fall in borrowing this year, has a difficult circle to square. It is opposing pressure from coalition parties to hike the deficit, meaning any extra pension outlay must be offset with taxes or spending cuts. 
A 2018 scheme, known as ""quota 100"", allowed people to draw a pension at age 62 if they had paid in 38 years of contributions - the sum of the two figures giving the ""100"" of the scheme's name.

After fraught negotiations in the autumn triggered a one-day national strike by the CGIL, Draghi introduced ""quota 102"", raising the minimum retirement age by two years to 64, but for this year alone.
The CGIL's Ghiselli said the government had rejected the unions' proposal to allow people to draw a pension after 41 years of contributions regardless of their age.

Emerging markets financing conditions are on a tightening streak with countries outside Asia bearing the brunt. Turkey, Brazil and Colombia are the countries that have seen the biggest increases in local bond yields since end-2020. 
S&P said it now expects the Fed to raise interest rates six times in 2022 compared to a previous forecast last month of three or more rate hikes. Some investment banks like BoFA expect as many as seven rate hikes this year. 

And while most emerging markets seem to be better positioned to face the upcoming rate hike cycle, some pressure on exchange rates and bond yields is likely. 
S&P expects current account dynamics to be the main channel of transmission of a faster-than-expected Fed tightening cycle for Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Turkey. Fiscal imbalances would be the main channel for Brazil, India and South Africa.

Investing.com -- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could be inching its way toward a breakup, if talk from an activist investor is to be believed. That's still a long way in the future though. In the meantime, the e-commerce giant has patched up its quarrel with Visa (NYSE:V) over interconnection fees. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) earnings are due, a day after a solid retail sales report for January and the latest Fed minutes reinforced fears of higher interest rates. Data on jobless claims and housing starts are the big economic news. Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine keep the region on tenterhooks, but oil drifts downwards after signs of demand destruction from high prices in the U.S.  Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 17th February.
1. Amazon nudged in the direction of breakup?
Amazon may be on the verge of being pushed into breaking itself up. That at least is the ultimate logical conclusion of comments by activist investor Dan Loeb, who reportedly told a call with clients that he sees another trillion dollars of untapped value in the company.
The opportunity comes from the fact that Amazon’s underlying businesses have radically different profitability profiles. In the last quarter, Amazon made effectively all of its money from hosting Cloud services. Its e-commerce business, by contrast, operated at a loss owing to rising cost pressures in the U.S. and remains as far as ever from making a profit outside the country.
Amazon was also in the news overnight for patching up its quarrel with Visa over card fees. The truce means that Amazon customers will continue to be able to use Visa cards in the U.K. and that other surcharges imposed in Australia and Singapore, introduced last year, will be dropped.
Amazon's Big Tech rivals Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) will also be in the spotlight later after Google said it will stop cross-app tracking, another blow to the ability of Facebook and other social media networks to sell targeted ads.
2. Jobless claims and housing starts
The weekly update from the labor market comes at 8:30 AM ET, with analysts looking for initial jobless claims to stay in their recent range of just over 200,000.  
The numbers come at the same time as January data for housing starts and building permits, which are expected to ease off only slightly from December’s levels. Housing starts haven’t sustained the current level of activity since the subprime boom in 2006, but have so far resisted pressure from rising mortgage rates.
The Philly Fed business survey is the other main data point of the day.
3. Stocks set to open lower; Walmart earnings eyed
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower after the publication of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting minutes offered a sharp reminder of the pressure on the central bank to raise interest rates and sell down its holdings of bonds.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 174 points, or 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures were down by a comparable amount and Nasdaq 100 Futures were down 0.7%.
The day’s big corporate news will be Walmart earnings, due for early release, which come a day after official retail sales data for January showed a sharp rebound in spending. The outlook for consumption from the U.S.’s biggest brick-and-mortar retailer will offer a perspective that official data – struggling with distortions to the usual seasonal adjustment process – may not capture.
Also in focus will be Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is marked down in premarket after issuing guidance that wasn’t as explosively optimistic as many expected, and DoorDash (NYSE:DASH), whose record revenue in the last quarter defied fears that the reopening of physical restaurants would hit its business.
4. Ukraine tensions continue to bubble as separatists reportedly fire over the border
Tensions on the Ukrainian border continue to bubble, as Kyiv and NATO repeat that there has been no meaningful withdrawal of Russian troops from advanced positions that could be used as a springboard for invasion.
Local media reported that Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine fired artillery at targets in the government-held village of Stanytsia Luhanska, and that government forces refused to fire back, fearful of creating a provocation that would create a pretext for a Russian invasion.
European natural gas futures rose as much as 8% in early trading but retraced to be up around 5% by midday. The Russian ruble, meanwhile, fell around 1% against the dollar.
5. Crude retreats further after U.S. inventory rise
Crude oil prices fell back towards $91 a barrel, as signs of slackening demand in the U.S. added to the factors that are making further gains difficult at such elevated levels.
The Energy Information Administration had said on Wednesday that U.S. crude stocks had risen by 1.1 million barrels last week, in contrast to the American Petroleum Institute’s assessment of a modest decline. Gasoline inventories, however, looked tighter, falling by 1.3 million barrels.
By 6:25 AM ET, U.S. Crude futures were down 2.4% at $91.42 a barrel, while Brent crude was down 2.1% at $92.77 a barrel.

89,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 06:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged for a second month on Thursday, as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government struggles to contain price surges that could threaten his two-decade rule.  
The Monetary Policy Committee held its one-week repo rate at 14% as forecast by all 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Turkish inflation climbed to 48.7% last month, pushing the nation’s yield when adjusted for inflation to almost -35%, the lowest by far among emerging market peers.
The lira was little changed and trading 0.2% lower at 13.6230 per dollar at 2:01 p.m. local time.
Turkey’s aggressive rate cuts in late 2021 fueled a collapse in the lira, leaving the nation more exposed than peers to recent global price shocks. Erdogan is prioritizing growth at a time many emerging market peers are tightening monetary policy to counter price gains, reasoning -- in a departure from economic orthodoxy -- that higher borrowing costs fuel inflation.
Boxed in by Erdogan’s demands, authorities have switched their focus away from rates. The central bank introduced incentives for a new savings scheme to stabilize the currency, while the government slashed value-added tax on staple foods in an effort to curb price gains. 
Treasury and Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati has predicted inflation will gradually slow this year as the economy attracts more dollar inflows from tourism over the summer. Inflation expectations for the end of the year jumped to 34.06% from 29.75%, according to the central bank’s February survey of market participants.
Rising living costs are already sapping Erdogan’s political support ahead of 2023 national elections.
The central bank’s steps to protect lira deposits and the government’s tax cuts aren’t sufficient to fight inflation, Deutsche Bank economist Fatih Akcelik said before the rate decision. “We maintain our view that the markets will force the central bank to hike its policy rate at some point this year,” he said.
Turkey’s Statistical Institute will publish gross domestic product data for the fourth quarter of 2021 and the full year on Feb. 28. It will publish February inflation data on March 3.

(Reuters) - Amid a strong U.S. housing market, low interest rates and unnervingly high inflation, the Federal Reserve has been adding to its bond portfolio even to this day, prompting calls to not just let the securities expire over time but to lay plans to begin selling them outright. 
It's unlikely that any sales would be included at the start of the balance sheet ""normalization"" plans officials are expected to approve in the coming months, a process that will run alongside interest rate hikes aimed at becalming inflation.
But if the fight against inflation doesn't succeed fast enough, some Fed officials want a ""Plan B"" that would venture into new territory and use sales of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to raise home mortgage rates, one of the key channels that the U.S. central bank can use to lower inflation because it holds down home prices and leaves less room in household budgets for other spending.
Fed officials discussed the possibility of MBS sales at their Jan. 25-26 policy meeting, with ""many participants"" saying it might be appropriate ""at some point in the future,"" minutes from the meeting showed on Wednesday.
Home borrowing costs are already rising rapidly, with the average contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage popping above 4% this month for the first time since 2019, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Even before the Fed's first rate hike - expected to come next month - or the first bond matures from its portfolio without replacement, that key consumer interest rate has surged a full percentage point in less than six months. 
Mortgage rates are climbing fast - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/jnvwelnwdvw/chart.png 
Still, the Fed's $2.7 trillion MBS stockpile acts as an anchor on interest rates in that market, preventing them from being even higher, and some officials argue the central bank's footprint may need to shrink faster than it would through natural ""runoff."" That process, of securities rolling off the balance sheet as they mature, is particularly slow and unpredictable for MBS and may take longer when rates are rising. 
""I still keep that option open in scenarios where inflation is not moderating in the way we hoped and we are going to have to get a little tougher,"" St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Reuters at the start of February. 
And speaking on CNBC this week, Bullard said he supports starting the balance sheet reduction in the second quarter of this year through the passive approach and then using asset sales as a ""Plan B"" if needed to ""speed up the pace."" 
DECIDING EXIT STRATEGY
Investors are keen to know how the Fed is going to unwind more than $8 trillion of MBS and Treasury securities - a portfolio that doubled during the coronavirus pandemic as the central bank snapped up the assets to stabilize markets and the economy.
Bond purchases have long been a controversial aspect of monetary policy in part because of lingering questions around the exit strategy, with some critics arguing that selling securities when interest rates are rising can cause the central bank to lose money. Bond prices fall when interest rates are rising and vice versa. 
The Fed avoided bond sales when it last reduced the balance sheet between 2017 and 2019. Policymakers want to rely primarily on the runoff strategy this time around too, according to principles released last month. 
The first ""QT"" - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/BALANCESHEET/jnvwelojbvw/chart.png 
But some Fed officials and analysts say that passive approach could fall short. Bullard and Kansas City Fed President Esther George are among those who have pointed to high inflation as a concern. 
Sales may also be needed to help the Fed meet its goal of moving to a portfolio that is made up mostly of Treasury securities in the long run, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester recently said.
Part of the issue lies with the Fed's mortgage holdings, which are expected to move off its balance sheet more slowly than its Treasury holdings once the shrinkage of the portfolio is initiated. 
For example, about $2.5 trillion of the Fed's Treasury holdings have short maturities and would come due in the next three years, according to an analysis by the fixed income team at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But it's difficult to know exactly how long it will take for the Fed's mortgage holdings to roll off the balance sheet, analysts say. 
Portions of the securities are prepaid early as people sell their homes or refinance their loans, which leads them to pay their mortgages off ahead of the initial due date. And it typically takes time for MBS to roll off the balance sheet naturally. 
Between October 2017 and September 2017, the Fed capped the monthly reductions at $50 billion, but the actual decline was typically much less than that. Policymakers want to move faster this time, but are concerned the Fed's mortgage holdings will prove ""sticky,"" particularly when mortgage rates are rising.
That's because fewer people refinance their mortgages when rates are going up, which slows the rate of loan prepayments, said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. 
In fact, that may already be happening. MBA's data shows that refinancing application volumes are at a two-year low and their share of all mortgage applications is the lowest since July 2019.
Fed officials are currently running the numbers on how long it could take for the mortgage holdings to run off the portfolio and no decisions have been made, Mester said. 
But the Fed may want to address the possibility of asset sales early on when it starts to provide guidance on its plans for the balance sheet, Jones said. 

""They'll want to address the question in one way or another,"" Jones said.

LONDON (Reuters) - More than seven out of 10 British exporters have found no benefit from the trade deal that Britain agreed with the European Union after Brexit, the British Chambers of Commerce said on Thursday.
New trade rules took effect on Jan. 1, 2021, 11 months after Britain formally left the EU after almost 50 years of membership. British trade with the EU does not face tariffs, but there is extra paperwork for customs declarations and many services exports are restricted.
Out of more than 1,000 businesses surveyed within the past month - which mostly had 250 staff or fewer - just 12% of exporters agreed that the new arrangements had helped them increase sales, while 71% disagreed.
""Many of these companies have neither the time, staff or money to deal with the additional paperwork and rising costs involved with EU trade, nor can they afford to set up a new base in Europe or pay for intermediaries to represent them,"" the BCC's head of trade policy, William Bain, said.
Britain's official data shows that after a slump in exports to the EU in January 2021 when there were widespread delays at ports, exports are back around their previous level, while imports from the EU are some way below.

Many economists say this is still a poor outcome, as global demand has boomed over the past year, with British exporters losing market share, and the overall reduction in trade with the EU will hamper Britain's productivity in the long term.
The BCC said key areas where it wanted changes included export health certificates for British-produced food, value-added tax registration for smaller online retailers and upcoming restrictions on electrical safety certification for imports.

92,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 05:17AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has been right to maintain its easy money policy as inflation is set to fall after ""transient boosts"" from supply snags that may extend into next year, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday.
Backing from her former employer was likely to bring some relief to ECB President Christine Lagarde as she struggles to persuade investors that she is not about to jack up interest rates in the face of record inflation.
The Washington-based institution said past data suggested that wages in the euro zone would rise only modestly and that inflation, which hit 5.1% last month, would fall back below the ECB's 2% target.
""We expect inflation to fall slightly below the European Central Bank’s target once the pandemic fades,"" read a blog post signed by managing director Kristalina Georgieva and two other officials.
""The ECB has appropriately decided to maintain an accommodative monetary stance until its medium-term inflation target is met while preserving its flexibility to adjust course if high underlying inflation proves more durable than expected.""
Lagarde, Georgieva's predecessor at the helm of the IMF, repeated on Monday that any change to the ECB's ultra-easy policy of massive bond purchases and negative interest rates would be gradual.
But she failed to convince investors, who are still pricing in rate hikes worth 50 basis points by the end of the year. 
The IMF's post was based on a new paper estimating that euro zone GDP would have been 2% higher last year had it not been for supply constraints, caused by lockdowns and by shortages of everything from containers to skilled workers.
This supply shock accounted for half the increase in euro area producer price inflation excluding energy prices last year, the IMF said. 

It warned that bottlenecks may last longer than expected and possibly into 2023 due to the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, posing a challenge for central bankers trying to support the economy while keeping a lid on inflation. 
""Keeping medium-term inflation expectations stable despite transient boosts to inflation, including from supply disruptions and surging energy prices, is key to managing this trade-off,"" the IMF said.

""The direction in which we need to head is clear, but we should not draw premature conclusions as to the time frame. The process will be both gradual and data-dependent,"" De Cos told a financial event.
On Wednesday, two European Central Bank officials made the case for ending the ECB's bond buying scheme as high inflation in the euro zone lessens the case for adding stimulus to the economy.
Although inflation is now more than twice the ECB's 2% target, the bank has kept policy especially loose on the assumption that inflation will fall back below target next year without any action.

JOHANNESBURG/LONDON (Reuters) -Wealthy nations must improve their floundering flagship debt relief initiative or face a spate of debt crises in the developing world, experts and campaigners say as a meeting of finance chiefs of G20 major economies opened on Thursday.
As the pandemic battered global economies, the Group of 20 leading economies launched measures, including a temporary debt service suspension for poor countries to provide breathing room, as well as the Common Framework - a debt restructuring scheme for long-term relief.
The Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) has now expired. Meanwhile, having signed up for the Common Framework a year ago, Zambia, Ethiopia and Chad have yet to receive relief. 
Their uncertain fate, coupled with the fear of being punished by the market, have led other governments to steer clear of the Common Framework.
""It doesn't give them any incentives,"" the Washington-based Center for Global Development's Daouda Sembene, a former director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), told Reuters.
""Unfortunately, it so far has done some harm and not necessarily good.""
Alarm (NASDAQ:ALRM) bells are ringing for many. According to the IMF, some 60% of low-income countries - mostly in Africa - are either in debt distress or at high risk of it, up from less than 30% in 2015.
This year, 74 low-income nations must repay $35 billion to bilateral and private lenders - nearly double from 2020, the World Bank calculated. With the U.S. Federal Reserve on the verge of hiking interest rates, borrowing costs are set to increase for riskier emerging markets.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called for action on relief for poorer nations and will urge her G20 counterparts to work towards shoring up developing countries.
World Bank President David Malpass said last month the slow pace of relief is increasing the risk of sovereign defaults.
Hung Tran, a former IMF deputy director now with the Atlantic Council think tank, wrote this week that G20 initiatives to deal with debt had ""largely failed https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-g20s-unfinished-business-dont-let-debt-do-us-part"".
""Unless these efforts are strengthened, sovereign debt crises will prevent vulnerable countries from fully bouncing back after the pandemic."" 
REVISED RELIEF PLAN
Officials in Indonesia, which holds this year's G20 presidency, say debt relief is one issue on the agenda at the meeting of finance ministers on Thursday and Friday.
IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva wants the Common Framework beefed up with timelines to speed up decision-making and clear comparability of treatment enforcement, providing creditors comfort that the process is fair. 
She also wants debt service standstills during restructuring negotiations and an expansion of the framework's remit as many countries holding the bulk of at-risk debt are not poor enough to currently qualify for relief. 
Others are pushing for deeper revisions.
The Atlantic Council's Tran believes debt service standstill should prevent ratings agencies from downgrading countries seeking relief.
Tim Jones of the UK-based Jubilee Debt Campaign says a plan is needed to deal with private creditors and bondholders, who refused to participate in the now expired DSSI initiative.
""You need to make clear the alternative is them not being paid anything,"" he said
What action, if any, the G20 delivers this week remains to be seen. Finance ministers might be absorbed by issues closer to home - geopolitical tensions, rising global inflation and tighter monetary policy.
""So what happens in 30 low-income countries, even though it's 30 countries, is something that could be happening on another planet,"" World Bank Chief Economist Carmen Reinhart told Reuters.

Even a functioning Common Framework will solve only half the problem, experts say. Countries must get help in growing economies, not just traditional austerity measures.
""It is not solving a growth problem, and you cannot solve a debt problem by killing growth,"" said Vera Songwe, the executive secretary of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa.

MANILA (Reuters) -The Philippine central bank left key interest rates unchanged for a 10th consecutive policy meeting on Thursday, reaffirming continued support for the economy as officials warned of risks that could derail the global recovery.
The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) kept the rate on the overnight reverse repurchase facility at a record low 2.0%, as expected by all 21 economists in a Reuters poll.
The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were also kept at 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively.
""The monetary board deems it prudent to maintain the BSP's accommodative policy stance given a manageable inflation environment and emerging uncertainty surrounding domestic and global growth prospects,"" BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno said in a joint media and analysts' briefing.
Last week, he said the BSP would not necessarily follow the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has signalled it may start raising interest rates in March to tackle inflation.
The BSP will wait until the end of the year before raising rates, a Feb. 1-14 Reuters poll found, in line with Diokno's view that monetary policy would remain accommodative as long as required to underpin growth.
On Thursday, Diokno said the economy's recovery was gaining further traction, but elevated global commodity prices, heightened geopolitical tensions, and the uneven pace of COVID-19 vaccinations across countries could dampen the growth outlook.
Some economists, however, believe a BSP rate hike could come as early as by the end of the second quarter.
""BSP can keep rates unchanged for now but the window for accommodation is closing fast,"" said ING senior economist Nicholas Mapa, citing emerging inflationary pressures.
The increased volatility in global oil prices warrants close monitoring and potential ""second-round effects"" on inflation should be averted with appropriate intervention measures, the BSP said. 
The BSP expects inflation to average 3.7% in 2022, and 3.3% in 2023, within the 2%-4% target range but slightly higher than previous forecasts.
""There is enough headroom for continued accommodative monetary policy in the near term, with possible normalisation to begin towards the second half of 2022,"" BSP Deputy Governor Francisco Dakila said during the same briefing.

But given what Diokno described as stronger signs of recovery in output growth and labour market conditions and improvements in domestic financial markets, he said the BSP was now crafting an exit strategy.
""The BSP will continue to carefully develop its plans for the eventual normalization of its extraordinary liquidity measures when conditions warrant,"" he said.

The SNB has charged commercial banks a negative rate of minus 0.75% since January 2015 as part of its strategy to weaken demand for the safe-haven franc.
Some banks have passed on the charge to their customers, triggering fears people anxious to avoid it could respond by hoarding cash.
But most companies (58%) told the SNB they did not keep cash as a store of value in the survey of 2,000 companies in Switzerland carried out by the central bank.
This share is more than double the share of companies holding cash for imminent transactions.
Roughly a third of companies held up to 50,000 Swiss francs ($54,095) in cash as a store of value, the study found. But just 1% held more than 1 million francs in cash, it added.
Most companies said they kept the cash on hand as a safety net, with less than 10% saying it was to avoid negative interest rates.
Central banks are generally against cash hoarding because it erodes the effectiveness of monetary policy by weakening the money creation process.

A study last year showed that 70% of Swiss households kept cash at home as a store of value, although the average amount was less than 1,000 francs and was usually put aside to deal with crisis situations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States needs to pursue new strategies and update its domestic trade tools to deal with China's ""state-led, non-market policies and practices"", the U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Wednesday in a new assessment report.
USTR said in its annual report on China's compliance https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/WTO/2021%20USTR%20Report%20to%20Congress%20on%20China's%20WTO%20Compliance.pdf with World Trade Organization rules that the ""Phase 1"" trade agreement signed by the Trump administration two years ago failed to address fundamental U.S. concerns with China's industrial policies and supporting policies, including ""massive financial resources.""
It said such support, which includes favorable regulatory support to Chinese industry and limited market access for imported goods and services, is often aimed at specific targets for capacity, production and market share. 
The report, issued annually to Congress since China joined the WTO in 2001, is the first issued under U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and reflects her China trade strategy.
It follows final 2021 trade data showing Beijing's failure to meet promised two-year targets for purchasing U.S. goods, services and energy under the Phase 1 deal, which eased a tariff war between the world's two largest economies. 
""China has not moved to embrace the market-oriented principles on which the WTO and its rules are based, despite the representations that it made when it joined 20 years ago,"" Tai said in a statement. ""China has instead retained and expanded its state-led, non-market approach to the economy and trade.""
The USTR report said the United States needs to update its domestic trade law tools to reflect the current realities of China's trade policies ""to secure a more level playing field for U.S. workers and businesses.""
A sweeping China competition bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and under consideration in the Senate would expand the use of anti-subsidy tariffs to target cross-border subsidies for Chinese companies that invest in offshore production to skirt U.S. duties.
""It is also apparent that existing trade tools need to be strengthened, and new trade tools need to be forged,"" USTR said in the report. ""China pursues unfair policies and practices that were not contemplated when many of the U.S. trade statutes were drafted decades ago, and we are therefore exploring ways in which to update our trade tools to counter them.""
The report said the United States was still pursuing bilateral engagement ""to hold China accountable for its existing commitments"", including under the Phase 1 agreement.
It also said China had failed to make good on other Phase 1 commitments. These include regulatory approvals for U.S. agricultural biotechnology and a risk assessment on the use of ractopamine, a feed additive used to produce leaner pork and beef in the United States.

Gao Feng, spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce, on Thursday urged the United States to adopt a reasonable and practical approach to trade with China, so that bilateral ties could return to the right track.
""U.S. labelling China as non-market oriented does not have any proof in international economic and trade rules, nor is it consistent with the facts,"" Gao said.

The generous plan, unveiled at a news conference hosted by China's state planner on Thursday, underscores official concerns about job prospects for the country's millions of graduates in a labour market that has tightened due to slowing economic growth.
Zhejiang is also the testing ground of President Xi Jinping's so-called ""common prosperity"" drive. The province, a manufacturing powerhouse by the coast, has been tasked with piloting policies to narrow income disparities by 2025.
If graduates' startup businesses go sour, the government can help pay at least 80% of their loans and 100% if it is less than 100,000 yuan, Chen Zhong, vice director at Zhejiang province's Human Resources and Social Security Department, told reporters. 
College graduates can also enjoy a living allowance and housing subsidies from 20,000 to 400,000 yuan if they work in Zhejiang, China's fourth-biggest province by economic output. 
""College graduates are valuable human resources... This year, there are more than 10 million college graduates across the country, which is a good opportunity for us,"" Chen said. 
Last week, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said the central government will offer special help to young entrepreneurs and roll out incentives for small companies that employ fresh graduates, estimated to reach a record 10.76 million across the country this year. 
New graduates coming to Zhejiang will now be able to obtain a ""hukou"", or residency, with no strings attached, according to Chen, although restrictions to apply for a hukou in the downtown area of the provincial capital of Hangzhou would remain. 
Hukou, aimed at ensuring urban resources are not overwhelmed by migrant workers, impose limits on home ownership and benefits for out-of-towners.

""Most projects by college students are not reliable. And the amount of money may only be useful for them to set up street stands,"" said a Shanghai-based venture capitalist, who declined to be identified due to company policy.

LONDON (Reuters) -For NATO members, the most powerful measure against Russia were it to invade Ukraine would be U.S. sanctions cutting off Russian state banks from the dollar according to Russian executives, bankers, and former senior U.S. sanctions officials. The United States has warned that Russia could invade as early as this week. Moscow denies it has such plans but says the West needs to take its concerns about NATO expansion seriously. Washington, and its allies in Europe, are finalising an extensive package of sanctions if Russia were to launch an invasion according to U.S. and European officials. The U.S. package would expand a technology export ban to include any goods made with U.S. components or software, as well as proposed sanctions against specific Russian billionaires. But sanctions experts say more than any other measure, aggressive action against Russia's state banks would hit its economy the hardest. ""Banking sanctions are the most impactful measure the U.S. can carry out in the short term,"" said Brian O'Toole, a former senior advisor to the director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control or OFAC in the U.S. Treasury Department, which designs and manages the implementation of sanctions. Proposed sanctions against Russian banks would bar them from making any transactions in U.S. dollars, essentially freezing any dollar-denominated assets or liabilities held by the banks at home and abroad. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov on Wednesday said sanctions against Russian banks would be “unpleasant” and lead to a spike in volatility, but said the state would make sure that all deposits with banks and all transactions, including in foreign currencies, were secured. Russia’s abundant hard currency reserves – now at $635bn – would help shield against the potential blow, he said. When asked about possible sanctions on Russian state banks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters that Russia was “preparing for unpredictable actions” from the United States “by hedging against any risks."" 
He said: ""We could get the impression that all this information noise and all these claims that Russia is about to attack Ukraine are being made to further contain Russia and to create a reason to impose further sanctions - and so they are speaking about these hellish sanctions."" Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance in Washington said even though Russia has enough reserves, the potential measures ""could cause a run on deposits. It will definitely have a strong impact on the domestic financial system. It will raise the risk of financial instability including a widening of spreads and a sell-off of the rouble.” U.S. sanctions far outweigh the power of any other jurisdiction because the White House can potentially impose secondary sanctions on any foreign banks continuing to deal with these institutions, said O’Toole and Tom Keatinge, finance and security expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. The White House did not answer requests for comment about secondary sanctions. Shares in banking giant Sberbank and smaller rival VTB have both fallen in the past week on the prospect of sanctions, although recovered some losses after Russia said on Tuesday that some troops stationed near borders with Ukraine were returning to base after completing drills Sberbank holds nearly half of Russia's 21 trillion roubles in deposits and together with state lenders VTB, Gazprombank, and Rosselkhozbank accounts for nearly 60% of the nation’s banking assets. GOING IN HEAVY Sberbank, VTB and the Russian Central Bank declined to comment. Gazprombank and Rosselkhozbank did not respond to requests for comment. ""Taking out Sberbank would have massive ramifications,"" O'Toole added. The nature of the sanctions would likely hinge on the scale of a Russian invasion. A Russian invasion limited to an incursion into the rebel-held Donbass region of east Ukraine for example, might mean the United States staggered its targeting of the Russian state banks in order to maintain further deterrence, potentially keeping Sberbank until last, said Daniel Fried, a former State Department coordinator for sanctions policy in the Obama administration. But ""if the Kremlin goes in big, so could we, and we might go in heavy in any case,"" Fried said. Sanctions on banks would be partly aimed at forcing Russia's central bank to dig into its hard currency reserves in order to bail out the banks and keep them afloat, O'Toole and Fried both said. The central bank declined to comment on hard currency reserves and sanctions. Russia has some defences to withstand a U.S.-led attack on its financial stability. The hard currency reserves, high oil prices and a low debt to GDP ratio of 18% in 2021 place it in a good position to weather a further tightening of existing sanctions, said Chris Weafer, director of MacroAdvisory, a Moscow-based consultancy.
In addition, Russian state banks curtailed their exposure to Western markets when the United States and EU imposed limited sanctions on VTB and Sberbank in retaliation for Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, which restricted their ability to raise debt.
Today, the proposed state bank sanctions would include a system of waivers, licenses and wind-down periods to ensure payments for dollar-denominated commodity contracts and debt payments could be made, the sanctions experts said. 
Russian officials have largely focused on threats to cut off Russia from the SWIFT financial messaging system in case of war. But U.S. and European officials said last week this measure was now off the table due to concerns from European lenders that it could mean billions of dollars in outstanding loans they have in Russia would not be repaid. 

DOLLARS THE KEY Sberbank chief executive German Gref has previously brushed off reports that U.S. sanctions could prevent Moscow from converting roubles into dollars on the grounds that he believed it was ""impossible to execute."" Two senior Russian bankers interviewed by Reuters said they expected any targeted bank to escape the worst of the impact by converting their dollar holdings into euros. Former senior U.S. sanctions officials, however, said this confidence was misplaced as the dollars would still have to ultimately go through a U.S. clearing bank in order to convert them. ""Anything that is denominated in dollars has to clear through the U.S. and once you do that it's stuck,"" said O'Toole. These sanctions, he said, could also lead to freezes on dollar accounts held abroad by the Russian state banks in correspondent accounts, set up to handle funds on behalf of another bank. Igor Yurgens, vice president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, a powerful lobby group for Russian business, told Reuters the Russian central bank had been working on a programme for correspondent accounts with China through which to convert cash that might help mitigate the impact of sanctions. ""Everything would be difficult, but it won't collapse,"" he said. The Russian authorities ""have conducted technological stress tests and consider they will muddle through for a while."" Sergey Aleksashenko, a former deputy Russian central bank chairman now living in exile in the United States, said he believed the West's sanctions threats were no more than an escalating virtual, or information, war between Russia and the West. In this standoff, ""Putin's weapon is (the movement of) tanks and the West's is talk of sanctions. All of this is part of a great game,"" he said. But one of Russia's top 50 billionaires interviewed by Reuters warned that the political manoeuvring between Moscow and Washington could end up in conflict and economic reprisals.
""Everyone has been playing a virtual game...But then all these virtual events can become facts in life."" ""Sanctions will lead to serious economic consequences,"" he said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - President Nayib Bukele on Wednesday asked U.S. senators to stay out of El Salvador's ""internal affairs"" after they called for an investigation into the economic risks the United States faces due to the Central American country's adoption of bitcoin as legal tender.
Senators Jim Risch, Bill Cassidy and Bob Mendez asked the State Department to submit a report on the implementation of bitcoin in El Salvador with the purpose of assessing the risks it poses to the U.S. economy.
""Ok boomers… You have 0 jurisdiction on a sovereign and independent nation,"" Bukele, 40, said in a tweet, referring to the older generation of ""baby boomers"". ""We are not your colony, your back yard or your front yard. Stay out of our internal affairs. Don’t try to control something you can’t control.""
El Salvador was the first country in the world to adopt cryptocurrency for official use, in parallel to the U.S. dollar, a decision that has drawn it harsh criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The U.S. senators also expressed fear over the fact that adopting bitcoin could weaken the U.S. government's sanctions policy and increase the activity of criminal organizations.
""This new policy has the potential to weaken U.S. sanctions policy, empowering malign actors like China and organized criminal organizations. Our bipartisan legislation seeks greater clarity on El Salvador’s policy,"" said the senators in a statement.

The Salvadoran government, which has acquired some 1,801 bitcoins since September, has been questioned by economists and the opposition for its refusal to be accountable in the process of buying and managing the funds.
Diplomatic relations between El Salvador and the United States have deteriorated after the White House denounced publicly cases of corruption in Bukele's government and an escalation of measures to accumulate power.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - The United States has ""no intention"" of engaging with China in its forthcoming Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, but is talking to its partners who share the same vision of a free and open region with no coercion, a senior U.S. diplomat said.
The United States vowed on last week to commit more diplomatic and security resources to the Indo-Pacific to push back against what its sees as China's bid to create a regional sphere of influence and become the world's most influential power.
In a 12-page strategy overview, the Biden administration said it would focus on every corner of the region from South Asia to the Pacific Islands to strengthen its long-term position and commitment.
The document reiterated U.S. plans to launch an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework in early 2022, an initiative the administration hopes will at least partially fill a big gap in engagement with the region since former President Donald Trump quit a multinational trade framework in 2017.
Speaking to reporters on a Thursday conference call, U.S Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink said early discussions were ongoing about the economic framework.
""I think it's safe to say that we are engaged in initial conversations with partners across the region, who share our vision for the kind of region that we want to live in again, a free and open region in which countries are free from coercion and are able to pursue their economic and security interests freely in an in an unhindered fashion,"" he said. 
""And you are correct that there is currently no intention to engage the People's Republic of China on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.""
Chinese President Xi Jinping has pushed what the country calls the Belt and Road programme, committing billions of dollars to build infrastructure around the world.
China has also backed the world's largest free trade bloc that excludes the United States, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
China and Russia declared a ""no limits"" strategic partnership earlier this month, their most detailed and assertive statement to work together - and against the United States - to build a new international order based on their own interpretations of human rights and democracy.
Kritenbrink said Washington could not ""dismiss the challenge"" posed by the vision put forward by China and Russia's joint statement.

""We stand for a world and a vision grounded in problem solving and innovation, not coercion and aggression,"" he said.
""That is our affirmative vision for the region. I think it stands in stark contrast to the vision of others, including that put forward by Presidents Putin and Xi.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - An expected reshuffle of the Bank of Japan's board will give Prime Minister Fumio Kishida a chance to replace a reflationist member with a less-dovish policymaker in July, a move that could nudge the central bank away from its radical easy policy.
Any such change won't lead to an immediate policy tightening and would mark only a subtle shift in the nine-member board, which has consistently voted to keep policy ultra-loose to fire up inflation to the bank's elusive 2% target.
But the departure of Goushi Kataoka, seen as the most dovish member of the board, comes at a time other central banks are focusing more on fighting inflation, and as Governor Haruhiko Kuroda - the architect of the BOJ's radical easing - faces the end of his second and last term in roughly a year.
""It's just one vote but a very important one given Kataoka was always vocally against rolling back stimulus,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities who is a veteran BOJ watcher.
""Not having such a strong opponent (against policy normalisation) in the board could smooth the groundwork for an eventual exit from ultra-loose policy,"" she said.
A former economist, Kataoka has been a solo dissenter to the BOJ's decision to keep its interest rate targets unchanged and consistently proposed cutting rates further.
He and former commercial banker Hitoshi Suzuki, who warned of the rising side-effects of prolonged easing but voted with the majority, will both see their five-year terms end in July. The successor of Suzuki is likely to come from the banking sector and unlikely to rock the boat on policy, analysts say.
The government is listing candidates to fill the openings and could present its nominees to parliament as early as next month, say two sources familiar with the matter.
LEADERSHIP REVAMP LOOMS
The choice will give markets a taste of Kishida's policy bias. While stressing the need to maintain monetary support for now, the premier has distanced himself from his predecessor Shinzo Abe's aggressive stimulus policies and had warned in the past against keeping interest rates low for too long.
Many of Kishida's close associates are former finance ministry bureaucrats-turned lawmakers who - unlike aides of Abe who influenced BOJ personnel decisions - are wary of relying too much on heavy money printing to spur growth.
The finance ministry has traditionally focused on spending cuts and tax hikes in getting Japan's fiscal house in order. That runs counter to the reflationists' view that by spurring growth with bold monetary and fiscal stimulus steps, Japan can rein in its huge debt without raising tax.
""There's a good chance the government will choose someone more neutral on monetary policy,"" said a third source. ""It's hard to see a reflationist-minded person being chosen if the finance ministry has strong influence in the process.""
The board will be left with even fewer doves in a revamp of the BOJ's leadership early next year, when Kuroda and his two deputies see their terms end including Masazumi Wakatabe - another proponent of aggressive easing.
The two remaining reflationist-minded board members, Asahi Noguchi and Seiji Adachi, no longer speak of the need to ramp up stimulus to quicken achievement of the BOJ's price target.
While the BOJ will likely be the last in line to raise interest rates due to low inflation, the shrinking presence of doves could also affect the pace at which it rolls back Kuroda's legacy stimulus programme, some analysts say.

""Up till now, the government kept filling BOJ board openings with people who won't go against Kuroda's radical policies,"" said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research.
""Kishida may try a different approach.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - More than two-thirds of Japanese firms don't plan to raise base salaries at this year's labour talks, a Reuters poll showed, with pay increases more likely to come from one-time bonuses that may not kickstart household spending.
A slim majority of firms said they would raise the total amount they pay workers this year, including bonuses, as corporate earnings rebound from the worst period of the COVID-19 pandemic. A full 39% said the increases would be between 1-3%.
The survey goes some way to show why wages remain one of the most vexing problems for the world's no.3 economy, where policymakers want to see a virtuous cycle of higher wages and domestic consumption.
After years of deflation, companies remain wary of increasing base salaries, which become permanent. Instead, companies use discretionary bonuses - paying out more when times are good and cutting back in a downturn. As a result households often hoard cash for a rainy day.
With surging oil and global commodity inflation driving up the cost of living, the government is pressing companies to raise wages. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has called for a ""new capitalism"" that includes a greater distribution of wealth.
""We will avoid base pay hikes, which will increase fixed costs over time,"" a manager of a machinery maker wrote in the Feb 1-10 survey of some 500 big and midsize Japanese non-financial companies. Roughly half responded on condition of anonymity.
""In view of recent price hikes, we are raising pay, which is vital for lifting employee morale,"" wrote one manager at a ceramics maker, saying earnings ""turned out solid"".
Last year, major Japanese companies offered the lowest wage increases below 2% in eight years as the COVID-19 hammered corporate profits.
This year, Japan's biggest business lobby Keidanren has urged companies to raise wages, although it has brushed aside Kishida's call for uniform pay hikes of 3% or more for profitable firms, given the uneven nature of the recovery.
Rengo, Japan's largest labour confederation, has demanded 4% wage hikes combining 2% base-pay rises and 2% annual pay hikes.
Most economists surveyed in a separate Reuters poll reckoned Kishida's wage policies were unlikely to trigger a virtuous growth cycle.
The Reuters corporate survey in December also showed a slim majority of firms expecting to increase total pay, including bonuses.
INFLATION
A slim majority of firms voiced a concern about rising long-term rates, with 40% saying they can tolerate rate rises of up to 0.25% and another 40% seeing 0.5% can be tolerated.
Against the backdrop of global inflation, the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield hit 0.23% last week, the highest since 2016 and near the implicit 0.25% cap the BOJ set around its target of 0%.
""It would be desirable for inflation to entail a pay increase. But the current price hikes under low growth are undesirable,"" wrote a transport company manager.

Several others expressed concern that Japan may fall into stagflation - a combination of low growth and high inflation.
Still, those who were concerned the world's third largest economy may slide back into deflation outweighed those worried about rising inflation, the survey showed.

The decree will also allow the government to meet a $166 million sovereign bond maturity scheduled for March 15 by accessing support funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) held by the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH), said deputy finance minister Elizabeth Rivera.
The initiative was proposed by the new leftist president Xiomara Castro, who upon taking office on Jan. 27, said she had taken charge of a state in ""bankruptcy"" from conservative president Juan Orlando Hernandez, who ruled for eight years.
""Congress approved a decree authorizing the government to take out loans, including through the issuance of sovereign bonds, for up to $2 billion this year and next year to address fiscal and financial problems,"" congressional vice president Hugo Noe told Reuters.
Noe, a former finance minister, said the fiscal and financial emergency decree that was passed on Tuesday also authorizes the government to use $335 million in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) provided by the IMF and held by the central bank to be used for budget execution.
Elizabeth Rivera, the deputy finance minister, said in the unicameral Congress the decree will allow the central bank to transfer the $335 million from SDRs, which will be used to pay the $166 million bond maturity scheduled for March and the rest to finance budget expenditures in the first quarter of the year.
Honduras had a total public debt of $15.679 billion at the end of 2021, representing 59.3% of gross domestic product, according to Ministry of Finance figures.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore maintained its forecast for the economy to expand 3-5% this year as the city-state's recovery from the pandemic slump continues, although officials flagged downside risks to global growth and rising inflationary pressures.
The global economic recovery faces risks from mounting price pressures due to supply chain disruptions and rising energy costs amid tensions involving Russia and Ukraine, even as the pandemic appears to abate.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.1% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said, slightly higher than the 5.9% growth in the government's advance estimate.
Analysts had expected a 6.2% increase, according to a Reuters poll.
For the full year 2021, GDP grew 7.6% versus an initial 7.2% estimate and a 4.1% contraction in 2020. Last year's growth was the highest in a decade.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy expanded 2.3% in the fourth quarter.
Singapore's economic recovery has been led by the trade-related and manufacturing sectors, but activity in industries exposed to tourism, aviation and consumers are expected to remain below pre-COVID levels even by the end of 2022.
""Global supply bottlenecks remain and are expected to persist throughout the first half of 2022, thereby constraining industrial production and GDP growth in the near term,"" said Gabriel Lim, permanent secretary for trade and industry.
""Persistent supply bottlenecks, alongside rising energy prices due to geopolitical tensions, have also exacerbated global inflationary pressures,"" he said.
Output of the construction sector was expected to remain below pre-pandemic levels throughout 2022. 
However, bolstered by high vaccination rates, Singapore is loosening border measures and easing local restrictions, in moves that will likely support the recovery of lagging sectors. 
The Monetary Authority of Singapore tightened its policy settings in January in its first out-of-cycle move in seven years. It is widely expected to tighten again at its scheduled policy meeting in April.
""For monetary policy purposes, we assess that the balance of risk is still tipped towards inflation,"" said Edward Robinson, Deputy Managing Director at the MAS. The central bank will release its next review on its monetary policy in April as scheduled, he said.
He affirmed the 2022 core inflation forecast at 2-3% and headline inflation at 2.5–3.5%. 
The forecast does not include any impact from a looming Goods and Services Tax (GST) hike, the timing for which is likely to be announced at the budget on Friday. 
Separate data on Thursday showed Singapore's January non-oil domestic exports (NODX) rose 17.6% from a year earlier, beating expectations.

""We expect growth momentum to slow sequentially in H1 2022, amid a more protracted reopening due to the Omicron wave and rising inflationary pressures,"" said Priyanka Kishore and Sung-Eun Jung at Oxford Economics. 
""We also expect further monetary tightening and a return to conservative fiscal policies this year,"" they added in a research note.

JENKINTOWN, Pa. (Reuters) -Congressman Conor Lamb has a message to Pennsylvania Democrats who wonder whether he is liberal enough to represent them in the U.S. Senate: He is no Joe Manchin.
Locked in a tight nominating race with the northeastern state's progressive lieutenant governor, John Fetterman, the moderate Lamb has drawn comparisons to Manchin, a conservative Democratic Senator from neighboring West Virginia who has routinely acted as a roadblock to Democratic priorities in Congress.
Manchin endorsed Lamb for his 2020 congressional bid and has helped him raise money.
During a weekend chat with Democratic voters at a coffee shop in Philadelphia suburb Jenkintown, Lamb noted that he voted for President Joe Biden's sweeping $1.75 trillion Build Back Better spending bill, which Manchin blocked. He also said he supported ending a Senate practice called the filibuster that Republicans have used to block votes on voting rights and other issues.
Manchin and fellow conservative Democratic Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona both lined up against lifting the filibuster, blocking Democrats who control the 50-50 Senate due to Vice President Kamala Harris' tiebreaking vote. Sinema stopped short of fully endorsing the Build Back Better bill, saying she was willing to continue working. 
""We're basically two votes away on that long list of priorities, and that's what the Senate campaign is really about,"" Lamb said, without explicitly identifying the two senators.
The Senate seat that Fetterman, Lamb and state Representative Malcolm Kenyatta are seeking the nomination for is seen by nonpartisan election analysts as the most competitive Senate contest ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm elections, since its current occupant, Republican Pat Toomey, 60, plans to retire at the end of his term.
History and Biden's sliding approval rating favor Republicans' chances of winning back control of at least the Senate or the House of Representatives, which would give them the power to block the Democratic president's legislative agenda for the last two years of his four-year term.
Chris Borick, a political science professor at Pennsylvania’s Muhlenberg College, said Lamb's pitch to voters is that he would be electable in November.
""He's trying to find the sweet spot,"" Borick said. ""And the sweet spot is, look, you know there is a place for Joe Manchin in the Democratic Party, but I am not Joe Manchin. I am a Pennsylvania Democrat, which means focusing on labor and working-class issues, which has been a good recipe for winning statewide.""
Lamb, 37, served in the U.S. Marines and as a federal prosecutor before he was first elected to Congress in 2018.
He is trailing Fetterman, 52, in the few public opinion polls on the race and is significantly behind in fundraising ahead of the May 17 primary election, when Democrats will pick their nominee. 
His rivals have more directly criticized Manchin.
""Some Democrats, like Manchin, who are refusing to reform the filibuster, are telling us that allegiance to a flawed Senate rule is more important to them than democracy itself. They're wrong,"" Fetterman wrote in an opinion article on CNN.com last year, one of many times he has directly chided the West Virginia senator.
Kenyatta, 31, has criticized Manchin in speeches and social media posts. Asked in a recent interview whether he thought Manchin was a Democrat, the state representative responded, ""Occasionally.""

Manchin, whose office did not respond to a request for comment, has defended himself from liberal criticism, saying he has never been a progressive Democrat and doesn't plan on becoming one. The senator -- whose state voted overwhelmingly for Republican Donald Trump for president in 2016 and 2020 -- has also offered some advice:
""All they need to do is, we have to elect more liberals,"" he told reporters in September.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Federal Reserve officials last month agreed that, with inflation tightening its grip on the economy and employment strong, it was time to raise interest rates, but also that any decisions would depend on a meeting-by-meeting analysis of inflation and other data, according to the minutes of the Jan. 25-26 policy meeting.
The account of the two-day session showed the U.S. central bank readying for a fight against the fastest pace of price increases since the 1980s, with officials saying that while they still expected inflation to ease through the year they would be ready to hike rates fast if it does not.
""Most participants noted that, if inflation does not move down as they expect, it would be appropriate for the (Federal Open Market) Committee to remove policy accommodation at a faster pace than they currently anticipate,"" the minutes stated.
As it stood, Fed officials said the strength of the economy and the high current pace of inflation would warrant raising rates quicker than the once-per-quarter pace seen during the tightening cycle that began in 2015 - a statement some analysts said perhaps points to rate hikes at every meeting this year.
The Fed meets eight times per year, or roughly every six to seven weeks.
But, with the United States still near a peak in coronavirus infections when the last policy meeting was held, the minutes gave no obvious indication policymakers were wed to a particular path - and, especially, no sense they would start the liftoff in borrowing costs at their upcoming meeting in March with a half-percentage-point rise in the benchmark overnight interest rate.
The Fed in recent years has stuck with smaller and usually well-anticipated quarter-percentage-point increases.
Among the Fed officials who have made public comments about monetary policy since the January meeting, most have favored a smaller initial increase, including two who spoke on Wednesday.
Even though surprised by the persistence of inflation, ""participants emphasized that the appropriate path of policy would depend on economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and the risks around the outlook,"" the minutes stated. 
Fed officials ""will be updating their assessments of the appropriate setting for the policy stance at each meeting.""
Bond yields fell and stocks on balance moved higher after the release of the minutes. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note, the maturity generally most sensitive to Fed interest rate expectations, slid to 1.52% from 1.55% and the S&P 500 index rose into positive territory on the day.
BALANCE SHEET DEBATE
Following the January policy meeting Fed officials issued a statement saying that it would ""soon be appropriate"" to raise the central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate from its near-zero level. 
Data since the beginning of this year have, if anything, heightened the Fed's readiness to act. U.S. retail sales in January were strong, and U.S. employers added 467,000 jobs that month, far more than expected. The most recent inflation data showed no sign of easing from the current 40-year high.
But policymakers have not committed to much beyond the notion that they will increase rates at their March 15-16 policy meeting and will likely continue to raise rates through the year - depending on how inflation responds.
Investors had begun pricing in the prospect that the Fed would raise its target interest rate by half a percentage point next month, but they now see a quarter-percentage-point hike as more likely.
""While the minutes of the late-January FOMC meeting pre-date the release of the stronger-than-expected labour market and inflation data covering last month, officials didn't appear to be seriously considering either a 50bp rate hike to start the tightening cycle or a hike at each of the remaining seven policy meetings this year,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.

The Fed in January also released a broad set of guidelines about how it plans to reduce the nearly $9 trillion portfolio of securities held by the central bank.
Discussion of the balance sheet included debate about whether or not outright sales of securities will be needed, the minutes stated. Though no decision has been made, the minutes noted that ""many"" participants in the meeting said sales may be needed at some point in the future.

Investing.com -- Federal Reserve officials were in favor of reining in accommodative monetary policy measures with a faster pace of rate increases and a ""significant"" reduction in the size of balance sheet that could begin later this year, the Fed’s January meeting minutes showed Wednesday. 
""With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, members expected that it would soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,"" according to the minutes.  
The faster pace of rate hikes, however, is conditional on whether the pace of inflation continues to trend above target or eventually dissipates.       
""Most participants noted that, if inflation does not move down as they expect, it would be appropriate for the Committee to remove policy accommodation at a faster pace than they currently anticipate,"" the minutes showed. 
The odds of a 50 basis point rate hike at the Fed's meeting has eased slightly to about 50%, 25% last week, according to Investing.com’s the Fed rate monitor tool.
On the balance sheet, fed members noted that ""a significant reduction"" in the size of the balance sheet would likely be appropriate, which could get underway ""sometime later this year."" 
Following its previous Jan. 25-26 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark rate in a range of 0% to 0.25%, but teed up the prospect of increasing interest rates at its next meeting in March.
In his press conference following the monetary policy statement, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stoked fears of aggressive Fed rate hikes, saying there was ""quite a bit of room to raise rates without hurting jobs.""
Since the meeting in January, inflation has continued to trend well above the Fed’s 2% target, the labor market is inching closer to maximum employment, and the once low prospect of a 50 basis point rate hike is being priced in.
The St. Louis Fed president, who tends to lean more hawkish on monetary policy, has been one of the more audible members among his peers calling for aggressive Fed rate hikes.
“I’d like to see 100 basis points in the bag by July 1,” James Bullard said in an interview with Bloomberg. “I was already more hawkish but I have pulled up dramatically what I think the committee should do.""
An increasing number of market participants, however, are bemused as to why the Fed, despite acknowledging concerns about elevated inflation, has continued to persist with its monthly bond purchases, albeit at a reduced pace of $30 billion a month.
Most fed members, however, preferred to continue to ""reduce the committee's net asset purchases according to the schedule announced in December, bringing them to an end in early March,"" according to the minutes. 
The U.S. central banks’ balance sheet has swelled to nearly $9 trillion. Previous attempts, however, to cut the size of its balance sheet, or engage in quantitative tightening, haven’t been well received in markets.
In 2018, the Fed allowed certain bonds to mature each month without reinvesting the principal of the bonds in new securities.
But the central bank was soon forced to halt the process in the latter part of 2019 after a key short-term overnight lending rate, which supports the plumbing of the financial system, surged and threatened the stability of funding markets.
Powell, however, believes today’s economy is on more of a solid footing, and likely able to cope better with quantitative tightening."

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazil's government is considering an income tax exemption for foreigners investing in domestic corporate bonds, hoping to lower financing costs for local firms at a time of rising interest rates, the Economy Ministry said on Wednesday.
In a statement to Reuters, it said officials are drafting regulations aimed at ""expanding the access of Brazilian companies to foreign capital"" by aligning the tax treatment given to corporate bonds with the one already applied to equity investments by non-residents. 
Foreigners currently pay a 15% tax on capital gains from local private-sector bonds, but are exempt from the tax when they invest in Brazil's stock market and public debt. Brazilians pay a 15-22.5% income tax rate on returns from corporate bonds, depending how long they are held.
Two Economy Ministry officials said an executive order is being drafted with the change as part of a minor capital markets reform, which was confirmed by two other ministry sources.
By opening the door for more foreign investment in Brazil's capital markets, the country hopes to attract dollars and strengthen the local currency, which would help to ease double-digit inflation, one of the sources said. 
The Brazilian real has strengthened more than 7% against the U.S. dollar this year, boosted by net financial inflows of just over $10 billion.
In 2006, Brazil exempted foreigners from income taxes on their investments in public bonds, helping the government to extend its debt maturities while boosting financial inflows.
An executive order providing a similar exemption for private bonds should be ready soon, one source said, following studies by Brazil's Treasury and tax service. The move would require approval from Congress to become permanent.
An initial review has shown little revenue impact from the proposed exemption, the source added, given relatively small foreign holdings of corporate debt in the country. 

A second source said the tax change would apply to local debt issued by non-financial companies, a market currently worth about 1 trillion reais ($194 billion) according to central bank data, with foreign investors now holding just 2.7% of the total.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Bank of Canada will be nimble and potentially ""forceful"" in tackling uncomfortably high inflation, a senior official said on Wednesday, setting the stage for an aggressive campaign of interest rate increases.
Deputy governor Timothy Lane, speaking to a university audience, said there was a risk inflation could continue to be more persistent than forecast, and the central bank was increasingly focused on countering the upside risks. 
""We will be nimble — and if necessary, forceful — in using our monetary policy tools to address whatever situation arises, as we have done throughout these turbulent times,"" Lane said.
Canada's annual inflation rate hit a fresh 30-year high at 5.1% in January, official data showed on Wednesday. It was the 10th consecutive month the rate had been above the Bank of Canada's 1-3% control range.
""Currently, with inflation well above our target, we are increasingly focused on countering the upside risks,"" Lane said.
The economic rebound was faster and inflation persistently higher than forecast because demand was more robust and supply more constrained than expected, said Lane.
Still, the central bank expects supply disruption to ease and inflation to come down quickly in the second half of 2022, though it is ""alert to the risk that inflation may again prove more persistent"", Lane said.

The central bank in January said the slack in Canada's economy had been absorbed and interest rates would need to rise from their current record low of 0.25%. Governor Tiff Macklem has said Canadians should expect multiple increases.
Money markets are betting on a first hike on March 2, likely to 0.50%, with about a 30% chance of a larger 50-basis-point increase. The Canadian dollar was up 0.3% at 1.2680 to the greenback, or 78.86 U.S. cents, after Lane's comments.

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada's main oil-producing province of Alberta looks set to return to a budget surplus this coming fiscal year, ending seven years of deficit, as surging oil prices swell provincial royalty revenues and provide a boost to Premier Jason Kenney ahead of a spring leadership review.
The oil and gas sector accounts for around 17% of Alberta's GDP, and a rally in U.S. crude to seven-year highs above $90 a barrel is super-charging the royalties that producers pay to extract the province's vast fossil fuel reserves.
Some analysts say the windfall, which could exceed the province's previous oil royalties record of C$10.8 billion ($8.52 billion), will allow Alberta to balance its books and return to a surplus in the 2022-23 fiscal year. The government unveils its budget on Feb. 24.
Last year, Alberta slashed its 2021-22 deficit forecast from C$18.2 billion to C$5.8 billion and since then oil prices have rocketed even higher.
No other Canadian province is expecting a surplus in 2022-23, according to an RBC report released in November.
The expected bonanza is well-timed for United Conservative Party leader Kenney, who slumped in public opinion polls due to what critics describe as his mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. He faces a leadership review in April after members of his party called for his resignation.
""He is banking on positive economic news that will hold sway over all the other problems he is facing,"" said Duane Bratt, a politics professor at Calgary's Mount Royal University.
While a balanced budget may help burnish Kenney's reputation, Alberta still faces economic headwinds. The province has the highest rates of long-term unemployment in Canada, according to a Business Council of Alberta report, and capital investment in the oil and gas sector remains more than 50% below a 2014 peak.
Bratt said he expects Kenney to survive the leadership review - which entails party members voting on whether to retain him as leader - but the premier may face a backlash in next year's provincial election.
An Alberta government spokesperson said the province is still finalizing calculations on how exactly oil and gas royalty revenue will impact the budget.
BORROWING COSTS IMPROVE
The improved fiscal outlook has already helped improve borrowing costs. The gap between Alberta's 10-year yield and the yield on the equivalent bond issued by Ontario, Canada's most populous province, has narrowed from nearly 40 basis points in April 2020 to about 5 basis points.
The previous high point for Alberta royalty revenue was in 2005/06 when the government raked in C$10.8 billion. Since then a prolonged downturn in oil prices starting in 2014 has weighed on Alberta's finances and prompted many international oil majors to cut their investments in the province.
Now, Alberta is benefiting from changes to the royalty rate formula made in 2017, which translate to higher rates as prices rise. Production from the oil sands are at a record high and a number of major projects have hit ""post-payout"" in the last year - the point at which a project's cumulative revenue surpasses the initial investment - and switched to a higher royalty rate.
""We have never in Alberta's history seen a change this quick or large (in the budget balance),"" said Trevor Tombe, an economics professor at the University of Calgary.

""We may very well see royalty revenues higher than any point in Alberta's history.""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Inflation estimates for Colombia this year rose and predictions of interest rate rises quickened among analysts polled in a central bank survey.
The 40 analysts surveyed by the bank expect inflation to end the year at a median of 5.44%, above the 4.48% recorded in January's poll, and well away from the bank's long-term target of 3%.
Prices will rise 1.27% in February, analysts said in the poll published late on Tuesday, taking 12-month inflation to 7.62%. The 12-month figure was 6.94% in January.
Consumer price rises will decrease to 3.69% at the close of 2023, those polled said.
Analysts expect the bank's seven-member board to raise borrowing costs by a median of 100 basis points to 5% at its meeting at the end of March, though some predicted a rate rise of 150 basis points.
Though policymakers will meet this month, they will not vote on the interest rate.

The survey was conducted between Feb. 7 and 11, before the government published growth figures of 10.6% for 2021, which may push policymakers to raise rates more quickly in a bid to curb inflation.
Further rises of 100 basis points and 50 basis points will come in April and June, those polled said, taking the interest rate to 6.50%, where it will remain through April next year before gradually being lowered.

(Reuters) -Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said Wednesday it's 'appropriate' for the U.S. central bank to take steps to normalize monetary policy to deal with high inflation, but warned against raising rates too fast or too far. 
""My caution to my colleagues, and to myself, is, 'let's not overdo it,'"" Kashkari said at a town hall for  United Natural Foods  (NYSE:UNFI) Inc. employees, noting that an aging population among other factors will tend to pull inflation down over time. ""If we raise rates really aggressively, we run the risk of slamming the brakes on the economy, putting the economy into recession, which would then -- we'd be crashing back down into this low inflation environment."" 
The Fed is expected to start raising rates in March, with the debate currently focused both on how big of an increase it should start with, and how far rates should rise, to deal with inflation that's the highest it has been in nearly 40 years. Some Fed officials believe the Fed ought to start with a bigger-than-usual half-percentage point rate hike to make clear that it has joined the fight on inflation; others who appear to be in the majority say a smaller quarter-point hike is merited. 
Kashkari said he and his family had COVID-19 earlier this year, and the experience drove home for him that it will take some time for the economy to get back to normal.

""A lot of families are experiencing what we just experienced,"" Kashkari said, explaining that his family's bout with the disease meant three weeks of disrupted work. 
""This will be a while"" before people can be comfortable living with COVID, before workers on the sidelines of the labor force can return to work, and before supply chains will catch up, he said.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Turkey sold $3 billion in Islamic bonds on Wednesday, in its first U.S. dollar-denominated debt sale since September, before unorthodox rate-cutting despite high inflation sent the lira into a tailspin.
Turkey's economy fell into turmoil late last year as the central bank cut its policy rate by 500 basis points to 14% since September, causing the lira to end the year down 44% against the dollar, its worst performance during President Tayyip Erdogan's nearly two decades in power. The depreciation sent inflation to nearly 49% in January, its highest in 20 years.
The lira has largely stabilised this year after Erdogan announced a new scheme to protect lira deposits, costly government interventions in the currency market and a local currencies swap deal with the United Arab Emirates.
Turkey sold the Islamic bonds at 7.25%, tighter than initial guidance of between 7.5% and 7.625% after orders topped $10.75 billion, the document from one of the banks on the deal showed. 
""We continue to remain underweight Turkey due to the elevated uncertainty,"" said Doug Bitcon, head of credit strategies at Rasmala Investment Bank. 
""However, the pricing of the new 5-year issue is cheap relative to the sukuk curve and broadly in line with the conventional curve. The order book is strong and we expect the issue to trade well at the break.""
Investors in the UAE piled into the Islamic bonds, three sources said. Relations between the two countries have pivoted to economic partnership following a charm offensive by Turkey last year, with Erdogan visiting the UAE this week after the UAE's de facto ruler took a trip to Turkey in November.
One of the sources, a fund manager in Dubai, said higher demand from the UAE due to cosier ties may partly explain the large order book despite a risk-averse market.
Demand for sukuk has long outstripped supply, and sales of high-yielding bonds have been scarce as investors fret over an imminent tightening cycle, with many analysts expecting as many as seven rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve this year.
""Investors are wary about a Fed that's too hawkish and are averse to longer tenors - Turkey's tapping into that demand for shorter bonds,"" a fixed income analyst in Dubai said.
Fitch Ratings last week downgraded Turkey's sovereign debt rating to ""B+"" from ""BB-"" saying the government's policies have increased risks from high inflation and weak foreign currency liquidity.
FX reserves stood at $16.33 billion as of Feb. 4, rising $5.8 billion in a week, likely in part due to the $4.7 billion swap deal with the UAE. Net FX reserves had reached a two-decade low of $7.55 billion last month.
Citi, Dubai Islamic Bank, HSBC and KFH Capital arranged the sukuk sale.
Turkey has roughly $18.5 billion in bonds maturing this year, with $7.6 billion denominated in dollars and the rest in lira, according to Refinitiv data.

ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan's government is hoping that Turks will endure soaring living costs for just a few more months before inflation begins easing and tourists arrive, helping the economy leave a winter currency crisis behind. 
The plan is risky given some small protests have already emerged in the face of annual inflation nearing 50%, and with many economists expecting price and wage pressures to persist throughout the year.
The lira, which plunged 44% last year, is also potentially vulnerable to the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate tightening and, closer to home, any Russian military incursion into Ukraine that could strain Ankara's ties with Moscow and NATO. 
But for now, Erdogan - whose push for unorthodox rate cuts initially sparked the crisis last year - has managed to regain some confidence among savers and investors with a combination of state-backed deposit guarantees and costly market interventions. 
That has bought the government time to let cuts in sales taxes work to cool off prices and ease the pain for consumers, while it seeks to boost Turkey's export sector with the help of low lending rates and planned capital injections into state lenders.
Ankara expects those steps, combined with newfound lira stability and eventual base effects, will allow annual inflation to peak in April or May and recede by year end to about 24%, far below analysts' forecasts. 
The stakes are high for Turkey's leader of 19 years who faces an election by mid-2023 that current polls suggest he might lose. 
Ratings agencies and analysts say that while the budget can fund such measures for now, costs and inflation may spiral if the lira comes under renewed pressure. Simply raising interest rates instead would be a better way of containing inflation and bolstering the currency, they say. 
Real rates are far in negative territory at 35% and official reserves low and deep in the red when accounting for swaps, leaving Erdogan's experiment vulnerable to another crisis. 
""The government is now using the fiscal space to balance the economy to the extent they can, but of course you can only pull this lever so far given inflation and ... massively negative real rates,"" said Anupam Damani, New York-based head of international debt at investment manager Nuveen. 
Erdogan's key goal is to narrow the chronic current account gap - near $15 billion last year - which would replenish official reserves possibly helping the lira, and there are early signs he may have some success there. 
As Turkey's beaches begin filling up in May, Ankara forecasts tourist arrivals to return to pre-pandemic numbers with close to $34 billion in revenues expected to wash in, shoring up the sector that accounts for over 10% of the economy. Turkey's car rental association told Reuters the fleet size should rebound 25% this year, reflecting visitor expectations. 
However, it is not unusual for Turkey to record current account surpluses in the summer only to swing back into deficit in the winter and it may take an export miracle to change that pattern.
CONFIDENCE GAME
After a series of cuts last year to 14% in the policy rate, the lira crashed to all-time lows in December and inflation soared. Since then, however, the depreciation-protected deposits and central bank's forex sales have calmed markets. 
Households and companies have poured some 350 billion lira ($25.5 billion) into the protected accounts, nearly half converted from hard currencies, according to official data. 
The central bank has boxed the exchange rate into a tight range near 13.5 to the dollar so far this year, a far cry from the lira's wild swings in December. 
Bankers and economists estimate the central bank spent $20 billion in December and $3 billion in January supporting the lira, but next to nothing this month and Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati said last week there was no more need to intervene in markets. 
Erdogan has promised to protect Turks from ""crushing"" annual price rises, including 50% for electricity, 55% for food and 76% for energy. The value added tax on basic foods was slashed this month and more relief, possibly for housing, is expected.
Nebati has urged patience and said Turks would wake up to a ""very different"" reality by the middle of the year.
He also told investors in London the economy would be in even better shape by the election and said now was the ""perfect"" time to invest, according to one participant. 
Yet two days later Fitch cut Turkey's credit rating deeper into junk territory citing policies that risked even higher inflation, especially if depositors' confidence is shaken by renewed market stress.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said the lira was emerging markets' most vulnerable currency.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also said that while the state's deposit protection scheme successfully triggered ""a wave of dedollarisation"" its success adds to the state's currency risk exposure.
A test of business confidence comes early next month when February data could show an easing of the trade deficit after it soared in January as a result of a stockpiling rush in the face of soaring import prices, analysts said. 
Meanwhile, the patience the government is asking for is wearing thin. Food couriers, nurses and other workers have carried out strikes in recent weeks, joining other scattered rallies in some cities.

Esat Celik, 32, an Istanbul construction worker relying on odd jobs, said he spends more than half his income on food and children's needs. ""I am unemployed now,"" he told Reuters. ""It is very hard to continue like this but let's see how long it lasts.""

QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador's mining exports in 2021 nearly doubled in value from the previous year to $2.09 billion, beating government expectations, the Ministry of Energy said on Wednesday.
President Guillermo Lasso, a conservative ex-banker, is betting on mining to diversify the country's income streams, as it struggles with limited liquidity worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mining exports in 2021 were ""99% more than what was exported in 2020, when a value of $1.05 billion was registered,"" the ministry said in a statement.
The government originally projected that mining exports would be worth $1.6 billion last year.
The 2021 figure places mining as the country's fourth largest source of export income behind oil, bananas and shrimp.
Oil prices on international markets have recovered strongly from a collapse in demand at the height of pandemic lockdowns in 2020, and other commodities have also rebounded as economies across the world have gathered pace.
Ecuador has significant mineral resources, but has lagged regional competitors Peru and Chile in large-scale mine development.

Big resource companies, including Chinese consortium CRCC-Tongguan and Canada's Lundin Gold (OTC:FTMNF), operate in Ecuador, but many mining projects have faced community opposition, including occupation by informal miners.
The government expects three new projects in the centre of the country to raise the value of mining exports to $4 billion by 2025, Wednesday's statement said.

The effects on government debt ratios from 2022 inflation vary by region, with the smallest impact being forecast for the Middle East & North Africa, and the largest impact in sub-Saharan Africa.
Developed market sovereigns, in which inflation is forecast to push government debt ratios much lower than the median, include the United States at 5 percentage points of GDP, Britain at 4.6 percentage points and Canada at 4.1 percentage points.

Averaged out across all 120 countries Fitch rates, the drop is set be 2 percentage points, matching 2008 for the most significant inflationary effect in more than 20 years.
""It would be a stretch to claim that debt is being ‘inflated away’ at least at the global level, but higher inflation is definitely helping,"" two of Fitch's top sovereign analysts, James McCormack and Ed Parker, said in report.

Indonesia hosts a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs on Thursday and Friday. Many participants, including German Finance Minister Christian Lindner, will only take part virtually due to the latest coronavirus wave.
On Monday, the Finance Ministers of the G7 group of large western economies warned Russia of ""massive"" economic consequences if it chose to invade Ukraine, to whose economy they also promised swift and decisive support.
It is unclear whether the larger G20 group, which includes China and Russia itself, will issue a similarly harsh warning to Moscow.
The German government official said the Europeans in the G20 also wanted to push for a quick implementation of a global tax reform, which among other things provides for a minimum tax for companies of 15%.
""Here we will put a clear exclamation mark on implementation,"" the official said.
The tax reform in almost 140 countries is supposed to take effect as early as the beginning of 2023. However, this target is considered ambitious by some and may not be achievable.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Headline inflation has moved above central bank targets in most Group of 20 economies despite weaker growth momentum and remains a ""significant risk,"" but rising prices should moderate gradually in most economies this year, the IMF said Wednesday.
The International Monetary Fund said inflation had ""continued to surprise on the upside"" mainly due to rising commodity and shipping prices, continued mismatches in supply and demand, and shifting demand for more goods.
But longer-term inflation expectations remained generally well-anchored in economies with strong policy frameworks, the global lender said in a surveillance note prepared for a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers this week.
The IMF said downside risks continued to dominate and economic indicators released after it downgraded its forecast for global growth by half a percentage point to 4.4% in January pointed to ""weak growth momentum.""
Renewed mobility restrictions in the euro area, Japan and Britain had weakened service-sector activity in recent months, while the spread of the coronavirus had dented consumer sentiment in the United States.
IMF staff estimated that supply disruptions had likely subtracted between 0.5 and 1 percentage point from global gross domestic product growth in 2021 and lifted core inflation by 1 percentage point, the IMF said.
The potential emergence of new and dangerous variants of the COVID-19 virus could drag down economic activity.
Supply-demand mismatches could also take longer to resolve than expected, weighing on output and fueling wage inflation, which in term could prompt an earlier-than-expected tightening of monetary policy in major advanced economies, especially in the United States, the world's largest economy, the IMF said.
""This could dampen the global growth outlook, lead to a sudden tightening of financial conditions, and prompt capital outflows from emerging market economies,"" the IMF said, noting the added risk posed by already-high debt levels.

China's economy, the world's second largest, could see growth slow further if it ran into further problems in its real estate market, private consumption did not recover, and a widespread COVID-19 outbreak caused further disruption, it warned.
Central banks in emerging market economies should be prepared for adverse shocks if inflation continues to rise in major economies and they adopted steeper-than-expected interest rate increases, the fund said.

122,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 10:06AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sixteen groups representing the U.S. construction industry sent a letter to the White House opposing a recent executive order signed by President Joe Biden requiring ""project labor agreements"" in federal construction projects over $35 million.
The order signed by Biden earlier this month, is expected to impact nearly 200,000 workers, the White House has said, and offer a potential boost to workers and unions that negotiate these deals.
Project labor agreements are collective bargaining agreements between building trade unions and contractors, which set wages, employment conditions, and dispute resolution on specific projects. 
""The administration's flawed rationale justifying pro-PLA policies ignores marketplace realities and broad opposition to government-mandated PLAs within the construction industry,"" said the letter, which was sent to the White House on Tuesday.
The groups said the labor agreements will exacerbate the construction industry's skilled labor shortage and undermine the Biden administration's ability to meet its infrastructure, affordable housing and clean energy goals.
The order, which went into effect immediately, comes on the heels of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law by Biden that invests in the country's roads, ports and bridges.

The new executive order excludes projects funded by grants to non-federal agencies that will make up for a bulk of the projects under the bill.
The groups that sent the letter include Associated Builders and Contractors, American Road & Transportation Builders Association, the National Association of Home Builders and the National Black Chamber of Commerce among others.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Possible western sanctions against Russian banks will lead to a spike in market volatility but Russia will be able to withstand restrictions thanks to abundant reserves, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday.
U.S. and European officials are finalising an extensive package of penalties should Russia invade Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly denied it has such a plan.
Such sanctions could target major Russian banks and its energy sector but will not include banning Russia from the SWIFT financial system, according to U.S. and European officials.
Siluanov said sanctions against Russian banks would be ""unpleasant"" but the state will make sure that all deposits with banks, all transactions, including in foreign currencies, are secured. 
""Thank god we have enough forex liquidity and enough forex reserves,"" Siluanov told reporters.
""They say we have a financial shield in the form of gold and forex reserves, budget surplus and [budget] rule, low debt."" 
If new sanctions target Russian energy companies, Russia would be ready to re-route its supplies to other markets, Siluanov said.
Russia has been living under financial and economic sanctions since 2014 when the West attempted to punish it for annexing Crimea and for its role in the military conflict in Ukraine.
Restrictions prompted banks and companies to reduce dependence on global debt markets, while Russia focused on replenishing reserves and developing its own financial systems as alternative to SWIFT or Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard.
Siluanov said Russia will be able to switch to other financial systems if it is cut off from SWIFT.
""We expect the country's financial system to continue to focus inwards as part of the ""Fortress Russia"" strategy and advance digital and fintech sovereignty,"" the Institute of International Finance.
Siluanov said possible restrictions on buying of Russian debt would be ""unpleasant but not fatal"" for Russia, which had nearly $635 billion in gold and forex reserves as of early February.
The minister said Russia had no plans to revise its 2022 borrowing plan worth 3.3 trillion roubles ($44 billion), preferring to raise funds via OFZ bonds with fixed coupons, while also offering bonds with floating-rate coupons.

Once the current situation calms down, Russia will consider testing foreign demand for Russian Eurobonds, Siluanov said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top court on Wednesday cleared the way to cut billions of euros of funds to Poland and Hungary, whose populist rulers the bloc accuses of violating democratic rights.
There is no appeal against the ruling by the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice, which dismissed challenges by Warsaw and Budapest against a new EU sanction that would halt funding to member countries which break European laws. 
""Today's judgements confirm that we are on the right track,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, announcing the Brussels-based EU executive would decide how to act in the coming weeks. 
At stake are hundreds of billions of euros of funds, the EU's internal cohesion, and its international standing. 
Hungary and Poland have long been big beneficiaries of EU funds, which the bloc has poured into the former communist countries to help develop their economies since they joined in 2004.
The EU says that to receive those benefits, countries must uphold common European standards, which Warsaw and Budapest have flouted by imposing political control over the judiciary and media, and restricting civil rights.
Disagreements over the rule of law come as the bloc seeks to present a united front on its eastern flank, where Russia has massed forces near Ukraine. 
The decision could also have immediate political impact, particularly in Hungary, where an April 3 national election is expected to be the tightest race for nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban since his landslide victory in 2010.
Orban's ruling Fidesz party said the ruling was ""political revenge"" against Hungary, meant to help the united opposition. Justice Minister Judit Varga said Brussels was abusing its powers against national member states.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told a news conference: ""Poland believes that centralisation, bureaucratic centralisation, federalisation... is a dangerous process.""
DESTROYING EU FROM WITHIN
The EU has already frozen pandemic recovery funds worth 36 billion euros ($41 billion) for Poland and 7 billion euros for Hungary. The so-called ""conditionality mechanism"" could now affect any part of the EU budget, worth 1.8 trillion euros ($2 trillion) for 2021-27. 
Poland, the biggest formerly communist EU member with 38 million people, is eligible for more than 75 billion euros through 2027, including for climate, digitalisation and public health. Hungary has a population around a quarter the size but has received an even greater share of EU spending per capita. 
""Hungary and Poland have been rapidly backsliding on media freedom, independence of judges, the right to protest,"" said Amnesty International. ""Instead of trying to oppose EU funds being conditional on respect for the rule of law, they should respect people's rights and clean up their act.""
EU officials said the bloc might move on Hungary first, while political horse-trading would probably delay a decision to withhold funds at least until late this year.
Poland and Hungary have threatened to retaliate by stalling other EU decisions that require unanimity, including on climate and energy, as well as foreign policy.
Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told Reuters that the dispute would not lead Hungary to block an EU-Africa summit later this week or interfere with any potential sanctions against Russia over Ukraine.

Katalin Cseh, a liberal Hungarian EU lawmaker, said ignoring the erosion of the rule of law in Poland and Hungary would be comparable to the dark comedy film ""Don't Look Up"", in which politicians fail to stop an asteroid from destroying the earth.
""If we are sitting tight and assessing, then Mr Orban and Mr Morawiecki would achieve their goal of destroying the Union from within,"" she said. ($1 = 0.8786 euros)

LONDON (Reuters) - The risk of material credit rating pressures from the current tensions between Russia and Ukraine is low, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said on Wednesday, unless the situation continues for an extended period or escalates to other countries.
Reliance on Russian oil, gas and coal means energy supply is likely to be the dominant channel through which Europe's economies would be impacted by a conflict, Moody's said, although some countries are also vulnerable to trade disruption and security risks, especially cyber attacks.
""Our baseline view is that Russia-Ukraine tensions will stop short of an outright military conflict,"" Moody's said in a report on the broader impact of the crisis.
""And the risk of material credit pressures emerging is low unless such a conflict were to carry on for an extended period or escalate into outright conflict beyond Ukraine"".
It added that countries in the Baltics and central and eastern Europe were most exposed to the energy, trade and security strains, but that those risks were largely accounted for in their current credit ratings.
If the situation worsened there could be problems though.
Russia provides 38% of Europe's natural gas, 26% of its crude oil and 46% of its solid fuels such as coal, Moody's cited.
Any move by Moscow to reduce those supplies to gain political leverage or in response to European sanctions would ""have major implications"", especially as the European Union's liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal capacity, at best, only covers about a quarter of total demand.
""Even a relatively short reduction in gas supply would likely lead to a further increase in energy prices, which have already soared,"" the report said.
An intensification of inflationary pressures could push the European Central Bank and other central banks to raise interest rates, slowing economies and potentially increasing debt levels.
""The knock-on effects for tax revenue would also weigh on the public finances. Pressures would intensify if governments decided to introduce additional support measures like (energy cost) price caps or subsidies,"" Moody's added.
The big risk, though, would be other former Eastern Bloc countries also become involved in conflict with Russia.
""In a very unlikely and extreme scenario, an outbreak of armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine could spill over into EU countries neighbouring them,"" Moody's said, flagging Baltic states and Poland because of their geographical proximity and history of tense relations with Russia.
""Although unlikely, in part because of the permanent presence of NATO troops in the most exposed EU countries, such a scenario could have far-reaching consequences for their credit profiles"".

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks and financial advisers in Britain have called for more time to introduce a new 'duty of care', a landmark change in consumer protection to combat mis-selling and scams.
Last year the Financial Conduct Authority proposed a tougher and more comprehensive standard of care on firms, requiring them to put consumers' interests at the centre of their business to deliver ""good outcomes"".
The watchdog said it would finalise the new rules by the end of July 2022, and give industry nine months to prepare for their introduction.
""It needs to be at least two years to allow firms enough time to comply,"" UK Finance, an industry body for banks, said in a statement on Wednesday.
PIMFA, which represents financial advisers and investment firms, agreed said that nine months was insufficient time to change systems and processes, and that at least two years would be needed. 
""This is an industry which has undergone an enormous amount of regulatory change recently which, in combination with the ongoing impact of COVID-19, means resources are already stretched,"" PIMFA CEO Liz Field said in a statement.
There is also uncertainty over how the Financial Ombudsman Service, which handles complaints against financial firms, will interpret the new duty, potentially opening the floodgates to claims, Field said.
In tweaked proposals late last year, the watchdog ditched plans requiring firms to ""take all reasonable steps"" in protecting customers.
A proposal to allow consumers to go to court for breaches of the new duty was also scrapped.

""Significant issues nonetheless remain, with attendant risks of stifling innovation, differentiation and competition, leading to product restrictions and financial exclusion,"" UK Finance said.
The FCA's cost benefit analysis on the proposed new duty finds costs to firms in the billions of pounds but does not quantify the benefits, UK Finance added.

129,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 06:56AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden ordered his administration last year to boost the domestic economy by cracking down on what it sees as a lack of competition in sectors from agriculture to drugs and labor.
As inflation hits a 40-year high, keeping prices down is a key political issue, too. November midterm elections will determine whether Biden and Democrats can maintain slim control of Congress, and the economy is the top issue voters care about, Reuters polling shows. 
In an interview as year-end corporate earnings roll in, Bharat Ramamurti, the Deputy Director of the White House's National Economic Council, told Reuters that the administration is looking closely at whether higher profits are due to lack of competition.
Questions and answers have been edited for clarity and brevity.
REUTERS: The White House continues to take aim at 'profiteering,' particularly in the meat-packing industry. How do you define this and do you see this as a worsening problem? Is it related to the pandemic?
RAMAMURTI: Corporations by design are trying to maximize the amount of profit that they're making. I don't think anything has changed on that front just because of the pandemic. They do that by, if they can, raising prices in the face of higher demand.
There's higher demand for certain products, including certain food products. But also, this is a very concentrated industry - the meat processing industry.
The top four meat packers in the beef space, for example, control about 80% of the industry. And what we've seen is that, in a market that's highly concentrated like that, the ability of corporations to raise prices more quickly and to a higher level - and to keep them there for longer - exists. 
Introducing more competition into that space could eventually help bring down those price levels.
REUTERS: How much of a role is a lack of competition playing in the inflation we're seeing now?
RAMAMURTI: There are a number of reasons why we are looking at a higher rate of inflation now. The main one is that we are emerging from a pandemic. The United States is not alone in facing higher inflation. It's all related to problems in supply.
In industries that are marked by high levels of concentration, there can be a more severe effect.
REUTERS: Do you expect that you'll look at other industries?
RAMAMURTI: We've tried to be very data-driven about this. We haven't done that level of deep dive into any of these other industries so far.
But there are other examples of companies with higher profits and higher margins, which indicates that they have the ability to not just pass along any cost increases that they're facing in their supply chain to consumers - there's an additional step where they're able to raise the price even beyond that, which is reflected in the higher margin.
Part of that, of course, is higher demand, but there may be other factors at play as well. And what we want to do is use every available tool that the president has to go right at these price increases. He knows that they are pinching family budgets.
We'll put out more analysis once we've done it. 
[A few days after this interview was conducted, the White House said it was investigating competition in the defense industry.]
REUTERS: What would you say to someone who says charging more for goods when demand is high is 'just how capitalism works?'
RAMAMURTI: I would say what the president said, which is that capitalism without competition isn't really capitalism. It's exploitation.

If you can introduce more competition into those industries, you have more companies fighting for your business. And one of the ways they are doing that is by offering a lower price than their competitors, that's going to have a downward effect on prices over time. 
That's the kind of economy that we want to build.

(Reuters) - Lithuania's central bank has told the country's banks to prepare for power cuts and cyberattacks as Russia's standoff with Ukraine risks spilling over into a military conflict, according to a document and two sources familiar with the matter.
Russia has amassed over 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, prompting fears of an invasion.
Losing electricity and internet access are among ""extreme but possible"" scenarios that Lithuania's central bank told finance companies to be ready for in a letter sent to them last week and seen by Reuters.
Lithuania, as well as Baltic neighbours Latvia and Estonia, shares a common power grid with Russia run from Moscow. 
""Increased geopolitical tension in the region leads to increased threats of cyber-attacks, including attacks on critical information infrastructure,"" the central bank warned in the letter. 
The letter did not name any possible hackers. The Lithuanian central bank did not respond to a request for comment.
The warning comes as EU regulators more generally have told banks to prepare for potential Russian cyberattacks, and some financial firms conduct cyber war games to test their ability to withstand them.
Lithuanian banks should have contingency plans in place for cyber assaults such as ransomware and DDoS attacks, in which hackers try to flood a network with high volumes of data traffic, the central bank said in the letter.
It told financial firms to prepare for a breach similar to last year's massive SolarWinds cyberattack that was linked to a Russian-based agency and targeted hundreds of companies and organisations.
'TO SPLIT THE WESTERN ALLIANCE'
Russia has said some of its forces surrounding Ukraine are withdrawing, but NATO has urged Moscow to show proof, saying it has seen signs there are more troops on the way.
Two Ukrainian banks, including its largest, were hit by a cyberattack on Tuesday, Ukraine's information security centre said in a statement that suggested it was pointing the finger at Russia.
Once ruled from Moscow, but now members of both NATO and the European Union, the Baltic states have tense relations with their former overlord.

Estonia blamed Russia for a cyberattack in 2007 that paralysed its internet network. The incident prompted NATO to review its readiness to defend against ""cyber-warfare.""
Janis Sarts, director of a NATO-affiliated think-tank in Riga, said Russia could use cyberattacks and disruptions to energy supplies in the Baltics and across the West ""to try to split the Western alliance and to try to create internal pressures for western governments.""

Investing.com -- Retail sales data for January and the minutes from the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting are set to dominate the day's trading, as fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine continue to ease. The process of detente is looking likely to be slow and drawn-out, however. Airbnb stock is on the up after a bright update late on Tuesday. Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) and ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) are not so fortunate. Inflation continues to advance in the developed world, but there are tentative signs of an improvement in China. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 16th February.
1. Retail Sales, Industrial Production due
Belt up and get ready for the latest big U.S. economic numbers, heading your way at 8:30 AM ET. Retail sales are expected to have posted their biggest jump in 10 months in January, at 2.0%, after their biggest monthly decline in nearly a year in December.
That kind of volatility is an eloquent testimony to how the pandemic, with its various waves, has disrupted the usual consumer spending patterns. Investors will once again need to look through such distortions – this time from the Omicron wave – to distinguish noise from signal.
Industrial production data due at 9:15 AM ET will also be subject to some of the same factors. It’s expected to have risen 0.4% last month. The National Association of Homebuilders monthly housing market index, meanwhile, is due out at 10 AM ET.
2. Global markets still jittery after Russia de-escalates only a little
Global markets are still jittery about the situation on the Ukrainian border, amid warnings from the Ukrainian government and from NATO that Russia still has high troop concentrations capable of launching an invasion.
Russian newswires, in turn, cited diplomatic sources on Wednesday as saying that troop withdrawals – from regions including Crimea – will continue over the next three to four weeks.
The Russian ruble strengthened to its highest in nearly a week, suggesting that locals, at least, have become more sanguine about the chances for peace. However, European natural gas futures, which have eased in recent days, started to edge up again.   
3. Stocks set to drift lower; Fed Minutes eyed; Airbnb's bright update
U.S. stock markets are set to open mostly lower, as participants hold fire ahead of the big economic data later. Late trading in particular will be dominated by the minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting, which are due for release at 2 PM ET.
In recent months, the Fed’s minutes have developed a habit of being more hawkish than its policy statement and press conference, causing volatility toward the end of the trading day.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 68 points or 0.2%, while S&P futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down by a similar amount. All three had posted solid gains on Tuesday on relief at the apparent de-escalation on the Ukrainian border.
Stocks likely to be in focus include Airbnb, whose fourth-quarter results reinforced perceptions that the pandemic has permanently shifted customer behavior in a way that will be profitable for it. ViacomCBS and Wynn Resorts, however, are headed in the other direction after weaker-than-expected updates. Hilton Worldwide and Kraft Heinz lead the early earnings roster, while Nvidiaand Cisco report after the bell.
4. Inflation roars ahead in U.K., eases in China; Canada data due
The Great Inflation Narrative continues to progress all over the world. U.K. consumer prices again overshot expectations in January, leaving the annual rate of inflation at 5.5%. Producer price inflation accelerated to 9.9%. also above expectations.  That all adds to pressure on the Bank of England to raise its key rate for a third straight meeting in March. The pound rose 0.3% to its highest in nearly two weeks.
There was better news from China, where both consumer and produce price inflation eased in January. The picture was the same in South Africa. 
Canada, whose central bank is also fingering the interest rate trigger, will release its CPI at 8:30 AM ET.
In the corporate sector, meanwhile, brewer Heineken (OTC:HEINY) warned that input inflation pressures were ""off the charts"", but was still confident that it could offset them through what it calls ""premiumization"" - i.e., higher prices.
5. Oil rebounds after sharp drop; EIA inventories eyed
Crude oil prices regained their upward after falling heavily in response to Wednesday’s news out of eastern Europe.
By 6:20 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 0.8% at $92.77 a barrel, while Brent crude was up 0.9% at $94.07 a barrel.
U.S. inventory data, due from the government at 10:30 AM ET, appear likely to confirm a picture of ongoing tightness due to strong demand and a sluggish response from domestic and foreign producers. The American Petroleum Institute’s numbers showed a 1.08 million barrel drop in crude stocks last week – albeit that was a little less than expected."

""The commercial real estate (CRE) sector is considered vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic, while medium-term risks of price corrections continue to grow in the residential real estate (RRE) sector, with signs of a potential overvaluation in housing prices and elevated household indebtedness,"" the ECB said.
Banks’ exposures to commercial real estate account for around 8% of supervised banks' loans and over 20% of their corporate loans, the ECB said.

Investors gauging the likely size of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate hike in March and plans for shrinking a balance sheet now at a record $8.9 trillion will get fresh clues on Wednesday.
That’s when the Fed publishes minutes of last month’s policy meeting, where Chair Jerome Powell told reporters the U.S. central bank is on track to raise rates for the first time since 2018 and officials also shared general principles for normalizing their balance sheet. The minutes will be released at 2 p.m. in Washington.
Officials are pivoting toward fighting the hottest inflation in 40 years and removing the massive support they deployed to protect the economy from Covid-19. That’s prompted speculation that they may act more aggressively to get price pressures back under control, with some betting on a half-point move, which would be the first increase of that scale since 2000.
“If there was some discussion of 50 basis points, we may get a very oblique reference to it in the minutes,” said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup Inc).. “You might get a statement of the pros and the cons. That keeps it alive for the March meeting. The minutes could sound a bit hawkish if there was some discussion.”
While the minutes could show that a 25 basis-point move was viewed in January as the most likely course, they could hint at conditions under which the Fed might consider something larger, he said. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“Whether the FOMC committee has an appetite for a 50-basis point hike in March -- as markets now have priced in -- will depend on members’ and Fed staff’s assessment of the urgency of the inflation outlook, and whether the Fed is “behind the curve.” The January FOMC minutes may provide clues to that, and explain why Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave such a hawkish post-meeting presser.”

Inflationary pressures have accelerated since officials met last month, with consumer prices rising 7.5% in January from a year ago, while both U.S. employment and wages have surged. Policy makers will see another inflation and jobs report before their March meeting.
With the FOMC estimating the long-run neutral level of their benchmark federal funds rate at around 2.5%, the minutes could give a sense of the urgency the committee felt in getting it up there -- from near zero currently -- even before the latest inflation news.
“Inflation is the number-one concern and number-one priority,” said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies LLC. “Everybody knows that the Fed is behind. The question is how quickly do they intend to catch up to an appropriate policy stance.”
Markets are now pricing in six or seven quarter-point moves by the end of 2022, including the possibility of a 50-basis point hike in March. The FOMC forecast just three quarter-point hikes in its last projections in December. Powell, in his post-meeting January press conference, declined to rule out a 50-basis point hike.
Balance Sheet
With its other monetary policy tool, the Fed is currently scheduled to end its asset-purchase program in early March, ahead of the policy meeting. Powell said discussions over shrinking the balance sheet -- which some investors call quantitative tightening -- will be held at upcoming gatherings.
“We need to hear details from the Fed on how they are going to do QT and we need to hear them soon,” said Mark Holman, a partner at TwentyFour Asset Management, a London-based investment firm that specializes in fixed-income securities.
“The case for the Fed to do something quickly is growing day by day, especially given how disappointing the recent inflation report was,” said Holman, who thinks the Fed should sell some of its long-term Treasuries to help prevent the yield curve from inverting.
In a January statement, the Fed said it expects the process of balance-sheet reduction will commence after it has begun raising rates. It also spelled out that it planned to “significantly” shrink the balance sheet over time, while in the longer run holding mainly Treasury securities, implying a desire to shed most of the $2.7 trillion of mortgage-backed securities that it also currently owns.
Powell said no decision was taken at the January meeting on the pace of the runoff or when it would start.
At least two officials -- St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Kansas City Fed chief Esther George -- have since raised the possibility of selling assets in the future. Officials haven’t disclosed details of how much runoff would be targeted in the initial months or what the size of the balance sheet should be longer term. 
Last time they shrank the balance sheet, official set caps to govern how much of their maturing securities would be allowed to run off every month and how much would be reinvested to ensure the process would be gradual.
“I would love to see some actual specifics on cap sizes and methodology. And balance between” mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries, said Blake Gwinn, RBC Capital Markets strategist.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republicans' Tuesday boycott of a vote to advance the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin as the Federal Reserve's Wall Street cop will further delay regulatory changes which have been in limbo since Randal Quarles stepped down as Vice Chair for Supervision in October.
While Fed staff are able to work on some measures in the background, Raskin would need to sign off on any major policy decisions. Here are some key ones likely to be affected: 
DE-REGULATION REDUX?
Over the past four years, Quarles led a review of regulations introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, arguing they were too blunt and onerous. Democrats accused Quarles of saving Wall Street billions of dollars while increasing systemic risks and want Raskin to revisit some of those changes.
Among the most contentious were revisions to the “Volcker Rule” curbing speculative bank investments; scrapping a requirement for big banks to hold capital against certain swap trades; and stripping the Fed of its power to fail banks on their annual “stress tests” based on subjective concerns.
Raskin would have to pick which of these to address. Even without the nomination delay, the process of overhauling many of these rules was expected to be extremely time-consuming.
CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS
Climate change, a top policy priority for Democrats, is expected to rapidly rise on the Fed agenda under new leadership.
So far, the Fed has asked lenders to explain how they are mitigating climate change-related risks to their balance sheets, with the industry expecting to progress to a formal climate change scenario analysis in 2023, Reuters has reported. 
Those projects are expected to accelerate. The big question will be whether Raskin pushes for restrictions or stiffer capital requirements on banks with significant exposures to polluting industries or other climate-specific risks.
Raskin may have to tread more carefully than progressives had hoped given Republicans have cited her stance on climate change as one of the reasons for opposing her appointment.
BANK M&A
The delay in nominating Raskin may compound a logjam in approving bank tie-ups that had slowed during the past six months due to uncertainty over Fed personnel changes. 
Some pending deals were approved following Fed Chair Jerome Powell's renomination, but the industry is still waiting for the Fed and the Justice Department to decide on a potential new policy for bank deals. Raskin is expected to lead the committee that scrutinizes potential tie-ups, suggesting any new merger policy may also need her backing. 
Without that certainty, bankers and lawyers have said they would be reluctant to pursue new tie-ups. 
FINTECH FRAMEWORK
She will also have to tackle a regulatory blueprint for ""fintech"" companies that are quickly chipping away at the traditional financial sector.
The Fed is exploring how banks intersect with fintechs, particularly with smaller lenders that may outsource more services and infrastructure. Fintechs are also lobbying the Fed for access to its payments system.
While other banking regulators have worked for years to bring fintechs under their regulatory umbrella, the Fed has resisted, fearing doing so could create systemic risks. But as the sector continues to balloon, the Fed is expected to act.
The controversy over Raskin's role in helping fintech Reserve Trust gain access to a key Fed service could also complicate that process.
SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO
Another issue on the table is the supplementary leverage ratio, a rule created after the decade-ago crisis requiring banks to hold capital against assets regardless of their risk.
The Fed had to temporarily ease that rule in the midst of the pandemic as a glut of bank deposits and Treasury bonds drove up capital requirements on what are viewed as safe assets.
Despite intense bank lobbying, the Fed let that relief expire last year but promised to review the overall rule. The Fed has yet to publish a proposal, leaving the job up to Raskin.
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT
The central bank will also play a key role in a long-awaited overhaul of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rules which promote lending in lower-income communities. 

The Fed, which shares responsibility for writing the rules with other bank regulators, hopes the CRA can be updated to reflect the growth in online banking, while still ensuring lenders make meaningful contributions to the poorer areas they serve.
Raskin would likely have to be in place before the Fed could sign off on the changes.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan has no plan now to change an implicit 0.25% cap set around its yield target, though a tweak in the future cannot be ruled out, governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Wednesday.
Under yield curve control, the BOJ guides the 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield around 0% as part of efforts to keep borrowing costs low and stimulate the economy.
To breathe life back to a market made dormant by its huge presence, the central bank clarified last year that it will allow the 10-year yield to move 25 basis points up and down each around the target.
""We have no plan now to change the band. But that's not to say the band cannot change forever,"" Kuroda told parliament.
Kuroda also said the yield curve needs to steepen ""to a certain extent,"" suggesting the BOJ will not intervene to forcefully push down longer-dated yields such as those for 20- and 30-year notes.
""Even if 20- and 30-year JGB yields fall, they won't have much effect in stimulating capital expenditure and consumption. Rather, they risk hurting pension funds' profits,"" Kuroda said.
The remarks underscores the tricky balance the BOJ faces in keeping borrowing costs low, while seeking to mitigate the strain prolonged ultra-low rates is inflicting on bank profits.
The BOJ on Monday offered to buy an unlimited amount of 10-year JGBs at 0.25% to prevent rising global long-term rates from pushing up JGB yields too much.
""JGB yields were rising rather sharply reflecting higher overseas long-term rates. It was an unusual market situation,"" Kuroda said in explaining why the BOJ stepped in.
""If something similar happens again, we will of course resort to such a tool. But our basic stance is to buy sufficient amount of JGBs so that the 10-year yield moves 25 points up and down each around our 0% target,"" he said.

The 10-year JGB yield stood at 0.215% on Wednesday, off the implicit 0.25% cap, due in part to the BOJ's action on Monday.
But longer-dated bond yields continued to rise. The 20-year yield hit 0.7% on Wednesday, the highest since 2017, while the 30-year note saw yields climbed to 0.930%.

136,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 04:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone housing costs rose sharply last year, boosted by soaring German property prices and adding to already uncomfortably high overall inflation, a European Central Bank study showed on Wednesday.
Housing costs are mostly excluded from headline inflation figures but the ECB promised last year to take this cost into account even before official data can be adjusted to better reflect the actual price changes experienced by households.
While housing costs do not deviate significantly from overall price changes over several decades, they would have added to inflation for most of the past decade and would have lifted inflation in the third quarter of last year by just over 0.3%. 
Although inflation is now more than twice the ECB's 2% target, the bank has kept policy especially loose on the assumption that inflation will fall back below target next year without any action. 
It now sees inflation at 3.2% this year, falling to 1.8% in 2023, so even a small boost from house prices could put price growth right at or even above target next year.

""Developments in the last few quarters are mostly explained by the sharp increase in Germany,"" the ECB said in an Economic Bulletin article.
""Since 2011, the difference between the euro area Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices with and without Owner Occupied Housing has been limited, with the largest difference being 0.3 percentage points,"" the ECB added.
Euro zone inflation rose to a record 5.1% in January, well above expectations, prompting the ECB to abandon its pledge not to raise interest rates this year and to prepare the ground for ending debt buys, the cornerstone of its stimulus policy in recent years.

While the ECB does not project house price growth for 2023, it argued that the market tends to move with business cycles. That could mean further price rises since the bank sees economic growth at 4.2%, well above historic trends.
""Changes in house prices tend to be more closely linked to business cycles and sometimes also financial market dynamics, with considerable variation around their longer-term average of 3.3%,"" the ECB said.

137,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 03:25AM ET</span>",,,,,,"PARIS (Reuters) - The next French government will need to revise current budget deficit reduction plans after a presidential election in April to ensure France does not fall further behind other European countries, the public audit office said on Wednesday.
President Emmanuel Macron's government currently plans to cut the public sector budget deficit below an EU ceiling of 3% of gross domestic product in 2027, from an estimated 5% this year.
Less than two months from the election, the Cour des Comptes criticised the government's plans, saying they risked fuelling divergences within the euro zone, especially with more fiscally conservative countries such as Germany.
""The next budget bill, which is to be presented in autumn 2022 after the spring elections, should revise the ambition on the public finances especially as regards the economic and health situation and the plans of our European partners,"" it said.

The call follows a warning from the International Monetary Fund, which said last month that France should rein in its public finances faster than planned starting from next year.
The audit office called for a stiff dose of ""realism"" when the deficit-reductions plans were revised after the election, which polls suggest Macron is likely to win.

WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -U.S. imports of new Mexican avocado harvests will stay suspended for ""as long as necessary"" to ensure the safety of U.S. inspectors who were threatened verbally in Mexico's western Michoacan state, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Monday.
The halt of export inspections on Feb. 11 by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) marks another source of trade tension between Washington and Mexico City.
All U.S.-bound avocado crops must be inspected for safety, and those approved before Feb. 11 could still be exported, the agency said.
USDA said the suspension was ordered ""following a security incident (verbal threat) involving our employees. The suspension will remain in place for as long as necessary to ensure the appropriate actions are taken, to secure the safety of APHIS personnel working in Mexico."" 
The details of the incident were not immediately clear. Michoacan, Mexico's top avocado producing state and the only one certified to export to the United States, has long had security issues linked to problems with drug gangs. 
'POLITICAL ATTITUDE'
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday authorities are looking at the U.S. decision and suggested there may be political motivations behind the suspension.
Speaking at a regular government news conference, Lopez Obrador said the matter may have been influenced by groups with something to gain from the suspension, without elaborating.
""The truth is, there's always an economic, a commercial interest behind it,"" he said. ""Or there's a political attitude.""
The Biden administration has recently brought a number of complaints about Mexican enforcement of labor rights and environmental standards under the updated U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade. The United States also voiced concerns about government regulations in its telecoms and energy sectors. 

Lopez Obrador pointed to a recent decision by U.S. trade officials to seek talks with Mexico over its environmental obligations under a North American trade agreement, including protection of the critically endangered vaquita porpoise.
But he said Mexican relations with the U.S. government were ""very good.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Top Indonesian economic officials on Wednesday backed the expanded use of local currencies in trade and investment, instead of the U.S. dollar, to help maintain stability in global financial markets as pandemic-era stimulus is withdrawn.
Indonesia, which holds the presidency of the Group of 20 major economies this year, and a number of Asian countries have bilateral deals to settle transactions in domestic currencies, known as local currency settlement (LCS) arrangements, which cut demand for the dollar.
Bilateral currency swaps among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Japan and South Korea have reached $380 billion, according to the People's Bank of China.
Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said LCS arrangements should be replicated more broadly globally to manage shocks, especially given emerging nations face potential capital outflows when bigger economies tighten monetary policy.
""This (LCS) has been brought into a global agenda because this can also create a financial safety net for financial transactions between countries and reduce the vulnerability risks due to global economic shocks that cause financial instability,"" Sri Mulyani told a seminar ahead of a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors on Thursday.
Currency diversification would support economic stability, allowing countries to sustain their recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, she said.
Indonesian officials have said the country's main priority for this week's G20 meetings will be to ensure that developed economies' exit from easy monetary policy is well calibrated, well planned and well communicated, in order to limit the spillover impact on developing economies.
Previous periods of global monetary tightening have triggered capital outflows from emerging countries as investors flock to put their money in safe-haven assets. Indonesia saw the rupiah currency plummet by more than 20% in 2013 during the so-called ""taper tantrum"".
Bank Indonesia (BI) Governor Perry Warjiyo told the seminar emerging economies will be able to weather global monetary tightening, including U.S. rate hikes, ""much better"" this year compared with previous periods of tightening.
Emerging markets, like Indonesia, had in place a better policy framework, higher foreign exchange reserves and had made efforts to deepen financial markets, he said, listing the LCS deals as an example.

LCS arrangements had cut Indonesia's U.S. dollar exposure by $2.53 billion in 2021 and a further 10% increase in such settlements is expected this year as BI sought to expand deals with other countries and develop more hedging instruments, Warjiyo said.
China will work with Asian countries to beef up the use of local currencies in trade and investment, Yi Gang, the governor of the central bank, told the seminar, as part of plans to strengthen regional economic resilience.

Among the world's largest manufacturers for brands like  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), Zara, and H&M, Vietnam has recently lifted most of its COVID-19 curbs, which last year disrupted production and hobbled global supply chains. 
""The pandemic will have a milder impact on Vietnam's garment and textile industry this year thanks to a high vaccination rate,"" Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association vice chairman, Truong Van Cam, said in an interview this week.
Daily coronavirus infections in the Southeast Asian country reached a record high of 31,800 on Tuesday but businesses and experts said the risk of repeating last year's lockdowns is lower now that millions of factory workers have been vaccinated and with the Omicron variant appearing to be less severe.
Cam said pandemic-related shutdowns had affected up to 1.2 million garment workers last year, or 65% of the industry's workforce. Nearly all of them have now returned to work, he added. 
""Thanks to the country's flexible policies to tackle the pandemic while restoring business activities, especially from the fourth quarter of 2021, the garment and textile industry has managed to significantly limit supply chain disruptions,"" he said.

Vietnam has recorded 2.57 million COVID-19 cases and around 39,000 deaths. More than 76% of its population of 98 million has received at least two vaccine doses, according to official data.
The tourism ministry has proposed fully reopening the country to foreign tourists from March 15, three months earlier than planned.

Recent years' progress by emerging Asian nations in using local currencies in trade and investment has strengthened the region's financial safety net against external shocks, Yi told an event of the G20 grouping.
""Emerging markets should improve their resilience,"" Yi said by video at the event hosted by Indonesia. ""This is where regional co-operation has a key role to play."" 
Bilateral currency swaps among the ASEAN regional grouping, China, Japan and South Korea have reached $380 billion, he said.
Last month, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) extended a bilateral currency swap pact with Bank Indonesia for three years to deepen financial cooperation and promote investment.
""Central banks from advanced economies should continue to enhance market communications,"" Yi added, as this would help mitigate the spillover effect at a time of greater risks to emerging economies from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Economists believe China and other emerging economies could face the risk of capital outflows once the U.S. Federal Reserve starts to tighten policy.

A Reuters poll showed the Fed will kick off its tightening cycle in March, with an interest rate hike of 25 basis points, but a growing minority say it will opt for a more aggressive half-point move to tamp down inflation.
China will keep its accommodative monetary policy flexible, as economic growth is likely to return to its potential rate this year, Yi added.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan must respond to any damage inflicted on the economy by recent rising prices, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Wednesday, a sign that the hit to households from the cost of living is emerging as a fresh headache for policymakers.
Suzuki said the recent rise in prices was driven mostly by higher global fuel costs, rather than any increase in import prices from a weak yen.
""If prices rise before wages ... that could hurt household income and affect consumption,"" Suzuki told parliament. ""We must respond to any impact such price moves could have on the economy,"" he added. 
Suzuki did not elaborate on what steps the government could take.
His comments came in response to a question from an opposition lawmaker on whether the Bank of Japan's ultra-loose policy, and a resulting weak yen, were to blame for pushing up household living costs.
Japan's consumer inflation remains stuck around 0.5%, well below Western nations and the BOJ's 2% target. With wages barely rising, however, the hit to households is becoming a politically hot topic ahead of an upper house election likely around July.
The country relies almost entirely on imports for fuel, making its economy vulnerable to oil price swings. The government launched a temporary subsidy programme last month to ease the blow from rising fuel prices on households, and has signalled the possibility of taking further measures.

While the economy rebounded in the final three months of 2021, some analysts expect a contraction in the current quarter as a spike in COVID-19 cases and rising prices hit consumption.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has repeatedly said a weak yen was beneficial for the economy as a whole, and brushed aside the chance of a near-term exit from ultra-loose policy.

“We will keep our accommodative monetary policy flexible and appropriate, and increase support for key areas and weak links in the economy,” Yi said in a videotaped speech Wednesday ahead of a meeting of central bank chiefs and finance ministers from the Group of 20 nations in Jakarta. 
Volatile internal and external conditions will create challenges for the economy and require more counter-cyclical policy adjustment, he said.
The People’s Bank of China shifted to easing mode in the second half of last year as economic momentum faltered under a property downturn and sporadic virus outbreaks. The central bank has taken swift action in recent months by cutting interest rates, reducing the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve, and boosting credit expansion in the economy.
While the PBOC held its policy interest rates steady on Tuesday, many economists expect further easing in coming months.
The central bank projects the potential growth rate, or the maximum the economy can expand without fueling inflation, is about 5%-5.7% in the five years through 2025. The objective of monetary policy should be to match actual output with potential, it said in a paper last year.
Economists polled by Bloomberg forecast growth will slow to 5.2% this year after surging to 8.1% in 2021 during the economy’s post-pandemic recovery period.

The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to accelerate monetary tightening to tame inflation this year, while the People's Bank of China needs to use monetary policy tools to stabilise growth.
""Therefore Sino-U.S. monetary policy divergence will likely become greater,"" Guan Tao, global chief economist at BOC International said in a commentary published in the Shanghai Securities News.
Fed tightening is expected to reduce foreign capital inflows into China, shrinking the country's trade surplus and thus helping stabilise the yuan, which needs to be better aligned with economic fundamentals, said Guan, who previously headed the balance of payments department of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).
Guan said China-U.S. policy divergence will have several effects on China, including a shrinking yield spread, reduced purchases of Chinese securities, a strengthening dollar, less demand for Chinese exports and global financial market volatility.
Even in a worst-case scenario in which Fed tightening triggers a global economic crisis, China would cushion the external impact by easing monetary policy, not tightening it, he wrote. 

The yuan hit a near four-year high against the dollar in late January, even as the spread between Chinese and U.S. 10-year treasuries shrank to roughly 80 basis points, from a high of more than 250 basis points in late 2020.
Guan described a spread of between 80 and 100 basis points as the ""comfort zone"".

(Reuters) -U.S. Senate action on President Joe Biden's five nominees to the Federal Reserve stalled Tuesday after Republicans boycotted a key vote over objections to Sarah Bloom Raskin, the White House's pick to be the central bank's Wall Street regulator.
Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown delayed a vote on the slate, which includes Fed Chair Jerome Powell, after none of the 12 Republicans showed up for a scheduled vote Tuesday afternoon. 
Senator Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the committee, had called on fellow Republicans to skip the vote, citing what he said were unanswered questions about Raskin's past role on the board of a fintech company. 
The development comes as the U.S. central bank is gearing up to raise interest rates to combat the highest inflation in 40 years. 
""Instead of showing up to work, to do their job, Republicans have walked out on the American people,"" Brown said to the other 11 Democratic senators on the 24-member panel who gathered for the vote. 
White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said the decision by Republicans to boycott the meeting was ""extreme"" and promised to work with Brown on a path forward for the nominations.
As of late Tuesday, that path was not clear, with Brown adamant he would not split Raskin's nomination from the rest, a solution that Toomey had proposed. 
""Democrats will argue that Republicans are being hypocritical by complaining about inflation while also blocking votes on these nominees,"" Isaac Boltansky, policy director for brokerage BTIG, said in an email exchange. ""Republicans will argue that Democrats are being unreasonable by refusing to pause on Bloom Raskin’s nomination."" 
It is unclear, he said, ""which side will blink first."" 
Separately, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell met with Powell on Tuesday to discuss inflation and the economy. 
POWELL STILL IN CHARGE
While his confirmation for a second four-year term as Fed chief is pending, Powell continues in a ""pro tempore"" chair role, remaining in charge of both U.S. monetary policy and the central bank. 
Most Republicans on the panel back a second term for Powell, a Republican initially installed as Fed chair by then-President Donald Trump. His first term expired earlier this month.
But they are as one in opposing Raskin's nomination as the central bank's vice chair for supervision, the top U.S. banking regulatory role, and have attacked her over past statements expressing support for using financial rules to police climate change.
""Ms. Raskin’s repeated and forceful advocacy for having the Federal Reserve allocate capital and choke off credit to disfavored industries is alone disqualifying and reason enough to vote against her,"" Toomey said Tuesday. 
Raskin, who held senior roles at the Treasury and Fed under Democratic President Barack Obama, told Toomey and the rest of the Senate Banking panel at her confirmation hearing that it was not the Fed's role to tell banks what firms to lend to. 
She has also denied Republican's suggestions that she inappropriately lobbied on behalf of a fintech firm on whose board she sat.
If confirmed, Raskin would become the most powerful banking regulator in Washington, overseeing an ambitious portfolio. 
Her key projects would likely include building tools to assess financial risks from climate change, reversing Wall Street breaks granted by her predecessor, Randal Quarles, and drafting new rules for fair lending and fintechs.
Raskin has been praised by progressive Democrats for her experience and expertise. Moderate Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee also spoke supportively of Raskin at her confirmation hearing, and two of them -- Mark Warner of Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana -- told Reuters on Monday they both planned to vote for her and the rest of Biden's Fed nominees.
OTHER NOMINEES 
The three other nominees for Fed slots include current Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who is up for the job of Fed vice chair, and proposed newcomers Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson. 
All three used their confirmation hearings to signal their backing of Powell's monetary policy agenda, which will see the Fed likely begin lifting interest rates at its March 15-16 policy meeting in what's likely to be the start of a series of rate hikes to quell inflation.
Brainard, a Democrat appointed by Obama to be a Fed governor in 2014, is likely to win support for promotion to the vice chair position, which would make her Powell's deputy, despite Republican misgivings that she would push for the central bank to strengthen its climate change policies. 
Cook is an economist at Michigan State University, while Jefferson is an economist and currently dean of faculty at Davidson College in North Carolina. 
All Democrats on the committee are expected to vote in favor of Cook and Jefferson while at least one Republican, Senator John Kennedy, also indicated he would support them both. 
On Tuesday, Republican Senator Kevin Cramer said he would support Jefferson and Powell, was open to Cook, and was a no on Raskin and Brainard. 
If Cook and Jefferson, who are Black, are confirmed as governors to the currently all-white Fed Board, it would make it the most racially diverse in the central bank's 108-year history.
SENATE RULES 

The standoff over Biden's Fed nominees is the latest example of the obstacles Democrats have encountered moving forward with their agenda in a body they control only by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote as Senate president. 
Rules agreed at the start of this session of Congress ensure that Senate committees cannot advance legislation or nominees unless at least one Republican is present, a change from the previous Congress when Republicans had an outright majority on committees and could move ahead even when Democrats staged walkouts.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve will kick off its tightening cycle in March with a 25-basis-point interest rate rise, a Reuters poll of economists found, but a growing minority say it will opt for a more aggressive half-point move to tamp down inflation.
While inflation is rising across the globe, it is particularly hot in the United States, hitting a 40-year high last month. 
That is putting pressure on the Fed to not only raise rates from a record low but also to reduce its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet, drastically inflated by emergency bond purchases as the Fed resuscitated the economy from COVID-19 pandemic damage.
Now that the economy has recovered its pre-pandemic level, all 84 respondents in a Reuters poll taken Feb. 7-15 expected the Fed to raise the federal funds rate by at least 25 basis points at its upcoming March 15-16 meeting.
Almost a quarter of those respondents, 20, forecast a 50-basis-point move to 0.50-0.75% following debate in markets over the past week after Fed officials discussed the merits of such a move. Rate futures are pricing in more than a 50% likelihood of a half-point hike.
Rates were forecast to rise each quarter this year to reach 1.25-1.50% by end-December, roughly where they were at the start of the pandemic two years ago. One-quarter of respondents, 21 of 84, saw rates even higher by end-2022.
""The risk is that at some point ... they'll shift to hiking 50 basis points, because it's very unusual for a central bank to have a zero interest rate in the face of the kind of news we're looking at right now,"" said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities, referring to inflation. 
""I do think the Fed is behind the curve. In my view, the Fed should have started hiking last fall, and so they've got some catching up to do.""

The Fed was also expected to start reducing its balance sheet quicker than in the previous cycle, beginning as soon as June or July, only a few months after the first rate hike.
The poll concluded the Fed would start by cutting $60 billion per month from its portfolio with predictions in a $20 billion to $100 billion range, according to the median of 27 responses to an additional question. 
That follows a $120 billion-per-month purchase pace at the peak of pandemic-related stimulus. Respondents estimated the Fed's balance sheet would amount to $5.5 trillion to $6.5 trillion once this so-called ""quantitative tightening"" concludes.
While that would leave the central bank's balance sheet about 30% lighter, it would still be larger than before the pandemic, roughly $4 trillion.
Poll respondents also said this would not be a typical interest rate cycle.
Not only was it expected to be short, but the Fed is only forecast to reach a neutral rate: one which neither stimulates nor puts the brakes on activity.
Respondents put both the terminal rate and their estimated neutral rate at the same level, 2.25% to 2.50%, according to median forecasts from additional questions.
That terminal rate was expected to be reached by end-2024, marking a quick tightening cycle by historical standards, something which comes with its own risks.
""Since nobody knows where the neutral rate exactly is, the Fed could get into restrictive territory earlier than it realizes, and that could ultimately lead to a recession,"" said Philip Marey, senior U.S. strategist at Rabobank.
Still, the Fed was not expected to achieve its 2% inflation target until at least 2024.
The core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, was forecast to clock 3.9% and 2.4% this year and next, before falling to 2.1% in 2024.
Headline inflation was forecast to average 7.1% this quarter, before falling to 2.3% by the end of next year, and average 5.0% and 2.5% in 2022 and 2023, respectively.

Disruptions to economic activity following a surge in COVID-19 cases dented growth in the final months of last year and are expected to do so as well this quarter. 
Growth for this quarter was downgraded for the fourth consecutive month -- to an annualized rate of 1.6%. It was expected to rebound to 3.8% next quarter and then gradually slow.

Economic growth was predicted to average 3.7% and 2.5% this year and next, respectively, largely unchanged from a January poll.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration is seeking $30 billion in additional funds from Congress to fight the COVID-19 pandemic to bolster vaccines, treatments, testing supply, and research, according to sources familiar with the matter.
The $30 billion request includes $17.9 billion for vaccines and therapeutics, two sources familiar with it said.
Administration officials and congressional staff have been in talks about the issue, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday.
“HHS leaders regularly engage with Congress about COVID resources, and in a Tuesday conversation with congressional staff, HHS discussed the status of COVID response funds as well as the need for additional resources to support securing more lifesaving treatments and vaccines, sustaining testing capacity, and investing in research and development of next-generation vaccines,"" the spokesperson said.
""These resources would help us continue expanding the tools the country needs to stay ahead of the virus and help us move toward the time when COVID-19 will not disrupt our daily lives.”
Democratic President Joe Biden secured a $1.9 trillion ""American Rescue Plan"" last year to fight the pandemic. But the Delta and Omicron variants of the coronavirus, coupled with ongoing vaccine hesitancy among a portion of the U.S. population, have fueled coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths nationwide.
""While we continue to have sufficient funds to respond to the current Omicron surge in the coming weeks, our goal has always been to ensure that we are well prepared to stay ahead of the virus,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said.
The White House is eager to show progress on the pandemic ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm elections, in which Republicans hope to take over control of the House of Representatives and the Senate; Democrats have a slim majority in the House and control the 50-50 Senate now, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding a tie-breaking vote.
The administration may face opposition from Republicans and even some Democrats wary of approving additional funding. Biden is also struggling to pass pieces of his Build Back Better climate and social spending bill, which has stalled in the Senate because of opposition from moderate members of his own party.

The new COVID funding package includes a proposed $4.9 billion for testing, including extending community testing, and continuing development and manufacturing of at-home tests aimed at new variants, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. 
Another estimated $3 billion is proposed for reimbursing providers for testing, treatment and vaccination of the uninsured and vaccination of the underinsured. $3.7 billion would go to developing vaccines that would protect against future variants and half a billion dollars would be aimed at programs for tracking diseases.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will urge her G20 counterparts to work towards ending the COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries and ensuring they have the resources needed to support an equitable recovery, a U.S. Treasury official said on Tuesday.
Yellen is due to participate virtually in the meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 major economies on Thursday and Friday.
The U.S. Treasury official laid out U.S. priorities for the meeting, which comes as COVID-19 Omicron variant cases are receding in many wealthy countries but are still rising in many developing countries. Host country Indonesia reported a daily record 57,049 new cases on Tuesday.
Southeast Asia's most populous country had initially planned an in-person G20 finance meeting in Bali, but the venue was moved to Jakarta in January when it became a hybrid gathering with many officials participating virtually. 
Yellen will urge the G20 to tailor their policies to individual country circumstances to secure an inclusive recovery and to close the gap in vaccine access for poorer countries, the official said.
This includes supporting efforts by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization to address global bottlenecks in the deployment of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, the official said.
Yellen also will urge G20 countries to support a proposed global fund housed at the World Bank to invest in pandemic prevention and preparedness, with its estimated $75 billion cost a ""bargain"" compared to COVID-19's global economic and human costs.
Yellen also will express confidence that momentum will be maintained among 136 countries to finalize an agreement for a 15% global minimum corporate tax this year, so that it can be put into force in 2023.
The official said Democrats in the U.S. Congress broadly support the international tax provisions.

""Secretary Yellen expects they will be part of any Build Back Better bill passed,"" the official added, referring to U.S. President Joe Biden's social and climate investment bill, which is currently stalled in Congress.
Yellen also intends to make a pitch for more intensive climate action to meet carbon emissions reduction goals, including mobilizing more private capital to finance the transition away from fossil fuels. Public resources can help catalyze additional private financing for reducing emissions, the official said.

(Reuters) - Senate Republicans on Tuesday delayed a pivotal committee vote on President Joe Biden's nominees to the Federal Reserve Board, including Jerome Powell as chair, when they boycotted the proceeding over objections to Sarah Bloom Raskin as the central bank's Wall Street regulator.
Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat who chairs the Banking Committee reviewing the nominations, said he will try to reschedule a vote as soon as possible. It is unclear when that might happen because Republicans, who hold half the seats on the panel, are demanding Raskin be separated from the other four nominees, and Brown is refusing to acquiesce. 
Here's how the delay might affect the Fed in the weeks ahead.
WILL IT AFFECT PLANS FOR A MARCH INTEREST RATE HIKE?
Not really. 
The Board of Governors earlier this month voted to have Powell act as ""chair pro tempore"" for the Fed system as a whole until the Senate confirmation process is completed. And in January, he was reelected chair of the Federal Open Market Committee by members of the policy-setting panel.
Officials, including Powell, have signaled their intent to raise interest rates at the March 15-16 meeting, though recent high inflation readings have stirred a public debate about how fast to proceed in the months ahead.
But, for instance, the delay in affirming Fed Governor Lael Brainard's elevation to vice chair - traditionally a leading voice in Fed messaging efforts - may hamper the effort to provide clarity on the road ahead for monetary policy, said Kaleb Nygaard, senior research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability. 
""This delay in getting the nominees actually hurts the institution’s ability to signal because there’s an added degree of uncertainty about what the leadership team is going to be,"" Nygaard said.
WILL THIS MEAN FEWER POLICYMAKER PROJECTIONS NEXT MONTH?
In all likelihood, yes.
Policymakers provide individual forecasts each quarter for where they think inflation, interest rates and the unemployment rate will head in the coming months, and the median of their forecasts on the Fed's target interest rate in particular is very influential. The next set is due at the March meeting.
Since they last provided projections in December, two officials have left the Fed - Richard Clarida and Randal Quarles. With just four weeks until the meeting, it is likely that the next set of projections will include only 16 forecasts instead of 18 in December and 19 were all the nominees confirmed in time.
At the margin that could affect the signal emerging from the projections on how soon officials see inflation returning to their 2% target and how aggressively they intend to raise rates this year and after that.
WHAT'S NEXT IN THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS?
With Republicans refusing to appear, the 12-12 committee cannot reach the quorum required to hold a vote.
For now that leaves Brown and his Democratic colleagues - likely in consultation with the White House - to make a political judgment on whether to split up the vote by breaking out Raskin as Republicans have demanded, or to continue trying to get all five nominees through at once. 
Several Republicans on the committee have expressed support for the nominations of Powell for a second term as chair and Brainard as vice chair. A number have also said they would support economists Philip Jefferson of Davidson College and Lisa Cook of Michigan State University for open board seats. 
That signals those four could be ""reported favorably"" for confirmation consideration to the full Senate - if the committee can hold a vote. 
But Republicans are united in opposing Raskin over past comments on climate change and have also accused her of inappropriately lobbying on behalf of a firm where she acted as a director.
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE COMMITTEE DOES EVENTUALLY VOTE?
The names of the nominees winning a majority of support from committee members then go to the full Senate for final confirmation.
In the event the committee ""fails to report favorably"" on any nominee - a likely outcome for Raskin - Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer can have the full Senate vote on ""discharging"" the Senate banking panel from considering the nomination further. 
Then, a final confirmation vote could occur after other technical procedures are completed. The process was used last year to move forward on the stalled nomination of Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Director Rohit Chopra.
One further twist: that vote may also depend on attendance.

President Donald Trump's attempt to get his one-time economic adviser and controversial Fed nominee Judy Shelton confirmed failed in 2020 in part because a couple of Republicans were quarantining due to COVID-19 exposure and could not come to the Senate floor to vote.
Senator Ben Ray Luján, a Democrat from New Mexico, suffered a stroke last month and is recovering, putting off the earliest likely confirmation vote on the Fed nominees until March.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -Three U.S. senators on Tuesday called on the Department of Labor to help states find alternatives to identity verification provider ID.me for screening people seeking unemployment aid because they said its technology raises serious privacy and civil liberties concerns.
The Internal Revenue Service last week dropped mandatory verification through ID.me for people filing their taxes online this year. But about half of U.S. states still use ID.me, which employs a mix of facial recognition technology and video-chat interviews, to confirm the identity of unemployment applicants. Other states have used rival tools.
Activists have argued that facial recognition remains too faulty for use in government applications, and that people should have more privacy and control over face scans.
ID.me declined to comment on the request, which came in a letter from Democratic Senators Ron Wyden, Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren.
A day after the IRS announcement, ID.me said it would allow users to bypass facial recognition and proceed to a manual check. It has said security and equitable access are top priorities.
Reuters reported last year that a government watchdog group wrote to officials, including the Department of Labor's inspector general, that the influential National Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA) may have interfered with open-competition requirements by recommending ID.me to the exclusion of others. NASWA is partially backed by the Labor Department. 
States have called ID.me valuable for curbing record unemployment assistance fraud during the COVID-19 pandemic. But some legitimate applicants experienced delays after facial recognition failed to verify their identity and long waits for interviews with manual verifiers ensued.
The senators urged the Labor Department to work with other agencies on alternative recommendations, including possibly the federal government's Login.gov identity verification tool. 

Over 40 million people are registered on Login.gov, which uses credit histories and other records for verification.
ID.me says it has 73 million users.

The Andean country's economy grew 10.6% last year, beating expectations, as the entertainment, retail and manufacturing sectors soared, the government's DANE statistics agency reported earlier on Tuesday.
However, pressures amid supply-chain issues mean Colombia's central bank will need to act quickly in the first half of this year to anchor inflation expectations and insure against upside inflation risks, said Hamid Faruqee, head of the IMF's Colombia mission.
""Controlling inflation ... poses a challenge to Colombia's central bank, a challenge that we see in other countries as well, including the United States,"" Faruqee said during a virtual press conference. 
Colombia's inflation came in at 5.62% in 2021, its highest in five years, while 12-month inflation in January hit 6.94%, more than double the central bank's target of 3%.
""For Colombia we see the need for additional interest rate hikes, front loaded in the first half of this year and broadly speaking we're seeing markets have similar expectations shifting in that direction for some other major central banks,"" Faruqee added.

While the IMF forecasts Colombia's economic growth at 4.5% this year - with help expected to come from consumption, investment and exports - the multilateral organization will revise its outlook following DANE's report, Faruqee added. 
""We won't know the final numbers yet until we reexamine our forecast,"" he said. ""Obviously we'll make some adjustments as we look at the DANE release today.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government said it faces ""significant harm"" if an a appeals court fails to reverse an injunction barring enforcement of President Joe Biden's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for government workers, and that testing unvaccinated employees could cost up to $22 million a month.
White House Office of Management and Budget Deputy Director Jason Miller disclosed in an declaration cited late on Monday by the Justice Department that the government would be hurt on several fronts if it cannot enforce the vaccine requirements.
""While most federal civilian employees are fully vaccinated, hundreds of thousands of them are not vaccinated,"" Miller said in the Jan. 28 declaration.
The government hires about 20,000 workers monthly and currently cannot require them to be vaccinated, he added.
On Jan. 21, a U.S. judge in Texas ruled Biden could not require federal employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and blocked the U.S. government from disciplining employees failing to comply.
In September, Biden had issued an order requiring about 3.5 million workers to get vaccinated by Nov. 22 barring a religious or medical accommodation - or else face discipline or firing.
Miller's declaration said as of Jan. 21, roughly 2% of the federal civilian workforce ""had neither affirmed they were fully vaccinated nor submitted a request for or received an exception.""
U.S. COVID-19 workplace safety protocols require unvaccinated federal employees to submit to regular testing. Weekly testing ""could cost taxpayers on the order of $11 million to $22 million each month, or $33 million to $65 million each quarter,"" Miller wrote.
Tens of thousands of unvaccinated federal employees do not have pending or approved requests for exception and tens of thousands of exception requests are pending, Miller wrote.
Last week, a U.S. appeals court declined to block the vaccine ruling. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals will hear the case on March 8.

Miller said the ruling is forcing government agencies to revise ""reentry and post-reentry plans and schedules"" to include ""setting up expanded COVID-19 testing programs at agencies."" He added if the injunction remains in place ""it will imperil the federal government's ability to protect the health and safety of the federal workforce.""
The Justice Department cited then-President Ronald Reagan's 1986 executive order requiring federal employees abstain from using illegal drugs, both on and off duty, and argued the president has ""broad power to regulate the federal civil service.""

In the face of growing inflation risks, the ECB has opened the door to an interest rate hike later this year and flagged plans to decide at a March 10 meeting how quickly its long-running bond purchases are wound down.
In a speech to the London School of Economics, Villeroy said it would be useful to have a transition between the end of exceptional pandemic-era bond purchases in March and the end of its more traditional Asset Purchase Programme, which he said could end in the third quarter.
Villeroy, who heads the French central bank, also said that the link between the end of asset purchases and rate hikes could be softened by dropping the suggestion in the ECB's forward guidance that a hike would come ""shortly"" afterwards.
""We could give ourselves more time and consider the latest inflation outlook before deciding about the calendar of rate hikes - a decision that anyway we don’t need to make before our June meeting,"" Villeroy said.
""Any speculation about this calendar of future lift-off is at this stage premature,"" he added.

Villeroy also pushed back against market speculation that the ECB could pause hikes or slow them after rates return to positive territory, saying that there was ""no pre-set course"" although that could be a possibility.
In the risk of an ""unwarranted"" blow-out in bond spreads between euro zone countries, he said the ECB could reactivate its pandemic-era bond purchases if needed.

The country’s presidential spokesman Jesus Ramirez played down the nature of the threat to the U.S. inspector, but said the government is working with its northern neighbor to guarantee everyone’s safety.
The ban on avocados from Michoacán, a coastal state just west of Mexico City that has been plagued with violence in recent years, went into effect on Feb. 11 after an inspector said he received a threatening call to his cell phone. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador responded by suggesting there were political and economic interests at play in the U.S. decision.
Ramirez, who said he didn’t personally know the culprit’s identity, said the threat wasn’t concerning. “It has no importance,” he said in a phone interview with Bloomberg News, saying he understands it wasn’t a “direct threat.” He noted that Mexico’s national guard accompanies inspectors to ensure their safety. “There’s no problem so we’re going to see what more is required.” 
Separately, Mexico’s avocado export group APEAM met with several U.S. and local authorities to review security measures and protocols, according to a tweet from the organization.  
Mexico accounts for 80% of the U.S. market, and the ban could drive up prices for American shoppers on yet another product in an economy grappling with its worst inflation surge in four decades.

159,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 02:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Has inflation really eroded Americans’ wage gains in the pandemic? Some regional Federal Reserve economists say no.
Even though decades-high inflation has eaten into earnings in recent months, the net effect over the past two years is still positive, according to a blog post from the Dallas Fed Tuesday. Researchers found wages rose during the period when adjusting for changes in the makeup of the labor force. 
“Despite recent negative real wage growth, workers have experienced real wage gains over the two years of the pandemic,” researchers Sean Howard, Robert Rich and Joseph Tracy said in the post.
The findings follow a recent disagreement on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) between Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman and Jason Furman, a Harvard Kennedy School professor and former economic adviser to President Barack Obama. Krugman said in December real wages had risen since the pre-pandemic period, but Furman said they’d declined about 1%. 
The reality is a bit more complicated, according to the Fed economists. Researchers used average hourly earnings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly jobs report, which jumped 5.7% in January from a year ago. 
They also took into account the consumer price index, a key measure of inflation which registered a fresh four-decade high in January. Wages adjusted for inflation dropped 1.7% last month on an annual basis, the BLS said last week.
The research controlled for composition effects to reflect how the workforce changed amid the pandemic jobs churn. This is important because if a slew of higher-paid workers left the labor force while lower-wage ones entered, it has a negative effect on compensation.
When accounting for those shifts and holding them constant to historical trends, real wages declined 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2021 as inflation skyrocketed. Wage growth was closer to 2% in the first three months of 2019 when the CPI was about five times lower than it is now, the findings showed.

(Reuters) - Canada prevailed on Tuesday in a challenge to U.S. solar panel tariffs under the trade pact between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, its trade minister said on Tuesday, ahead of planned talks with Washington over the dispute.
Mary Ng, Canada's minister of trade and export promotion, said in a statement that she welcomed the findings of a U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement dispute settlement panel, “which unequivocally confirmed that U.S. tariffs on Canadian solar products are unjustified and in violation"" of the trade pact.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump first imposed the ""Section 201"" safeguard tariffs on imported solar panels and cells in January 2018, but did not exempt Canada and Mexico from the duties. Canada argued that the tariffs violated the terms of the USMCA pact, which eliminates most tariffs among the North American partners, and sought a dispute settlement panel last year.
A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office said the United States prevailed on some aspects of the panel's decision. 
“The U.S. appreciates that the panel reaffirmed the President's authority to make exclusion determinations in safeguard proceedings,"" USTR spokesman Adam Hodge said in a statement. ""We will continue to review the report and work with Canada to resolve the dispute.""
President Joe Biden earlier this month extended the tariffs for another four years, but in a major concession to installers he eased the terms to exclude a panel technology dominant among big U.S. projects.
Biden's proclamation also called for starting negotiations with Canada and Mexico to ensure that imports of solar products from the countries ""do not undermine the effectiveness"" of the tariffs, which were largely aimed at subsidized production from China.

Canada and Mexico were granted exemptions from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum first imposed by Trump, but those agreements contain provisions aimed at preventing ""surges"" of imports and products transshipped from other countries.
Ng said she welcomed the U.S. offer for talks, adding, ""Canada will work toward the complete removal of these unjustified tariffs.""

161,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 02:00PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- American poultry farmers were already struggling to boost production before deadly avian influenza started popping up for the first time in several years.
From the Covid-19 outbreak two years ago to abnormally cold weather that knocked out power on farms in 2021, producers of chicken and turkey have not been able to hatch enough birds, sending prices for both poultry and eggs soaring. Detection of bird flu, most recently on a Kentucky farm that supplies top U.S. chicken producer  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN)., is the latest disruption that is threatening to keep poultry supplies tight. 
“Once a flock gets it, it’s a death sentence,” said Russ Whitman, senior vice president at commodity researcher Urner Barry. “It’s all about the spread and we simply don’t know enough about that. It’s a wait and see.” 
”The buyers of the world are already keenly aware of the challenges they’re up against in 2022 in just getting the supply that they need.”
Tyson said it was heightening biosecurity measures including restrictions on visitors to nearby farms after the deadly bird flu strain was detected. 
“Because the affected farm in Kentucky is only one of the thousands of farms that raise chickens for our company, the situation is not expected to impact our overall chicken production levels,” Tyson said in a statement.
Tyson and other meat companies have been under pressure from the Biden Administration for turning huge profits even as consumers pay near-record prices for meat. 
The weather isn’t helping: drought in Brazil is shrinking the soybean harvest and raising feed prices. Harsh winter recently in states including Arkansas and Virginia also hit poultry production, similarly to the abnormal cold snap a year ago that killed hundreds of thousands of chickens.
“There’s a lot of weather issues that have occurred,” Bob Brown, an independent market consultant in Edmond, Oklahoma, said by phone. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture earlier in February scaled back its production outlook for broiler chickens this year, due in part to high feed costs.

Demonstrators at a border crossing between Manitoba and North Dakota are also preparing to leave in unison Wednesday with a police escort, said Jake Klassen, a truck driver who joined the protest out of frustration he can not visit his daughter receiving palliative care unless he is fully vaccinated. People are worried the government will seize their property and protesters plan to leave in a “slow roll” tomorrow and reopen traffic, Klassen said by phone.
“A lot of grown men were crying,” Klassen said. “We didn’t think he was going to enact that. We could lose everything.”
The Manitoba border to the U.S. at Emerson (NYSE:EMR) was still closed as of 12:14 p.m. New York time, according to the website of Canada’s border agency.
“We accomplished something, I believe, but we didn’t accomplish what we went there to accomplish,” Klassen said.

163,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 01:31PM ET</span>",,,,,,"MILAN (Reuters) -Two activist investors in Generali (MI:GASI) on Tuesday urged Italy's leading insurer to engage in ""an open and constructive dialogue"" to overcome issues that have held back its growth.
Generali is at the centre of a shareholder battle pitting a group of investors including eyewear billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio against its single biggest shareholder Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY).
Del Vecchio's Delfin investment vehicle and banking foundation Fondazione CRT said it was important for a company of strategic relevance for Italy such as Generali to engage with shareholders and respect their rights.
Delfin, Generali's third-largest investor, and CRT said their consultation pact over Generali remained in place, as they sought to provide their view of what the insurer's future should be like after investing ""significant resources"" in it.
""Delfin and Fondazione CRT are long-term shareholders,"" they said in a joint statement.
""As such they firmly believe only an open and constructive dialogue ... can allow the insurer to pursue a path of sustainable growth, overcoming issues that affected its competitive positioning in Europe.""
Generali declined to comment.
Del Vecchio and fellow tycoon Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, a construction magnate who is Generali's No.2 investor, have complained in the past that Generali lags in size compared to peers such as France's AXA or Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG).
Generali for its part has pointed out its total shareholder returns since CEO Philippe Donnet presented his first business plan in November 2016 surpass those of AXA and Allianz.
Throwing the gauntlet at Mediobanca, Del Vecchio and Caltagirone in September joined forces in a consultation pact that was later joined by CRT. The two magnates are both investors in Mediobanca, of which Del Vecchio owns nearly 20%.
Caltagirone last month quit the Generali pact to avoid drawing regulatory scrutiny ahead of proposing a slate of nominees for the renewal of Generali's board in April. 
Del Vecchio and Caltagirone have questioned Donnet's reappointment, which is backed by Mediobanca and faces a shareholder vote in April.

People familiar with their thinking have said they believe Generali has favoured paying dividends over expansion through M&A.
After backing Donnet's first two business plans, Caltagirone voted against the CEO's new strategy in December while a representative for Delfin did not attend the board meeting. They have both stepped down from Generali's board since then.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Developing countries must quickly strengthen their financial sectors, the World Bank said on Tuesday, warning that rising inflation, interest rates and alarming levels of debt distress could trigger a global chain reaction not seen in generations.
The World Bank underscored its longstanding concerns about lack of transparency about Chinese lending and collateralized loans in the sovereign debt sector, but also called out growing private sector risks in its latest World Development Report.
The bank's surveys showed 46% of small and medium-sized businesses in developing countries expected to fall behind on debt payments within six months, but the number was twice as high in some countries, chief economist Carmen Reinhart told Reuters in an interview ahead of the report's release.
Reinhart said she was keeping a close eye on private sector debt developments in bigger emerging markets like India, South Africa, the Philippines, and Kenya, where more than 65% of small and medium-sized companies expected to be in arrears.
She told an online World Bank event that the share of countries in or at risk of debt distress was in ""alarming territory,"" but financial sector policies were also needed to address risks posed by rising debt among households and firms. 
Turkey, whose credit rating was downgraded to ""BB-"" by ratings agency Fitch last week, had been in crisis for several years and could ""well be the straw that broke the camel's back,"" she told Reuters.
Massive fiscal and monetary support had helped mitigate the consequences of the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic, but forbearance policies and relaxed accounting standards could be obscuring a ""hidden non-performing loan problem,"" she said.
""There's a huge need for better transparency on the private sector debt,"" Reinhart said.
""What gets you in the end is not so much what you see, but what you don't see,"" she said, warning against a false sense of complacency about financial health of households and firms.
Bank for International Settlements head Agustin Carstens told the World Bank event that many of the macroeconomic policies adopted by governments during the pandemic had hit their limits and new policies were now needed to enhance the resilience of private firms and support employment.
The report urged greater efforts to improve transparency about private sector debt, more proactive management of distressed loans, including out-of-court solutions, as well as accelerated work on addressing sovereign debt distress.
Many ratings agencies also failed to factor in foreign state-owned enterprises that could raise significant financial risks in low-income and some emerging market countries, it said.
World Bank President David Malpass highlighted risks of spillover effects given the interrelated nature of households, firms, financial sector institutions and governments. ""Private debt could suddenly become public debt, as in many past crises,"" he wrote in the forward to the report.
Speaking on Tuesday, Malpass said gradual interest rate hikes by central banks and a tapering of bond purchases alone were unlikely to control inflation that is hitting the world's poorest the hardest.
Instead, he said, governments and central banks - in developing countries and advanced economies - should ""use more of their tools at the same time,"" including steps to lengthen the maturity and transparency of all levels of outstanding government debt, and slow the growth in national debt levels.
STALLED PROGRESS ON SOVEREIGN DEBT RESTRUCTURING
Malpass said implementation of the Common Framework agreed by China, the world's largest creditor, and other Group of 20 major economies to deal with debt problems was stalled.
The pandemic-induced recession of 2020 led to the largest single-year surge in global debt in decades, and 51 countries had their sovereign debt credit rating cut, but the issue had not triggered the urgent action needed, Reinhart said.
Malpass warned that the longer such debt restructuring efforts took, the bigger the ""haircut"" creditors faced.

""For debtor countries, delay presents major setbacks to growth, poverty alleviation and development,"" he wrote, adding that negotiations about moving forward were now ""stalled.""
The International Monetary Fund last week said it would press G20 finance leaders meeting this week to strengthen the framework for poor countries given rising default risks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A dramatic flattening in key parts of the U.S. Treasury yield curve is reflecting worries that the Federal Reserve has been too slow to raise interest rates and will now risk causing a recession by tightening monetary policy too aggressively. 
The gap between yields on two-year and 10-year U.S. government debt is the smallest since July 2020 and compressed by 20 basis points after data on Thursday showed the strongest annual inflation in four decades last month.
Investors watch the yield curve for insight into the U.S. economy. An inverted curve, where rates on short-term government debt exceed those on longer-term debt, has reliably predicted past recessions.
In this case, investors believe the flattening yield curve reflects worries that the Fed has already let inflation get out of control by being slow off the mark in raising interest rates and risks hurting growth as it hurries to catch up.
“On the one hand, the market is saying this is what the Fed is going to be doing, and on the other side it’s saying ‘oh by the way, it’s going to be a mistake,’” said Tom Fitzpatrick, chief technical strategist at Citi.
Investors are now pricing in around 175 basis points of interest rate increases by next February and a 62% chance the Fed will raise rates 50 basis points at its March meeting. A rate hike of at least 25 basis points in March is fully priced in. [FEDWATCH]
The curve between two-year and five-year notes, which Fitzpatrick calls his “financial bible” because of its historical accuracy in forecasting the outcomes of Fed policy, briefly reached 30.4 basis points, from 66 basis points a month ago, and was last at 36 basis points.
Each time the yield gap has broken below the 31 to 33 basis point area in the past 25 years it has ended up inverting, as occurred in 2000, 2006 and 2019, Fitzpatrick said. Economic contraction and stock market declines followed each of these instances - with the most recent downturn caused by business closures in response to the pandemic. 
Flattening between five-year and 10-year yields, where the spread currently is only nine basis points, also indicates the Fed has been too slow to act as the economy improves.
“The bond market is saying that we’re in a bit of a boom here and the Fed has a lot of work to do,” said Padhraic Garvey, regional head of research, Americas, at ING.
The two-year, 10-year yield curve is the most closely watched as a recession indicator, with an economic downturn seen as likely six months to two years after this part inverts. It reached 38 basis points on Monday, before bouncing back to 45 basis points.
But while that area is flat relative to the start of previous tightening cycles, another recession indicator, the spread between three-month bills and 10-year notes, is more encouraging, according to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
That part of the curve “tells us that the current shape of the yield curve is not too drastically different from the beginning of past tightening cycles, once the expected total number of hikes is factored in,” Deutsche Bank strategist Steven Zeng said in a report.
The spread between the two yields is around 160 basis points, while the market is pricing in 200 basis points of cumulative hikes by the time the Fed finishes its tightening cycle. If 10-year yields rise by 40 basis points during the rate hikes, ""the curve would avoid a complete inversion,” Zeng said.
While the flattening curve is attracting attention, most market participants don’t see a recession on the horizon. Fund managers in a BofA Global Research survey, released Tuesday, named hawkish central banks as the top “tail risk” to markets. Expectations for a flatter yield curve were the highest since 2005, though only 12% of respondents said a recession will occur within the next year.
The Fed can also use the roll off or possible sale of bonds from its massive balance sheet to tighten conditions, or to re-steepen curves and give it more space to keep hiking rates.

“If you use the balance sheet and longer-end yields continue to push higher and the curve continues to steepen, that kind of validates that you can continue on your path in terms of short-term interest rates,” said Citi's Fitzpatrick.
Kansas City Fed President Esther George said last month that shrinking the balance sheet could allow the central bank to take a shallower path on interest rate increases.

Since President Emmanuel Macron took office in 2017, the government has cut corporate tax by 26 billion euros ($29.5 billion) since 2017, including 10 billion euros in levies that French firms pay that are tied to turnover or staff headcount whether they make a profit or not.
Nonetheless, these so-called ""production taxes"" remain far higher than in other EU countries, and Le Maire has repeatedly called recently for another round of cuts to make French companies more competitive.
""We can go further on tax cuts but only as far as 10-15 billion euros,"" Le Maire told a business conference on France's presidential election in April.
Le Maire said cutting production taxes by that much would be ""reasonable"" if France is to stick to current plans to reduce the public-sector budget deficit beneath an EU ceiling of 3% of output by 2027 from an estimated 5% this year.
The Rexecode economics think tank estimates cutting production taxes by 30 billion euros would be needed just to bring them to the EU average.

Rexecode said in a study on Tuesday that cutting production taxes should be a the centre of a new push to restore French companies' competitiveness under the next government.

The package for 2022-2025 is in line with a zero emission vehicle policy plus a goal to ensure 30% of Thailand's total auto production are EVs by 2030, Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana told a news conference.
In the first two years, the measures will focus on encouraging widespread domestic use of EVs by providing tax breaks and subsidies for imported models and those made locally, he said.
In the last years of the package, the support will mainly be on promoting domestically produced EVs, while cancelling some benefits for imported models, Thanakorn said. 
""This is to encourage operators to accelerate the production of electric vehicles in the country to meet increasing demand,"" he said.
Thailand last year produced 1.7 million regular vehicles, for firms that include Toyota, Honda and Mitsubishi. 
Thanakorn did not give further details on the incentives, which he said would need to be worked out with the energy ministry.

Erdogan, visiting for the first time since 2013, received a grand reception on Monday with UAE de facto ruler Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan meeting him on arrival and the world's tallest tower, the Burj Khalifa, projecting Turkey's flag.
The move to rein in regional rivalry rooted in differences on the role of political Islam, comes after Ankara launched a charm offensive last year at a time of economic turmoil in Turkey and as the UAE turns towards soft power politics.
""Our mutual goal is to carry our bilateral relations to much higher levels in all areas,"" Erdogan told a business event. ""Turkey provides very important advantages for investors looking for alternatives to Asia-centred production areas.""
Later on Tuesday, Erdogan met with Dubai's ruler Mohammad bin Rashid at Dubai's Expo 2020, the first world fair to be held in the Middle East.
In brief remarks, Erdogan highlighted Turkey's steps to protect the environment.
The UAE and Turkey on Monday signed a joint statement on starting negotiations for a bilateral trade and investment deal as well as several agreements, including on defence, state media said. This follows investment accords worth billions of dollars signed in November when Sheikh Mohammed visited Turkey. [L1N2UP1HN]
The UAE, the region's trade and tourism hub, has said it wants to manage long-running differences with Turkey and Iran as it doubles down on economic growth after the pandemic.
""The UAE sees economic and developmental cooperation ... as a key tool in wisely managing various issues to rid our region of continuous escalation,"" Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE president, said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post on Erdogan's visit.

The rift stems from the Arab uprisings, when Turkey backed the Muslim Brotherhood and their Islamist allies challenging entrenched autocrats from Tunisia to Syria - alarming the UAE's dynastic rulers, who see the Brotherhood as a political and security threat.
Separately, Turkey is seeking smoother relations with Israel and is sending a delegation there ahead of a planned trip to Ankhara by Israeli President Isaac Herzog.

State Security, one of Lebanon's main agencies, looked for Salameh in three locations, including two personal residences outside Beirut and his office at the central bank in the capital, according to the source and Lebanon's LBCI TV. 
Judge Ghada Aoun had issued a subpoena for Salameh on Feb. 1 after he failed to attend three hearings as a witness in investigations into his alleged misconduct at the central bank, which includes accusations of fraud. He faces several other investigations in Lebanon and several European countries.
Salameh, who has denied wrongdoing and described accusations against him as politically motivated, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday.
He has previously accused Judge Aoun of bias and has sought her dismissal from investigations against him. 
Aoun told Reuters Tuesday she had indefinitely extended the subpoena until it is implemented. She will continue to legally pursue Salameh, she told Lebanese TV channel Al-Mayadeen.
Salameh's nearly three decades at the helm of the Lebanese central bank have come under increased scrutiny since the country's financial meltdown in 2019. 

He is being investigated in Lebanon and several European nations including Switzerland for alleged money laundering and embezzlement of hundreds of millions of dollars at the central bank - allegations he has repeatedly denied. 
Salameh retains the support of powerful figures including billionaire Prime Minsiter Najib Mikati, who has said the veteran central bank chief should remain in his post while Lebanon battles its economic crisis.

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation is on track to peak at a 30-year high of over 7% in April but differences in forecasts for energy prices and wages mean private-sector economists and the Bank of England are split over what happens next. 
A Reuters poll of economists this week showed inflation plunging back to 2.2% in the three months to June 30 2023, mirroring the sharp fall after inflation last reached this high in Britain in the early 1990s.
But the BoE's Feb. 3 forecast predicts inflation of around 3.5% in Q2 2023, saying it will not fall close to its 2% target until early 2024, citing potentially persistent pressures from energy prices, supply chains and wage demands as the economy emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.
""The gap's been there for a while. But it is particularly stark at the moment,"" said Chris Hare, an economist at HSBC.
Since its first detailed forecasts in 2004, the BoE has never forecast inflation will be so far above its 2% target for so long, squeezing living standards for British households and creating a headache for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government.
These forecasts have played a role in pushing up expectations in financial markets for BoE interest rate rises this year, economists say - even if a closer look at the BoE's message suggests it has no intention of raising Bank Rate to the 2% level that markets have priced in by the end of 2022.
""Market expectations are a little bit too hawkish in the medium term, despite the fact that there's a load of strong inflation to get through between now and then,"" said Hare, who forecasts rates will stay on hold after reaching 1.25% in August.
The BoE estimates consumer price inflation will peak at around 7.25% in April when energy tariffs leap by 54%.
A large part of the gap in inflation forecasts thereafter is based on differences about energy prices.
Most economists use futures markets for the outlook for energy prices which show British natural gas prices almost halving by June next year.
The BoE, by contrast, looks at futures prices only for the next six months and assumes they do not change after that because futures have not always given a good steer on long-term energy price trends.
The BoE's approach to energy prices had been reasonable in the past, but now meant that it was assuming an unprecedented surge in gas prices would prove to be long term, said Benjamin Nabarro, economist at Citi. 
""Clearly, as things stand, they're only capturing one half of what is a very exceptional price move,"" he said.
BoE officials have said inflation could fall a lot faster than their central forecast, possibly to just 1.2% in early 2024 if energy prices follow market expectations just ahead of the BoE's February meeting.
However, Governor Andrew Bailey has also warned of upside risks to energy prices and inflation if tension between Russia and Ukraine escalates.
Other complications include the impact of government measures to reduce the hit to households from energy price rises. Economists do not know if Britain's official statisticians will treat them as price reductions - which would lower inflation - or as a type of income, which would not.
WAGE PRESSURE
Another area of difference is whether high inflation and a tight labour market bring outsize wage demands.
The central bank says businesses it polled expect to raise pay by nearly 5% this year - much higher than increases of about 3% in the main private-sector surveys of employers.
Official figures on Tuesday showed wages rose by an annual 4.3% in the final quarter of 2021 - faster than both the BoE and economists expected, though below inflation.
Bailey this month urged workers to rein in requests for higher pay, drawing criticism from unions.
Surges in 2008 and 2011, when inflation briefly rose above 5%, did not lead to 1970s-style wage spirals.
But the BoE may be wary about extrapolating from lower peaks a decade ago.
""People simply become much more aware, and much more sensitive to changes, when you're talking about inflation that's 7%, rather than 3%,"" Nabarro said.
Citi's own survey has shown the British public's inflation expectations for 12 months' time at their highest since the series began in 2006 - a warning sign for the BoE. 
But Nabarro does not think inflation is likely to get out of control.
The squeeze on disposable income - the steepest in 30 years - will probably curb spending although savings built up by many richer households during the pandemic may keep a flame under inflation.

These uncertainties - alongside big questions about Russia and Ukraine - help explain another gulf, the one between economists' and financial markets' expectations for BoE action this year.
While markets price-in rates climbing to 2% by December, most economists in the Reuters poll see them going no higher than 1%. But the risk is one-way - 83% said rates were likely to rise by more rather than less than they forecast.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve should tighten monetary policy soon and decisively to head off what could become ""quite persistent"" inflation, World Bank Chief Economist Carmen Reinhart told Reuters in an interview.
Reinhart, who has been warning for some time that supply chain shocks could result in sustained inflation in the United States and elsewhere, said any delay by the Fed on increasing interest rates would just prolong the problem.
""If inflation is indeed more persistent, my bottom line on Fed policy is ... that if you do more now, you'll be better (off) than if you do too little, too late,"" Reinhart said ahead of Tuesday's release of the World Bank's World Development Report.
Reinhart said the Fed had been signaling a modest tightening by historical standards but could shift gears given recent data.
""I'm of the view that if the tendency is to delay action and be more circumspect, it's basically just pushing the problem out in the horizon,"" she added.
Reinhart has been arguing for about a year that the increase in inflation is unlikely to be temporary because supply chain shocks have affected commodity prices, transport costs, global shipping and other sectors. Escalating tensions between Ukraine and Russia were exacerbating inflationary pressures that had seen oil prices jump 77% from December 2020 to last month.
""All that is not temporary, and inflation proves very few things in life are permanent, but many are quite persistent,"" she said. 
U.S. Federal Reserve officials remain divided over how aggressively to begin upcoming interest rate increases at their March meeting.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard on Monday reiterated calls for a faster pace of Fed interest rate hikes, but other Fed officials have been less willing to commit to a half-point hike.

In a paper published last week, Reinhart and World Bank economist Clemens von Luckner noted that a more timely and robust response from major central banks would drive up funding costs for emerging markets and developing economies and could worsen existing debt crises.
But they said the longer-term costs of delaying action would be great. Because the United States and other advanced economies failed to tackle inflation quickly during the 1970s, they ultimately needed far more draconian policies, which then triggered the second-largest U.S. recession after World War Two and the debt crisis of developing countries, they wrote.

LONDON (Reuters) -Worries about Ukraine and the removal of help for economies over COVID-19 will challenge markets, which were already showing signs of being overvalued and heading for sharp corrections over coming months, the European Union's securities watchdog said on Tuesday.
The threat of a possible invasion by Russia of Ukraine raises the risk of further bouts of volatility, especially in sectors such as energy and commodities, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said in a report on trends in risks.
""We maintain our assessment of very high market and liquidity risks; high credit, contagion and operational risks; and elevated environmental risks,"" ESMA said.
""Going forward, we continue to see high risks to institutional and retail investors of further – possibly significant – market corrections.""
Western governments have warned Russia that it faces hefty sanctions if it invades Ukraine.
Steffen Kern, head of risk analysis at ESMA, said exposures to Russia varied across the EU, and an escalation in tension would move beyond the energy sector and into commodities like metals.
Exposures in the investment funds sector and derivatives to Russia were, however, limited, Kern said.
""Commodities are high on our monitoring agenda, cyber risk is very high on our monitoring agenda,"" Kern said, adding that ESMA was ready to help deal with any severe market disruptions.
The watchdog is also monitoring how ""zombie"" or highly indebted companies would cope with rises in interest rates.

It is also keeping an eye on higher premiums or ""greeniums"" on bonds which tout their green credentials, even though there are no official sustainability standards or independent checks.
Combating potential ""greenwashing"" or over-inflated green credentials in investments has become a priority for ESMA.

Investing.com -- Markets rally and risk premiums fade as Russia announces that at least some of its troops are returning to base after drills on the Ukrainian border. Stocks are set to open sharply higher, unless the release of U.S. publishes producer price inflation data for January upsets them. The mining industry continues to churn out cash - so much so that Beijing is moving to tamp down iron ore prices. Airbnb and Marriott report earnings, and the American Petroleum Institute puts out its weekly U.S. inventory report. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 15th February.
1. Markets rally on Russian pull-back
European stocks and U.S. futures rallied along with high-yielding currencies, after Russia’s Defense Ministry said that some of the 100,000+ troops involved in exercises on the border with Ukraine would return to their bases.
The comments were accompanied by video purportedly showing tank formations and heavy equipment moving away from their previous positions on the Ukrainian border. They followed a carefully orchestrated televised meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday, at which the two agreed to a continuation of diplomatic engagement.
Elsewhere, however, Russia published a draft of a new law that would recognize the breakaway republics in eastern Ukraine that were set up after Russia invaded in 2014. That would be a natural prelude to incorporating them into the Russian Federation, as it did with Crimea at the time.
2. PPI to test market's nerve
With the threat of war off the table, attention can return to the more prosaic but still concerning issue of inflation. The U.S. will publish its producer price index for January at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), with expectations that the pace of price increases picked up again to 0.5% from 0.3% in December.
December’s print had been the weakest in over a year, prompting hopes that the sequence of strong monthly price increases might be coming to an end. Sustained high energy prices, along with a string of announcements in recent weeks by companies saying they intend to pass on price increases in the coming months, may yet frustrate those hopes.
The annual PPI, a more backward-looking measure, is expected to slow to 9.1% from 9.7% last month. Separately, the New York Empire State Manufacturing index for February - due for release at the same time – is expected to bounce back from January’s Covid-hit low.
3. Stocks set to open sharply higher
U.S. stock markets are set to open sharply higher later in relief at the news out of Russia, but will remain sensitive to the ongoing stream of corporate earnings.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 368 points, or 1.1%, whle S&P 500 futures were up 0.5% and NASDAQ 100 futures were up 1.9%.
It’s a busy day for earnings, with Marriott, Ecolab (NYSE:ECL) and Iqvia all due to report early, alongside Fidelity National Info (NYSE:FIS). The more exciting releases, arguably, come after the close, with Airbnb,  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), CF Industries (NYSE:CF) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) all due to give their take on themes from high oil prices to the recovery in the travel and entertainment industries.
Also in focus will be Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), reported to be chasing Israel-based chipmaker Tower as a consolation prize after missing out on GlobalFoundries.
4. China’s zig-zag policy hits iron ore; miners churn out cash
There were already some interesting reports overnight from the mining sector, with BHP and Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) both churning out cash at near-record rates. BHP (NYSE:BHP) said it will pay out a record $7.6 billion in dividends for the first half of its fiscal year, while Glencore announced dividends and buybacks totaling $4 billion.
Glencore stock rose 1.9% after the mining and commodity trading giant also said it will set aside $1.5 billion to cover litigation costs from a multi-jurisdiction investigation into suspected bribery, drawing something of a line under a long-running problem for the stock. It's also selling a long-held stake in Russian oil producer Russneft.
However, commodity markets eased along with fears of supply disruption from Russia, while Iron ore already tumbled through an important support level after China’s government warned against ‘speculation’ and ‘hoarding’.

5. Oil slumps as war fears recede
Crude oil prices fell by nearly $3 a barrel as the geopolitical risk premium that had accumulated over the last week largely evaporated.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 3.0% at $92.61 a barrel, while Brent crude was down 2.8% at $93.81 a barrel.
The slightly more relaxed new state of affairs will allow the market to focus on U.S. supply data when the American Petroleum Institute publishes its weekly inventory report at 4:30 PM ET. Analysts expect a drop of some 1.8 million barrels from last week."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House will announce on Tuesday a new task force to promote use of construction materials with lower lifecycle emissions as it works to speed U.S. government purchases of greener products.
The move comes after President Joe Biden said in December that the government, which buys goods and services worth more than $650 billion each year, planned to cut its emissions by 65% by 2030, on the path to net zero emissions by 2050.
The multi-agency ""Buy Clean Task Force"" is being set up to help ""create markets for low carbon materials,"" by the Council on Environmental Quality and White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, an administration official told reporters.
It will recommend ways to boost federal purchases of clean building materials and identify materials, such as steel and concrete, as well as pollutants to prioritise for consideration in federal government purchases.
Construction is a significant source of global C02 emissions. Production of cement, the main ingredient of concrete, accounted for 7% of global CO2 emissions in 2019, the International Energy Agency estimates.
The General Services Administration, the government's landlord, will issue information requests on Tuesday focused on concrete and asphalt as it writes national low-carbon standards for Land Port of Entry projects.
The Transportation Department will also unveil new efforts to boost use of low-carbon materials in federal projects.
In his December executive order https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/08/executive-order-on-catalyzing-clean-energy-industries-and-jobs-through-federal-sustainability, Biden said the government, as the nation's ""single largest land owner, energy consumer and employer,"" can transform ""how we build, buy and manage electricity, vehicles, buildings and other operations to be clean and sustainable.""
He also aims to end government purchases of gas-powered vehicles by 2035. The federal government will seek to consume electricity only from carbon-free and non-polluting sources on a net annual basis by 2030.

The White House urged the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) this month to reconsider a plan to buy a new multibillion-dollar fleet of primarily gasoline-powered delivery vehicles.
The agency has said it does not plan to buy significantly more EVs without additional government funding.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The accounting firm that handled Donald Trump's company's financial statements dropped it as a client and said it could no longer stand behind a decade of statements, a court filing showed on Monday.
Mazars USA, in a Feb. 9 letter made public on Monday, told the Trump Organization, the former president's New York-based real estate business, that its financial statements for 2011 through 2020 should no longer be relied on.
The disclosure was made as part of New York Attorney General Letitia James' civil investigation into the Trump Organization, which could result in financial penalties. That probe partially overlaps a criminal investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney, which James joined in May, into the company's practices.
Mazars said it had based its conclusion on a January filing by the New York attorney general, its own investigation and information from internal and external sources. 
""While we have not concluded that the various financial statements, as a whole, contain material discrepancies, based upon the totality of the circumstances we believe our advice to you to no longer rely upon those financial statements is appropriate,"" Mazars said in the letter addressed to the chief legal officer at the Trump Organization, Alan Garten.
In the letter, filed in New York state court, Mazars said that it had ""performed its work in accordance with professional standards.""
The accounting firm also said it would no longer work for the Trump Organization. 
New York state's attorney general has accused the Trump Organization of repeatedly misrepresenting the value of its assets to obtain financial benefits.
A Trump Organization spokesperson said in a statement the company is ""disappointed that Mazars has chosen to part ways."" But the spokesperson added the letter confirms that ""Mazars' work was performed in accordance with all applicable accounting standards and principles"" and that the statements of financial condition ""do not contain any material discrepancies."" 
The New York attorney general filed the Mazars letter in support of its efforts to compel the production of outstanding documents from Trump and his company as well as testimony by him and two of his adult children, Donald Trump Jr. And Ivanka Trump.
In a memorandum also filed on Monday, the attorney general noted media reports that Trump had destroyed documents covered by the Presidential Records Act and wants him to supply a sworn statement on whether the files produced for her probe are complete and how they may have been destroyed and by whom.
Trump has decried the probe as political. 
In Monday's filing, James' office said the accounting firm's statement and actions further supported the legitimacy of the investigation.

James has been investigating whether the Trumps inflated real estate values to obtain bank loans, and reduced values to lower tax bills. In one example, she said Trump's annual financial statements said an apartment he personally owned in Trump Tower was 30,000 square feet(2,787 square meters), when it was in fact a third that size.
Neither Trump nor his children have been accused of criminal wrongdoing.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Major aircraft lessor Avolon is gearing to tackle possible disruptions to business with Russia and is concerned about whether sanctions against the country would affect international payment transfers, its chief executive said on Tuesday.
U.S. officials have warned that Moscow could launch an attack on Ukraine after massing more than 100,000 troops close to its neighbour's border, with the West preparing heavy sanctions.
Avolon is focused on ensuring that airlines flying over the region are fully insured from a risk-management perspective, Chief Executive Domhnal Slattery told Reuters on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow.
If sanctions are slapped on Russia, he added, ""My biggest concern is the sanctions are on SWIFT, so international payment transfers.""
""So we're focused on ensuring how do we get around that from the payment of our rentals perspective,"" Slattery said.
Privately held Avolon has fewer than 20 airplanes in Russia and one or two in Ukraine, out of a total fleet of more than 550 aircraft, Slattery said.

The company is working with a customer in Ukraine to relocate the aircraft to a more neutral territory, but is waiting to see how the situation develops before deciding whether to move its planes out of Russia.
""A bad situation in Ukraine is not good for anybody,"" Slattery added.

PARIS/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Airlines and the leasing companies that control billions of dolllars' worth of passenger jets are drawing up contingency plans for a freeze in business with Russia if the standoff on Ukraine's border boils over into a military conflict.
U.S. officials have warned that Moscow could launch an attack on Ukraine after amassing more than 100,000 troops close to its neighbour's border, with the West preparing heavy sanctions.
Aviation bosses are worried about the impact on dealings with Russian companies. Sanctions could disrupt payments to leasing firms, and any retaliatory move by Moscow to restrict access to Russian airspace might throw east-west trade into chaos.
""We are expecting an asymmetrical Russian response,"" said a Western source involved in drawing up scenarios, adding the West was unlikely to restrict its own airspace first.
Air corridors between parts of Europe or North America and Asia stretch across Russia, making its 26 million square km (10 million square miles) of airspace a vital trade intersection.
Cargo is particularly active. U.S. carrier FedEx (NYSE:FDX) said on Monday it was making unspecified contingency plans.
Without access to Russia's airways, experts say airlines face having to divert flights south while avoiding areas of tension in the Middle East - adding significant cost at a time when airlines are reeling from the pandemic.
According to some reports, the crisis has resurrected the Cold War prospect of European jets heading over North America to refuel in Anchorage, then dropping down to destinations such as Tokyo, pushing the economics of such flights to the limit.
So far, Alaska's largest airport has not been contacted by any airline exploring that option, which would require an increase in ground-handling capacity, a spokesperson said. 
But the scenario is a reminder that Russia's size and position on the aviation map gives it leverage not available to the Soviet Union when economies were less integrated, according to Elisabeth Braw, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
""So far, Moscow hasn't threatened to revoke overflight rights, but knows it has a phenomenal weapon at its disposal,"" Braw wrote in a column in Defense One last month.
Even short of formal retaliation, experts say the impact on crucial Russian overflights is hard to predict.
""Every one of those operations requires advance clearance and that's not always routinely granted. And there's every reason to believe that if things got serious some of those requests could just go unanswered,"" analyst Robert Mann said.
LESSOR CONCERNS
Russia's 8,000 air traffic controllers handled 194,296 transit flights, or 532 overflights a day, on average in 2021. 
That's up 16% from coronavirus-depressed levels in 2020 but still 37% below pre-crisis traffic in 2019, according to the Federal Agency for Air Transport.
""It would be devastating in normal circumstances, but Asia traffic is lower than normal,"" the Western source said.
Analysts say Russia earns significant fees from overflights.
As tensions rose in recent months, U.S. airlines raised concerns that Russia could refuse to extend overflights, disrupting connections to Asia, India and the Middle East.
If there is an emergency, we have no choice but to avoid Russia and fly the southern route,"" said Yuji Hirako, president and chief executive of All Nippon Airways Co Ltd. ""Since the demand for international flights is so low due to the coronavirus pandemic, we may choose not to fly in the event of an emergency.""
In October, U.S. carriers asked the State Department to ""act urgently"" to secure additional rights to overfly Russia, according to a trade group's letter seen by Reuters. U.S. officials are expected to meet the carriers within days.
For the aircraft leasing industry, Russia has until now been a relative bright spot, as airlines have largely kept up with payments during the pandemic, one leasing company executive said.
Even as some airlines began avoiding Ukraine on Monday, leasing companies were eyeing larger risks in Russia.
Domhnal Slattery, chief executive of lessor Avolon, said his biggest concern was the potential for sanctions involving SWIFT, which would disrupt international payment transfers.
""So we're focused on ensuring of how do we get around that from the payment of our rentals perspective,"" he said.
Russian companies have 980 passenger jets in service, of which 777 are leased, according to analytics firm Cirium.

Of these, two thirds, or 515 jets, with an estimated market value of about $10 billion, are rented from foreign firms.
""If there are sanctions on dealing with Russian companies, this could affect more than 500 aircraft if no exemptions are allowed,"" said Rob Morris, head consultant at Ascend by Cirium.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will raise its deposit rate in the second half of this year, and not wait until 2023 as previously expected, according to a Reuters poll of economists who also sharply upgraded their inflation forecasts for this year. 
The change in view followed a shift in the ECB Governing Council to concerns about consumer price inflation, rising rapidly across much of the world and which hit a record high of 5.1% in the 19-member euro zone in January on a year earlier.
While a majority of ECB watchers polled between Feb. 7 and 14 expected the central bank to lift the deposit rate to -0.25% by end-year from a record low of -0.50%, financial markets are already pricing in a return to zero by that time.
Even that would leave the ECB well behind the U.S. Federal Reserve, expected to raise its federal funds rate from a range of 0%-0.25% in March, possibly by half a point, with some banks expecting as many as seven Fed rate rises by the end of 2022. 
Poll respondents were split on when the first ECB rate rise would take place, with one economist expecting a move in the second quarter, 16 of 51 forecasting a hike in Q3, and another 21 expecting it to come in Q4.
A quarter of respondents, 13 of 51, still see no deposit rate rise this year, and only about 20%, or 11 of 51, expect it to reach zero at any point in 2022.
""Given the underlying inflation outlook and the risks the ECB is juggling, tightening is likely to be gradual and moderate, and the size of recent market moves still look overdone to us,"" wrote Simon Wells, chief European economist at HSBC, in a note to clients. 
Graphic: Reuters poll graphic on euro zone inflation and interest rates- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/jnpwelowbpw/Reuters%20poll%20graphic%20on%20euro%20zone%20inflation%20and%20interest%20rates.PNG 
The ECB is meanwhile widely expected to end its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme in March. More than two-thirds of respondents, or 31 of 45, also said the parallel Asset Purchase Programme, launched before the pandemic, will be shuttered by September.
Disruptions related to the Omicron variant wave of COVID-19 infections slowed euro zone economic growth to 0.3% last quarter. It was barely expected to pick up from there this quarter to 0.4%.
Growth was then expected to accelerate to a peak of 1.2% in Q2 before slowing to 1.0% and 0.7% in Q3 and Q4, respectively. In the January poll, those numbers were 0.5%, 1.1%, 0.9%, and 0.6%.
The economy was forecast to grow 3.9% on average this year, versus 4.0% in last month's poll. It was then forecast to clock 2.5% next year, slightly up from the 2.4% predicted in January.
Euro zone inflation was forecast to average 3.8% this year and fall below the ECB's 2% target to 1.8% in 2023 versus 3.0% and 1.7% predicted in January.
On a quarterly basis, inflation was predicted to average 5.1% and 4.7% this quarter and next. It was then forecast at 3.9% and 2.7% for Q3 and Q4, respectively.
A like-for-like analysis showed more than 80% of nearly 20 economists had revised those inflation forecasts up by at least one-fifth on average.
Over 80% of respondents, or 34 of 42, said inflation would peak this quarter.

""We expect inflation to fall again quite sharply over the next few quarters, and so it will be very unlikely the ECB will hike rates every quarter next year,"" said Martin Weder, senior economist at ZKB, the most accurate forecaster for the euro zone economy in Reuters polls for 2021 according to Refinitiv Starmine.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Philippine central bank will wait until the end of the year before raising interest rates from a record low 2.0% to support an uneven economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, a Reuters poll found.
With inflation remaining subdued compared to advanced economies and growth in the Southeast Asian nation yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) will stick to its dovish stance.
All 21 economists in a Feb. 1-14 poll predicted the BSP would leave its benchmark rate at 2.0% at its Feb. 17 meeting.
That was in line with Governor Benjamin Diokno's view monetary policy would remain accommodative as long as required to underpin growth and not necessarily follow the U.S. Federal Reserve which is expected to raise rates next month.
While the Fed's last monetary policy tightening cycle led to heavy capital outflows in emerging economies leaving local currencies considerably weaker, economists do not predict a repeat this time.
""We don't expect any changes in policy from BSP, at least for now. Governor Diokno stepped up his dovish rhetoric after inflation moderated in January, indicating that he did not want to 'change course' in the middle of a recovery,"" wrote Robert Carnell, regional head of research for Asia-Pacific at ING.
""However, the dovish BSP stance against the backdrop of a hawkish Fed could translate into additional pressure on the Philippine peso in the near term.""
The Philippine peso has been relatively stable this year, depreciating only about 1% against the U.S. dollar. A Reuters poll taken early last month showed the peso would hover around the current rate this year. [EMRG/POLL]
The central bank was expected to raise its key interest rate to 2.50% towards the end of 2022, followed by 25 basis points in the second quarter of 2023 and another 25 basis points in the July-September quarter, taking rates to 3.00%.
Almost half, seven of 15 respondents, forecast a rate hike of at least 25 basis points by the end of the third quarter, including three who said it would come as early as April-June.

Still, most respondents in the poll said the central bank would be on a wait-and-watch mode before changing gears.
That cautious approach echoes the stance of a few other central banks in Asia, including the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank of Thailand who were expected to maintain an accommodative stance rather than trying to calm inflation.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank is closer to meeting its economic goals than it has been for years, but is prepared to be patient on policy as wage growth continues to lag even as inflation picks up.
Minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) February meeting released on Tuesday showed its Board was yet to be convinced that the acceleration in inflation would be sustained and wanted to see wages respond before moving on interest rates.
""The Board is prepared to be patient as it monitors how the various factors affecting inflation in Australia evolve,"" the minutes showed.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe last week said it was plausible a rate rise could come later this year should the economy continue to beat expectations, a shift from former guidance that a move in 2022 was highly unlikely.
Investors are wagering on a hike as early as June given how inflationary pressures are building across the globe. Markets are fully priced for the 0.1% cash rate to rise to 0.25% in June, and to reach 1.25% by Christmas.
The economy did hit a speed bump in January as the rapid spread of the Omicron variant curbed consumer mobility, but spending has since recovered as cases leveled off.
The labour market remains tight with unemployment at a 13-year low of 4.2% and vacancies at record highs.
Wage growth has picked up somewhat to 2.2% but is still running at less than half the pace of the United States or UK and policymakers would prefer to see it up at 3.0% or more before withdrawing stimulus.
""After a long period of below target inflation, the RBA seems keen to run the economy 'hot' for a while,"" said HSBC's chief economist for Australia, Paul Bloxham.

""In particular, the RBA wants to reset inflation and wage expectations, such that wage rises of 3-4% become the norm, after many years of wages growth averaging 2%.""
He expects the first rate hike in the third quarter of this year, with another before year end.

He added that Suriname had shown commitment towards reducing inflation and maintaining a free floating-market determined exchange rate.
The country will soon submit a revised 2022 budget to the National Assembly that aims for a primary surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP, higher cash transfers for the country's most vulnerable and higher electricity rates.

When asked if a victory of the left-wing leader was already priced into financial markets, Campos Neto told an O Globo columnist that some market prices were showing an ""elimination"" of the risk of a government transition.
""It means that the market has become less afraid of passing from one government to another. This is what we can interpret. Because probably a government that represented a risk of more extreme measures is moving to the center. This is our interpretation from what we capture in market prices,"" he said, according to the columnist.
The central bank did not immediately respond to a request to verify the quotes.
Lula, a leftist former union leader and president from 2003 to 2010, holds a healthy lead in opinion polls over right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro ahead of the October election. 
In the remarks published to the O Globo website on Monday ahead of an airing of the interview on TV channel Globo News, Campos Neto also highlighted the importance of a law shielding the central bank from presidential influence. 
Under the law approved last year, Campos Neto will remain in charge for at least two years of the next four-year presidential term.

Last month, Lula also played down concerns about traditional left-wing concerns about central bank independence, saying that the institution had to be committed to Brazil, not to him.
The former president's more conciliatory stance led some investors to bet on more pragmatic economic policies under a possible Lula government, helping to draw a surge of financial inflows to Brazil so far this year.

WINDSOR, Ontario/WASHINGTON/OTTAWA (Reuters) -North America's busiest trade link reopened for traffic late Sunday evening, ending a six-day blockade, Canada Border Services Agency said, after Canadian police cleared the protesters fighting to end COVID-19 restrictions.
Canadian police made several arrests on Sunday and cleared protesters and vehicles that occupied the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario, after a court order on Friday.
The blockade https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/truckers-ambassador-bridge-perfect-spot-threaten-us-canada-trade-2022-02-11 had choked the supply chain for Detroit's carmakers, forcing Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, the second-largest U.S. automaker, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp to cut production.
The bridge carries about $360 million a day in two-way cargoes - 25% of the value of all U.S.-Canada goods trade.
A Windsor Police official told reporters that 20 to 30 arrests had been made. Police also seized vehicles within the demonstration area, according to an earlier statement.
Police stepped up their presence on Sunday with more than 50 vehicles, including cruisers, buses and an armoured car, as the number of protesters dropped to around 45 from roughly 100 on Saturday. Windsor Police tweeted ""there will be zero tolerance for illegal activity"". 
In Ottawa, counter protests started blocking vehicles trying to join the protests on Sunday, with residents losing patience over the three-week-old demonstrations. 
In the western Canadian province of British Columbia, the Pacific highway border crossing in Surrey was temporarily closed on Sunday afternoon, for a second day, by a group of about 200 protesters, according to a Reuters photographer on the scene. A small group of protesters gathered on U.S. side of the border, blocking incoming vehicles.
The ""Freedom Convoy"" protests https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/how-ottawas-anti-vaccine-mandate-protests-are-spreading-globally-2022-02-09, started in the national capital Ottawa by Canadian truckers opposing a vaccinate-or-quarantine mandate for cross-border drivers, entered its 17th day on Sunday. But it has now morphed into a rallying point against broader COVID-19 curbs, carbon tax and other issues, with people joining in cars, pick-up trucks and farm vehicles.
""We’re fed up, we’re tired. We want Ottawa to be boring again,” said an Ottawa resident at a counter protest in front of the city’s police headquarters. 
The Canadian government had discussed whether to invoke special emergency powers https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-canada-emergency-f-idCAKBN21442M to deal with the protests in the capital, Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair told CBC News on Sunday. Blair said the lack of police enforcement in Ottawa was ""inexplicable."" 
The rarely used Emergencies Act would allow the federal government to override the provinces and authorize special temporary measures to ensure security during national emergencies anywhere in the country. It has only been used once in peacetime - by Trudeau's father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau - in 1970.
Strangling bilateral trade, protests have spread to three border points, including in Alberta and Manitoba. Canadian police have said the protests have been partly funded by U.S. supporters, and Ontario froze funds donated via one U.S. platform GiveSendGo on Thursday.
The estimated loss so far from the blockades to the auto industry alone could be as high as $850 million, based on IHS Markit's data, which puts the 2021 daily flow in vehicles and parts at $141.1 million a day.

""Today, our national economic crisis at the Ambassador Bridge came to an end,"" Windsor City Mayor Drew Dilkens said in a tweet. 
In Europe, a convoy of 150 cars protesting COVID-19 restrictions left Paris on Sunday morning and headed towards Brussels, protesters told Reuters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. short-term interest rate futures on Monday reflected a reduced chance of an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve before its two-day March policy meeting.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, a voter on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, told Bloomberg last Thursday that he was open to the idea of an inter-meeting interest rate hike. 
He did not repeat that notion in an interview with CNBC on Monday, however. Instead, he doubled down on the need for 100 basis points or a full percentage point of policy-tightening by July 1, slightly faster than he suggested before. That implies at least one hike of a half-percentage point at one of those meetings instead of the quarter-point increases that the Fed used in recent years.
In early afternoon trading on Monday, futures on the fed funds rate using February contracts implied just a 3% chance of a rate hike of 25 basis points by the Fed before the March meeting. That was as high as 30% on Thursday after Bullard spoke.
Similarly, futures on the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, factored in just a 2% chance of an inter-meeting move on Monday, using February contracts as well, down from a 16% chance factored in late last week. 
The debate on any move between meetings was made irrelevant by the Fed's release late on Friday of the schedule for its final month of asset purchases. Fed officials have said the U.S. central bank was unlikely to tighten rates before the conclusion of its bond buying program.
""An inter-meeting rate hike was never a likely outcome,"" wrote Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson, in a research note.
""The primary goal of an emergency move in between meetings is to shore up confidence and staunch any financial market bleeding that might lead to further economic damage. That is why most inter-meeting moves are rate cuts rather than rate hikes.""

He added that an argument might be made for a move between meetings if long-term inflation expectations were getting out of control. But the University Michigan's 5-to-10-year inflation expectations, which held steady at 3.1% in the early February report, dispelled that.
""With long-term inflation expectations well within the range of recent decades, there is nothing obvious to be gained by appearing to panic,"" Crandall said.

(Reuters) - The unprecedented level of job switching seen last year as the U.S. labor market rebounded from the pandemic gave workers more leverage to ask for better pay and played a role in pushing inflation to its highest level in decades, a new study suggests. 
An increase in the share of people who searched for jobs while they were employed helped boost inflation by about 1 percentage point throughout much of last year, according to a paper released on Monday by the Chicago Federal Reserve. That suggests job-switching at times accounted for roughly 20% of the price growth seen in 2021. 
Graphic: Inflationary consequences of job searching = https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/QUITS-INFLATION/jnpweloabpw/chart.png 
""Workers' propensity to search for another job is an important driver of inflation,"" said Leonardo Melosi, a senior economist for the Chicago Fed and a co-author of the report.
People who search for new work while they still have a job can end up with higher salaries - and more spending power - after switching jobs or receiving a raise from their current employer, the researchers said.
Job switching took off last year as job postings soared and the number of people quitting reached record levels. Nearly 4 million Americans on average quit their jobs each month last year - often in search of better pay or more flexibility. 
Graphic: Wave of workplace turnover - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/QUITS/lgpdwxnrnvo/chart.png 
Fed officials are under greater pressure to combat higher inflation after data released last week showed that consumer prices posted their largest annual gain in 40 years. Watching what happens to the trend some analysts have dubbed the Great Resignation could offer a hint on the future path of price increases, Melosi said. 

If job-switching dies down as the pandemic recedes, that could help to ease inflationary pressures. But if people continue to change jobs in search of better pay or new opportunities, those inflationary pressures could continue, researchers said. 
Still, labor market turnover will not be the only factor influencing inflation, Melosi said, noting that supply-chain disruptions and other factors are larger drivers.

195,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 12:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde faced a backlash in the European Parliament on Monday from conservative lawmakers criticising the ECB's green strategy as a ""distraction"" from its duty to tame inflation.
Lagarde has made joining the fight against climate change a key goal and the ECB pledged https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/ecb-ramps-up-its-role-tacking-climate-change-2021-07-08 last year to take greater account of the environment in core policy decisions, such as which bonds to buy in its multi-trillion-euro stimulus programme.
But ahead of a vote on the ECB's annual report on Tuesday, lawmakers from the European People's Party were taking exception to what they saw as a foray into a policy area beyond the ECB's remit, especially when inflation is running high.
The ECB is independent of parliament, but lawmakers' objections may weigh down an already slow-moving debate on the euro zone central bank's climate role and strengthen the reservations of some conservative rate-setters.
""The ECB's primary mandate is ensuring price stability, which at the moment the ECB is not doing a great job at,"" German lawmaker Markus Ferber said in an emailed statement to Reuters. ""Everything else such as the 'green shift' is simply a distraction from achieving that primary mandate.""
In her address to the Parliament's plenary on Monday, Lagarde said the ECB's ""climate change action plan"" was on track.
This includes spelling out by the end of the year what information companies will be required to disclose for their bonds to qualify for the ECB's purchases.
BACKDOOR
But Ferber said such changes were ""nothing less than an extension of the ECB’s mandate through the backdoor"" and required changing the EU's treaties.
He and colleague Georgios Kyrtsos have tabled several amendments to paragraphs relating to the ECB's climate strategy in a report by the Parliament up for vote on Tuesday.
In one amendment, they insisted the ECB should stick to ""market neutrality"", that is buying bonds in proportion to the outstanding amount. This would implicitly close the door to buying more ""green"" debt and fewer bonds from highly polluting companies.

""Ferber and Kyrtsos' attempt to reinstate explicit European Parliament support for the principle of market neutrality would be a major step back in the debate on green monetary policy,"" said Alessia Del Vasto, advocacy officer at campaign group Positive Money Europe.
Ferber said environmental goals should not be pursued via monetary tools and the ECB would ""create distortions"" by ""only or predominantly buying green bonds"", because that market was still small.

In remarks nearly identical to her comments a week ago, Lagarde said that inflation risks are skewed to the upside but the ECB aims to maintain flexibility and policy decisions in March will depend on incoming data.
""Any adjustment to our policy will be gradual,"" Lagarde told the European Parliament's plenary session in Strasbourg. ""We need more than ever to maintain flexibility and optionality in the conduct of monetary policy"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Federal Reserve officials continued sparring over how aggressively to begin upcoming interest rate increases at their March meeting, with a final inflation reading just ahead of the two-day session taking on potentially outsized importance.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard on Monday reiterated calls for a faster pace of Fed interest rate hikes, saying that four strong inflation reports in a row warranted more aggressive action and that the central bank needed to ""ratify"" market expectations about its upcoming moves.
Bullard, who himself helped shape those expectations with calls last week for a 50 basis point increase at the Fed's March meeting, said on CNBC that the Fed's ""credibility is on the line"" in its quest to bring inflation down from the current 40-year high of more than 7%.
""It was really October, November, December, January that called into question any idea that this inflation was naturally going to moderate in any reasonable time frame without the Fed taking action,"" said Bullard, again calling for a full percentage point of Fed rate increases by July 1. That implies at least one hike of a half percentage point at one of the three meetings between now and then instead of the quarter point increases that the Fed has used in recent years.
As he spoke bond yields again rose and recent market volatility continued. The 10-year Treasury rose back above 2%, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 200 points by late morning. 
Other Fed officials have been less willing to commit to a half-point hike, or were even concerned it could cause trouble.
In an interview on SiriusXM radio Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said it was ""timely"" to begin raising interest rates but said the specifics will depend on how inflation moves in upcoming reports.
“Will it settle back down to levels more like the levels we have seen over the last 30 years or will it not settle?” Barkin said. “Depending on the answer you could adjust your pace or your timing.”
Kansas City Fed President Esther George said in a Wall Street Journal interview that she wanted a ""systematic"" plan to tighten monetary policy, but was not convinced it needed to start with a 50 basis point increase.
“It is always preferable to go gradual,"" George said. ""Given where we are, the uncertainties around the pandemic effects and other things, I’d be hard-pressed to say we have got to get to neutral really fast,” an aim that would dictate larger and more frequent rate increases.
On Sunday, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said if the Fed is too ""abrupt and aggressive"" it could ""have a destabilizing effect on the very growth and price stability that we're trying to achieve.""
Daly told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that after raising rates in March the Fed could even consider pausing at its next meeting to evaluate the economy, a contrast to the steady increases Bullard feels will be appropriate at the Fed's March, May and June sessions. 
STAYING NIMBLE
With the Fed promising what it calls a ""nimble"" approach to policy after so many pandemic-era surprises, the ultimate decision may rest on the details of the final consumer inflation report, due on March 10, that the central bank will receive ahead of its meeting on the 15th and 16th of the month.
That report will show whether, as some Fed officials say they hope and expect, the month-to-month change in prices is easing, something several have said would allow them to tighten policy at a slower pace. 
None of the Fed's governors, and most notably Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have spoken publicly to the matter since the central bank's last meeting in January.
Bullard said he would defer to Powell on the sequencing of coming rate increases. But he also said the Fed at this point needed to ""follow through"" on what markets anticipate, and in effect lock in the tighter financial conditions seen for example in rising interest rates for two-year Treasury notes.

Powell is ""very good at managing the committee,"" Bullard said. But ""the Fed has to follow through and ratify those expectations that have been built into the two year, and if we don't then it makes it appear that we are not defending"" the 2% inflation target. Since the Fed began planning tighter monetary policy last fall the yield on the two-year note has risen from near zero to 1.6% as of Monday morning, roughly where it was before the pandemic. 
""I think my position is a good one and I will try to convince my colleagues,"" said Bullard, a voting member on Fed policy this year.

198,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 11:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders are upping their bets that Federal Reserve policy makers will be forced to cut rates from the end of 2023 onwards -- after tightening policy in earnest with a supersized rate hike in the coming months. 
In the eurodollar futures markets, the spread between the December 2023 and December 2025 contracts has dropped further into negative territory on Monday -- implying a near-25 basis point cut in the federal funds benchmark over this 24-month timeframe. 
At the same time, traders in the front-end of the U.S. rates market are ever-more convinced that the central bank’s tightening cycle will be swift -- but over well before the central bank is forecasting. 
Market participants are pricing three 25 basis-point hikes by May -- implying a 50 basis-points increase at one of the next two meetings -- with rates peaking at just 200 basis points in the middle of 2023. 
The so-called terminal rate, or the level at which the economy should cruise along without needing policy changes to speed it up or slow it down, has remained far below the central bank’s median forecast of 250 basis points, with the latter confirmed by the Fed’s latest projections known as the dot plot.
Further out the Treasuries curve, the spread between the 7- and 10-year notes remains inverted after dropping as low as minus 2.5 basis points Friday. That has prompted strategists to look for the next inversion in the U.S. Treasuries curve.
On Monday, an early curve flattening move was sparked by more comments from St. Louis Fed President Bullard, who reiterated his market-moving pronouncement Thursday that he’d like to see the policy rate 100 basis points higher by July.
All told, the ever-flatter yield curve and bets on rate cuts are both signals that the U.S. central bank will be forced to ease policy to boost economic growth down the road.

199,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 11:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumers don’t expect red-hot inflation levels to last in the long term.
That’s the takeaway from the January consumer survey from Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which showed that the median one-year-ahead inflation expectations fell for the first time since October 2020, to 5.8%. The outlook over three years dropped even more sharply, and the decline was broad-based across age, education and income.
In a separate analysis of data from the survey and from the University of Michigan’s sentiment index, New York Fed economists concluded that consumers seem to recognize the unusual nature of the current bout of high inflation.
“This result suggests that while consumers are highly attuned to current inflation news in updating their short-term inflation expectations, they are taking less signal than before the pandemic from the recent sharp movements in realized inflation when revising their three-year-ahead expectations,” the economists said in a blog post. 
 
All products and services surveyed by the New York Fed declined in January, including the year-ahead price changes for food, rent, gas, medical care, college education and gold. The survey also showed that the median households is expecting one-year-ahead earnings growth to rise by 3%, the same as last month. Last year, an average gain of 2.6% was expected. 
The median three-year ahead inflation expectations decreased by 0.5 percentage point to 3.5%.
Last week, the Labor Department published data that showed consumer price rose 7.5% in January from a year earlier, the biggest increase in decades. Persisting high inflation has led has led the central bank to pivot toward a tighter monetary stance to help cool off prices.
The Fed‘s next policy meeting is set for March 15-16, and some economists are calling on the central bank to make an aggressive, half-point increase to signal its determination to contain rising prices.
While inflation is expected to return to more manageable levels, the so-called misery rate, the combination of inflation and unemployment will take some time to be reduced.
A Bloomberg News survey of economists finds that the misery-rate will return to levels seen in early 2020 by early 2023.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Emerging markets must brace for monetary tightening in the United States and Europe while central banks must be clearer in their policy communication to avoid confusion, financial leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies are likely to warn this week.
G20 finance ministers and central bank governors are to meet on Feb 17-18 in Jakarta. Global divergences in the post-pandemic recovery, a global corporate tax and financing the fight against climate change will be at the top of their agenda.
""I think the most important discussion will be on inflation developments,"" one European G20 official involved in preparations for the meeting said.
Asked what the G20 message could be, he said: ""The formula that will be agreed is that central banks in advanced countries are mindful of potential spillovers to emerging markets and developing countries and they will have well calibrated policies and communication about it.""
""And at the same time I think emerging markets will say that they're working towards increasing their resilience from financial markets,"" the official said.
With inflation in the United States at multi-decade highs and at a record level in the 19 countries sharing the euro, both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have signalled they would be tightening policy through diminishing bond purchases and rate hikes.
But this could trigger an outflow of capital from emerging markets like Brazil, South Africa, or Russia, leading to their currency depreciating, higher interest rates and a more difficult recovery, the International Monetary Fund has warned.
CLEAR CENTRAL BANK COMMUNICATION
Communicating central bank policy is also a challenge, as an unexpected change in messaging from the ECB last week caught markets by surprise. While the U.S. Federal Reserve in January clearly telegraphed a March interest rate hike, the pace of what is to follow is clouded.
The G20 are likely to call on the Fed, the ECB and other major central banks to tell markets as clearly as possible what they intend to prevent sudden market swings.
""Transparent and clear monetary policy communication by major central banks remains important for the global economy, price stability and financial stability,"" said a document with the agreed position of European G20 members, seen by Reuters.
To address the potential spill-overs to emerging markets of tighter monetary policy in the U.S. and Europe the IMF called in January for emerging economies to start working on defences now, reducing levels of debt in foreign currencies, hedging exposure, extending maturities to cut roll-over risk and prepare for bankruptcies of banks and companies.
The same message is likely to come from the G20 meeting this week, the European document showed.
""(G20) members, notably emerging markets and developing economies, should continue ... efforts to reduce vulnerabilities in order to be able to withstand a tightening of international financing conditions,"" it said.

201,"<span>Feb 14, 2022 09:16AM ET</span>","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Global trade bottlenecks are more the result of demand spikes than supply chain snags, with pressure likely to ease in the coming months, the World Trade Organization's chief economist said on Monday.
The WTO had thought in October that demand for goods would slow early in 2022. However, that was before the Omicron variant of coronavirus led to curbs on activity, including the postponement of the WTO's ministerial meeting.
Chief economist Robert Koopman said consumers had then continued to skew spending towards goods rather than services given they could not or preferred not to dine out or go on holiday.
Koopman said that for goods trade, excess demand likely explained two-thirds to three-quarters of apparent shortages.
""It still remains that this compositional shift in demand supported by the appropriately aggressive, quick fiscal and monetary policies, has resulted in this outcome where lots of people write about supply-chain disruptions,"" he told Reuters. 
Supply disruption was, he said, more obvious in the automotive sector, or for shippers adjusting to a production shift from China to the likes of Vietnam, Malaysia or Indonesia. 
Koopman said leading U.S. indicators such as back-ups of ships at ports and prices of used cars were tapering and throughput at U.S. ports had picked up.
""I'm pretty confident that in the next three or four months we're going to see the inflationary pressures being reduced,"" he said, referring to the majority of traded goods and assuming no new geopolitical or health shock.
Some companies have nonetheless warned that trade channels have become so clogged up it could be well into next year before they see business returning to normal.

The WTO will in March invite businesses, governments and trade experts to discuss global supply chain issues. Even if the problems were easing by then, there were still lessons to be learnt, Koopman said.
""What we saw were fiscal and monetary responses very, very quickly. Long-term finely calibrated supply chains did not though have the right physical or regulatory infrastructure to adapt so quickly,"" he said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -A pandemic-driven exodus of young families out of Canada's largest cities has depleted a core age group of workers from the already tight labor market, which experts say risks accelerating wage inflation in certain industries.
Leading the rush out of Canada's big cities were children under 10 and millennials, or young families, Reuters analysis of official data shows, many who moved to smaller cities or rural areas in search of more space to live and work. 
The drive-until-you-qualify trend has shifted mid-career workers - a key segment of the labor force - out of big cities, making it difficult to find established talent in sectors where in-person work is essential or preferred.
""That's a whole sort of cohort of workers missing,"" said Mike Moffatt, an economist and senior director of the Smart Prosperity Institute. ""You've got the sort of entry level people, but that middle, people in their 30s and 40s, they're moving out.""
Intraprovincial migration data from the federal government released last month shows 64,000 people left Greater Toronto https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/so-long-toronto-covid-19-pandemic-hastens-canadas-urban-exodus-2022-01-13 for smaller locales within their own province from 2020 to 2021, while Greater Montreal lost 40,000, a sharp acceleration of an existing trend. Vancouver lost 12,000 people.
The rush was sparked by young families. Toronto lost some 15,00 children under 10 from 2020 to 2021, along with 21,000 adults between 25 and 44, the data shows. At the same time populations surged in smaller cities past Toronto's outer suburbs.
Driving the shift was home price and type. Half of Toronto's home sales are condos and the average price is C$1.2 million ($946,074). In smaller cities outside Greater Toronto, a typical home is detached and costs under C$800,000.
Indeed, the race for space has led to faster price gains outside Toronto and its suburbs than within.
Back in the big cities, the very tight labor market has forced employers to offer higher wages to lure workers. That is sparking rapid wage escalation, as companies compete for the skills they need. Recruiting firm Robert Half (NYSE:RHI) said 46% of companies are increasing starting salaries to attract talent.
""People are leaving (jobs) today, because they're being offered large packages to go elsewhere. That's how that war for talent is right now,"" said Koula Vasilopoulos, district director for Robert Half Canada.
The worry for the Bank of Canada is fast-rising wages could start driving inflation, which hit a 30-year high of 4.8% https://www.reuters.com/business/canadas-annual-inflation-rate-hits-48-dec-highest-since-sept-1991-2022-01-19 in December, something that it says has not happened yet. 
""There could be this self-fulfilling cycle where we've had inflation running at a 30-year high now, so ... employees start to ask for higher wages to compensate for that inflation,"" said Stephen Tapp, chief economist at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.
""That increases labor costs, that increases the cost of output and that further drives the inflation spiral."" 
Many big city employers are offering fully remote or hybrid roles in order to tap into the talent that fled the big cities during the pandemic. Recent data from Statistics Canada found a quarter of Canadians now work exclusively from home.
""Canadian employers are deathly afraid to require people to come back to office jobs for fear they're going to lose people all together,"" said Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.
But remote does not work in the industries with the most critical shortages - warehousing, retail, manufacturing and education and healthcare. Filling those jobs, particularly as more people trade in tiny downtown condos for far-flung detached homes, remains an expensive challenge.
""It's a whole spectrum of labor, from the barista right up to the hospital workers,"" said Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University's City Program.

""It's going to be a struggle, particularly for small businesses, but even big businesses. How do you get the talent if housing is so disproportionate to incomes,"" he said.

ATHENS (Reuters) -Greece will repay the final tranches of bailout loans owed to the International Monetary Fund by the end of March, two years ahead of schedule, Finance Minister Christos Staikouras told Reuters on Monday.
The country, which received more than 260 billion euros in bailout loans from the European Union and the IMF during its decade-long financial crisis, has relied solely on bond markets for its financing needs since exiting its third bailout in 2018.
Since then, it has also made several early repayments to the IMF and now owes 1.9 billion euros ($2.15 billion) in loans due by 2024, the last batch of a total 28 billion euros that the Washington-based Fund provided between 2010 and 2014.
""Greece has officially submitted a request for the full repayment of the outstanding balance of its IMF loans. The relevant procedure has been launched and is expected to be completed at the end of March,"" Staikouras said in an interview. 
Greece remains the euro zone's most indebted nation, with public debt seen at almost 190% of gross domestic product this year. The repayment is expected to help Athens reduce the debt by about one percentage point and save about 50 million euros in interest rate payments.
PRIMARY SURPLUS
Staikouras said that despite increasing spending to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Greece implemented ""a prudent and responsible fiscal policy and an insightful debt issuing strategy"".
He said stronger growth and higher budget revenues will allow the country to return next year to a surplus in the primary budget, which excludes debt servicing costs. 
""Regarding 2023 onwards, we will shift towards the achievement of realistic primary surpluses."" 
This would mark a significant step as Greece seeks to return to investment grade status by 2023. 
The European Central Bank's hawkish turn has sent Greek bond yields to their highest levels since April 2020, with 10-year bonds now yielding around 2.5% compared with 0.9% in September 2021. Athens plans to borrow 12 billion euros in markets this year. 
It sold 3 billion euros of a 10-year bond last month at a challenging time, as the ECB's pandemic bond-buying stimulus scheme is set to end in March.
The conservative government expects economic growth to top 5% this year, with a primary deficit shrinking to 1.2% of GDP from 7.3% in 2021.
Under a post bailout enhanced surveillance programme agreed in 2018, which allows Greece's European lenders to closely monitor its fiscal progress, the Mediterranean country needs to achieve a primary surplus of about 2% of GDP from 2023 onwards.
Staikouras said Greece has already started preparing to exit its surveillance programme this summer.

""We have already raised the issue of the exit from it with the European Institutions"", he said.

Investing.com -- Global equity markets tumble and commodity prices are squeezed higher by fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine and its possible consequences (in the shape of Western sanctions). U.S. stocks are also set to extend their declines at the open. The Fed's Esther George repeats her calls for the central bank to sell down its bond portfolio, and uber-hawk James Bullard will speak later. Only commodities are bucking the trend, as global buyers start to look frantically for alternative suppliers of energy, agricultural and industrial products. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 14th February.
1. Russia fears prepare a St. Valentine's Day massacre for markets
Fears that Russia will invade Ukraine continued to rattle global markets, with European stocks selling off heavily in the wake of warnings by the White House and other governments of an imminent move by Moscow.
Benchmark European stock indices lost as much as 3.2% in the first half of the trading session, against a backdrop of what appear to be last-ditch diplomatic efforts to avoid war.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit both Kyiv and Moscow Monday for talks amid hints of Ukrainian concessions, but the tone was set on Saturday after a phone call between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, after which Biden again threatened “swift and severe costs” on Russia if it invades.
A White House readout after the call said that while the U.S. was eager to continue diplomatic engagement “in full coordination with our Allies and partners, we are equally prepared for other scenarios.” G7 Finance Ministers followed that up on Monday with a warning of ""massive and immediate"" consequences for the Russian economy.
2. George beats the drum again for QT; Bullard, Lagarde speeches eyed
A fresh barrage of central bank-speak is underway after repeated negative shocks from U.S. inflation data last week.
Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George repeated her view in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the Fed should start selling bonds out of the $9 trillion portfolio it has amassed through previous bouts of ‘quantitative easing’. George argued that the Fed’s huge portfolio makes it more difficult to carry out monetary policy, and that asset sales would keep the yield curve from flattening – a nod to those afraid that the recent yield curve flattening presages a recession.
Later in the day, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard – who has already nailed his inflation hawk colors to the mast - will speak. So too will European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who spent most of last week trying to reverse the hawkish turn she had signalled at her latest press conference.

3. Stocks set to extend post-Michigan declines; Lockheed Martin in focus 
U.S. stock markets are set to open markedly lower due to war fears, which are further souring a mood that had already turned negative at the end of last week in response to the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index for February.
By 6:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 273 points, or 0.8%, while S&P 500 futures were also down 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 1.1%. The NASDAQ had also underperformed on Friday, as traders contemplated a simultaneous combination of weakening consumer activity and tighter monetary policy to bring down inflation.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), which bowed the inevitable over the weekend and dropped its deal to buy Aerojet Rocketdyne (NYSE:AJRD) due to antitrust concerns. That development is the latest sign of the Biden administration clamping down on industry concentration, after its resistance to Nvidia’s bid for ARM and multiple Canadian bids for railroad operator Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU).
4. Trade flows resume as U.S.-Canada bridge reopens
There was brighter news from the U.S.-Canadian border, where the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor reopened after an Ontario court allowed the forcible removal of truckers protesting against the Trudeau government’s Covid-19 policies.
With the virus’ dominant strain, Omicron, now causing a much reduced incidence of serious illness in many countries, it is getting harder to maintain the public health policies that have disrupted so much of social and economic life in the last two years.
However, the pandemic still has teeth. In Hong Kong, authorities said that the city’s hospitals had been overwhelmed with Covid-19 cases, in a reflection of how the highly-contagious Omicron is still capable of spreading like wildfire through populations with inadequate vaccination.
5. Oil, commodities squeezed higher on Russia fears
Crude oil prices hit fresh seven-year highs overnight on concerns about the availability of Russian oil exports in the event of Western sanctions in response to an invasion of Ukraine.
By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), U.S. crude futures were down 0.2% on the session at $92.88 a barrel, while Brent crude was down 0.2% at $94.22 a barrel. Overnight, WTI had risen as far as $94.81 a barrel, partly due to fears that the U.S. and EU will shut Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial messaging system, the channel through which almost all international buyers execute their payments for Russian energy exports.
A lack of access to SWIFT would force international buyers to chase alternative energy supplies in the short term, at a time when the oil market already has little spare capacity to speak of. Squeezes were also visible in other products where Russia is a key exporters, such as Wheat, Nickel and Palladium.",,,,,

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Tourism in Turkey is set to return to near pre-pandemic levels this year, boosting the crisis-hit economy with the help of a recent currency crash that has made it a more attractive destination than ever, industry officials say. 
Despite the high hopes, hotel and tourism officials warned that sharp rises in utilities, food and wage costs will limit profits and broader benefits for an economy rattled by inflation soaring to a 20-year high.
The high season starts in May for Turkey's Mediterranean and Aegean beaches and historic treasures.
Europeans especially are already booking trips in good news for President Tayyip Erdogan's government, which has adopted a sweeping new economic policy relying heavily on foreign income to curb the current account deficit. 
""Early bookings started with high speed. We've got strong bookings especially from Britain. They're almost in line with 2019,"" said Turkish Hoteliers Federation vice chair Bulent Bulbuloglu.
He said early bookings traditionally start with Britons and are taken as a reference for the season, with strong demand also expected from other European countries, Russia and Central Asia.
Foreign arrivals in Antalya, among Turkey's most popular holiday destinations, totalled 117,818 in January, matching the 2019 level, data showed.
But a further escalation of the Russia-Ukraine crisis may pose some risk for the season, Bulbuloglu added.
""We get good signals from Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and the Scandinavian market too... Turkey has become a destination where visitors can have the most affordable holidays with their own currencies. It is now a paradise for foreigners.""
The lira weakened 44% against the dollar last year and all-inclusive deals make Turkey even cheaper.
'SERIOUS PROBLEMS' WITH COSTS
""A five-star hotel's average price per night is around 70 euros in Turkey, whereas it is around 200 euros in Spain,"" said Turkish Tourism Investors' Association head Oya Narin.
Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati last week forecast tourism revenues of $34.5 billion this year, up from 2021's $24.5 billion. They were $34.5 billion in 2019. 
Erdogan's new economic policy aims to cut inflation by creating a current account surplus, with tourism revenues a key factor.
""It seems we will achieve the $34-$35 billion target. But revenues are not enough themselves. There is also the costs angle,"" said Narin. 
She said foreign arrivals will be near 2019 levels, or just 10% below, but making a profit matters more to the industry than how many millions come.
""We have serious problems with the course of our costs. We are facing rampant cost increases regarding electricity, gas and other costs,"" Narin said.
Turkey's annual inflation hit 48.69% in January. 
Ulkay Atmaca, general manager of Innvista Hotel Belek in Antalya, said he had to increase prices by 42% for this season but still cannot compensate for the rising costs. 

Hotel Association of Turkey head Muberra Eresin said sharp cost increases were eroding industry margins, with costs rising 60%-65% in just one month.
""We have already signed contracts with operators and set our prices. It's not possible to reflect all these additional costs on our prices now,"" she said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Leading economists in and around Brazil's Workers Party are nearly united in scorn for a new law shielding the central bank from presidential influence – but there is an important voice of dissent in the party: ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
    As Lula gears up for his presidential campaign this year, he has pointedly avoided naming a spokesman for economic proposals. That has made clear that Lula alone is the deciding voice on his economic agenda – and he has shown no qualms seeking common ground with centrists, even where it breaks with his left-wing party's consensus.
    The early signs of moderation from the front-runner in this year's election have turned some investors bullish on Brazil, helping to draw nearly $10 billion in foreign flows to local markets and boosting the country's currency and stocks.
    In interviews with a half dozen economists and ex-ministers advising Lula or his party's policy think tank, all made clear that they did not speak on the former president's behalf.
    Nowhere was that clearer than in their criticism of a law passed last year to formalize the central bank's autonomy by giving its governor a term straddling presidential elections and removing the role from the government cabinet.
    Five of the six economists interviewed by Reuters disparaged the law, warning that it tied the president's hands on macroeconomic policy. Lula himself criticized the idea a year ago, but he has since played down concerns.
    ""People take issue with the so-called independent central bank. Look, this central bank has to be committed to Brazil, not to me,"" Lula told journalists last month, adding that he was ready for a constructive dialogue with the current central bank president. ""I see differences of opinion, but no obstacle.""
    Two other political advisors to Lula, speaking on condition of anonymity, ruled out any efforts to change the central bank law if Lula wins the October election, which polls show him carrying by a healthy margin. 
    Elsewhere, the consensus among advisors to Lula and the Workers Party has lined up more clearly with the economic agenda he has previewed publicly. All agreed on loosening fiscal rules to allow an expansion of public investments, social programs and 'green' growth initiatives, while scrapping the major privatizations proposed by current President Jair Bolsonaro.
'DEVELOPMENTALIST' DOUBTERS
Still, Brazil's left-leaning economists seem wary of relinquishing government control of monetary policy.
Pedro Rossi, a member of the Perseu Abramo Foundation (FPA) think tank created by the Workers Party and a professor at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp), a hotbed for the PT's ""developmentalist"" school of state-led economic policy, said the central bank must follow the president's lead.
""Monetary and fiscal policies cannot go against each other,"" argued Esther Dweck, an economics professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and former budget secretary in the most recent PT government.
Luiz Gonzago Belluzzo, a Unicamp economics professor who has advised Lula for decades, argued government policy should be able to use some $360 billion in foreign reserves held by the central bank in order to more forcefully stabilize the country's exchange rate.
His criticism echoed that of former Finance Minister Guido Mantega, who engaged in what he called ""currency wars"" while serving under both Lula and his PT successor Dilma Rousseff, battling against what he considered an overvalued exchange rate.
Mantega told Reuters the current central bank's hands-off approach to Brazil's currency market had led to excessive depreciation, contributing to Brazil's double-digit inflation.
The law establishing central bank autonomy last year included a mandate to stabilize economic growth and encourage full employment. But Eduardo Moreira, a founder of asset manager Brasil Plural who has advised Lula on economics, argued in an interview that the newly independent central bank had not changed its policy or communication to reflect that new mandate.

Nelson Barbosa, a professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation who served as finance minister under Rousseff, was the only economist surveyed who saw no problem with the central bank's new formal independence, arguing it had little effect on economic policy.
""I don't think it will be a big problem with the eventual return of Lula,"" he said.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Hedge funds look to be on the right side of the seismic moves in Treasuries that have propelled short-dated borrowing costs higher, intensified flattening pressures across the yield curve, and ripped up the consensus 2022 U.S. interest rate outlook.
Futures market data for the week through Feb. 8 showed speculators flipped to a net short position in two-year Treasuries for the first time this year and cut their net short position in the 10-year space to its smallest since October.
A deeper dive into the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission report reveals that the bearish momentum in two-year futures is accelerating fast, and offers signs that bullish sentiment in 10-year bonds is emerging.
Together, this shows funds are betting that the 2s/10s yield curve will continue to flatten. 
CFTC 2-Year Treasuries - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdvzynejepw/CFTC2Y.png 
The CFTC data are for the week through Tuesday Feb. 8, two days before figures showed inflation in January jumping to a 40-year high of 7.5%.
That triggered a 24-basis point rise in the two-year yield, the most for a single day since June 2009, and a 13 basis point narrowing of the spread between two- and 10-year yields, the fourth biggest compression in a decade. 
Money markets are now pricing in at least 150 basis points of tightening from the Federal Reserve this year, starting with a 50 bp rate hike in March, and Wall Street banks have revised their Fed outlook sharply higher.
Hedge funds were net short 11,430 contracts of two-year Treasuries, the first net short this year. The week-on-week swing of around 59,000 contracts was the biggest bearish shift since October.
A short position is essentially a bet that an asset's price will fall, and a long position is a bet it will rise. In bonds, yields rise when prices fall, and move lower when prices rise.
The swing to a net short position was down to funds opening new shorts and closing out longs. Momentum indicators show that momentum on the short side is the strongest in a year. 
CFTC 2-Year Treasuries Short Momentum - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jnvwelzkovw/CFTC2YMOM.png 
The CFTC data also showed that funds cut their net short 10-year U.S. bond position by some 73,000 contracts to around 202,000, its smallest since October. The change was almost entirely due to fresh longs being opened, perhaps indicating that a more fundamental shift in outlook is underway.
Collectively, that's a bet on a higher two-year yield and lower 10-year yield. This trend has been in place for months but is accelerating rapidly. The curve is only 40 basis points from inversion, the red flag that has preceded all six recessions in the past 45 years. 
If the Fed follows through on expectations for the most aggressive tightening cycle in a quarter of a century, recession in 2023 or 2024 is a clear and growing risk.
""It is widely accepted that the Fed had over-stimulated and has been significantly behind the curve over the last several months. However, it does not make sense to compound that mistake by swinging to the other extreme. Errors are additive; they do not cancel out,"" Citi rates strategists wrote on Friday. 
US 2s/10s Yield Curve & Recessions -https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgpomjeyxpd/YCRECESSION.jpg 
On top of the economic reasons for buying 10-year bonds and betting on further flattening of the yield curve, there may also be technical arguments for doing so. Only two weeks ago, speculators' long positions in 10-year futures were barely 400,000 contracts, the lowest in almost five years. There is room to add, especially with a yield of 2% on offer. 
And if Russia invades Ukraine, the most liquid and safest market on the planet might be expected to draw strong investor demand, regardless of the inflation or technical picture.

Macro strategies made money in January, bucking the wider downtrend across the hedge fund industry. Funds betting on higher short-term yields and flatter curves will be sitting pretty for another positive month in February.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates and Indonesia are close to finalising a trade and investment deal after months of negotiations and could sign an agreement in March, officials from the two sides said.
The UAE and Indonesia last September entered into talks for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) meant to eliminate tariffs and boost investment between the two nations.
Emirati Minister of State for Foreign Trade Thani Al Zeyoudi told Reuters the two sides were close to a deal and that it could be signed as soon as next month.
Similarly, Djatmiko Bris Witjaksono, a senior official at Indonesia's trade ministry, said the two sides were working on finalising the agreement and that it could be signed in March.
He declined to comment on what was still being negotiated.
Indonesia is among several countries the UAE is exploring possible trade deals with. The UAE wants to conclude multiple trade pacts this year.
Israel's envoy to the UAE, Amir Hayek, on Monday tweeted that the latest round of trade talks with the UAE were under way.
Among those that are being studied by the UAE is a potential CEPA with the six nation East African Community (EAC) trade bloc that includes Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania, Al Zeyoudi said.

LONDON/UTRECHT, Netherlands (Reuters) - As electric vehicle (EV) sales rise, the big question for power grid operators, charging companies and governments is how to run tens of millions of vehicles without crashing local networks or spending billions on grid upgrades. 
The answer: smart charging. 
Simply put, smart charging software allows EV owners to plug in during expensive peak hours, without the vehicle drawing power until cheap off-peak hours. This eases strain on the electric grid, makes better use of renewable energy and saves drivers money.
Without it, millions of EV owners plugging in after work - auditing firm EY estimates Europe will have 65 million EVs by 2030 and 130 million by 2035 - could overload local grids, causing blackouts.
""The shift to electric will be nigh on impossible without smart charging,"" Chris Pateman-Jones, CEO of British EV charger company Connected Kerb, told Reuters while demonstrating a pilot project on public chargers in Hackney, a London borough.
Using Connected Kerb's smartphone app you can set your charging speed, charge time and exact price down to a low, slow ""Eco"" rate of 19 pence (26 U.S. cents) per kilowatt.
""It's so much cheaper and simpler,"" said Ged O'Sullivan, a 65-year-old pub owner who cut his plug-in hybrid's charging bill by 30% with Connected Kerb. 
Smart charging for public chargers is a significant challenge because so few are available for people who cannot charge at home because they park on the street. 
According to a report from EY and Eurelectric, Europe alone will need 9 million public chargers by 2035, up from 374,000 today.
The near future should also bring ""bidirectional"" or ""vehicle-to-grid"" charging, where millions of EV owners could sell their EV batteries' juice back to grid operators during peak hours. 
Even in Britain where smart charging at home is widely available, many EV owners are unaware it exists, according to Britain's energy regulator, Ofgem. In the United States, only a tiny fraction of utilities offer it, according to utilities group the Smart Electric Power Alliance.
And few cars today beside  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Hyundai's upcoming Ioniq model are capable of bidirectional charging - though more are coming. 
""Most cars, at this point, do not support this bidirectional charging yet,"" said Robin Berg, CEO of We Drive Solar, which has supplied hundreds of bidirectional chargers for a pilot project in the central Dutch city of Utrecht and worked with Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY) and Hyundai Motor Co on their vehicles. ""Other carmakers will follow.""
Nearly 20% of new cars sold in the Netherlands and almost 12% in Britain in 2021 were fully electric.
State support has put Norway at the forefront of electrification, where EVs made up almost three-quarters of sales in the capital Oslo. Some local substations were built in the 1950s and without smart charging Oslo would need massive, costly grid upgrades. 
""To handle this we need smart charging solutions because we don't want to over-invest in the grid,"" said Sture Portvik, who heads Oslo's charging infrastructure efforts. 
'AWARENESS IS LOW'
Connected Kerb aims to have 190,000 UK on-street chargers by 2030, enabling it to predict consumer charging patterns for grid operators and offer lower rates when the available renewable energy is abundant, said Pateman-Jones. 
""Today when there's too much wind on the grid, wind farms are told to turn the wind turbines off,"" he said. ""With smart charging we can pull more of that power.""
Some UK energy providers already offer low off-peak rates for home smart charging, but few EV owners use them.
""The perception is smart charging at home is a done deal,"" said Charlie Cook, CEO of Rightcharge, a UK firm that helps EV owners find low tariffs. ""But the reality is awareness of these tariffs is surprisingly low.""
Rightcharge estimates smart charging could save UK drivers 10 billion pounds ($13.5 billion) by 2030.
British car dealer network Lookers guides EV buyers to Rightcharge's website to check their options.
Lookers' business development director, Andrew Hall, said ""early adopter"" EV buyers are ""pretty savvy about smart charging.""
""But that is changing as EV sales rise,"" he added. 
Utilities group the Smart Electric Power Alliance estimates only 50 out of 3,000 U.S. utilities offer smart charging.
EV charging company ChargePoint's U.S. chargers can all smart-charge, but it wants more utilities to offer it.
""We see a lot of positive response from customers when their utility is offering those rates,"" said Anthony Harrison, ChargePoint's North American head of utility partnerships.
Charging provider Blink Charging Co (NASDAQ:BLNK) has one set rate until smart charging is widely available.
""We decided to keep it simple for our customers,"" said Blink CEO Michael Farkas. 
'HORRENDOUSLY EXPENSIVE' 
Bidirectional charging may be crucial. 
""The whole idea behind bidirectional charging is to balance the grid,"" said We Drive Solar's Berg, who estimates a fully charged EV can power the average home in the Netherlands for a week.
Serge Colle, EY's global energy resources leader, said smart and bidirectional charging are better than ""horrendously expensive"" power grid upgrades.
""We can't possibly open up streets quickly enough to add more copper and do the necessary reinforcement,"" Colle said. 
Regulator Ofgem estimates that peak power reductions from smart and bidirectional charging by 2050 could match ""10 Hinkley Point C Nuclear Plants"" - a two-reactor plant under construction in England.
The U.S. market has more than 10 vehicle-to-grid pilot projects using school buses under way. 
California-based vehicle-to-grid company Nuvve Holding Corp has formed Levo, a joint venture with private equity firm Stonepeak - which chipped in $750 million - to enable EV fleet owners to sell power to utilities.
""Because our customers are able to generate revenue we're able to reduce the total cost of ownership for those vehicles, at times completely cost-neutral,"" said Nuvve CEO Gregory Poilasne.
Charger makers like Brisbane, Australia-based Tritium Dcfc Ltd are also developing bidirectional chargers. 
CEO Jane Hunter said Tritium will launch a bidirectional, fast-charging wall unit in 2023 for fleets and homeowners.
More automakers are embracing bidirectional charging. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co has partnered with solar power company Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) Inc to use its F-150 Lightning pickup truck to power homes. 
But Oslo has invested extra money in pilot projects for bidirectional chargers because it believes in the concept. So far, however, it has been disappointed that more carmakers have not yet introduced vehicles that can feed power back into the grid.

""The limitations for bidirectional charging has been the car producers,"" infrastructure chief Portvik said. ""The big carmakers have to step up.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's central bank is committed to its inflation mandate and the likely uptick in January inflation towards the upper end of its target band should not create any panic, central bank chief Shaktikanta Das said on Monday.
""Today's inflation print is expected to be around 6%. So that should not surprise or create any alarm, because we have taken that into consideration,"" Das said.
""There's a sort of major delicate balance between inflation and growth and the Reserve Bank is fully aware of its commitment to inflation,"" he added.
Das made the comments after a meeting with the country's finance minister and the central bank's board in a customary post-budget meeting.
India's retail inflation likely accelerated to 6.0% in January, driven by higher consumer goods and telecom prices along with a comparatively low rate a year ago, a Reuters poll found.
Das reiterated that the inflation trajectory in India was on a downward slope since October and despite global crude oil prices having spiked in recent weeks the central bank had taken into account all scenarios. 
Last week, the RBI's monetary policy committee kept rates and its stance unchanged to ensure a broad-based recovery and projected retail inflation to ease to 4.5% in the next fiscal year.
Das also said the Reserve Bank of India is working on the borrowing programme for the next fiscal year, while the country's inclusion in global bond indexes is also a work in progress.

The government is scheduled to borrow as much as 14.95 trillion rupees from the market next fiscal year, with traders hoping the RBI will step in to help the market absorb the supplies, by announcing open market bond purchases or other steps.
Das said the government's decision to sell sovereign green bonds will also help widen the foreign investor base.

1/ MINUTE BY MINUTES
After U.S. inflation posted its biggest annual increase in 40 years https://www.reuters.com/business/us-consumer-prices-rise-strongly-january-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-2022-02-10 in January, markets are pricing in a strong chance the Fed will hike rates by half a percentage point in March. 
Minutes from the Fed's January meeting, due on Wednesday, may already appear outdated. Nonetheless, edgy markets will scour them for signals on how big a move rate-setters are contemplating.
The Fed last month flagged a rates lift off for March https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/inflation-fighting-fed-likely-flag-march-interest-rate-hike-2022-01-26 and also reaffirmed bond purchases will end then. The minutes may provide a sense of when, and how quickly, the Fed might reduce its balance sheet, which roughly doubled to nearly $9 trillion during the pandemic. 
On the corporate front, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) will be among those reporting earnings. 
2/ WHO'S THE BOSS?
    If markets needed a reminder about who's in charge, the Bank of Japan was happy to comply, saying it would buy an unlimited https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/boj-announces-plan-buy-unlimited-amount-10-year-jgbs-2022-02-10 amount of 10-year bonds at 0.25% and underscoring its resolve to prevent borrowing costs rising too high.
Japan's 10-year bond yield has hit a six-year peak https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/what-boj-can-do-about-rising-japanese-bond-yields-2022-02-08 every day for a week, rising to 0.23%, just 2 bps off the BOJ's tolerance limit.
As the relentless rise in bond yields worldwide rippled out to Japan, some suspect the global trend towards monetary tightening could spur a shift at the dovish BOJ. 
The bond market intervention shows that's some way off. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bojs-kuroda-says-not-debating-exit-easy-policy-mainichi-2022-02-10 continues to pledge extraordinary support for the economy, the latest reading on which is out Tuesday.
3/ ECB 'PUT'
Just as the BOJ steps in, the European Central Bank, it appears, may allow borrowing costs to rise as it focuses on inflation.
Southern European 10-year bond yield premiums over Germany are at the widest since mid-2020; Italy's spread is 20 bps wider from levels seen before the hawkish ECB pivot on Feb. 3 https://www.reuters.com/business/ecb-seen-hold-may-acknowledge-inflation-risks-2022-02-02.
Yes, the periphery is in a stronger position https://www.reuters.com/article/europe-ratings-sp/italy-greece-have-buffers-from-rising-rates-sp-global-analyst-idUKL8N2UH09S to cope, thanks to low debt refinancing costs and the EU recovery fund. 
But a potentially faster-than-anticipated unwinding of the stimulus that has long buffered the periphery is a big deal, and the ECB 'put' could be put to the test https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/euro-zone-bond-markets-ecb-put-is-some-way-off-2022-02-10. 
The term, normally used to describe the Fed's backstop for stocks, refers to the ECB's willingness to tolerate rising yields that could tighten financing conditions and raise fragmentation risks. Markets are right to feel nervous. 
4/ BIG DATA 
It's a big data week in Britain with latest employment figures out Tuesday, inflation data on Wednesday and retail sales Friday. 
They're in focus because the Bank of England just delivered back-to-back rate rises https://www.reuters.com/business/bank-england-hikes-rates-clamour-contain-spiralling-inflation-2022-02-03 for the first time since 2004, trebled wage growth forecasts and predicted inflation to peak above 7%. Markets price another 130 basis points in hikes by year-end. 
Data last month showed a 4.1% unemployment rate https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-employers-add-jobs-dec-unemployment-falls-2022-01-18 for the three months to November, the lowest since June 2020; new hirings surged by a record amount in December.
Consumer prices, meanwhile, accelerated in December to near 30-year highs https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-inflation-rises-highest-since-march-1992-2022-01-19 of 5.4% and may only peak in April when households face energy bill hikes of up to 50%.
While December shopping was hit https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/uk-retail-sales-slumped-by-37-december-ons-2022-01-21 by Omicron-linked curbs, latest retail sales may also show consumers' mood https://www.reuters.com/business/uk-consumers-take-fright-rising-inflation-rates-gfk-2022-01-21 being soured by inflation, lofty energy bills, higher rates and tax hikes.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan successfully defended its key bond yield target on Monday, holding the line on its ultra loose monetary policy, with the 10-year government bond yield falling after the central bank pledged market support to stop rates going higher.
The BOJ said last week it would buy an unlimited amount of 10-year government bonds at 0.25% to prevent rising global yields from pushing up domestic borrowing costs too much.
The benchmark 10-year cash JGB yield, which hit a six-year high this month, lost one basis point to 0.215%. It fell to as low of 0.200% earlier in the day.
The BOJ said it made no purchases of the debt, as there were no offers for sale.
While investors were unwilling to test the BOJ's 0.25% line, its battle with market players is likely to continue, said Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Financial Group and a former BOJ official.
""Investors respected BOJ's message and they did not make any challenges today but this battle will be a long one,"" said Kanno.
""With global rates rising, it might be hard to defend the current level and also the BOJ may have to conduct special operations multiple times. In that case the effect of the unlimited buying may fade.""
That global pressure was seen elsewhere in the bond yield curve on Monday with rates on other maturities rising.
The five-year climbed 0.5 basis points to 0.035%, its highest since December 2015. The 20-year JGB yield rose 1.5 basis points to 0.670%, the highest since November 2018.
The 30-year JGB yield rose 1.5 basis points to 0.885% and the 40-year JGB yield rose 1.5 basis points to 0.935%.
The two-year JGB yield was flat at minus 0.035%. Prospects of accelerated U.S. policy tightening and bets that the BOJ would need to taper its ultra-loose monetary policy sent the benchmark 10-year yields to 0.230% last week, the highest since 2016 and close to the implicit 0.25% cap the BOJ sets around its 0% target.
Investors had expected the central bank would offer to buy an unlimited amount of 10-year JGBs at a set price, seen as the most powerful option in the BOJ's policy toolkit.
Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Monday the central bank would continue to make efforts to accelerate inflation to its 2% target.

""Specific monetary policy means fall under the jurisdiction of the Bank of Japan. We hope the BOJ continues to strive toward achieving its price goal,"" Matsuno told a news conference.
The BOJ's special offer to buy bonds is its second since July 2018. The central bank introduced the measure in 2016 to ensure its policy goal of guiding the yield around 0%.

""As a control tower, the Presidential 'Economic Security Supply Chain Management Committee' will be newly established, and a fiscal backing will be made as we will create a fund to stabilize supply chain woes,"" Moon said at a cabinet meeting, according to a statement from the presidential Blue House.
He said the government will make a list of raw materials and other items essential for ""economic security"" purposes and manage them to protect local companies against shortages. 
With consumer inflation hovering at a decade high, everything from memory chips to food is getting more expensive, hurting sales at exporters such as Hyundai Motor and LG Energy Solution. 
Over in the United States, the annul inflation rate has hit a 40-year high at 7.5% while Euro zone inflation surged to record high of 5% in December, underscoring supply chain challenges for export-led economies like South Korea. 
Hyundai and its affiliate Kia Corp, together among the world's top 10 automakers by sales, have forecast a 12.1% jump in their combined global sales for 2022, after their sales fell almost 4% short of a target of 6.92 million vehicles last year due to the chip shortages.

South Korea's January factory activity grew at the fastest pace in six months, a private-sector survey showed on Feb. 3, but persistent supply chain woes weighed on the outlook.
Respondents in the survey said a stronger recovery was held back by sustained material shortages and the impact of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.

Nineteen out of 22 financial institutions surveyed said they expect the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to issue 200 billion yuan ($31.45 billion) in maturing medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans on Tuesday, matching the amount maturing on Friday. 
The remaining three said they expect issuance to slightly exceed the value of loans maturing this week as an indication of the PBOC's easing stance.
All survey respondents said they expect the MLF rate to remain stable.
In January, the PBOC unexpectedly cut the rate on one-year MLF loans to some financial institutions by 10 basis points to 2.85% from 2.95% previously, alongside a 10 basis-point cut in the seven-day reverse repurchase agreement rate.
Those cuts kicked off a small flurry of further cuts, with the country also trimming rates on its standing lending facility (SLF) loans, and its benchmark loan prime rates (LPRs).
The MLF rate serves as a guide to the LPR, which is decided on the 20th of each month.
However, expectations for another cut are limited, particularly following stronger-than-expected lending data for January, which was seen addressing some concerns over the strength and effectiveness of policy stimulus.
""I don't think rates are likely to move. January credit data wasn't bad, I think we have to watch another month,"" said Zhou Hao, senior economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) Asia. 
The PBOC said on Friday it would keep liquidity reasonably ample and step up financing support for key sectors and weak links of the economy, but not resort to ""flood-like"" stimulus.
In addition to the 200 billion yuan in MLF loans maturing on Friday, a total of 300 billion yuan in reverse repos mature this week.

The PBOC drained a net 210 billion yuan from the financial system on Monday through its regular open market operations, conducting a 10 billion yuan seven-day reverse repo operation against 220 billion yuan in maturing seven- and 14-day reverse repos. [CN/MMT]

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Bank of England will raise interest rates faster than previously thought to tame surging inflation, according to economists polled by Reuters who significantly upgraded their forecasts for consumer price rises.
A near 30-year high inflation rate in December pressured Britain's central bank to raise rates for a second meeting in a row earlier this month, taking Bank Rate to 0.50%. 
But nearly half of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members voted for a hike to 0.75%, making further tightening next month more likely. 
Nearly two-thirds of respondents in the Feb. 7-11 poll, or 25 of 40, expected a 25 basis points increase in Bank Rate to 0.75% at the conclusion of the next MPC meeting on March 17. That would mark the first time the Bank has raised rates at three meetings in a row since 1997.
A slim majority, 21 of 41, forecast a further increase to 1.00% next quarter. That is well behind financial markets, which are pricing in the bank to make a cumulative 75 basis points of increases at its March and May meetings.
In a poll taken last month, only one further increase was expected this year - in the third quarter - showing how quickly rate expectations are changing. 
""A combination of higher inflation, a resilient labour market, and better-than-expected Omicron data warrants a continuation of the hiking cycle that began in December,"" said Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG.
""We expect the MPC to follow through with rate hikes in March and May, with a potential pause afterwards to allow the new policy direction to get embedded"". 
Also facing high inflation, now at the highest in four decades at 7.5%, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to tighten at its March policy meeting.
Persistent global supply chain issues and rising energy prices have pushed this year's median inflation forecast up for the ninth consecutive survey.
Inflation was pegged at 5.7% this quarter on average and seen peaking at 6.6% next quarter, up 0.5 and 1.1 percentage points respectively from January, around treble the BoE's 2.0% target.
Inflation was then expected to ease in the third and fourth quarters to 5.9% and 4.5%. 
""Inflation will peak at slightly below 7% in April, when the effects of the energy price hike are fully captured in the data. The second half of the year should see supply-side inflationary pressures easing,"" said Stefan Koopman, senior macro strategist at Rabobank.
More than 80% of respondents to an extra question, 15 of 18, said it was more likely the BoE increases rates more than they expect rather than less. 
Britain's economy shrank 0.2% in December, less than expected, as the Omicron coronavirus variant swept Europe and the loss of momentum is likely to have stretched through this quarter.
The economy was predicted to expand 0.4% this quarter and 0.9% next. Growth was then seen slowing to 0.6% in both the third and fourth quarters.
Across 2022 annual growth was put at 4.3% and for 2023 it was 2.1%, down from 4.5% and 2.2% predicted a month ago.
Amidst calls from BoE officials for wage restraint 85% of respondents, 17 of 20, did not see pay rises keeping up with inflation over the next 12 months.

""The UK already has falling real pay, weakening nominal pay growth and a clear risk of stagnating economic growth, so any notion of an impending wage-price spiral seems overdone,"" said Koopman.

LONDON (Reuters) - British employers expect to raise staff pay by the most in at least nine years but the 3% wage deals for workers would still be below fast-rising inflation, according to a survey published on Monday.
With the Bank of England fearing a wage-price spiral from Britain's tight labour market, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) suggested companies were not breaking the bank to counter their recruitment problems.
Planned median annual pay settlements in 2022, including private and public employers, rose to 3.0% from 2.0% three months earlier, its highest since the CIPD started using its current methodology in the winter of 2012/13.
The BoE is monitoring the labour market as it considers how much more interest rates need to rise from their all-time, coronavirus-emergency low. 
The central bank raised borrowing costs in December and earlier this month, as it forecast that consumer price inflation would peak at about 7.25% in April and average 5.75% over 2022. It forecast earnings for workers would go up by 3.75% this year, leaving households facing their biggest post-inflation income squeeze in 30 years.
The BoE was also influenced by its own survey of employers which showed businesses planned pay settlements of close to 5% in 2022 - a much bigger average pay rise than other surveys have shown to date.
""Even though businesses anticipate making record pay awards to their employees this year, most people are set to see their real wages fall against the backdrop of high inflation,"" Jonathan Boys, a CIPD economist, said.
More employers were providing flexible working, training and support for employee health and wellbeing as alternative ways to keep and hire staff, potentially reducing wage pressures.
""However, the UK government must also address skills policy failings to support greater employer investment in workforce training,"" Boys said, calling for an overhaul of Britain's apprenticeship levy to make it more flexible. 
The survey showed that 70% of employers planned to recruit in the first quarter of 2022 and only 11% planned redundancies.
Almost half the employers reported having problems filling their vacancies and two thirds expected similar problems in the next six months.

Over four-fifths of employers planned a pay review in 2022 and of them 40% expected basic pay to increase, 7% expected a pay freeze and 1% expected a decrease.
The CIPD surveyed 1,006 employers between Jan. 6 and Jan. 30.

San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said it’s paramount for the central bank to be measured and data-dependent as it starts lifting U.S. interest rates to ensure stability. 
“Abrupt and aggressive action can actually have a destabilizing effect on the very growth and price stability we’re trying to achieve,” Daly said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “So what I favor is moving in March, and then watching, measuring, being very careful about what we see ahead of us and then taking the next interest rate increase when it seems the best place to do that. And that could be in the next meeting or it could be a meeting away.” 
Investors have raised bets on the pace and size of rate increases since the January meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee after data out Thursday showed January consumer inflation accelerating at the hottest pace in four decades.
In the wake of the CPI report, banks including  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) now see a 50 basis-point increase at the March meeting. However, Fed centrists such as Daly appear skeptical of a half-point hike, and suggest there is little need to start a cycle of increases with an aggressive move.  
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard -- who votes on rates this year -- said in an interview Thursday that he favors three increases by July, with one of them being a half-point move.
Daly said “it’s too early to call” the number of interest-rate hikes this year. 
“The most important thing is to be measured in our pace and importantly, data-dependent,” Daly said. “What every American wants to know and deserves to hear is that we’re on this, and we’re going to take those data in and get the accommodation right-sized for the economy.
  
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress’s efforts to stem the effects of the pandemic have resulted in more jobs, which in turn has contributed to inflation. 
The passage of the so-called COMPETES Act -- an expansive bill that would invest tens of billions in the U.S. tech sector -- on Feb. 4 is “a giant step forward” in addressing accelerating price increases, she said on ABC’s “This Week.” 
“What that does is addresses the supply-chain shortages that we have and therefore will decrease inflation,” she said.
The final version of H.R. 4521 -- which includes $45 billion over six years for a new supply-chains fund and $52 billion over five years to support semiconductor production -- still has to be negotiated with the Senate and could be months away.
West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) Sunday the Fed needs to “stop pussyfooting around” and “tackle inflation head-on,” renewing his call for the central bank to act against the fastest pace of price increases since the early 1980s.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss voters rejected a proposal by animal rights activists to make Switzerland the first country to ban medical and scientific experiments on animals, but approved tougher restrictions on cigarette advertising in referendums held on Sunday.
Only 21% of voters were in favour of the animal experiment ban, with 79% against, according to government figures, in the nationwide referendum held under the Swiss tradition of direct democracy.
Supporters had wanted to halt tests, saying they are unethical and unnecessary, but ran into opposition from the country's powerful pharmaceuticals lobby, which warned of the economic damage such a ban could cause.
""We are delighted with the clear rejection of this harmful initiative,"" said Rene Buholzer, CEO of lobby group Interpharma.
""It shows that the Swiss population recognise the central role of research for people's health and for prosperity in Switzerland.""
Supporters said animals in laboratories and used to provide food suffer serious discrimination.
""Why don't we have more empathy for them?"" said campaign co-president Renato Werndli. 
In another vote on Sunday, voters approved tighter restrictions on tobacco advertising, with 57% in favour.
The restrictions will see such advertising banned in newspapers, cinemas, the internet, at events, and on billboards, with supporters saying such adverts encourage youth smoking.
""I'm in favour because it's a shame people are starting (to smoke), it’s a social phenomenon and it does not do good to anybody,"" said Angela Margeuron, from Carouge.
""We hear constantly that people end up in hospitals or die or that they have huge health issues, but still advertising is still here, of course it's about money, as always.""
The government was defeated in the other two votes on Sunday. 
Its proposal to scrap the 1% tax on raising equity was opposed by 63% with only 37% in favour, an outcome Finance Minister Ueli Maurer said sent a negative signal to businesses seeking to invest in Switzerland. 
Bern's plan to increase financial support for the media also failed, rejected by 55% of voters. 

""The majority thought that probably too much money was being given to the media, and many agreed with the argument that the proposal favoured the big publishers,"" Communications Minister Simonetta Sommaruga told a news conference alongside Maurer. 
""In the last few weeks the argument prevailed that the wrong people would benefit.""

""So I look at the data, and I see that it is obvious that we need to pull some of the accommodation out of the economy, but history tells us with Fed policy that abrupt and aggressive action can actually have a destabilizing effect on the very growth and price stability that we're trying to achieve,"" Daly told CBS' ""Face The Nation"" in an interview.
Daly's remarks followed a tumultuous week with regard to what the Fed may do at its meeting next month, when the central bank is expected to begin raising interest rates from the near-zero levels they have been since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, a move Daly said she supports. 
But after an unexpectedly strong reading of inflation on Thursday, one of Daly's colleagues - St. Louis Fed President James Bullard - called for at least a full percentage point of rate hikes by the end of June. 
That helped drive a rapid recalibrating of expectations for the Fed's first move, with interest rate futures now more or less fully priced for a half-point increase in March and up to 1.75 percentage points of tightening by year end, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool. When Fed officials last provided quarterly forecasts in December, the median expectation for the Fed's target rate at the end of 2022 was roughly half that level.
Daly appears unready to shift immediately into high gear even though inflation is running well above the Fed's flexible target of 2% annually. 
She said the Fed should lift rates at the March 15-16 meeting, after which officials should be ""watching, measuring, being very careful about what we see ahead of us, and then taking the next interest rate increase when it seems the best place to do that. And that could be the next meeting or it could be a meeting away.""

Asked about how the crisis in Ukraine plays into Fed officials' thinking amid worry that Russia could invade ""any day now,"" Daly said its primary economic effect is the degree to which it adds to consumer uncertainty.
""Any time ... that you have geo-political risk, it creates uncertainty, and Americans are already facing quite a bit of uncertainty - uncertainty about when COVID's ever going to leave our shores, uncertainty about how the economy's going, so this is just another factor,"" Daly said. ""And uncertainty, we know, affects consumer sentiment and ultimately affects consumer demand.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel needs to cut red tape in traditional industries so they can boost productivity and catch up with the country's booming high-tech sector, the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said on Sunday.
Joining Israel's weekly cabinet meeting, OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann praised much of Israel's economic progress since joining the OECD in 2010, particularly a robust technology sector, as well as its handling of the latest waves of the COVID-19 crisis without needing lockdowns.
He projected Israel's strong economic growth would continue in 2022 but told Prime Minister Naftali Bennett the country faces structural challenges and wide socio-economic gaps due to a ""two-speed economy"".
""The remarkable productivity of Israel's vibrant high-tech sector stands in stark contrast to the lower productivity levels in more traditional lagging sectors which actually employ most of the workforce in Israel,"" said Cormann, a former Australian finance minister. ""This continues to lead to slower gains in aggregate productivity.""
High-tech jobs account for about 10% of the labour force and the sector is highly efficient unlike manufacturing, agriculture and other traditional sectors that are subject to heavy regulations.
""So Prime Minister, the OECD's assessment is that if Israel were to reduce its level of bureaucracy and over-regulation in some of those sectors that has accumulated throughout the years, that will certainly help boost competition, help boost performance and help lower prices moving forward,"" Cormann said.
Bennett and his government have come under fire in recent weeks amid rising food and other living costs. The government last week announced a $1.3 billion plan to reduce the cost of living, including tax cuts for working families, child-care subsidies and streamlined regulation to stimulate price-cutting competition for products.

""We've got to reform the stagnant parts of our economy and we need to increase competition,"" Bennett told Cormann. ""We don't have enough domestic competition and that's something that's always tough because there is always a good reason on why you need to slow down on that. And we need to have the courage to take these actions.""
Israel's economy grew by an estimated 6.5% in 2021 and is projected to grow 5.5% in 2022, according to the central bank.

Investing.com -- Concerns over tensions between Russia and Ukraine together with uncertainty over how aggressively the Federal Reserve is going to raise interest rates look set to dominate market sentiment in the week ahead. Wednesday’s Fed minutes may provide a sense of how quickly policymakers want to move, while appearances by several Fed officials will also be parsed for clues. The U.S. data calendar features January figures on producer prices, which will be closely watched after data last week showing consumer prices hit their highest in 40 years last month. Meanwhile, earnings season is ending, but not before a last flurry of reports. And the U.K. is to release a string of economic data that looks set to keep the Bank of England on track for more rate hikes. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Wall Street’s three main indexes closed sharply lower on Friday after the White House warned that a Russian attack on Ukraine could begin any day. While stocks got hit, prices for Treasuries, the dollar and other safe-haven assets, such as gold rose.
Crude prices also surged as the prospect of sanctions on Russia, a top producer, added to fears over already tight global supplies.
Some analysts believe soaring crude prices could exacerbate already high inflation, adding to pressure on the Fed to raise rates more aggressively.
“By pushing energy prices even higher, a Russian invasion would likely exacerbate inflation and redouble pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates,” said Bill Adams, Chief Economist for Comerica Bank, in a note cited by Reuters.
“From the Fed’s perspective, the inflationary effects of a Russian invasion and higher energy prices would likely outweigh the shock’s negative implications for global growth,” he said.
With markets already pricing in a strong chance the Fed will hike rates by half a percentage point at its upcoming March meeting, Wednesday’s minutes from the Fed's January meeting, will be scrutinized for any indications on how big a move officials are contemplating.
Last month Fed Chair Jerome Powell flagged a March lift-off and said there was “quite a bit of room” to raise interest rates without threatening the recovery in the labor market.
On Friday, Goldman Sachs said it now expects seven quarter percentage point rate hikes this year, up from its previous forecast of five, as it updated its forecast following Thursday's U.S. CPI data.
Several Fed officials are due to make appearances this week that will also be closely watched. St. Louis Fed’s Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are to speak on Thursday. On Friday Fed Governor Lael Brainard speaks, as do New York Fed President John Williams, Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans.
Last Thursday Bullard said in the light of the latest CPI reading he now wants a full percentage point of interest rate hikes over the next three Fed meetings.
Markets will get an additional update on the inflation picture with Tuesday’s release of producer price inflation figures, which are expected to remain elevated.
Soaring inflation has seen consumer sentiment deteriorate so Wednesday’s data on retail sales will also be in focus this week. Retail sales are expected to have risen 1.8% last month, boosted by higher auto sales.
The economic calendar features reports on industrial production, initial jobless claims, existing home sales, building permits and housing starts.
Earnings season is drawing to a close, but this week will see a big flurry of notable reports. Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) reports on Tuesday, followed by semiconductor giant NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), which are both due to report after the close of trade on Wednesday.
Retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT), known for its everyday low pricing, reports Thursday, and is better positioned than other retailers to withstand rising price pressures. The pandemic has triggered inflation across the supply chain from labor to raw materials, forcing companies to pass higher prices onto consumers. However, many companies could still not fully offset the impact and that hit their profits.
Deere (NYSE:DE), the world’s largest maker of farm equipment reports Friday.
It’s a packed week on the U.K. economic calendar with the latest jobs figures out Tuesday, inflation data on Wednesday and retail sales on Friday.
The Bank of England has just delivered the first back-to-back rate hikes since 2004 amid surging inflation, which it expects to peak above 7%. Markets are currently pricing in another 130 basis points in hikes before the end of the year.
The jobs report is expected to show the unemployment rate unchanged from last month’s reading of 4.1% while the annual rate of inflation is expected to hold steady at 5.4%.
Retail sales are expected to rebound from December’s 3.7% slump, but inflation, rising energy bills, higher rates and tax hikes will all weigh on the outlook.

WINDSOR, Ontario (Reuters) - Canadian police made the first arrest of a protester blocking a key bridge to the United States on Saturday, more than a day after authorities moved in seeking to end the blockade of the important trade corridor.
Demonstrators opposing government pandemic restrictions have occupied the Ambassador Bridge for the fifth straight day, snarling international trade and prompting President Joe Biden to call for an end to the siege. But there was still no sign when traffic would resume.
Late on Saturday, Windsor Police arrested a 27-year-old male for a criminal offence in relation to the demonstration.
While police have successfully pushed back protesters from the foot of the Ambassador Bridge, which links Detroit and Windsor, more people were streaming into the area and the operation appeared to have stalled.
As the afternoon dragged on, some Canadians questioned what was behind the delay, given the order issued by a court on Friday to end the blockade and the imposition of a state of emergency declared by Ontario authorities. 
""It would essentially send a message that the state is not able to retain control, where it's attempted to do so,"" Michael Kempa, an associate professor of criminology at the University of Ottawa, told CBC News.
""The longer this drags on, the longer people have the idea that what they are doing is not an illegal protest,"" he said.
The Ambassador Bridge is North America's busiest land border crossing. Since Monday, protesters in trucks, cars and vans have blocked traffic in both directions, choking the supply chain https://www.reuters.com/world/us/gm-cancels-two-shifts-lansing-plant-following-canadian-trucking-protests-2022-02-10 for Detroit's carmakers.
The ""Freedom Convoy"" protests, started in the capital Ottawa by Canadian truckers opposing a vaccinate-or-quarantine mandate for cross-border drivers, entered its 16th day on Saturday. It has morphed into a wider protest https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/how-ottawas-anti-vaccine-mandate-protests-are-spreading-globally-2022-02-09 against COVID-19 curbs, with people joining in with smaller vehicles, including cars, vans and pick-up trucks.
During a meeting of his top advisers on Saturday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stressed border crossings cannot, and will not, remain closed, and all options remain on the table, a readout issued by his office said.
Early on Saturday, Windsor Police urged demonstrators to act lawfully and peacefully. Officers in black uniforms with yellow vests moved behind the demonstrators' vehicles and, accompanied by police cruisers, slowly advanced on the protesters, pushing them back from the bridge entrance. 
OTTAWA PROTESTS ESCALATE
The number of demonstrators had thinned to roughly two dozen early on Saturday from about 200 on Friday night.
""We are opening up this intersection to traffic. If you fail to comply with our instructions you will be arrested,"" police told the crowd via a loudspeaker.
Protesters moved back in a noisy but peaceful retreat, dismantling tents and barbecues. But since then, police have not progressed, witnesses said. Concrete barricades have been set up in front of the police near the Ambassador Bridge to keep protesters from reclaiming any ground.
Some 4,000 protesters gathered in downtown Ottawa on Saturday and some tore down a fence that had been erected around the National War Memorial. Ottawa Police has established a new command centre consisting to federal and provincial police to respond to the escalation.
Protests have spread to other border points, including two smaller crossings in Alberta and Manitoba and Pacific Highway Border Crossing in British Columbia, strangling trade between the two countries.
Canadian police have said the protests have been partly funded by U.S. supporters and Ontario froze funds donated via one U.S. platform, GiveSendGo, on Thursday.
Toronto-Dominion Bank has frozen two personal bank accounts into which C$1.4 million ($1.1 million) had been deposited in support of the protesters.
The protests have inspired similar convoys and plans in the United States, France, New Zealand and Australia.
In Paris, French police fired tear gas https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/police-stop-50-vehicles-heading-paris-protest-convoy-2022-02-12 at demonstrators on the Champs Elysees avenue on Saturday shortly after a convoy carrying protesters against COVID-19 restrictions made it into the capital. 

Ford, the second-largest U.S. automaker, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Co all have announced production cuts. Companies have diverted cargo to stem losses amid production cuts.
The estimated loss from the blockades just to the automobile industry could be as high as $700 million, based on IHS Markit's data, which puts the daily flow in vehicles and parts at $141.1 million day in 2021.

U.S. administration officials said on Friday they would work to ensure access to $3.5 billion of the assets would benefit the Afghan people, amid calls for the money to be used to address a deepening economic crisis since the Taliban seized power last year.
The other half of the funds would remain in the United States, subject to ongoing litigation targeting the Taliban, including by relatives of those who died in the Sept. 11 attacks, the officials said.
Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) criticised the decision, saying its assets had been invested in the United States in line with international practices, and belonged to the people of Afghanistan.
""DAB considers the latest decision of USA on blocking FX (foreign exchange) reserves and allocating them to irrelevant purposes, injustice to the people of Afghanistan,"" the central bank said in a statement.
""(DAB) will never accept if the FX reserves of Afghanistan is paid under the name of compensation or humanitarian assistance to others and wants the reversal of the decision and release of all FX reserves of Afghanistan,"" it added.

The central bank funds have been frozen since the Taliban took over the country as foreign forces withdrew in August. 
The frozen funding combined with sanctions and a drop off in development funding have sent the country's economy into freefall, unleashing a humanitarian crisis.

PARMA, Italy (Reuters) -The European Central Bank (ECB) will keep a flexible approach as it unwinds its ultra-expansionary monetary policy, monitoring not only inflation threats but also risks of uneven financing conditions across euro zone countries, a top policymaker said.
ECB Governing Council member Ignazio Visco told a conference that the impact of the energy price shock should gradually wane in 2023, provided inflation expectations remain anchored and in the absence of a wage-price spiral.
Visco, also Bank of Italy governor, said inflation pressures had turned out to be more prolonged than initially envisaged and, in the short term, risks of higher consumer prices had increased. But so had risks of slower economic activity.
""The council's March meeting must carefully examine and discuss these developments and their possible consequences,"" he said at the annual ASSIOM-FOREX conference on Saturday. 
The ECB will update, and likely increase, its inflation forecasts in March, when its council is also expected to change its December guidance that it would buy bonds at least until October and only raise rates after those purchases end.
Sources told Reuters after the ECB's Feb. 3 meeting some council members already wanted policy changes this month.
""The debate among ECB members over inflation has already started, it is a good debate,"" Visco said.
Following the meeting, ECB President Christine Lagarde refused to rule out a rate increase in 2022, walking back on a previous pledge and triggering a sell-off across bond markets of debt-laden southern European countries.
Yields on Italian, Greek, Spanish and Portuguese bonds rose sharply versus safer German paper due to concerns the ECB's bond-buying scheme - a lifeline for southern Europe - could be unwound sooner and faster than expected.
Visco said it was important for the ECB to move gradually and carefully in unwinding its policy stimulus. ""Flexibility will remain a further important element of monetary policy,"" he said.
""In addition to the constant attention to inflation, the council stands ready to fight risks stemming from an unwarranted fragmentation of financial conditions across the bloc's economies,"" he added.

With euro zone inflation running at 5.1%, the ECB will have a harder time keeping in check financing costs across the area if bond yields start diverging, with weaker countries hit by risk aversion, economists say.
Calling on governments to take action in the face of the energy price shock, Visco said the main answer should not come from the central bank, given expectations remain anchored to its inflation goal and wages are not rising.

WINDSOR, Ontario/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Protesters opposing pandemic restrictions flouted a court order and emergency rules, continuing to occupy a vital Canada-U.S. trade corridor early on Saturday, hours after a judge granted an injunction to end the blockade that has crippled North America's well-knitted auto industry.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised President Joe Biden quick action to end the crisis, and on Friday a Canadian judge ordered an end to the four-day-long blockade of the Ambassador Bridge, North America's busiest land border crossing.
The order came into effect at 7 p.m. Eastern Time (0000 GMT), but five hours after the deadline, some 100 protesters were milling around the entrance to the bridge, waving Canadian flags.
While the number of protesters and police dropped as the night progressed, demonstrators continued to block the bridge with trucks and pick-up vans, preventing any flow of traffic in either direction.
Protesters sang the Canadian national anthem and midnight, and some shouted ""Freedom!""
Police, who started to gather in a parking lot a few blocks away from the protesters, began handing out pamphlets that outlined penalties under Ontario's emergency order, which took effect at midnight.
Trudeau earlier told reporters that no action was off the table.
Companies have diverted cargo https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-looking-air-move-auto-parts-alternative-canadian-border-blockade-2022-02-10 to stem losses amid production cuts by companies including Ford.
Superior Court Justice Geoffrey Morawetz on Friday approved the request by auto industry associations and Windsor city authorities hoping to end the protests. Occupying access roads leading to the bridge https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/truckers-ambassador-bridge-perfect-spot-threaten-us-canada-trade-2022-02-11 on Friday, protesters voiced defiance and there was little sign of them backing down. 
""Canada is supposed to be a free country,"" said Liz Vallee, a protester from Chatham, Ontario. ""When that freedom is threatened, we must stand up."" 
Vallee said she and others would stay until all pandemic mandates are lifted. 
The ""Freedom Convoy"" protests, started by Canadian truckers opposing a vaccinate-or-quarantine mandate for cross-border drivers, are also occupying areas outside government buildings in the national capital Ottawa and have blocked two smaller U.S. crossings.
The protests have inspired similar convoys and plans in France https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-freedom-convoys-head-towards-paris-police-checkpoints-2022-02-11, New Zealand, Australia and the United States, whose Department of Homeland Security is working to ensure that a ""Freedom Convoy"" event due in early March in Washington, D.C., ""does not disrupt lawful trade.""
East of Ottawa, people were expected to gather in Fredericton in the province of New Brunswick (NYSE:BC) for a weekend demonstration. Local police said officers were stationed at entrances to the city to ensure traffic can continue. Canada's financial capital Toronto was also bracing for more weekend demonstrations.
U.S. PRESSURE
Adding to calls for action by U.S. officials and business leaders, Biden expressed concerns over auto plant closures and production slowdowns during a phone call with Trudeau, the White House said in a statement. 
""The two leaders agreed that the actions of the individuals who are obstructing travel and commerce between our two countries are having significant direct impacts on citizens' lives and livelihoods,"" the statement said. 
""The Prime Minister promised quick action in enforcing the law, and the President thanked him for the steps he and other Canadian authorities are taking to restore the open passage of bridges to the United States,"" it added. 
Trudeau told reporters that he agreed with Biden that the blockades cannot continue. ""Everything is on the table because this unlawful activity has to end and it will end,"" Trudeau said.
U.S.-Canada cross-border trade in vehicles and core parts totaled $51.5 billion in 2021, IHS Markit estimates.
Biden's administration had urged Canada to use federal powers to ease the Ambassador Bridge blockade, a step Trudeau's government has not taken. Trudeau said on Friday his government was not seriously contemplating calling in the military over the protests.
The leader of Ontario, where police have avoided using force to disperse protesters, sought to build pressure on Friday by threatening C$100,000 fines and up to a year in prison for non-compliance.
Announcing the penalties as part of emergency measures, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said they were needed to ""make crystal clear it is illegal and punishable to block and impede the movement of goods, people and services along critical infrastructure.""
Windsor police issued a statement warning of arrests, but it was not clear if or when authorities would begin issuing fines or seeking jail sentences. 
ECONOMIC LOSSES
With car production cuts mounting, Ford, the second-largest U.S. automaker, said on Friday it had temporarily halted work at its assembly plant in Ohio. General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Toyota also announced new production cuts. 
The stock of Canadian autoparts maker  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA) fell 6.4% on Friday after it said it had seen an initial hit from the bridge's closure.
Beyond auto sector losses, the three U.S.-Canada crossings obstructed account for 33% of Canada's trade with the United States, valued at $616 million per day, Export Development Canada said.
The bridge's shutdown could worsen the tight supply of new vehicles in the United States and contribute to the already fast-rising price of new vehicles, IHS Markit said in a Friday report. Even if the blockade ends, a return to normal will take several weeks as shortages cascade through the supply chain, IHS Markit said. 

Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, home to nearly a fifth of U.S. car production, told CNN: ""The Canadian government has to do whatever it takes to safely and swiftly resolve this.""

In an interview on Friday with Reuters, Dennis Gingold, the founder of the fintech firm, said that Senator Pat Toomey's account was ""unfair"" and that Raskin, nominated to be Fed vice chair of supervision, had acted ethically and correctly. 
A White House spokesman said Toomey was waging a ""baseless smear campaign.""
The Senate Banking panel, whose members are divided equally between Republicans and Democrats, is to vote on Tuesday on whether to advance Biden's five Fed nominees for consideration by the full Senate. Members from both parties have indicated support for most of them, including for the renomination of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. 
Raskin, however, drew repeated Republican criticism mostly centered on her views on the financial stability risks posed by climate change. Toomey's public release of his letters about her to Kansas City Fed President Esther George broadened the attack.
Raskin, a former Fed governor, personally rang George in August 2017 about Reserve Trust's master account application after it had been denied, Toomey wrote in the letters.
""In the wake of Ms. Raskin’s call, the Kansas City Fed changed its mind and granted Reserve Trust a master account in 2018,"" Toomey said. 
Gingold said he recollected Raskin's short conversation with George as simply asking her to check that the bank's staff had the proper information at hand to make its determination. 
Kansas City Fed earlier this week said its review of the Reserve Trust's application ""did not deviate"" from its normal review process, and that it initially denied the request based on a determination that it was not eligible for the account.

It later approved the firm's request for a master account, it said, after the fintech company changed its business model and Colorado banking regulators reinterpreted state law so that the Reserve Trust met the definition of depository institution. 
In written responses to Toomey's questions, Raskin said she did not remember any calls made to help Reserve Trust but that any communications ""would have abided by all applicable ethics rules.""

Data on Thursday showed U.S. consumer prices rose at their fastest pace since the early 1980s, fuelling market speculation for a hefty 50-basis-point hike from the Fed's March 15-16 meeting.
The current Fed fund effective target is 0-0.25%.
As the Fed gets set to raise pandemic-era rates, here are the estimates from major global investment banks on how far and fast rates will rise:

*  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) now expects the Fed to hike a cumulative 175 bps this year, beginning with a 50 bps increase at the upcoming March meeting. 
* Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) now expects five rate hikes of 25 bps this year, starting in March. 
*  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) says 125 bps of policy tightening this year is ""appropriate"", and will come in the form of four 25 bps rate hikes plus a 25 bps fed funds equivalent runoff of the Fed's balance sheet. Rate hike timing highly data-dependent. 
* Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it is raising its forecast to include seven consecutive 25 bps rate hikes at each of the remaining Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings in 2022 from a previous expectation of five hikes. 
* BofA Global Research expects the Fed to hike rates by 25 bps at each of this year's remaining seven meetings, unchanged from its previous outlook. However, it said there is a risk of a 50 bps hike in the Fed's March policy meeting.
* HSBC's said it expects the Fed to roll out a 50 bps hike in March and four more quarter-point rate rises in 2022.
*  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said it expects the Fed to call a 50 bps hike in March plus five more 25 bps hikes in 2022, with a hike at all but the November meeting.

* J.P.Morgan said on Jan. 28 it expects five rate hikes in 2022, up from the four it estimated previously.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. and European officials are finalizing an extensive package of sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine that targets major Russian banks, but does not include banning Russia from the SWIFT financial system, according to U.S. and European officials.
The sanctions on the table also include export controls on components produced by Russia for the tech and weapons sectors, and sanctions against specific Russian oligarchs, according to three sources familiar with the discussions.
One U.S. official said the Russian banks targeted with sanctions could include state-backed VTB and Sberbank, the largest financial institutions in Russia. 
Both institutions are already subject to sectoral sanctions imposed by the Treasury Department after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region that limit their ability to raise capital in the United States, but the full blocking sanctions in sight now would have far more significant consequences, said one sanctions expert. 
They would likely be accompanied by certain waivers and wind-down periods to limit harm to U.S. companies and those of allies.
Three sources familiar with the talks said banning Russia entirely from the SWIFT financial transaction system was not under active consideration after running into major objections from European countries.
European lenders have expressed concern https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/europes-banks-fear-payment-system-could-be-casualty-russia-ukraine-crisis-2022-02-09 that banning Russia from SWIFT would mean that billions of dollars of outstanding loans they have in Russia would not be repaid. 
Sanctions against major Russian banks would still have a significant impact on the Russian financial sector and economy, one of the sources said. VTB and Sberbank's share prices have been volatile https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/ukraine-sabre-rattling-hits-russian-bank-investors-2022-01-20 in recent weeks, as investors worry Washington could ban Americans from holding debt or equity in the institutions. 
""The goal is to design sanctions that would really hit the Russians while keeping an eye on the collateral damage to those imposing them, recognizing that sanctions would clearly hit Europe harder,"" said one of the sources.
U.S. officials said strong progress was made on the sanctions package during meetings with their counterparts https://www.reuters.com/world/us-officials-head-europe-coordinate-sanctions-options-russia-2022-02-07 in Germany, France and Britain this week.
The U.S. and European allies have focused on sanctions that would be imposed in the event of a physical Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to U.S. and European officials. They would need to coordinate further on any sanctions response short of a full military invasion, such as big cyber attack.
""A lot of the issues have been resolved,"" said one U.S. official familiar with the talks, adding, ""I wouldn't say there's 100% agreement, but most of the concerns raised"" by Germany in particular have been addressed. 

Visiting German chancellor Olaf Scholz said in Washington Monday he was aligned with the United States on actions on Russia, but did not mention the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that the U.S. has vowed to shut of Russia invades. 
Washington warned Friday that Russia is massing additional troops near Ukraine and an invasion could come at any time, perhaps before the end of this month's Winter Olympics.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday rejected an appeal by 18 Democratic lawmakers who want the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to end its practice of charging mostly middle and lower-income countries significant surcharges on larger loans that are not repaid quickly.
The IMF has estimated that borrowing countries will pay over $4 billion in surcharges on top of interest payments and fees from the start of the pandemic through the end of 2022.
Jonathan Davidson, the Biden administration's assistant Treasury secretary for legislative affairs, told the lawmakers that the surcharges were meant to address the increased risk to shareholders involved in lending large sums to member countries. They do not apply to the world's poorest countries, Davidson added and loans made often had rates well below market rates.
""Revenue from surcharges for those countries who do pay them helps build precautionary balances to protect the IMF’s shareholders against potential losses,"" Davidson wrote in his reply to a Jan. 10 letter from lawmakers, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
""In Treasury’s view, surcharges need to be considered in the context of the overall balance sheet of the IMF, most importantly its ability to absorb potential losses from nonrepayment of its lending,"" he said.
Washington's view is vital since the United States is the largest shareholder in the global lending institution, which is funded by its member states; although Germany, France and Britain have been open to reviewing the surcharge policy.
Representatives Jesus Garcia, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Pramila Jayapal last month led a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, urging her to back a review of a policy they said was ""unfair and counterproductive,"" and robbed countries of resources needed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

Argentina, which is expected to spend some $3.3 billion on surcharges from 2018 to 2023, has repeatedly asked for temporary relief from the surcharges given the COVID-19 crisis, but IMF executive board members remain divided over the broader issue.
IMF executive board members reviewed the role of surcharges, now the fund's largest source of revenue, late last year, without coming to a final decision.

""The economy is recovering, the output gap is closing, but it would still be below its potential,"" Adrián Armas, manager of economic studies at the Central Bank, told a news
conference, citing the bank's December and January advance indicator reports.
Peru's economy has consistently exceeded monthly pre-pandemic levels since June 2021, according to central bank data.
Business expectations about the local economy remain pessimistic, however, amid political uncertainty triggered by the administration of leftist President Pedro Castillo, who just named his fourth Cabinet in six months in office. 
Armas said there was the possibility of a deterioration in political stability, but that ""the bank, as it has already done, has a high response capacity to deal with this situation.""
The bank also expects that Peruvian inflation, which registered its highest annual rate in 13 years last year, will begin to slow down from July and fall to within the target range of between 1% and 3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, Armas said.
The official added that there was a recovery in the services sector, electricity production, exports of agricultural products, and formal employment growth.
Peru's exports are expected to reach 63 billion dollars in 2021, largely due to higher metal prices, representing 28.1% of the gross domestic product, ""a historical record,"" Armas said.
""The external environment continues to be highly favorable for the Peruvian economy,"" he added.
Peru is the world's second largest producer of copper. Some large mines in the country have been facing conflicts with local communities and in some cases have slowed down production.

Peru has also vaccinated over 80% of its population, which has strengthened the economy. 
""People are starting to go out with more confidence,"" Armas said.

(Reuters) -While professional forecasters now see the U.S. economy growing more slowly in the first quarter, many have faith the Federal Reserve may be able to control inflation while keeping the economy on track, according to a survey released Friday. 
Economists still expect strong GDP growth for the year, supported by a robust jobs recovery, according to a survey of forecasters by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve. They also largely expect inflation to stabilize in the long term, the survey showed.
Fed officials are under pressure to act more aggressively to curb price increases after a report released Thursday showed that inflation increased last month at the fastest pace in 40 years. But not all policymakers are convinced that the Fed should launch its rate increases with a half a percentage point increase, with some saying they prefer to speed up or slow down the rate increases based on what happens with inflation.
Professional forecasters said they now expect the U.S. economy to grow by 1.8% in the first quarter, down from the 3.9% growth expected in November, according to the Fed survey. But they still see the economy growing by 3.7% for the year, down only slightly from previous expectations. 
They also see the U.S. labor market adding about 430,000 jobs a month this year - a pace that could help fill the jobs hole https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/JOBS/ygdpzzqwypw caused by the pandemic levels within six months. 
As for inflation, forecasters said they expect price increases to ease in the longer run from the high levels seen today. 
Forecasters now expect the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index to average an annualized rate of 4.7% in the first quarter of this year, before dropping down to 3% in the second quarter. They estimate PCE will average 2.2% a year over the next decade, slightly above the Fed's 2% target.

A separate survey of consumers by the University of Michigan showed that inflation is weighing on consumer sentiment, which dropped to its lowest level in more than a decade in early February.
The consumer survey one-year inflation expectations rose to 5.0%, highest since July 2008. Its five-to-10-year inflation outlook held steady at an 11-year high of 3.1%.

Treasuries quickly jumped to highs of the day while volumes spiked higher in 10-year note futures. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that the country continues to see signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border. Russia has previously denied that it currently has plans to invade Ukraine, and the U.S. said it does not believe Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a final decision.
The gain in Treasuries pulled the 10-year rate down as much as 10 basis points to 1.93%, temporarily erasing the prior day’s advance. Yields plunged across the curve.
“After being buffeted all week by fears of inflation and a hawkish Fed, it looks like USTs are now rallying on some safe-haven demand due to Russia tensions,” said Brown Brother Harriman & Co.’s Win Thin. “This sort of haven bid is rarely sustained, and so I think we eventually go back to selling USTs next week.”
The yen, which is generally seen as a haven in times of risk aversion, climbed, while the dollar advanced against most other peers and the Russian ruble slid.
With asset prices being pulled to-and-fro by inflation and geopolitical concerns “tensions in financial markets are running high,” wrote BMO’s Ian Lyngen.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canada's trucker protesters could not have picked a better spot to disrupt the export-driven country's economy, or the North American auto industry, than the four-lane Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, trade experts say. 
The 92-year old bridge was blocked for a fifth day on Friday by protesters demanding an end to Canada's vaccine mandate for truck drivers, prompting Ontario province to declare https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-ontario-province-declares-state-emergency-2022-02-11 a state of emergency, and auto companies to resort to costly air freights for crucial parts.
Ambassador has been a vulnerable trade chokepoint for decades, thanks to successful lobbying https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-detroit-bridge/after-long-fight-new-bridge-for-detroit-may-be-in-sight-idUKBRE9BA05920131211 against a replacement by the billionaire Moroun family that controls it and charges trucks $45 per crossing. 
The bridge carries about $360 million a day in two-way cargoes - 25% of the value of all U.S.-Canada goods trade. But traffic is limited by its 1929 physical footprint: just two lanes each way with no shoulders and antiquated customs plazas, emptying out into city streets on the Canadian side. 
Relief is coming in the form of a new expressway-only bridge across the Detroit River, but construction will not finish until the end of 2024 - provided it, too, can avoid delays.
""This is a reminder that the supply chain discussion isn't just about the ports in LA-Long Beach,"" said Dan Ujczo, an Ohio-based lawyer who specializes in U.S.-Canadian trade and transport matters.
The Biden administration has focused on unclogging containers at U.S. seaports, but the Detroit-Windsor crossing and a U.S.- Mexico bridge at Laredo, Texas are the two most important U.S. border entry points for North American manufacturing, Ujczo said.
NORTH AMERICA SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTED Canada is highly dependent on exports, which account for nearly 32% of its GDP, according to World Bank Data. The country displaced China as the top U.S. trading partner in 2021. 
Both exports and imports surged during the year from pandemic-depressed levels and Canada's U.S. trade surplus more than tripled to $48 billion, according to U.S. trade data https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c1220.html released on Tuesday.
The trade crossing's shutdown and delays at the Blue Water Bridge, 65 miles north of the Ambassador, have impacted auto plants, and other manufacturers from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals.
""Pretty much across the board, anybody who's part of the North America supply chain, whether it's getting parts or goods from the States, or sending parts or goods to the States, are beginning to see things backup significantly,"" said Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters president Dennis Darby.
The economic damage is now spilling down to small businesses that supply components for other auto parts makers and food ingredients, said Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.
""Even pre-pandemic our border infrastructure was incredibly fragile. There were delays all the time. And anything went wrong, there was chaos,"" Kelly said. ""We're seeing that in real time now."" 
MILLIONS OF TRUCKS, LONG DELAYS 
The opening of the Ambassador Bridge in 1929 gave rise to a cross-border auto industry and U.S.-Canadian economic integration, said Bill Anderson, director of the University of Windsor's Cross Border Institute.
Some 2.3 million trucks crossed last year, according to data https://www.bridgeandtunneloperators.org/index.php/trafficdata from the Bridge and Tunnel Operators Association, averaging out to 6,311 a day, or 263 an hour. On some days the bridge handles more than 9,000 trucks and 500 an hour, Anderson said, and crossings can take hours in heavy traffic.
The Moroun family waged a decades-long battle to thwart construction of a rival crossing, persuading Michigan's Republican-controlled legislature to oppose funding and mounting multiple legal challenges. 
In 2012, Michigan's then-Governor Rick Snyder accepted a Canadian government offer https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-canada-bridge/canada-michigan-announce-new-detroit-windsor-bridge-idUKBRE85E18X20120615 to fund most of the new bridge's costs, and took the unusual step of using executive authority https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-detroit-bridge/after-long-fight-new-bridge-for-detroit-may-be-in-sight-idUKBRE9BA05920131211 to bypass the legislature. 
The $4.4 billion Gordie Howe bridge under construction downriver from the Ambassador will cut 20 minutes off the crossing time, saving truckers $2.3 billion over 30 years, University of Windsor's Anderson estimated in January https://www.cbinstitute.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Gordie-Howe-Internation-Bridge-Full-Report.pdf.

The new cable-stayed bridge, named after the late Canadian Detroit Red Wings ice hockey star, and its vastly more efficient customs plazas may be more difficult to blockade because it will not empty into city streets, he said.
""It's a highway-to-highway connection and it will be faster and far more resilient,"" Anderson added. ""It will have a lifespan of over 100 years and give global companies the confidence to continue investing in Canada.""

The United States accuses China of genocide and along with other Western nations has imposed a diplomatic boycott of the Games over China's treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Allegations of rights abuses include some that are reviewed by the ILO committee, such as China's alleged use of forced and prison labour. China denies the accusations.
""The Committee expresses its deep concern in respect of the policy directions expressed in numerous national and regional policy and regulatory documents and requests therefore the government to ... review its national and regional policies with a view to eliminating all distinction, exclusion or preference,"" the report released by the U.N. agency on Thursday said. 
Specifically, the committee asked China to repeal provisions ""that impose de-radicalisation duties on enterprises and trade unions"" in Xinjiang and to amend political re-education provisions.
""As a ILO member state, the Chinese government is firmly committed to respecting, promoting and realizing the full access to productive and freely chosen employment and decent work for all China’s ethnic minority groups including Uyghurs in Xinjiang,"" its diplomatic mission in Geneva said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), adding that U.S. labour practices had previously fallen foul of the same committee. 
The United States and Britain welcomed the committee's findings and called on Beijing to take the steps requested.
An ILO official told Reuters that the alleged violations would be raised at a major conference in June.
This could lead to a formal complaint and the establishment of a commission of inquiry to investigate abuses on the ground, as occurred in Myanmar in the 1990s. 
In its report, the ILO committee examined a number of allegations by the International Trade Union Confederation, including that Beijing has used a ""widespread and systematic"" programme of forced labour throughout Xinjiang that violates an Employment Policy Convention.
The Chinese government called the allegations ""untrue and politically motivated"" in remarks summarised in the report.

China has been a member of the Geneva-based ILO since 1919 and has ratified many of its legally binding conventions.
The ILO committee is an independent body made up of 20 jurists to provide an impartial evaluation of all member states' application of global labour standards.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is seeking to free up half of the $7 billion in frozen Afghan central bank assets on U.S. soil to help the Afghan people while holding the rest to possibly satisfy terrorism-related lawsuits against the Taliban, the White House said on Friday.
President Joe Biden signed an executive order to deal with the threat of an economic collapse in Afghanistan, setting wheels in motion for a complex resolution of competing interests in the Afghan assets.
The U.S. Justice Department is due on Friday to present a plan to a federal judge on what to do with the frozen funds amid urgent calls from U.S. lawmakers and the United Nations for the money to be used to address the economic crisis that has worsened since the Taliban's takeover in August.
Senior U.S. administration officials said they would work to ensure access to $3.5 billion of the assets - which stem mainly from aid to Afghanistan over the past two decades - to benefit the Afghan people.
They said Washington would set up a third-party trust to administer the funds for which details were still being worked out.
The multi-step plan calls for the other half of the funds to remain in the United States, subject to ongoing litigation by U.S. victims of terrorism, including relatives of those who died in the Sept. 11, 2001, hijacking attacks, the officials said.
Washington froze the Afghan funds after the Taliban's military takeover, but has faced pressure to find a way to release the money without recognizing the new administration, which says it is theirs.
Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban’s designated representative to the U.N., called for the entire amount to be unfrozen and kept under control of the Afghan central bank. 
""The reserve is the property of Da Afghanistan Bank and by extension, the property of the people of Afghanistan,"" Shaheen told Reuters.
The spokesman of the Taliban’s Doha office blasted the U.S. move in a tweet: ""Stealing and takeover of frozen money which belongs to the Afghan people by U.S. shows the lowest level of human and moral decline of a country.""
The plans also prompted an angry response from some families of Sept. 11 victims, who are seeking to cover unsatisfied court judgments related to the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.
Brett Eagleson, the son of one victim, said the U.S. government should ensure the equal treatment of all family members of those killed by ordering the $3.5 billion to be distributed via an existing fund, instead of leaving it up to the court to potentially favor a small subset of families.
""Any mechanism that treats some victims’ families as less deserving or that prioritizes some victims over others is an insult to the memories of those victims of this mass murder,"" he said.
WORKING WITH UN
Biden's new executive order requires U.S. financial institutions to transfer all Afghan central bank assets held into a consolidated account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Afghanistan has another $2 billion in reserves held in other countries. Most of those funds are also frozen.
The United States, the largest single donor of humanitarian aid in Afghanistan, also plans to keep working with the UN and humanitarian aid groups on separate U.S. aid flows, the officials said, adding that they expected significant multilateral engagement in creation of the new trust fund.
The UN, which has repeatedly called for the release of Afghanistan's frozen assets, said it was encouraged by Friday's step
However, ""it's also important to reiterate that humanitarian assistance alone will be insufficient to meet the tremendous needs of Afghan women, men and children over the long term,"" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
Washington is also working closely with the UN to ensure the international body's agencies and aid groups have the liquidity needed to support critical humanitarian assistance programs, the White House said.
Reuters reported on Thursday that the UN aims to kickstart a system to swap millions of aid dollars for Afghan currency that would help solve that issue. 

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for a mechanism https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/un-chief-appeals-release-money-save-afghan-lives-2022-01-13 to free up about $9.5 billion in frozen Afghan reserves, including in the United States.
U.S. sanctions ban financial business with the Taliban, but Washington has granted waivers to allow humanitarian support for the Afghan people.

“This is clearly a very hot economy and it’s the Fed’s job to cool it off a bit,” Krugman said Friday on “Balance of Power” with David Westin on Bloomberg Television. As for what’s needed, he said, “Definitely not shock therapy.”
Krugman, now at the City University of New York, said that there’s no need to panic about current rates of inflation, with no sign that it’s become entrenched in the economy.
The Fed will need to be raising rates “consistently” until the underlying overheating in the economy that’s stoking price pressures dissipates, Krugman said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Friday it would remain ""closely engaged"" with Lebanon's authorities to help the crisis-ravaged country formulate an economic reform programme.
Lebanon's financial system unravelled in late 2019 under the weight of huge public debts, slicing more than 90% off the local currency's value and plunging a majority of the population into poverty.
At the end of more than two weeks of online discussions with local officials, the IMF said the country was facing an ""unprecedented and complex"" crisis that required a comprehensive economic and financial reform programme.
""The team will remain closely engaged, and discussions are continuing,"" it said in a statement.
Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Thursday described trying to agree a plan to extricate the country from its economic collapse - which includes a $70 billion black hole in the banking system created by previous governments' overspending - as a ""Kamikaze operation"".

""Progress was made during the mission in agreeing on the necessary reform areas, and more work is needed to translate them into concrete policies,"" the IMF's statement said.
""Obtaining broad-based buy-in for this multi-year (reform) programme will be fundamental for its timely and decisive implementation.""

""Due to extraordinarily high profits and negative interest rates, the SNB's distribution potential has risen sharply. This money belongs to the people,"" the SGB said after delegates met to approve the campaign, as Reuters had reported.
The SNB has racked up more than 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) in profits during the central bank's long campaign to restrain the safe-haven Swiss franc. 
Pension funds around the world are facing crises as people live longer and returns from investments shrink.
The SGB has expressed confidence it will get the 100,000 signatures to trigger a ""popular initiative"" referendum under the Swiss system of direct democracy, and then win the nationwide vote that would follow, probably in 2025.
The results would be binding on the government in Bern.
The SNB declined comment on the political initiative. 
But it is likely to oppose any payment to fund pensions, having already rejected calls for its balance sheet to be converted into a sovereign wealth fund. It says such a move would compromise its independence. 
The SGB said it had opted for an initiative text that continued to guarantee the independence of SNB monetary policy. The initiative calls for an adjustment of distributions, but does not aim at a fundamental reorganisation of payouts or restrict the SNB in its investments.
The distribution of profits to the pension fund would only takes place if the SNB's reserves were particularly high. In addition, the entire income from negative interest rates would be transferred to the pension scheme on a one-off basis. 
The pension scheme, which covers everyone who has worked in Switzerland, is forecast to slip into the red by 2025 and reach an annual deficit of 5 billion Swiss francs by 2032.
The SNB has meanwhile amassed massive profits from shares and bonds it has bought with foreign-currency purchases designed to weaken the franc.

The central bank expects a profit of 26 billion francs for 2021. Taking into account profit retained from previous years, the SNB has a net profit of 108 billion francs, according to central bank data.

244,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 10:10AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Germany and Austria should curb a boom in house prices by setting caps on mortgages and forcing banks to build up more capital, the European Union's financial stability watchdog said on Friday.
The European Systemic Risk Board's recommendations, published on Friday but dating back to early December, were designed to speed up action by authorities in the two countries.
""Austria and Germany...had already received ESRB warnings in 2016 and 2019, respectively (but their) vulnerabilities have not been addressed sufficiently,"" the ESRB said.
Specifically, the ESRB wants Berlin and Vienna to impose limits on how much property buyers can borrow in relation to the purchase price and to their income. 
But German Finance Minister Christian Lindner pushed back on the introduction of a loan-to-value ratio for home buyers, saying in a letter to the ESRB published on Friday that banks would simply be expected to act ""prudently"". 
The ESRB also recommends that authorities order banks to build capital cushions to absorb possible losses via a so called countercyclical buffer and a sectoral systemic risk buffer for residential loans.
Since the recommendation was issued on Dec. 2, Germany's financial watchdog BaFin introduced a countercyclical buffer of 0.75% and said a supplemental 2% cushion would be set for residential mortgages.
Its Austrian counterpart said on Friday it wanted to tighten its own curbs after it found that more than half of new mortgages did not comply with its standards, which are not binding.
These include a down payment of at least 20%, servicing costs not exceeding 40% of a household's income and a maximum maturity of 30 years.
""We do not have a property bubble that is about to burst,"" the deputy governor of Austria's central bank Gottfried Haber told reporters.
""But we have high price growth, we have high lending growth and therefore systemic risks that have increased in recent months and which we must therefore address proactively.""
Countries that receive ESRB recommendations must ""act or explain"" why they haven't done so, according to EU rules. But the watchdog cannot issue sanctions.

The ESRB's move comes as the European Central Bank winds down its massive bond purchases and is widely expected to increase its interest rate after years of aggressive stimulus.
Ultra-low borrowing costs have helped fuel runaway property prices in richer euro zone countries and particularly in large cities.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia's central bank raised its key interest rate sharply to 9.5% on Friday, increasing the cost of borrowing by 100 basis points for the second time in a row, and indicated a further rate increase was likely.
Russia is grappling with stubbornly high inflation which could yet get an extra boost from the weak rouble, which has been battered by the Ukraine crisis. The subsequent erosion of living standards is a key concerns for householders. 
The central bank raised its main interest rate seven times in 2021 from a record low of 4.25% but failed to tame inflation, which it targets at 4%.
Governor Elvira Nabiullina struck a hawkish tone when presenting the board decision on Friday, saying policymakers had considered an ever bigger rate rise of 150 basis points.
""We cannot say for today that the cycle of key rate rises has completed. We hold open the prospect of a further key rate increase at the upcoming meetings,"" Nabiullina said.
The central bank also raised its assessment of the average key rate level in 2022 to 9.0-11% from 7.3-8.3%, indicating there was room for substantial further tightening.
Friday's decision to raise the key rate to its highest level since March 2017 came in line with a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted the hefty increase as inflation hovers near a six-year high.
With annual inflation at 8.8% as of Feb. 4, the Bank of Russia revised its year-end inflation forecast to 5.0-6.0%, giving up on earlier hopes that it would slow to 4.0-4.5%. It now expects inflation to reach the target in mid-2023.
Short-term inflation risks have intensified due to global market volatility caused by ""various geopolitical events"", which may affect the rouble and inflation expectations, the bank said.
Higher rates can help curb inflation by pushing up lending costs and increasing the appeal of bank deposits. 
The rate hike did not immediately boost the rouble, which was down 1% on the day at 75.78 to the dollar.
    Renaissance Capital analysts said the central bank could now raise the rate to 10% at its next board meeting on March 18. 

""We pencil in a cautious 50 bps hike in March,"" Sova Capital said.
Locko Invest analysts said a more aggressive 100-basis-point hike also looked possible next month.

246,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 09:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Inflation is projected to run well above the Federal Reserve’s target rate this year and it’ll take longer to recede toward the 2% goal, according to Bloomberg’s latest monthly survey of forecasters.
The consumer price index will average 5% this year, up from the previous month’s projection of 4.6%, according the the median of 76 economists surveyed Feb. 4-10. The survey preceded the government’s latest CPI report, which showed inflation jumped 7.5% in January from a year ago, a fresh four-decade high.
The personal consumption expenditures index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation metric, will likely average 4.2% in 2022, firmer than the 3.8% projection from last month. Both measures will average more than 2% in 2023, they said.
Inflation, running at the fastest pace in 40 years by either gauge, is the top concern for policy makers at the Fed, who have been under pressure to rein it in. They’re prepared to start raising interest rates in March, and traders are increasing their bets for a half-point hike next month.
The increase in consumer prices last month was broad-based and showed that price pressures are extending beyond pandemic-related goods categories like cars to services such as health insurance and rents.
“This surprisingly high CPI reading will likely cause more FOMC members to favor a more aggressive rate-hike path,” Bloomberg economists Anna Wong and Andrew Husby said in a note Thursday. “We expect inflation to get worse before it improves, peaking at around 7.8% in next month’s report.”
U.S. growth probably took a big hit as well to start the year. Expectations for gross domestic product for the first quarter were cut in half to an annualized 1.5% after economists fully assessed the omicron variant’s impact as well as greater-than-expected inflation. Growth estimates were boosted slightly for the second quarter and reduced for the third.
Much of the first-quarter weakness can be attributed to consumer spending, now just expected to rise at a 1.8% rate compared with 2.5% in the January survey. Inflation is eating away at Americans’ paychecks, leaving less discretionary income after high food and gas prices.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will meet the reasonable financing demands of the real economy while not resorting to flood-like stimulus, it said in its fourth-quarter implementation report.
The world's second-largest economy has shown signs of slowing after a rapid rebound from the COVID-19 slump, with concerns about the financial health of property developers and the rapid spread of the Omicron variant clouding the outlook. 
""We will improve the money supply mechanism, maintain reasonable and sufficient liquidity, guide financial institutions to vigorously expand loan lending and enhance the stability of total credit growth,"" the central bank said.
The PBOC said it would keep growth of money supply and total social financing basically in line with nominal economic growth.
The weighted-average lending rate was at 4.76% in December, down 27 basis points from a year earlier, the central bank said.
New bank lending in China more than tripled in January from the previous month, hitting a record high, as the central bank seeks to shore up slowing growth.
The PBOC has cut reserve requirement ratios for banks and benchmark lending rates, with more easing steps expected.

The central bank will also fend off systemic financial risks and will not use real estate as a short-term method of stimulating the economy, it said. 
It will keep both the macro leverage rate and the yuan exchange rate basically stable, it added.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish inflation will fall to around 24% by year-end and hit single digits by May of 2023, the finance minister said on Friday, painting a far rosier picture than that of economists who see it 10 percentage points higher. 
Nureddin Nebati said authorities were no longer intervening in markets to support the lira, which has dramatically steadied after a December crisis. Yet he added that any U.S. Federal Reserve rate hikes would not affect the emerging market economy.
Inflation surged to a two-decade high of 48.7% in January, fuelled by President Tayyip Erdogan's push for unorthodox interest rate cuts and the resulting crash in the currency, which shed 44% of its value last year. 
The central bank's monthly survey of market participants' expectations on Friday showed consumer price inflation was seen ending 2022 at 34.06%. Many economists say pressure will remain due to soaring prices and wages. 
""The only problem now is inflation,"" Nebati said in a televised interview on broadcaster Haberturk. He added that meetings with investors in London this week were ""fantastic"", in part because the government had achieved a competitive and stable exchange rate. 
Costly interventions and a state scheme to protect deposits from depreciation helped arrest the lira crisis. Nebati said the scheme had attracted 340 billion lira ($25 billion), after corporate clients were added in recent weeks. 
AGAINST THE GRAIN 
Erdogan's government says credit, exports and investment will ease the current account deficit and lower inflation, which has sent Turks' living costs soaring and upended their household budgets. 
Official data on Friday showed the current account deficit narrowed nearly 60% to $14.88 billion last year, less than forecast, while manufacturing remained hot in December.
Turkey's import-reliant economy, worth $717 billion in 2020, has been prone to big trade deficits and a boom-bust growth cycle. 
After three months of surplus, a deficit re-emerged in the last two months of 2021 due to rising imports of energy and intermediate goods. The December deficit was $3.84 billion. 
Nebati said the economy had achieved high growth with a low current account deficit and would continue to do so. 

The government would take further steps to bring some $25 billion worth of gold from ""under the mattress"" and into the financial system, he added. 
Under the new economic plan, the central bank has cut the key rate by 500 basis points to 14% since September, even as most other banks globally moved to tighten. The Fed is expected to hike rates next month in the face of rising U.S. inflation.

(Reuters) - Signs are growing that a global supply chain crisis which has confounded central bank inflation forecasts, stunted economic recoveries and compressed corporate margins could finally start to unwind towards the end of this year.
But trade channels have become so clogged up it could be well into next year before the worst-hit industries see business remotely as usual - even assuming that a new turn in the pandemic doesn't create fresh havoc.
""We're hoping in the back half of this year, we start to see a gradual recession of the shortages, of the bottlenecks, of just the overall dislocation that is in the supply chain right now,"" food group Kellogg (NYSE:K) CEO Steve Cahillane told Reuters.
But he added: ""I wouldn't think that until 2024, there'll be any kind of return to a normal environment because it has been so dramatically dislocated.""
The global trade system had never contended with anything quite like the coronavirus.
Starting in 2020, companies reacted to the economic downturn by cancelling production plans for the next year, only to be blindsided by an upswing in demand prompted by rapid vaccine rollouts and fiscal support for rich-world household spending.
At the same time, virus containment measures and infection clusters triggered labour shortages and factory shutdowns just as consumer spending was shifting from services to goods.
European Central Bank Chief Economist Philip Lane likened the fall-out to the aftermath of World War Two, when demand exploded and firms had to quickly retool from production of military to civilian goods.
Export-led economies like Germany have seen recovery choked by supply bottlenecks to their factories, while surging shipping costs have combined with higher fuel prices to push U.S. inflation to a four-decade high.
MIXED MESSAGES
Now, as the milder Omicron variant prompts authorities to loosen restrictions, there are tentative signals that supply snags may be unwinding.
Last week's Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey showed signs of improvements in U.S. labour and supplier delivery performance for a third month, and purchasing manager testimonies in Europe also suggested easing pressures.
""Although supply chain constraints continued to stymie growth, there were signs that these were past their peak, a factor contributing to a slight easing in purchase price inflation,"" IHS Markit said of the UK read-out.
While this has raised central bankers' hopes of a more tangible reduction in inflationary pressures towards year-end, they also know that messages from the real economy remain mixed.
Soren Skou, head of shipping giant Maersk, said this week he was working on the assumption that more people would return to work at ports, more newly-built ships would come on line and that consumers would start to favour services again.
""At some point during this year, we will see a more normal situation,"" Skou predicted.
While German shipper Hapag Lloyd also saw delivery bottlenecks and freight prices easing in the second quarter, the big unknown for the sector is just how long the return to more reliable delivery schedules will take.
Supply chain analyst Sea-Intelligence said the current logjam had no precedent but past experience suggested it would take 8-9 months for port and hinterland networks to recover.
""That said, the market is showing no indication that we have started on the path to resolution,"" Sea-Intelligence CEO Alan Murphy said in an analysis of current trends compared to past data on average vessel delays caused by disruptions.
NOT LIKE PRE-COVID
Any resolution will be dependent on there being no further knocks to severely strained supply chains.
Those fragilities were highlighted on Thursday as Toyota, General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford and Chrysler-parent Stellantis said production had been hit at their North American plants due to parts shortages stemming from Canadian trucker protests against pandemic mandates.
Japanese, German and International Monetary Fund officials have all meanwhile raised concerns about a worsening of bottlenecks if China's zero-COVID policy - which has included sealing off entire cities - is deployed in full against local outbreaks of Omicron.
For the consumer, it will be some time before they see any tangible unwinding of supply chain pressures - and they should not necessarily expect a return to pre-pandemic levels of pricing or availability.
Executives at automotive and other manufacturers say they expect prices for a range of raw materials to rise during the year, but they are confident they can raise prices for their products to cover some or all of the increase. 
U.S. motorcycle-maker Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) said it was making do with a much more limited inventory by putting in place a reservation system for customers to order bikes.

Jens Bjorn Andersen, chief executive of transport and logistics group DSV, said the dislocation had been so complete that, whatever emerges, the sector will not look the same as it did before COVID-19. 
He added: ""I never use the word normalization.""

In a statement issued at the end of discussions with South Africa, the IMF said the country's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic had been faster than expected, but its durability remained uncertain.
South Africa's National Treasury responded by saying it was ""somewhat more optimistic"" than the IMF on the medium-term growth outlook, seeing a gradual recovery in investment and confidence.
""The National Treasury acknowledges the difficult juncture South Africa is at,"" it said in a statement, adding it was committed to placing public debt on a declining path and reducing budget deficits.
The IMF forecasts South Africa's economic growth at 1.9% in 2022 after an estimated 4.6% rebound in 2021, but sees it easing to 1.4% in the medium term. The National Treasury did not give its latest growth forecasts in its Friday statement.

""The economic recovery is deemed fragile, as it was accompanied by worsening unemployment, weak bank lending to the private sector and anaemic private investment. Despite the growth rebound, poverty and inequality did not show signs of improvement,"" the IMF said.
IMF directors commended the government for a strong policy response to the pandemic but outlined a variety of areas requiring improvement. It said the looming budget on Feb. 23 provided an opportunity for concrete measures to contain public sector wages, rationalise bailouts of state companies, streamline tax expenditure and better target education subsidies.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's foreign exchange reserves are plummeting, essential imports are stalling and opposition leaders and some experts warn that time is running out to avoid a sovereign default that would further upend the economy.
But Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa is focused on helping the domestic economy shake off the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic before he seeks assistance from the likes of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a close aide said.
""We should not be in a hurry to run here and there without sorting out local issues,"" said Milinda Rajapaksha, who works closely with the finance minister and is an additional director general in the media ministry.
It could take up to four to five months to fix issues like local supply chains and restart businesses, which alongside a pickup in tourism and remittances - both major foreign exchange earners - would help stabilise the economy, Rajapaksha said.
""You have to look at the external debt crisis separately,"" he told Reuters. ""That's what we are going to do. Are we going to look at a package like the IMF? Are we going to work with our neighbours and supporters for more swaps and loans?""
Sri Lanka's foreign exchange reserves are down to $2.36 billion, according to data from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) released earlier this week.
In a note on Monday, Citi Research said that confidence in the Sri Lankan government's external repayment position remains weak and foreign exchange reserves were declining faster than expected.
Sri Lanka has outstanding sovereign bonds amounting to $12.55 billion, with $1 billion of the bonds maturing in July, according to the CBSL. This year, the island's government has to repay debt of around $4 billion.
""We stick to our base-case scenario that international bonds will need to be restructured by July,"" Citi Research said.
On Wednesday, the CBSL said there was currently no need for discussions on debt restructuring as ""the government would be able to ensure the settlement of its sovereign debt without any interruption or default.""
""The government and the CBSL are committed to honour all forthcoming debt obligations,"" the central bank said in a statement.
'VERY DANGEROUS LEVEL'
The lack of dollars is already holding up goods from coming into the import-dependent country of 22 million people, which typically spends about $1.6 billion every month for imports of fuel, essential food and medicine.
In Sri Lanka's main port of Colombo, thousands of containers packed with essentials like rice and sugar have been stuck for weeks because importers are unable to get hold of foreign exchange.
On the streets of Colombo, prices of everything from milk powder and fuel to auto spares and mobile phones are rising.
Headline inflation rose to 14.2%, the highest in more than a decade, with food inflation hitting 25% in January, according to government data.
Sri Lanka is left with usable foreign exchange reserves of around $800 million, which could be exhausted in a matter of weeks, said Murtaza Jafferjee, Managing Director of stock broker JB Securities.
""The amount of reserves basically have come down significantly to a very, very dangerous level,"" he said.
To meet the shortfall, Sri Lanka's government has sought help from India with a $1 billion credit line. It is also in talks with Pakistan and Australia for two credit lines of $200 million each for imports of rice, cement, grains and medicine. 
In January, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa sought debt relief from China and assistance to pay for imports. Sri Lanka imports about $3.5 billion worth of goods from China every year.
POLITICAL FUTURE
The government, led by the influential Rajapaksa family, faces a choice between moving immediately to restructure its debt or continuing to scrape by even as it hits ordinary Sri Lankans, said Nishan de Mel, Executive Director of Verité Research think-tank.
""So, it is really a question of how much pain the society can bear and how much pain the government is willing to inflict before it changes the path,"" he said. ""It is not a path that looks to be sustainable.""
The IMF on Thursday said the Sri Lankan government had not initiated talks for financial support.
""Of course, we stand ready to discuss options if requested and we continue to closely monitor economic and policy developments,"" IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said in an online briefing.
For finance minister and veteran lawmaker Rajapaksa, the decision to go to the IMF or another external agency will also depend on political considerations, his aide Rajapaksha said.

The powerful politician is the younger brother of the president and of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, and took over the finance portfolio in July, 2021 as the economic crisis gathered steam.
""His political future is on the line,"" Rajapaksha said, referring to the finance minister. ""And his political party's future is on the line.""

LONDON (Reuters) -There will be no access to the European Union for Britain's derivatives clearing houses after June 2025, the bloc's financial services chief Mairead McGuinness said on Friday.
Britain's departure from the EU has largely severed the country's financial services ties with the bloc.
But clearing in London of euro-denominated derivatives for banks and asset managers in the EU was allowed to continue because of the risk of market disruption if the huge volumes involved had to be moved in a short time.
The  London Stock Exchange 's LCH business holds 92 trillion euros in euro interest rate swaps positions, compared with 11.4 trillion euros at Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) in Frankfurt.
Brussels on Tuesday extended ""equivalence"", meaning UK clearing access, until June 2025 for a final time to reduce heavy ""over-reliance"" on clearers in London.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Thursday that Brussels should not have set a time limit on clearing access, and that seeking to fragment the international financial market cannot be justified.
McGuinness said the EU had an open financial market and wanted to build up its own capital market.
""I am very clear that June 2025 is the end of equivalence for UK clearing houses,"" McGuinness told a Politico event.
Shares in London Stock Exchange Group (LON:LSEG) were down 3.5%, compared with a 0.7% drop in the FTSE 100 blue chip index.
She has launched a public consultation on ""incentives"" to shift clearing from London to the EU in an industry that has so far resisted pressure to do so.
""It will not happen organically, which is why we will need to intervene,"" McGuinness said.
An exchange official said only about 25% of euro clearing at LCH is between EU counterparties, meaning coming under Brussels' regulatory purview.
The Brexit trade agreement between Britain and the EU includes a ""memorandum of understanding"" to set up a forum for financial regulators to hold regular discussions, a step banks hoped would open the door to EU market access later on.
The EU has yet to approve the new forum and McGuinness said 

the forum would not be launched until issues over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which Britain is refusing to adhere to in full, are resolved.
""Our hope would be we could see the finalisation of these problems that need to be solved, and that then we could move forward,"" McGuinness.

Investing.com -- Bond markets calm down after Thursday's inflation shock, but stocks are set to open lower again amid fears that the Federal Reserve will do more, and faster, than previously expected to bring inflation down. ECB President Christine Lagarde tries to restore calm to Eurozone bond markets with a more dovish message. The Michigan Consumer Sentiment index, with its gauge of inflation expectations, tops the data calendar, while oil prices rise again after the International Energy Agency says the world's oil demand has been understated for the last three years. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 11th February.
1. Bonds adjust after Bullard's punchy message
The 10-Year Treasury note yield is set to open at over 2% for the first time in three years later, while the 2-Year note yield is at 1.60%, after another upward repricing of U.S. interest rate expectations on Thursday.
While the markets initially took January’s 40-year high in inflation reasonably calmly, they took fright again as St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard told Bloomberg that he wanted a full 100 basis points of tightening by July 1.
Bullard is a relatively marginal voice on the Federal Open Markets Committee, but he is a voting member this year and, more importantly, the fact that he turned hawkish before the Washington, D.C.-based board is creating the impression that he is a leading indicator of the Fed’s policy direction. As such, his words are having more impact on markets than they usually might have.
2. Lagarde tries to smooth the bond market waves; U.K. economy shrugs off Omicron
It’s a different story in the Eurozone, where ECB President Christine Lagarde had to resort to another lengthy interview undoing the policy signals that she gave in her press conference last week.
Lagarde said that there dangers in acting too hastily and said that “all of our moves will be gradual”, starting with the reduction of asset purchases in April. Her more conciliatory tone allowed a big Italian bond sale to pass off without incident, although the 10-year yield spread with Germany – a rough proxy for financial stress in the Eurozone – remains at over 150 basis points, its highest in 18 months.
Elsewhere in Europe, U.K. GDP fell by less than expected in January, suggesting that the economy coped better with the Omicron wave of Covid-19 than first thought. GDP was still below its pandemic level at the end of 2019, however, in contrast to the U.S. and much of Europe.
3. Stocks set to open lower; Affirm,  Zillow , Under Armour (NYSE:UA) in focus
Bond markets may have settled a little but U.S. stocks are still under pressure and set to open with fresh losses, creating the impression that this week’s gains have been essentially a bear market rally.
By 6:20 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 140 points, or 0.4%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.6% and NASDAQ 100 futures were down 0.8%. As such, all three are on course to end the week with modest losses.
Thursday’s inflation data will ensure that the inflation expectations component of the Michigan Consumer Sentiment index attracts attention later, while stocks in focus include Buy Now Pay Later specialist Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM), which had the now-familiar -20% punishment beating in response to weak guidance late on Thursday.
Other stocks in the spotlight include Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), which looks set for a bounce after its numbers,  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) – which also put out strong earnings and guidance after the bell, and British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI), after it increased its shareholder payouts. Under Armour, Newell Brands and Dominion Energy report early.
4. Ontario court to rule on trucker protests as auto sector suffers
Ontario's Superior court will hear a motion from the Canadian city of Windsor seeking a court order to clear protesting truckers from the most important road crossing between the U.S. and Canada. 
The Ambassador Bridge has been blocked for four days by truckers protesting against the Liberal Party government's vaccine and mask policies, disrupting the flow of trade and threatening to prolong the supply chain agony being felt by Detroit-based automakers in particular. 
The bridge closure has already forced Ford Motor (NYSE:F) to cut output at an engine plant in Windsor and at an SUV factory in Oakville, west of Toronto, the Wall Street Journal reported the company as saying.
5. We've been burning way more oil than we thought, IEA says 
The International Energy Agency revised its estimates of past world oil demand higher, suggesting that the global market is even tighter than first thought. In its monthly report, the agency increased past baselines for demand by between 770,000 and 970,000 barrels a day over the last three years and raised its 2022 forecast by 870,000 barrels a day.  That puts the current low inventory levels into even sharper relief.
U.S. crude futures prices rose back above $90 a barrel in response to the news, while Brent crude rose 0.8% to $92.13 a barrel, as talk of a quick lifting of Iranian sanctions took a back seat.
Baker Hughes’ rig count, which hit its highest since April 2020 last week, will show how quickly U.S. shale producers are reacting to the surge in prices."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Nations aims to kickstart this month a system to swap millions of aid dollars for Afghan currency in a plan to stem humanitarian and economic crises and bypass blacklisted Taliban leaders, according to an internal U.N. note seen by Reuters. 
Since the Taliban takeover in August, foreign financial assistance has stopped and international banks are wary of testing U.N. and U.S. sanctions on the hardline Islamist group, leaving the United Nations and aid groups struggling to obtain cash even as they continue to receive humanitarian donations. 
The U.N. explanatory note, written last month, outlines an ""urgently needed"" Humanitarian Exchange Facility (HEF). The United Nations has warned that more than half of Afghanistan's 39 million people are suffering extreme hunger and the economy, education and social services are collapsing.
""The overall objective is to have the HEF up and running in February,"" the note said. ""Prior to the full establishment of the facility, we seek to facilitate several trial swaps, to demonstrate exactly how the mechanism will work."" 
U.N. and humanitarian officials warn that the facility can be only a temporary measure until Afghanistan's central bank begins operating independently and some $9 billion in foreign reserves frozen abroad are released. 
But when that could happen is uncertain. The reserves held by the United States are tied up in legal action and Western governments are reluctant to release funds unless they see the Taliban show greater respect for human rights, especially those of women and girls.
The HEF would allow the United Nations - which is seeking $4.4 billion for humanitarian assistance this year - and aid groups access to large amounts of the national currency, the afghani, held in the country by private businesses.
In exchange, the United Nations would use aid dollars - potentially tens of millions - to pay the businesses' foreign creditors, thereby bolstering the flagging private sector and critical imports.
""The facility's flow of funds would not require the movement of funds across the Afghan border,"" the U.N. note said.
While the money bypasses the Taliban, the note says the HEF will need the approval of the Taliban-run central bank for ""the flow of funds and the exchange rate used and the withdrawal of AFN cash deposited into AIB (Afghanistan International Bank) without any restriction.""
A spokesman for the Taliban government confirmed that officials in Afghanistan were aware of the proposal for the HEF, but did not know the details or the procedure.
""We welcome any kind of humanitarian actions for the people of Afghanistan, but all actions should be taken according to Afghanistan's laws and national interests,"" Bilal Karimi told Reuters on Friday in response to a question on the HEF.
'STARVATION CRISIS'
The United Nations does not comment on leaked documents, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said of the note. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said Afghanistan is ""hanging by a thread"" and long pushed for international action to combat the economic crisis hampering aid efforts.
Afghanistan's economy has continued to deteriorate, with inflation for basic household goods reaching nearly 42% in January, compared to the year-earlier period, the World Bank said on Wednesday. Wages and demand for labor continued to decline, as did imports, which were down 66% compared to a year earlier, it said.
Aid groups and U.N. officials have been advocating for a cash swap mechanism, but the U.N. note seen by Reuters provides new details on how it will work.
Graeme Smith, a senior consultant for the International Crisis Group think-tank, told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that an exchange facility is needed quickly, but only as a stopgap measure.
""It is not sufficient,"" he said. ""Nobody should be under any illusions that this substitutes for the normal functioning of a central bank.""
Complicating the response, Taliban leaders have banned the use of foreign currency in a country where U.S. dollars were common. The United Nations has flown in shipments of $100 bills, but the central bank has not converted them, leaving the world body sitting on about $135 million in cash that it cannot use, a U.N. official said last week.
Those funds are held in Kabul in the vaults of AIB, the official said, the private bank that would play a role in the new cash swap system.
The security of the cash flights and limits on how much can be delivered are key reasons for starting the new exchange facility, the note said.
World Bank and U.N. officials have been working to finalize the HEF, including completing a risk assessment, seeking a U.S. Treasury license to protect international banks from sanctions, and hiring a private company to vet participants and guard against money-laundering, the note said.

David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, said the consequences of Afghanistan's economic crisis could be devastating, and he called for a change in U.S. and international policy toward the country.
He told the Senate committee on Wednesday: ""Current policy will indeed mean that a starvation crisis kills ... more Afghans than the past 20 years of war.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's markets watchdog said on Friday it will start working on a legal definition of ""greenwashing"" to underpin enforcement action as trillions of euros flow into funds that are advertised as climate-friendly.
Regulators are playing catch-up with the deluge of money going into investments that tout their environment, social and governance (ESG) attractions.
Few if any investment firms have been punished for ""greenwashing"", or over-inflating their ESG credentials, as there are no hard rules on what it means.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said that in an ideal scenario it would be tackling greenwashing based on a complete set of rules that set boundaries on market behaviour and practices that are not allowed.
""However, there is now a real need to address greenwashing without delay, even if all the legislative stepping stones are not fully in place yet,"" ESMA said in its sustainable roadmap document published on Friday covering work planned to 2024.
Defining the ""greenwashing phenomenon"" can drive supervisory work by regulators in a coordinated and efficient manner, ESMA said.
It will determine how greenwashing differs from other types of mis-selling in financial products, how it can spread and what measures can be taken to promote transparency.
The EU is rolling out new ESG disclosure requirements for companies and asset managers, and a ""taxonomy"" or list of what can be considered ""green"" investments. 
""Ensuring the consistent and effective application of the EU sustainable finance rulebook is key to preventing greenwashing,"" ESMA said.

The watchdog will look at the extent to which national regulators in the bloc can use their existing powers to exercise a form of ""professional scepticism to second-guess"" the sustainability ""reality"" in what's being publicly disclosed.
Earlier this week, ESMA said it was also scrutinising the market for ESG ratings, used by investors to help choose sustainable investments.

256,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 05:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"HONG KONG (Reuters) -Goldman Sachs said it expects seven 25 basis point interest rate rises from the U.S. Federal Reserve this year, up from its previous forecast of five and updating its forecast after Thursday's U.S. inflation data. 
U.S. consumer prices surged 7.5% last month on a year-over-year basis, topping economists' estimates of 7.3% and marking the biggest annual increase in inflation in 40 years, further adding to pressure on the Fed to raise rates more aggressively.
HSBC's U.S. economist Ryan Wang said the bank now expects the Fed to front-load rate rises more than previously anticipated, with a 50 basis point hike in March and four additional quarter-point rate rises in 2022. As per HSBC, that will lift the federal funds target range from 0-0.25% to 1.50-1.75%. 
""This would amount to 150 bps in rate hikes this year, vs our previous forecast of three 25 bps rate hikes,"" Wang said in a note. 

 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a daily markets note that its economists had also raised their Fed call to a 50 bps hike in March plus five more 25 bps hikes in 2022, with a hike at all but the November meeting and totalling 175 bps in 2022. 
Deutsche economists ""also highlight the increasing risk of a 2023 or 2024 recession"", the note said. 
 
"
257,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 04:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) -Romania's central bank has raised its inflation forecast for this year, citing higher energy prices that it cannot control, its quarterly inflation report showed on Friday.
The bank now expects annual inflation to reach 9.6% in December, driven primarily by energy, a big jump from the 5.9% it had forecast in November. 
Inflation rose to 8.19% at the end of 2021, its highest level in a decade, despite government energy subsidies and price caps for household clients in place from November through March. 
The bank expects inflation to surge to 11.2% in the second quarter of this year after the energy support scheme ends, and remain in double digits throughout the third quarter. 
It was unclear whether the coalition government would extend support past March, heightening uncertainty, the bank said. 
Other risks to the outlook included commodity price developments, the Russian military build-up on Ukraine's border, and domestic fiscal consolidation efforts, as well as persistent bottlenecks in production and supply chains, the bank said.
Policymakers expect inflation to ease to 3.2% at the end of next year, the central bank's first forecast for 2023, returning to within the 1.5%-3.5% target band one quarter later than previously envisioned. The bank must tread a narrow path to curb inflation without fuelling a growing current account deficit.

On Wednesday, the bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a bigger-than-expected half percentage point to 2.50%. 
That rate remains the lowest among regional peers, which have tightened borrowing costs aggressively to rein in inflation fuelled by external factors like energy as well as domestic issues such as post-pandemic demand and tight labour markets.

258,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 03:55AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Markets now appear to be gunning for a big U.S. rate hike in March, so Federal Reserve minutes and policymaker comments in the days ahead will be the key focus. 
European and Japanese bond markets may keep testing policymakers' resolve to contain rising borrowing costs, UK data could shed some light on the Bank of England's next move, and shuttle diplomacy will endeavour to avert a war in Ukraine.
Here's your week ahead in markets from Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Sujata Rao, Karin Strohecker and Dhara Ranasinghe in London.
1/ MINUTE BY MINUTES
After U.S. inflation posted its biggest annual increase in 40 years in January, markets are pricing in a strong chance the Fed will hike rates by half a percentage point in March. 
Minutes from the Fed's January meeting, due on Wednesday, may already appear outdated. Nonetheless, edgy markets will scour them for signals on how big a move rate-setters are contemplating.
The Fed last month flagged a rates lift off for March and also reaffirmed bond purchases will end then. The minutes may provide a sense of when, and how quickly, the Fed might reduce its balance sheet, which roughly doubled to nearly $9 trillion during the pandemic. 
On the corporate front, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) will be among those reporting earnings.

2/ WHO'S THE BOSS?
    If markets needed a reminder about who's in charge, the Bank of Japan was happy to comply, saying it would buy an unlimited amount of 10-year bonds at 0.25% and underscoring its resolve to prevent borrowing costs rising too high.
Japan's 10-year bond yield has hit a six-year peak every day for the past week, rising to 0.23%, just 2 bps off the BOJ's tolerance limit.
As the relentless rise in bond yields worldwide rippled out to Japan, some suspect the global trend towards monetary tightening could spur a shift at the dovish BOJ. 
The bond market intervention shows that's some way off. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda continues to pledge extraordinary support for the economy, the latest reading on which is out Tuesday.
(Graphic: BOJ pushed to the limit, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdvzynawqpw/Pasted%20image%201644498679306.png) 
3/ ECB 'PUT'
Just as the BOJ steps in, the European Central Bank, it appears, may allow borrowing costs to rise as it focuses on inflation.
Southern European 10-year bond yield premiums over Germany are at the widest since mid-2020; Italy's spread is 20 bps wider from levels seen before the hawkish ECB pivot on Feb. 3.
Yes, the periphery is in a stronger position to cope, thanks to low debt refinancing costs and the EU recovery fund. 
But a potentially faster-than-anticipated unwinding of the stimulus that has long buffered the periphery is a big deal, and the ECB 'put' could be put to the test. 
The term, normally used to describe the Fed's backstop for stocks, refers to the ECB's willingness to tolerate rising yields that could tighten financing conditions and raise fragmentation risks. Markets are right to feel nervous. 
(Graphic: Where is the ECB's pain threshold on the BTP/Bund spread, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkplgjkgnvb/BTP1002.PNG) 
4/ BIG DATA 
It's a big data week in Britain with latest employment figures out Tuesday, inflation data on Wednesday and retail sales Friday. 
They're in focus because the Bank of England just delivered back-to-back rate rises for the first time since 2004, trebled wage growth forecasts and predicted inflation to peak above 7%. Markets price another 130 basis points in hikes by year-end. 
Data last month showed a 4.1% unemployment rate for the three months to November, the lowest since June 2020; new hirings surged by a record amount in December.
Consumer prices, meanwhile, accelerated in December to near 30-year highs of 5.4% and may only peak in April when households face energy bill hikes of up to 50%.
While December shopping was hit by Omicron-linked curbs, latest retail sales may also show consumers' mood being soured by inflation, lofty energy bills, higher rates and tax hikes.

5/ TROOPS, TALKS AND TABLES
Shuttle diplomacy is at fever pitch to prevent tensions between Moscow and the West tipping over into a full-blown conflict around Ukraine.
After French President Emmanuel Macron's visit, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will see Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday, before heading to Moscow to meet Russia's Vladimir Putin. Poland's foreign minister is due in Moscow too, and NATO holds a defence ministers summit in Brussels Wednesday.
While Russian troop build-up near Ukraine's border continues and Western powers send military to Europe's eastern fringes and ready sanctions on Moscow, markets seem to be focusing on other issues such as central banks and inflation.

The coming days may show whether the flurry of diplomacy improves international ties and keeps Russian energy flowing into Europe.

LONDON (Reuters) - Whether emerging economies have already done enough to pre-empt the global central bank tightening cycle may dictate whether investors in them can escape yet another dire decade. 
With everyone braced for the U.S. Federal Reserve's first post-pandemic interest rate rise next month, clouds appear to be gathering over emerging economies once again. 
The prospect of a rising U.S. Treasury yields and appreciating dollar is typically a twin torture for governments and companies heavily borrowed in greenbacks - an exposure few in the developing world have been able to shake.
And given that emerging stocks as a basket have never truly recovered from the last Fed 'liftoff' that began with the so-called 'taper tantrum' of 2013, the outlook appears bleak as they face a second liftoff again in less than 10 years. 
One of the few positives is most investors seem to have skedaddled already. 
Funds' positioning in global emerging markets equities fell to net 2% underweight last month, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fund manager survey. That was a full standard deviation below long-term averages and a eye-watering reversal of the net 60% overweight seen as recently as late 2020.
There's been no let up this year. EM funds did not escape a generally wobbly start to the year everywhere - with last week seeing the 7th consecutive week of net outflows from emerging equity and a 4th straight week of exits from EM bond funds. 
For all the national pros and cons missed by broad EM index investing, it's hard to imagine a worse constellation over the past year for MSCI's benchmark emerging equity index - one that's now almost 50% Chinese and Taiwanese companies.
Aside from the drama of the pandemic itself, exaggerated in recent months by China's ""Zero COVID"" policies while other economies kept largely open through the Omicron variant, rising dollar interest rates and fractious geopolitics between the West and both Beijing and Moscow has rankled like never before.
The near collapse of China's debt-laden property sector and the government's crackdown on the country's tech giants as part of its ""common prosperity"" push jarred even more. 
Amid all that, the investment world was forced to enter 2022 on tenterhooks over a possible Russia invasion of Ukraine - a standoff that last week seemed to cement China/Russia alliance in opposition to G7 and NATO, exaggerating the global energy price and inflation crisis in the process and upping pressure for higher U.S. interest rates.

(Graphic: EM indices relative performance vs S&P500 since 2013's 'Taper Tantrum', https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjpqkamylpx/Two.PNG) 
DARKEST BEFORE DAWN?
There are those who think the darkest hours are before dawn; or that EM will win when 'value stocks' have their day; and even that extreme positioning provides opportunities. That's led to some calling for a return to emerging equity at the strangest time.
Some of the thinking is simply eyeing a turn in sentiment toward China as the pandemic endgame unfolds and the People's Bank of China bucks a global central bank trend with easing of its own.
Others reckon a peak-to-trough 18% drawdown in MSCI's equity benchmark over the past 12 months has run its course as a result and a 'bear market' signal in the event of a recoil of more 20% just isn't warranted.
Some also think emerging companies should benefit from pumped up oil and commodity prices driving decades-high global inflation rates - although tech stocks are now a bigger overall weighting in the MSCI's index than materials, energy and industrials sectors combined. 
And tech stocks don't like higher yields much.
A more cogent hope is that many emerging market central banks have dodged the oncoming bullet of a soaring dollar against their currencies by tightening sharply in advance.
In the year before the Fed has even contemplated rate rises, Brazil's central bank has hiked its policy interest rate by almost 9 percentage points to 10.75%; Chile added 5 points to 5.5%; and Russia and South Korea doubled their equivalents to 8.5% and 1.25%.
If that pre-emption reins the dollar in during this Fed hiking cycle - and China continues to ease further - it may just allow emerging central banks some breathing space to end their tightening earlier, offering attractions to bond investors fearful of what developed world fixed income has in store.
That's a big 'if' and goes against consensus views on the dollar for this year. 
But it does speak to other hopes that the model of emerging economy growth is shifting away from a reliance on exports to more home-grown drivers of domestic demand. 
""Emerging markets are breaking away from their dependence on the developed world,"" said Columbia Threadneedle's head of global emerging equities Dara White.

""Investors should now be looking at emerging markets through a different lens,"" he added.
End of a lost decade? We'll see after March.

LONDON (Reuters) -Worried about record-high inflation, the European Central Bank may have significantly raised the threshold where it might staunch bond market sell-offs in Italy and other weaker euro bloc countries.
Markets across poorer, debt-laden southern Europe reacted with shock to the ECB's move to walk back earlier pledges https://www.reuters.com/business/ecb-seen-hold-may-acknowledge-inflation-risks-2022-02-02 not to raise rates this year. They recoiled too at the signal that its bond-buying scheme -- a lifeline for southern Europe -- could be unwound sooner and faster than expected.
The hawkish pivot sharply lifted yields on ten-year bonds from Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal -- collectively dubbed the euro zone periphery -- relative to safer German equivalents.
The premium on Italy, arguably most vulnerable because of the sheer size of its debt, is up 20 basis points in the past week.
ECB President Christine Lagarde has since seemed to soften https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/euro-zone-inflation-could-subside-before-becoming-entrenched-lagarde-2022-02-07 her stance. But she hasn't banished fears that policy tightening will sharply raise borrowing costs, exacerbating debt ratios that are already among the world's highest. 
The question many ask is where the ECB 'put' might kick in -- a term normally used to describe the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve will eventually backstop falling stock markets.
Since 2015, the ECB has bought member states' bonds, capping their borrowing costs. And since March 2020 PEPP, its emergency stimulus scheme to cope with the coronavirus pandemic, has enabled the periphery to borrow more cheaply. 
Italian 10-year yields for instance, spiked to 3% just before PEPP was launched but fell as low as 0.4% at one point last year.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) called ECB stimulus ""a safety net for the periphery"", without which bond markets risked fragmenting along national lines, dividing the vulnerable, indebted south from Germany and other richer states. 
Noting Lagarde's promise after last week's policy meeting that the ECB is ""obviously going to respond"" to any sharp spread widening, JPM predicted ""the market may be willing to test this commitment."" 
Indeed, it brings to mind Lagarde's comment early in her role that the ECB was not there to ""close spreads"" i.e. narrow yield premia. 
The ensuing spread blowout forced the ECB to announce PEPP.
What's changed since then is that bloc-wide inflation is running at a record high 5.1%, after years of failing to reach the ECB's target.
""It's the first time since 2012 that there's potentially conflict between inflation and dealing with fragmentation,"" AXA Group chief economist Gilles Moec said. 
INFLATION VS SPREADS
Danske Bank chief strategist Piet Haines Christiansen says the ECB might be willing to tolerate higher yields for the periphery. 
""Back in the day, the pain threshold would have been lower, but with inflation higher, Italy is increasingly on its own,"" Haines Christiansen said.
""Previously I would have said that 250 bps on the Italian/German spread is the pain threshold for the ECB, PEPP was announced at around 300 bps, and now I would say it is higher.""
Pictet Wealth Management strategist Frederik Ducrozet saw the 'danger zone' for the Italy bond spread at around 250 bps -- roughly 100 bps above current levels. 
For David Riley, chief investment strategist at BlueBay, ""we'd have to go through a 200 bps spread before we get close to the ECB put.""
However, despite Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 150%, concerns won't arise immediately because the country has used the low rates era to extend the average maturity of its debt to seven years. 
Haines Christiansen said debt sustainability questions would only arise when yields on Italy's seven-year bonds rose 150 bps from current levels.. 
Capital Economics senior Europe economist Jack Allen-Reynolds sees concern arising only once 10-year Italian yields hit 5%. 
CLARITY NEEDED
Any sovereign bond sell-off that causes a jump in corporate borrowing costs would grab policymakers' attention.
How could they respond? 
The ECB could check borrowing costs by targeting where it reinvests the proceeds of maturing PEPP bonds. Or it could leave the door open to re-starting bond purchases if needed. 

Analysts said they hoped the ECB would provide more clarity at its March meeting over what support would be provided to the periphery if spreads continue to widen.
But at current levels, BlueBay's Riley reckons ""we are long away off from the ECB put"". So despite sharply higher Italian yields, ""in the near term, that's not a knife I'd be looking to catch"", he added.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's headline inflation rate is expected to top the central bank's forecast of 1.7% this year, but should remain within its target range, central bank officials said on Friday.
Inflation would exceed the Bank of Thailand (BOT)'s target range of 1-3% in early 2022 before falling in the second half of the year, they said.
""For the whole year, we still look at no more than 3%,"" senior director Sakkapop Panyanukul told a news conference. 
Sakkapop said most economic indicators were largely in line with the BOT's estimates so far this year, though there was an improvement in exports and a rise in inflation. In January, inflation jumped to a nine-month high of 3.23%.
The BOT has forecast economic growth of 3.4% this year, with exports rising 3.5%. It is due to update that data next month.
On Wednesday, the BOT left its key interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.50% and ruled out an immediate need to adjust despite higher inflation and looming U.S. policy tightening.
The BOT reiterated that planned interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve would have little impact on Thailand as its external stability remains strong with high foreign reserves and low foreign debt.
""There will be spillover effects on Thailand, but quite limited,"" Sakkapop said.
Senior director Surach Tanboon said Thailand's monetary policy does not follow that of foreign countries, though the BOT would monitor global developments.

Earlier on Friday, Finance Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith said the government would next week consider measures to mitigate the impact of soaring fuel prices, but did not elaborate. Diesel prices would continue to be capped at 30 baht ($0.9) per litre, he added.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore could return to a small budget surplus in 2022 as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the government turning its focus to rebuilding public finances and an imminent tax hike after two years of unprecedented spending.
The transport and financial hub, seen as a bellwether of the global economy, is forecast to grow 3% to 5% this year after expanding at its fastest annual pace in over a decade in 2021.
The rebound has paved the way for the government to start raising taxes and to limit support measures to businesses yet to recover from the impact of COVID-19, such as those in the travel and hospitality sectors. 
The government had forecast a budget deficit of about S$11 billion ($8 billion), or 2.2% of gross domestic product, for the fiscal year 2021 that ends in March. The deficit ballooned to a record 13.9% of GDP in the prior year. 
The government has also had to draw from reserves to fund more than S$100 billion in support packages. 
""The urgency to beef up revenues is a priority for policymakers, putting the long-planned 2 percentage point Goods and Services Tax (GST) hike in the spotlight,"" HSBC economists said in a research note, forecasting a S$5 billion surplus for 2022. 
The government plans to raise GST to 9% from the current 7% between 2022 and 2025. At next Friday's budget, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong will likely provide a timeframe for the hike, which analysts estimate could bring in additional annual revenues of more than S$3 billion.
HSBC estimates that a 1 percentage point GST hike will add 0.5-0.7 percentage points to headline inflation in 2023 and 2024.
Singapore's central bank tightened its monetary policy settings in January on elevated inflation pressures, and is expected to tighten again in April. 
The central bank forecast core inflation to be 2.0–3.0% this year, while headline prices are expected to rise 2.5–3.5%.
While the government has already outlined a S$6 billion package to soften the blow of the GST hike for lower income households, it could also try and address the rising cost of living. 
Spending priorities are likely to focus on the funding of long-term infrastructure projects and the need to reskill or upskill the domestic labour force, OCBC Bank's Selena Ling said. 
She said the government will also spend more on healthcare due to an ageing population and towards promoting a green and sustainable economy. Ling forecast a budget surplus of S$2.7 billion for 2022, with a deficit of about S$6.8 billion in 2021. 

Some economists are expecting a carbon tax increase as well as a review of tax incentives for multi-national companies, following the global agreement on a minimum corporate tax rate.

263,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 11:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials are in no rush to raise interest rates prior to their scheduled policy meeting next month, nor is a half percentage-point move in March yet likely, despite a bigger-than-expected jump in consumer prices that stoked speculation about such options.
An emergency increase risks signaling panic and cementing criticism that the central bank is too far behind in reining in inflation, while Chair Jerome Powell only last month predicted the pace of price increases would cool later this year. Powell also has shown a preference for building consensus within the policy-setting committee, and no Fed officials are now signaling a rush to act before its March 15-16 gathering.
A rate increase before March would also involve bringing forward the conclusion of the Fed’s asset-purchase program -- enhancing the potential shock to an unprepared public. The Fed instead favors taking in further data before it makes a decision next month.
Speculation about a rare inter-meeting Fed move rose in markets Thursday after consumer inflation accelerated to a fresh 40-year high of 7.5% in January, with the annual core rate, excluding food and energy, running at 6% -- also the fastest since 1982.
Money markets suggest about even odds on the possibility of a 50 basis-point increase in March, and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard -- who votes on rates this year -- said in an interview Thursday that he favors three hikes by July, with one of them being a half-point move.
However, centrists among the top Fed officials appear skeptical of a half-point hike, and are suggesting there is little need to start a hiking cycle with an aggressive move.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Thursday that a half-point rate hike “is not my preference,” speaking to Market News. She cited the lingering drag of the pandemic and the fact that the Fed is already sending a clear message on its readiness to act. “Markets have already priced in the withdrawal of accommodation, and that is them hearing what the Fed is clearly communicating.”
Thomas Barkin, president of the Richmond Fed, had a similar view.
“I’m open to it conceptually,” he said of a half-point move, speaking Thursday at a virtual event hosted by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. “Do I think there’s a screaming need to do it right now? I’d have to be convinced of that.”
Powell is aiming for a rare soft landing, predicting that goods-price inflation will ease as supply blockages unclog. He and his colleagues will need to face down twin risks: averting a self-inflicted recession by hiking too fast, while moving quickly enough to keep public expectations about future prices in check.
Single Report
The January data offered some evidence of broadening price pressures, with an acceleration in costs for services, unrelated to supply-chain issues. However, a month of data isn’t likely to push officials to an inter-meeting hike.
Fed officials appear confident that they have the tools to lower inflation and that markets fully understand their intent to start tightening monetary conditions. When the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee next meets, officials will have a full month more of data to look at before they make a decision, while geopolitical risks in Europe have also raised uncertainty.
Investors have boosted bets on the pace of rate hikes since the Fed’s January meeting, shifting to roughly six moves this year versus the three that officials forecast in December. Fed officials aren’t pushing back against market expectations and are instead revising their own outlook for rates higher since their last forecast in December.
Earlier: Fed’s Mester Not Keen on Half-Point Hike; Bostic’s Options Open
The report “shows continued inflationary pressure in the U.S.” and “is concerning for me and for the Fed,” Bullard said in the interview with Bloomberg News. “We are going to have to be far more nimble and far more reactive to data.”
Bullard called a half-point move in March “a sensible response to a surprise inflationary shock that we got during 2021 that we did not expect,” but highlighted that he would defer to Powell.
Bullard said the Fed isn’t “in that mode” of emergency rate hikes, noting that there is little need to surprise markets now given the tightening they are pricing in already.

The change of view comes after the U.S. consumer price index report for January showed a 7.5% annual increase, the biggest since 1982. Gains were broad-based, extending beyond food and energy to categories including household furnishings and health insurance.
Economists led by Jan Hatzius are tipping the Fed will move by 25 basis points at seven consecutive meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee.
While there’s a case to be made for a 50 basis point hike in March given the combination of very high inflation, hot wage growth and high short-term inflation expectations, the indications from policy makers so far are pointing to more incremental moves, according to the Goldman analysts. 
“Most Fed officials who have commented have opposed a 50 basis points hike in March,” the Goldman analysts wrote in a note. “We therefore think that the more likely path is a longer series of 25 basis points hikes instead.”
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said he supports raising interest rates by a full percentage point by the start of July -- including the first half-point hike since 2000 -- in response to the hottest inflation in four decades.
“We would consider changing our forecast if other participants join him, especially if the market continues to price high odds of a 50 basis points move in March,” the Goldman analysts said.

WINDSOR, Ontario/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canada should use federal powers to ease the growing economic disruption caused by the blockage of a vital U.S.-Canada trade route by protesters opposed to coronavirus mandates, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration said on Thursday. 
The closure of the Ambassador Bridge, North America's busiest international land border crossing and a vital supply route for Detroit's carmakers, has halted some auto output and left officials scrambling to limit economic damage.
Canadian truckers started their protests as a ""Freedom Convoy"" occupying Ottawa, the capital, to demonstrate opposition to a vaccinate-or-quarantine mandate for cross-border drivers mirrored by the U.S. government. 
They began blocking the Ambassador Bridge on Monday and have since shut two smaller border crossings in Alberta and Manitoba provinces. 
As many pandemic-weary Western countries near the two-year mark on coronavirus restrictions, copycat protests have spread to Australia, New Zealand and France, although the wave of infections caused by the highly infectious Omicron variant has begun to subside in some places.
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Thursday urged their Canadian counterparts ""to use federal powers to resolve this situation at our joint border,"" a White House official said. 
""U.S. and Canadian border and customs authorities are working with great urgency to ensure the continued flow of goods and services across our international border, leveraging alternative land routes, as well as air and sea options.""
Canadian federal ministers have called the blockade illegal and asked protesters to return home.
In a tweet on Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had spoken to Drew Dilkens, the mayor of Windsor, Ontario, which borders Detroit, and said the federal government was ready to help Windsor and the province get the situation under control.
""It is causing real harm to workers and economies on both sides of the border,"" he said.
Police near the Ambassador Bridge have begun receiving additional manpower, Dilkens told CNN earlier.
""(If) the protesters don't leave, there will have to be a path forward. If that means physically removing them, that means physically removing them, and we're prepared to do that,"" he said.
Dilkens later said Windsor was seeking a court injunction to have the protesters removed, adding he was striving to resolve the issue peacefully. 
""(While) it may be gratifying for someone to see the forced removal of the demonstrators, such action may inflame the situation and certainly cause more folks to come here and add to the protest, and we don't want to risk additional conflict,"" he said.
DIVERTING CARGO 
With traffic at times shut in both directions, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler-parent Stellantis said they had to cancel or reduce shifts because of parts shortages, tacking on to earlier production cuts announced by Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp.
Toyota said it was suspending production through Saturday at its plants in Ontario and Kentucky, affecting manufacturing of the Camry, RAV4 and other popular models.
Ford is looking at flying in some auto parts to a plant in Windsor that produces engines for popular models, a union official said.
An Ontario court on Thursday froze funds donated to anti-vaccine protesters through the app GiveSendGo. The convoy group had raised more than $8 million as of late Thursday afternoon, the Boston-based company said.
Protesters began gathering with their vehicles in Ottawa nearly two weeks ago and have occupied the main downtown street that runs by parliament, the Bank of Canada and the prime minister's office.
MORE U.S DISRUPTION TO COME?
More than two-thirds of the $511 billion in goods traded annually between Canada and the United States is transported by road. The Detroit International Bridge Company, which owns the Ambassador Bridge, urged Canada to end the protest by repealing the vaccine mandate or remove the vehicles so trade can resume. 
A third option was to do ""nothing and hope this ends on its own: an option that will most likely prolong the blockade, further crippling our economy and putting more jobs at risk,"" the company's chairman, Matt Moroun, said in a statement. 
Seeking to show support for the Canadian protesters, some U.S. truckers said they will send two convoys this weekend to a fourth border crossing that connects Buffalo, New York, and Fort Erie, Ontario. 

The United States is adding staff to its command post at the National Football League's Super Bowl in Los Angeles in response to reports of a convoy that could cause disruptions at Sunday's game, the White House official said.
The official said the Department of Homeland Security was making preparations to ensure that a 'Freedom Convoy' event in Washington, D.C., due in early March ""does not disrupt lawful trade and transportation or interfere with federal government and law enforcement operations and emergency services.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's top central banker on Friday said it was plausible interest rates could rise later this year, but there were risks in moving too early and the bank wanted to see a couple more quarterly inflation reports before deciding.
Speaking before a parliamentary economics committee, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe said it was not yet certain that the recent pick up in inflation would last and the RBA Board was prepared to be patient to make sure.
""I think these uncertainties are not going to be resolved quickly. Another couple of CPI's would be good to see,"" said Lowe, referring to quarterly consumer price index (CPI) reports.
That would open the door to a hike in the 0.1% cash rate from August onwards, given data for the March quarter CPI is due on April 27 and the June quarter on July 27.
Financial markets are wagering it will have to move more aggressively, with futures pricing in a rise to 0.25% by June, and then four more to 1.25% by the end of the year.
This hawkish view owes much to the outlook for U.S. rates, where another shockingly high inflation reading had markets betting the Federal Reserve would hike by a full 50 basis points next month.
However, Lowe emphasised that many of the inflationary pressures seen in the United States were not present in Australia, where consumer prices were running at 3.5% and core inflation at just 2.6%.
Lowe noted core inflation had only recently returned to the RBA's target band of 2-3%, having spent seven years below 2%.
Wage growth was also lagging at 2.2%, less than half the pace of the United States or Britain, and policy makers wanted it up at 3.0% or more before withdrawing stimulus.
That gave the RBA the rare chance to try and drive unemployment down under 4% for the first time in 50 years, said Lowe. The jobless rate hit a 13-year low of 4.2% in December after falling more quickly than anyone had expected.
""Over the period ahead we have the opportunity to secure a lower rate of unemployment than was thought possible just a short while ago,"" said Lowe. ""Moving too early (on rates) could put this at risk.""
Longer term, however, Lowe was actually more hawkish on the policy outlook than markets in that he hoped real rates, adjusted for inflation, would rise enough to be positive.

Assuming inflation did average around 2.5%, that would require the cash rate to rise to at least the same level.
Markets, on the other hand, imply rates will peak around 2.0% and while yields on 10-year bonds have jumped this week, they are still negative in real terms at 2.16%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday he had done a thorough check on about four potential nominees for the Supreme Court and that he expects whomever he chooses will get some Republican support in the U.S. Senate.
""What I've done is I've taken about four people and done the deep dive on them, meaning ... thorough background checks,"" Biden told NBC News before meeting at the White House with 10 of the 11 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Committee Chairman Dick Durbin said the lawmakers shared some of their recommendations with Biden, but conveyed their trust in his judgment. Biden told them he expected to begin meeting with potential nominees soon, Durbin told reporters.
""We understand we're making history here. His decision to appoint a Black woman to the Supreme Court is literally going to change the face of the court for the future, for our history in the United States,"" he said. ""We're anxious to get started.""
Biden, who heads to the presidential retreat of Camp David this weekend, has also spoken with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and is seeking the advice of other Republican lawmakers, the White House said. 
Biden has said he will announce his choice to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer by the end of February and has promised to name the first Black woman to the high court. The nomination must be confirmed by the Senate.
""I'm not looking to make an ideological choice,"" Biden told NBC News. ""I'm looking for someone to replace Judge Breyer with the same kind of capacity Judge Breyer had, with an open mind who understands the Constitution, interprets it in a way that is consistent with the mainstream interpretation of the Constitution,"" he said.
Durbin and the other Democrats who met with Biden vowed to work hard to ensure that whomever Biden picked was confirmed by the Senate as quickly as possible.
Senator Patrick Leahy, a long-time member of the Judiciary Committee, said he has voted on 21 Supreme Court nominations but told reporters this one was ""the historic one.""
""This is going to affect our country, our image abroad,"" he said. ""It is going to do so much for young people, older people, white and black. I know the reaction has been in my family, 'Thank God. At last, at last, at last.'""
Fourteen Black female lawmakers from the House of Representatives on Thursday urged Biden to pick a candidate with ""an established record of working to advance racial justice and eradicating entrenched white supremacy.""
""It is long past time for a Black woman to be on the Supreme Court, and we commend your unwavering commitment to correcting this long-standing injustice on the nation’s highest court,"" the group, led by Representative Cori Bush, told Biden in a letter.
They noted that there was not a single Black woman serving in the U.S. Senate who could vote to confirm his nominee. 
Senator Mazie Hirono told reporters that Biden's pledge to nominate a Black woman to the court was resonated strongly with people of color. 
Senator Richard Blumenthal said the goal was to ensure bipartisan support for the nominee, and added his hope that the new justice could help bring together the deeply divided body.
Republican Senator Mitt Romney, asked about the issue on Wednesday, said he would like to see a nominee ""who could represent the mainstream of judicial thought.""
Potential nominees include Ketanji Brown Jackson, a former Breyer law clerk confirmed by the Senate last June to serve on an influential U.S. appellate court, and Leondra Kruger, who serves on the California Supreme Court. Another potential contender is Michelle Childs, a federal district court judge in South Carolina who Biden already has nominated to the U.S. appeals court in Washington.

Biden's selection will not shift the court's ideological balance. It has six conservative justices, three of whom were named by former President Donald Trump, and three liberal justices.
Biden's fellow Democrats control the Senate by a razor-thin margin. They can confirm a nominee without a single Republican vote because Republicans in 2017 changed the Senate rules to no longer require 60 of the 100 senators to allow Supreme Court nominations to move forward.

(Reuters) - Pressure increased on the Federal Reserve on Thursday to take a stronger stand against inflation after an unexpectedly large jump in U.S. consumer prices defied hopes that the pocketbook squeeze would ease and bolstered the view that the U.S. central bank is behind the curve. 
In the hours after a government report showed consumer prices rose at their fastest pace since the early 1980s, traders piled into previously improbable bets that the Fed will start its coming round of rate hikes with a ""big bang"" 50 basis-point rate hike. One Fed policymaker who just last week said such a move was unnecessary said he had changed his mind. The yield on two-year Treasuries rose the most since June 5, 2009.
The massive market shift and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard's embrace of a full percentage point's worth of rate hikes over the next four months suggests an internal Fed debate over how fast and high to raise interest rates will only intensify ahead of the next rate-decision meeting on March 15-16.
Until this moment, Fed policymakers had largely resisted the idea of a half-point hike, which they have not used since May 2000 and not at the outset of a rate-hike cycle since probably the 1980s, before the Fed's rate hike decisions were published. 
""I don't think there's any compelling case to start with a 50 basis-point"" rate increase, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, often among the Fed's more hawkish voices, said on Wednesday. Interest-rate futures were pricing in about a one-in-four chance of that happening.
Fast forward a day, and the latest U.S. inflation reading tipped that on its head. Household prices were up 7.5% in the 12 months through January, the Labor Department reported.
Market participants began pricing a hefty chance of a half-percentage-point rate hike in March. Then Bullard - who last week agreed with Mester - told Bloomberg News he had become ""dramatically"" more hawkish. 
That sealed the deal for markets. At day's end rate futures were pricing in a half-point rate hike in March with just a scant chance of a smaller quarter-point hike, and heavy bets for a policy path that would bring rates to a range of 1.75%-2.00% by the end of the year. 
(Graphic: A rate hike for the ages?, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/zjpqkamgmpx/chart.png) 
Fed policymakers had already flagged that they will begin raising the central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero at the March meeting, just days after they stop their two-year spree of buying billions in government bonds each month. It began the bond purchases to keep financial conditions loose and spur borrowing amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
By many measures they are already late to the party, with inflation at its highest level in 40 years and a super-tight labor market at odds with a Fed only just getting ready to remove crisis-era policy support.
""All this logically supports a 50 basis-point move in March,"" said Karim Basta, chief economist at III Capital Management. ""Whether the Fed ditches its gradualist approach remains the most relevant question.""
To Mark Cabana, head of U.S. interest rates strategy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Global Research, the case is only getting stronger. 
""Are you going to tell the market that it's wrong and you need to go slower?"" Cabana said. ""If the market gives the Fed the option, we do not believe that the Fed will tell the market that it's wrong."" 
Economists at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) on Thursday said they now think the Fed will kick off its policy tightening with a 50 basis-point hike next month.
And Tim Duy, economist for SGH Macro Advisors, said he would not be surprised if the Fed in the next few days abruptly ended bond purchases and raised interest rates. ""The Fed needs to do something significant to establish even a minimal amount of credibility on inflation,"" he wrote.
Still, many economists for now are predicting the U.S. central bank will stick to quarter-percentage-point increments for future rate increases. 
Instead of going bigger to start, they say, the Fed could just speed up the pace of rate hikes or reduce its balance sheet sooner and more sharply. 
With one more big inflation reading and more jobs data due before the March meeting, the jury for most Fed officials is likely still out. 
""We'll see what we get by the time we get to March,"" Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said Thursday at a virtual meeting of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. 
Asked about the possibility of a 50-basis point hike, Barkin said: ""I'd have to be convinced on that.""
(Graphic: Fighting the Fed, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/xmvjojybxpr/chart.png) 
BOXED IN?
The Fed is leery of spooking financial markets, which have required diligent handholding in recent years to avoid a knee-jerk tightening of financial conditions and repeats of episodes like the 2013 ""taper tantrum,"" which was widely seen as a communications misstep.
A half-percentage-point hike in March would not itself hurt the economy, economists say, but the signal it sends about the future path of policy could. 
""The market goes from pricing five (quarter-percentage-point rate hikes) to pricing eight, 10 and then you are potentially causing some real sharpening in financial conditions,"" said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies. 
""They are way behind the curve, and I think they have a lot of catching up to do,"" Markowska added, ""but I think it makes sense to move, not slowly, but not too aggressively.""
Keeping rate hikes to 25 basis-point increments allows the Fed to better tailor policy to the data if inflation soon cools on its own, as Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said earlier this week he thinks is likely. 
That could still come to pass if supply chains get untangled and an easing COVID-19 pandemic allows more people to return to work, reducing price and labor-market pressures without the need for steep rate hikes. 

But Narayana Kocherlakota, an economics professor at the University of Rochester known for his dovish views after the 2007-2009 recession when he was the Minneapolis Fed's president, expects dissents, including perhaps from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, should the central bank not go harder in March.
""I think going 50 now also puts it on the table in every meeting going forward ... so it expands optionality in a big and useful way,"" he said. Much-higher-than-expected inflation, he said, ""deserves an aggressive response.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury yield curve has been flattening over the last few months as the Federal Reserve prepares to hike rates, and some analysts are forecasting more extreme moves or even inversion. 
Unabated inflation supports their argument, with recent consumer prices readings fueling market expectations that the Fed may increase rates more aggressively than anticipated to cool the economy. 
The shape of the yield curve is a key metric investors watch as it impacts other asset prices, feeds through to banks' returns and even predicts how the economy will fare. Here's a quick primer explaining what a steep, flat or inverted yield curve means and whether it will forecast the next U.S. recession. 
WHAT IS THE U.S. TREASURY YIELD CURVE? 
The U.S. Treasury finances federal government budget obligations by issuing various forms of debt. The $23 trillion Treasury market includes Treasury bills with maturities from one month out to one year, notes from two years to 10 years, as well as 20-and 30-year bonds.
The yield curve plots the yield of all Treasury securities.
WHAT SHOULD THE CURVE LOOK LIKE? 
Typically, the curve slopes upwards because investors expect more compensation for taking on the risk that rising inflation will lower the expected return from owning longer-dated bonds. That means a 10-year note typically yields more than a 2-year note because it has a longer duration. Yields move inversely to prices. 
A steepening curve typically signals expectations of stronger economic activity, higher inflation, and higher interest rates. A flattening curve can mean the opposite: investors expect rate hikes in the near term and have lost confidence in the economy's growth outlook.
WHY IS THE YIELD CURVE FLATTENING NOW? 
Yields of short-term U.S. government debt have been rising fast this year reflecting expectations of a series of rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, while longer-dated government bond yields have moved at a slower pace amid concerns that policy tightening may hurt the economy.
As a result, the shape of the Treasury yield curve has been generally flattening. A closely watched part of the curve, measuring the spread between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, shows the gap at roughly 47 basis points, 30 points lower than where it ended 2021. That flattening increased on Thursday after data showing U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in January. 
While rate increases can be a weapon against inflation, they can also slow economic growth by increasing the cost of borrowing for everything from mortgages to car loans.
Two-year U.S. Treasury yields, which track short-term interest-rate expectations, have risen to 1.54% from 0.73% at the end of last year - a 110% increase.
U.S. benchmark 10-year yields have gone up to about 2.01% from 1.5%, a 34% rise. They topped the 2% level for the first time on Thursday since 2019. 
WHAT DOES AN INVERTED CURVE MEAN, AND WILL IT HAPPEN?
Some investors and strategists are starting to forecast a curve inversion could happen as soon as this year - an ominous sign.
The U.S. curve has inverted before each recession since 1955, with a recession following between six and 24 months later, according to a 2018 report by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. It offered a false signal just once in that time.
The last time the yield curve inverted was in 2019. The following year, the United States entered a recession - albeit one caused by the global pandemic.
Strategists at  Standard Chartered  bank (LON:STAN) forecast the curve to be completely flat by mid-year and potentially invert by year-end.
Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, has also warned about a possible curve inversion.
DOES THE WHOLE CURVE INVERT OR PARTS OF IT? 
Traders typically watch the shape of the curve determined by comparing two-year and 10-year Treasury notes, because a yield curve inversion on that spread has anticipated previous recessions. That is currently flattening but not yet close to inversion - the spread was at 46.4 basis points after narrowing to 43.73, the smallest spread since August 11, 2020.
But distortions can occur anywhere along the curve without inverting the entire curve.
On Thursday, a less closely watched part of the curve inverted intraday, with the premium of U.S. Treasury 10-year notes over seven-year Treasuries going briefly into negative territory.
The 20-year/30-year spread has been negative since late October, though supply and demand technical factors may have contributed to that. 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE REAL WORLD? 
Aside from signals it may flash on the economy, the shape of the yield curve has ramifications for consumers and business. 

When short-term rates increase, U.S. banks tend to raise their benchmark rates for a wide range of consumer and commercial loans, including small business loans and credit cards, making borrowing more expensive for consumers. Mortgage rates also rise.
When the yield curve steepens, banks are able to borrow money at lower interest rates and lend at higher interest rates. Conversely, when the curve is flatter they find their margins squeezed, which may deter lending.

(Reuters) -Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Tom Barkin on Thursday said he would be ""conceptually"" open to raising interest rates by a bigger-than-usual half-of-a-percentage point increment, but does not see a need for it now. 
""Do I think there's a screaming need to do it right now?"" Barkin said at a virtual meeting at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, after several questions pressing him about the possibility. ""I'd have to be convinced on that."" 
Traders on Thursday newly priced in such a rate hike after a a government report showed consumer prices rising at a nearly 40-year high and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he had become dramatically more hawkish and now wants rates to rise a full percentage point by July 1. 

Barkin said he expects the Fed to move interest rates up ""steadily"" towards neutral and wants to bring interest rates back to pre-pandemic levels ""relatively soon."" 
""I do think it's time to start normalizing policy,"" Barkin said, adding that as far as the pace and scope of raising rates and reducing the Fed's balance sheet, policymaker decisions will depend on the economic data.

CULPEPER, Va. (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday said he expected inflation to start to ease this year as supply chain logjams clear up, while saying that his administration was already helping ease shortages, as new data showed the biggest jump in consumer prices in 40 years.
Biden told NBC News that efforts by his administration to address the shortage of semiconductors that sent car prices soaring last year were starting to pay off.
Rising consumer prices ""ought to be able to start to taper off as we go through this year,"" Biden said. ""In the meantime, I'm going to do everything in my power to deal with the big points that are impacting most people in their homes.""
Biden earlier in the day told an event in Virginia that proposals included in his signature Build Back Better legislation would help bring down prices for families. The roughly $1.7 trillion bill, which includes social spending and climate change provisions, is stalled and Biden has said previously that chunks, rather than the full package, could pass.
U.S. stock indexes ended sharply lower on Thursday after the consumer price data raised fears of a hefty interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. Consumer prices in the 12 months through January rose 7.5%, the biggest jump since February 1982, according to the Labor Department.
Part of Biden's Build Back Better plan would give the federal government's Medicare program for seniors authorization to negotiate drug prices for the first time.
""The fact is that if we are able to do the things I'm talking about here, it'll bring down the cost for average families,"" Biden said.
Noting that Build Back Better had already passed the House of Representatives, Biden said, ""Now we just have to get it through the United States Senate. And we're close. 
""We can do even more to lower out-of-pocket prescription costs,"" he said. ""Under my proposal, we will hold drug companies accountable for the absurd price increases.""
The Democrats hold a razor-thin majority in the Senate, providing little leeway given that Republicans have been opposed to allowing the government to negotiate prescription drug costs.

High inflation and fatigue over the ongoing pandemic have hurt Biden's popularity with Americans, causing concern for his fellow Democrats, who risk losing control of both houses of Congress in the November midterm elections.
Biden was joined by Democratic Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, who could face a tough re-election fight in November, and Xavier Becerra, his secretary of Health and Human Services, who has faced criticism for a low-profile role in the administration's fight against COVID-19. Biden praised Becerra for ""how much he's helped us make so much progress in getting people vaccinated"" and making healthcare affordable.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is seeking the first-ever consultations with Mexico over its environmental obligations under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, including protection of the critically endangered vaquita porpoise, U.S. trade officials said Thursday.
The formal talks - which could ultimately result in trade sanctions - will also focus on Mexico's obligations to prevent illegal fishing and trafficking of the critically endangered totoaba fish, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) said in a statement.
Vaquita become entangled and die in fishing gear set to catch shrimp, totoaba - a large fish in demand in China for its swim bladder - and other finfish. 
""There are serious concerns about Mexico's enforcement of its environmental laws in compliance with its USMCA obligations related to the protection of endangered species, the prevention of illegal fishing, and the trafficking of fish,"" Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jayme White told reporters.
He said USTR hoped to reach a negotiated settlement with Mexico as a result of the formal consultations, but the trade deal also provided ""additional tools"" if the talks failed.
Senior USTR officials said the trade agreement called for the consultations to be scheduled within 30 days, and would involve technical experts, although an extension was possible.
If no agreement is reached, U.S. officials could request a dispute settlement panel after a minimum of 75 days had passed, which could ultimately result in tariffs or other trade sanctions, the USTR officials said.
""This is a big move that could save these little porpoises from extinction,"" said Sarah Uhlemann, international program director at the Center for Biological Diversity. ""Illegal fishing is out of control in Mexican waters, and the vaquita is paying the highest possible price.""
Mexico's Economy Ministry said in a statement it had received a request for consultations on the issue with the United States. The ministry said it would coordinate the work between authorities from the two countries ""with the objective of timely presenting the efforts and measures adopted to protect marine species in the national waters.""
""The Government of Mexico reaffirms its commitment to the correct implementation of the T-MEC and the responsibilities acquired within it,"" the statement said, using the Spanish acronym for the USMCA.

Environmental groups urged USTR in August to initiate proceedings against Mexico over its ongoing failure to crack down on rampant illegal fishing in the Gulf of California that has caused the vaquita's near-extinction.
USTR said the most recent data showed that at least six, but likely fewer than 19 vaquita remained on earth, but experts believe that the species remains biologically viable if given the space to recover.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration on Thursday unveiled its plan to award nearly $5 billion over five years to build thousands of electric vehicle charging stations.
Congress approved the funding to states as part of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill in November.
The White House wants to prod Americans to move away from gasoline-powered vehicles even as efforts to win substantial additional funding for EVs in Congress have stalled.
The administration will make $615 million available in 2022 but states must first submit plans and win federal approval.
""We're not going to dictate to the states how to do this, but we do need to make sure that there are meet basic standards,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at a press conference.
Buttigieg told Reuters that the United States faces different EV network challenges in rural and urban areas. 
""It's got to be customized, which is exactly why we have the states coming to us with plans rather than the other way around,"" he said.
By 2030, Biden wants 50% of all new vehicles sold to be electric or plug-in hybrid electric models and 500,000 new EV charging stations; he has not endorsed phasing out new gasoline-powered vehicle sales by 2030.
The Biden administration said in guidance Thursday states should first prioritize investments along interstate highways. It also says:
* States should fund DC Fast Chargers; stations should have at least four ports capable of simultaneously charging four EVs.
* States should install EV charging infrastructure every 50 miles along interstate highways and be located within 1 mile of highways.
* Federal funds will cover 80% of EV charging costs, with private or state funds making up the balance.
The White House endorsed legislation https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/retooling-auto-plants-evs-will-cost-billions-biden-wants-help-2021-11-17 stalled in Congress to increase current $7,500 EV tax credits to up to $12,500 for union-made U.S. vehicles, create credits of up to $4,000 for used EVs.
That bill includes a 30% credit for commercial electric vehicles, $3.5 billion for converting U.S. factories for EV production and $9 billion for the U.S. Postal Service and federal government to buy EVs and charging stations.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told Reuters the government wants to ""attract more charging companies to start here.""
Asked about some lawmakers' concerns about high fuel prices, Granholm said ""medium term the shift to electric vehicles is to get ourselves away from the volatility of fossil fuels ... We won't be held hostage to solar power.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Reserve should stop buying bonds immediately to contain rampant inflation, a top investment manager at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) said on Thursday, joining a chorus of Wall Street heavy hitters and investors who have been calling for swifter Fed action to contain rising prices.
U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in January, leading to the biggest annual increase in inflation in 40 years and fueling market expectations that the Fed may increase rates more aggressively than anticipated to cool the economy.
As it seeks to contain inflation, the U.S. central bank also plans to reduce its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet, which grew in size during the COVID-19 pandemic as the Fed bought bonds in the market to support the economy.
After the pandemic-triggered recession, the Fed was buying $120 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month. While it has reduced that amount, it is still making purchases. At the latest meeting https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220126a1.pdf, the Fed said that beginning February it would increase holdings of Treasury securities by at least $20 billion a month and mortgage backed securities by at least $10 billion a month, and would bring those purchases to an end in early March. 
""The Fed is still infusing the system with QE through the middle part of March"", said Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income, referring to quantitative easing - the Fed's bond-buying programme.
""The Fed needs to react and address today’s high levels of inflation and end QE now,"" Rieder said in a note, after the publication on Thursday of higher-than-anticipated January inflation data.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit 2% on Thursday for the first time since August 2019 after the inflation reading. 
'INCONSISTENT'
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Chief Executive James Gorman said in December the Fed should have moved ""quicker rather than later"" in the transition to a rising interest-rate environment.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Chief Executive Charlie Scharf also said that month the Fed needed to potentially move quicker to address inflation concerns.
Investors have voiced similar concerns regarding the Fed's speed of action.
Kelsey Berro, fixed income portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said she was hoping the Fed would end quantitative easing earlier than March.
""Because what's the point? We all know that the economy doesn't need QE anymore and ending it a month early to clear the way for a rate hike in March just makes a lot more sense"".
For Sonal Desai, chief investment officer of Franklin Templeton Fixed Income, the Fed missed an opportunity in January when it announced plans to hike rates and reduce its balance sheet while continuing to buy bonds until March.
""They continue to expand that balance sheet after acknowledging that they don't need to do this anymore"", she told Reuters last month.
""They recognise inflation is a problem, however, they're still going to expand monetary policy... to me that seems internally inconsistent"", she added.

While the Fed's response to the pandemic has been ""heroic"", Rieder said, it was now time to move swiftly to a neutral policy stance, avoiding at the same time a too restrictive tightening of monetary policies.
""We think policy needs to adjust quickly, but not necessarily too much in total amount as the Fed weighs data over time, since this would create significant risk for markets and the economy"", he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Federal funds rate futures on Thursday have boosted the chances of a half percentage-point tightening by the Federal Reserve at next month's meeting after hawkish comments from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and following hotter-than-expected U.S. consumer prices data for January.
In late afternoon trading, rate futures showed a 62% chance that the Fed will raise interest rates by 50 basis points in March following Bullard's remarks, from a 30% chance late on Wednesday. For the year, futures have priced in 164 basis points of policy tightening.
Other metrics such as the CME FedWatch tool showed a 95% probability of a 50 basis point hike in March.
Bullard, a voter on the Federal Open Market Committee this year, told Bloomberg on Thursday he has become ""dramatically"" more hawkish in light of the hottest inflation reading in nearly 40 years. He now wants a full percentage point of interest rate hikes over the next three U.S. central bank policy meetings.
Data showed the CPI index gained 0.6% last month after increasing 0.6% in December. In the 12 months through January, the CPI jumped 7.5%, the biggest year-on-year increase since February 1982. Economists had forecast a 7.3% increase.
Bullard in his comments said he did not think such a move would be a ""shock and awe"" approach but rather a ""sensible response"" to the unexpected inflation shock.
Some analysts, however, believe the Fed will maintain a gradual approach in tightening monetary policy despite higher-than-expected inflation.
""We all expected an acceleration here…is 7.5% to 7.3% the difference between a 25 and a 50 (basis point hike)? No,"" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist, at RBC Capital Markets in New York. 
""I sincerely hope that the Fed's reaction function is not that sensitive to this kind of miss. Because the reality is we've had firm inflation now for months. 
In a blog, ActionEconomics noted that Bullard has a ""very hawkish reputation and has often been on the fringe,"" adding it would monitor further comments from other Fed officials. 
Following the inflation data, the yield on the U.S. benchmark 10-year note hit 2% for the first time in 2-1/2 years, rising as high as 2.056%. It was last at 2.0539%.
The U.S. 2-year/10-year yield gap flattened to 43.7 basis points, the tightest spread since August 2020, as traders priced in hikes that should push short-term rates higher.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) in a research note on Thursday said it has revised its Fed hike forecast this year to five rate increases from three.
""Following today's January CPI release, which included core inflationary pressures that exceeded our expectation by one-tenth, and the January employment report, which, after revisions, revealed a hiring rate that was more durable than prior data suggested, we alter our outlook in favor of a more front-loaded policy response from the Fed,"" Barclays wrote.

The bank added that its new policy forecast implied an end to the tightening cycle in mid-2023, with a terminal target range for the fed funds rate of 1.75-2.0%. That was 25 basis points higher and six months sooner, Barclays said.
The fed funds rate has been near zero since March 2020, when the Fed slashed rates to cushion the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp , General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Chrysler-parent Stellantis said they had been forced to cancel or scale back some production at North American plants on Thursday because of parts shortages stemming from Canadian trucker protests against pandemic mandates.
The truckers, who oppose a vaccinate-or-quarantine requirement for cross-border drivers, have used their big rigs to snarl traffic https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-canada-border-closures-risk-trade-more-govt-action-is-likely-2022-02-10 at the Ambassador Bridge linking Detroit and Windsor, Ontario - which accounts for about 25% of U.S.-Canadian trade.
A Toyota spokesman told Reuters the automaker was suspending production through Saturday at plants on both sides of the border, in Ontario and Kentucky. The largest Japanese automaker said it was ""experiencing multiple dropped logistics routes"" and it is ""not isolated to only one or two parts at this point.""
The shortages affected Toyota's production of the RAV4 - the best-selling non-truck vehicle in the United States, Camry, Avalon, Lexus RX and Lexus ES, the automaker said.
Ford said it was running its plants in Windsor and Oakville, another Canadian city, at reduced capacity. It added that it hoped for a quick resolution ""because it could have widespread impact on all automakers in the U.S. and Canada.""
Stellantis said some U.S. and Canadian plants cut short shifts on Thursday after many shortened shifts Wednesday night ""due to parts shortages caused by the closure of the Detroit/Windsor bridge.""
GM said it was forced to halt production Thursday at a Michigan plant where it builds sport utility vehicles after the protests.
The largest U.S. automaker said it had canceled a shift on Wednesday and two shifts Thursday at its Lansing Delta Township plant.
Shilpan Amin, GM's vice president for global purchasing and supply chain, told suppliers on Thursday in a message seen by Reuters that ""although we may have intermittent stoppages, we intend to keep production running and meet current schedules at all of our manufacturing operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.""
The company added it was ""encouraging suppliers to evaluate alternative options in order to sustain your operations to meet our production schedules.""
Honda said its Alliston, Ontario plant temporarily suspended manufacturing on one production line Wednesday evening due to border delays but was back online.
Stellantis said the ""situation at the Ambassador Bridge, combined with an already fragile supply chain, will bring further hardship to people and industries still struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.""
""We hope a resolution can be reached soon so our plants and our employees can return to normal operations,"" Stellantis added. 
The White House said Wednesday it was talking to automakers, Canada and customs officials to try avoid disruptions to auto production.

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday called on Canada to reopen the Ambassador Bridge, as did U.S. Representatives Debbie Dingell and Dan Kildee.
""It is imperative that Canadian local, provincial, and national governments de-escalate this economic blockade,"" Whitmer said. ""They must take all necessary and appropriate steps to immediately and safely reopen traffic.""

(Reuters) - OnlyFans, an online subscription platform known for adult content, has launched a feature for users to display verified NFTs as profile pictures, it said on Thursday.
The UK-based company, which said it introduced the feature in December, joins social media companies such as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Reddit that have explored ways to incorporate the digital tokens on their platforms.
OnlyFans, which was launched in 2016, boomed during the pandemic as it became a way for creators to earn money selling content directly to subscribers.
NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of digital asset that exist on the record-keeping technology blockchain. They have surged in popularity over the last year, with people buying artwork and videos of sports highlights as NFTs.
""Our mission is to empower creators to own their full potential,"" OnlyFans Chief Executive Officer Ami Gan said in a statement to Reuters. ""This feature is the first step in exploring the role that NFTs can play on our platform.""
OnlyFans said it only supports NFTs minted on the ethereum blockchain. It said creators' NFT profile pictures would show an ethereum icon to mark them as authentic. 
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube this week elaborated on its own plans around NFTs, saying it could offer ways to verify the legitimacy of digital assets using its video library. Sales of NFTs soared last year, but critics have said scams, copyright theft and other predatory behavior are too common. 

Instagram's head Adam Mosseri has also said the company is working on NFTs.
In December, OnlyFans founder Tim Stokely said he was stepping down as CEO and would be replaced by Gan, who was previously its chief marketing officer.

Four of the Bank of Mexico's board, including new governor Victoria Rodriguez, voted for the half a percentage point increase, while member Gerardo Esquivel voted for a 25 basis points hike to 5.75%, the bank said in a policy statement.
Saying ""new governor, same script"", Nikhil Sanghani, an economist at Capital Economics, noted Rodriguez had sided with the majority in maintaining the bank's hawkish stance.
""As we suspected, the new governor Victoria Rodriguez did not want to rock the boat,"" Sanghani said in a research note.
Banxico said in its statement that inflationary pressures have been greater and lasted longer than anticipated, noting that forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised upwards, especially for 2022 and the first quarter of 2023.
The bank underscored that the balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation remains biased to the upside.
Analysts have said expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will start raising rates would be top of mind for Banxico board members when considering what to do with rates at home.
Core inflation in Mexico in January surged to heights not seen since 2001, and though headline inflation eased slightly to 7.07%, it was still more than double Banxico's target rate of 3%, official data showed on Wednesday.

""With inflation likely to remain well above target over the coming months, the board remaining hawkish under the new governor, and the Fed set to start hiking too, it's clear that the tightening cycle has further to run,"" Sanghani said.
He forecast three more 50 basis point hikes in the coming months, taking the policy rate to 7.50%. After that, as headline and core inflation eased towards target, ""policymakers should take their foot off the brake pedal,"" he said.

281,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 02:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden called on lawmakers to pass his plan to lower prescription drugs prices, saying he’s seeking to reduce rising costs faced by families at a time when inflation is surging.
“Bringing down the cost of healthcare, bringing down the cost of prescription drugs is an easy thing for us to do,” Biden said Thursday in Culpeper, Virginia. “It can be done legally with the stroke of a pen.”
Biden is seeking to address drug prices and other pocketbook issues ahead of this year’s midterm elections as rising consumer prices threaten Democrats’ control of Congress. 
The president’s comments came the same day Labor Department data showed U.S. consumer prices surged in January by more than expected, sending the annual inflation rate to a fresh four-decade high of 7.5%.
The president on Thursday also said he’d “work like the devil” to bring down surging gasoline prices. “Coming from a family when the cost of gas went up, you felt it in the household, you knew what it was like, it matters,” Biden said.
Biden’s stalled $2 trillion Build Back Better social spending plan seeks to lower prescription medication costs for people with Medicare and private insurance by allowing the federal government to negotiate the price of some drugs, cap out-of-pocket spending for some Medicare enrollees and limit costs for insulin.
“What we’re proposing is that we negotiate fair prices,” Biden said.
GOP senators oppose Biden’s Build Back Better plan and moderate Democrats Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have raised objections. Biden has said the package would have to be broken up to make it through Congress but he still hopes some “chunks” of the bill will survive. 
Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders and Senator Amy Klobuchar are pushing leaders to quickly move a standalone bill to cut drug prices -- a move that would require 60 votes to pass in the evenly divided chamber.
While Manchin has said he supports efforts to reduce drug prices, Democrats in both the House and Senate balked at major drug price controls last year.
Accompanying the president in Virginia was Democratic Representative Abigail Spanberger, who is facing a tough re-election battle following Virginia’s redistricting of its congressional map.
Spanberger is competing in a substantially redrawn 7th District, whose boundaries shifted north, eliminating portions of suburban Richmond that heavily supported her. A group of GOP challengers is trying to unseat her.

The building block for most cookies, cakes, breads and pastries has spiked 10.3% in the past year, the biggest jump since 2011, U.S. government data released Thursday show. That’s among the highest inflation rates for any category of food outside of meat, eggs and oils.
The cost of basic ingredients has been climbing amid supply chain woes and labor shortfalls, and wheat is no exception. This week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture in its widely followed global supply and demand report pared back its estimate for world wheat supplies, signaling some tightness ahead. Meanwhile, “with higher wheat prices, we are seeing some pushback” from retail consumers with sticker shock, said Farm Futures analyst Jacqueline Holland.
Rising prices have already started to hit U.S. bakeries, which buy much larger quantities than your average household. At Baked and Wired in Washington D.C., menu prices have already gone up “at least twice” since the pandemic started, said representative Ryan Henson. Now, it’s been forced to scale back cake production, too, thanks to skyrocketing prices of flour, along with milk and eggs.

The bakery used to sell cakes every day of the week, but since last month, it only sells limited quantities on Saturdays. Before the pandemic, a 50-pound bag of flour cost $8; now it’s roughly $17.
“It’s crazy,” said Henson. “We can’t offer as many things as we normally do.”
Price-sensitive Valentine’s Day shoppers won’t be able to turn to chocolate for help, either. Cocoa prices in New York neared a two-year high Thursday amid dry weather that has curbed harvest yields.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Canadian research note calling ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva a possible ""savior"" of Brazil's sluggish economy has stoked debate in financial markets over increasingly bullish foreign investors eyeing a return of the left-wing leader.
BCA Research analysts raised their recommendation on Brazilian equities and sovereign debt to ""overweight"" in a note published this week, based on ""rising odds"" of Lula winning the presidential election in October.
""Lula's current policy proposals and his agenda following the election will be moderate, providing a positive impetus to financial markets,"" wrote the BCA analysts, led by Chief Emerging Markets Strategist Arthur Budaghyan, in a note titled ""Is Lula Brazil's Savior?""
The outlook comes as foreign flows into Brazilian financial markets have surged to $9.5 billion so far this year, boosting the local currency 7% against the dollar as the benchmark Bovespa stock index has risen 8%.
Much of that has come from a belief among global investors that Lula, who enjoys a double-digit lead over right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro in recent opinion polls, will take a pragmatic approach to policy, as prominent Brazilian hedge fund managers flagged during an event last week. 
While many domestic investors rue the demise of a reform agenda that Bolsonaro promised on taking office, foreign investors take comfort in memories of the orthodox economic policies Lula adopted early in his 2003-2010 presidency.
""The leading candidate in the polls has a positive international image. He is not unknown, he is a candidate who has been tried,"" said Gabriel Galipolo, former CEO of Banco Fator and managing partner of Galipolo Consultancy.
He highlighted that Brazil is one of several emerging markets lifted in recent weeks by investors shifting out of the U.S. tech sector and toward other high-yielding assets. Brazilian interest rates have also climbed into double digits as the central bank battles inflation aggressively, which has also lured financial flows.
Another chief economist at a Brazilian bank told Reuters Lula's proposals to re-ignite growth with public investments and more generous social programs may even be good for the economy.
Policymaking under Bolsonaro has been torn lately between an economy minister intent on fiscal discipline and allies in Congress eager to spend on pork barrel projects. In contrast, Lula has proven to be a nimble negotiator in Congress.
""A Lula government would also have more ability to move between congressmen,"" said the economist, requesting anonymity to avoid political blowback.

However, even the most optimistic investors recognize the challenge in coming years of stabilizing public debt levels, which now stand at 80.3% of gross domestic product.
""In the long run, odds are that Lula's government will attempt to 'inflate its way out of debt,'"" the BCA analysts told clients. ""Hence, our long-term strategy on Brazil remains intact: long stocks but hedge currency risk.""

(Reuters) -St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Thursday that he has become ""dramatically"" more hawkish in light of the hottest inflation reading in nearly 40 years, and he now wants a full percentage point of interest rate hikes over the next three U.S. central bank policy meetings. 
Within minutes, Bullard's view became the market's view, with rate futures contracts now fully pricing an increase in the Fed's target range for its policy rate to 1%-1.25% by the end of its policy meeting in June, with some bets on an even steeper rate hike path. 
""I'd like to see 100 basis points in the bag by July 1,"" Bullard told Bloomberg News in an interview, after a U.S. government report showed inflation rose 7.5% in the 12 months through January. 
With only three Fed meetings between now and July 1, Bullard's comments point to at least one half-percentage-point rate hike, a big move the Fed hasn't made in any recent rate-hiking cycle.

Contracts traded at CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) are now fully pricing in a half-percentage-point interest rate increase in March - up from about a 25% chance of such a hike on Wednesday.

The investment would take up half of the EU's 300-billion-euro Global Gateway scheme, which that was launched in December with the aim of strengthening Europe's supply chains and fighting climate change in sectors including health, energy and transport.
It comes as many European states seek to reduce illegal migration from Africa, driven in part by poverty and joblessness, and as fossil fuel producers in Africa bristle against the strict carbon reduction goals set by richer nations to reduce global warming. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the regional plan at a news conference in Dakar with Senegalese President Macky Sall.
How the funds will be disbursed or spent is not yet clear.
At the launch of the Gateway fund in December, the EU said the money would come in the form of grants, loans or guarantees from EU institutions, governments, EU financial institutions and national development banks. 
An EU source said the 150 billion could come in payments of 20 billion per year, of which only 6 billion would come from EU funds and the rest from EU states and private investors. 
China launched its Belt and Road project in 2013 to boost trade links with the rest of the world, and has been spending heavily on the development of infrastructure in dozens of countries around the world, not least in Africa.

EU officials say the financing terms offered by Beijing are often unfavourable and opaque, and make some poorer countries, especially in Africa, dependent on China through debt.

""We have been using every tool at our disposal, and while today is a reminder that Americans’ budgets are being stretched in ways that create real stress at the kitchen table, there are also signs that we will make it through this challenge"", Biden said in a statement.

Biden also said forecasters projected that inflation will ease by the end of 2022. The president added that his administration's policies had led to a decline in new unemployment claims, which he described as a sign of ""real progress"".
U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in January, leading to the biggest annual increase in inflation in 40 years, fueling financial markets speculation for a 50 basis points interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve next month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Civil rights groups on Thursday asked President Joe Biden's administration to disavow century-old Supreme Court rulings suffused with racist language that gave the government license to treat people living in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories differently than other Americans.
The 13 groups, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland that the Justice Department should publicly condemn a series of rulings in the early 1900s called the Insular Cases. 
The activists pointed to Biden's January 2021 executive order in which he pledged to advance racial equity. Other groups signing the letter included the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the Hispanic Federation, a Latino advocacy group.
The rulings, starting in 1901, came in the aftermath of the acquisition of overseas territories following the 1898 Spanish-American War and established that Puerto Ricans and those living in some other U.S. territories do not possess the same rights under the U.S. Constitution as people living in U.S. states.
One Supreme Court justice at the time referred to territories ""inhabited by alien races"" and another endorsed the notion that the United States can seize ""an unknown island, peopled with an uncivilized race"" without conferring citizenship.
The letter from the activists said that the Justice Department's ""continued embrace of the Insular Cases cannot be reconciled with this administration's pledge to affirmatively advance equity and racial justice.""
The activists said they were prompted to write the letter by the Justice Department's approach in a November Supreme Court oral argument concerning whether Congress can bar Puerto Ricans from the federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program that provides benefits to low-income elderly, blind and disabled people.
During the argument, Justice Neil Gorsuch specifically asked Deputy Solicitor General Curtis Gannon, representing the administration, for its position on the cases.
""Why shouldn't we just admit that the Insular Cases were incorrectly decided?"" Gorsuch asked.
Gannon responded that although the ""reasoning and rhetoric there is obviously anathema,"" the Supreme Court did not need to say anything about the cases to decide the question about SSI benefits, thereby missing an opportunity to denounce them, the activists said.
""It's like having laws on the books that don't outlaw lynching,"" said Laura Esquivel, vice president of federal policy and advocacy at the Hispanic Federation. ""Why would the U.S. government want to leave those laws there? Why would they not want to repudiate them?""
Alejandro Ortiz, an ACLU lawyer, said it would be an ""easy win"" for Biden's administration to condemn the Insular Cases because there is consensus now that they were based on racist reasoning.
""This is one easy example of systemic racism, where racism has been built into the way the federal government treats people who live in the territories, who are overwhelmingly people of color,"" Ortiz added.
The Insular Cases could play a more prominent role in another case heading toward the justices on whether people born in American Samoa, another territory, are entitled to full U.S. citizenship at birth.
There are five U.S. territories in total - the other three being Guam, the Virgin Island and the Northern Mariana Islands. Puerto Rico is by far the most-populous, with about 3 million people. Many Puerto Ricans have long complained that the Caribbean island's residents are treated worse than other Americans despite being U.S. citizens.
In the case before the court, Biden's Justice Department continued an appeal initially filed by Republican former President Donald Trump's administration while at the same time urging Congress to extend SSI benefits to Puerto Rico. 

Based on the oral argument, it was unclear how the Supreme Court would rule, with a decision due by the end of June.
If the court rules in favor of Puerto Rican resident Jose Luis Vaello-Madero, who has argued that he should receive the benefit, more than 300,000 Puerto Rico residents could become eligible at an estimated cost to the U.S. government of $2 billion annually.

TORONTO (Reuters) -Manulife Financial Corp and Sun Life Financial (NYSE:SLF), Canada's two biggest life insurers, are increasing premiums to offset higher costs this year from inflation that has risen to a three-decade high, executives said on Thursday.
A 50-basis-point increase in fixed income yields would also translate into a C$1.85 billion ($1.5 billion) rise in embedded value, Manulife Chief Executive Roy Gori told analysts on a post-earnings call. 
Manulife on Wednesday posted core fourth-quarter earnings of 84 Canadian cents per share, up 13.5% from a year earlier and beating analysts' expectations.
Smaller rivals Sun Life Financial and Great-West Lifeco on Wednesday also reported higher earnings.
Manulife shares jumped 3.9% to C$27.95 in morning trading in Toronto, their highest intraday level since 2008. Sun Life, whose U.S. earnings dropped 51% due to higher COVID-related death claims, declined 3.9% to C$70.97, while Great-West shares fell 1.55%. 
The main Toronto index rose 0.6%.
""There are some aspects of our business where higher rates will create some headwinds, but we have flexibility as it relates to driving scale through expenses or price changes to offset those,"" Gori said.
The company could push up prices in its long-term care business, which may be susceptible to increased costs, although a shift to cheaper home care prompted by the pandemic has offset some of that, Chief Actuary Steve Finch said.
Sun Life executives said higher costs due to inflation could be a positive in its stop-loss business, which protects employers against unpredictable losses. 
As policies reprice every year, ""we would be able to react very quickly,"" Dan Fishbein, president of the insurer's U.S business, said on an analysts call. ""Not that we're hoping for medical inflation, but the primary impact of medical inflation on our stop-loss business would be more premium.""
Sun Life has already raised premiums in its disability and group life businesses, but those will take some time to take effect as policies are longer, he said. 
Sun Life's MFS Investment Management unit, which focuses primarily on equities, could see some challenges, CEO Michael Roberge said. 

An expected increase in market volatility, higher interest rates and high stock valuations are likely to send more investors into cash, reducing flows into funds in 2022, he said.

289,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 12:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden said inflation was creating “real stress at the kitchen table” but insisted he remained optimistic about the American economy even after the consumer price index surged beyond expectations in Labor Department data released Thursday.
“While today’s report is elevated, forecasters continue to project inflation easing substantially by the end of 2022,” Biden said in a statement. “And fortunately we saw positive real wage growth last month,” he said, referring to pay after adjusting for inflation. He also cited “moderation in auto prices, which have made up about a quarter of headline inflation over the last year.”
Biden highlighted the positive developments of record job and wage growth over the past year, and said he would continue to push Congress to pass programs that would address the costs of child care, energy and prescription drugs.
Inflation has become a major political headache for Biden, whose approval rating has slipped below 40% in the most recent RealClearPolitics polling average. The administration’s efforts to advance its economic agenda has been stymied on Capitol Hill after Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia broke with fellow Democrats, in part over concerns that additional government spending would drive inflation higher.
And January’s consumer price index report -- which saw the widely followed inflation gauge rise 0.6% from the previous month, above consensus estimates -- comes after Biden said in December he believed the nation was already at “the peak” of its inflation crisis.
Broad Based
The report found that food prices rose 0.9% in January, the most in three months, and energy costs also advanced 0.9%, on gains in fuel oil and electricity. The White House has taken a series of executive actions in recent months designed to tamp down price gains in both sectors. 
The broad increase in the CPI also reflected higher prices for household furnishings, used vehicles, apparel and medical care. Prices of household furnishings and health insurance both rose by the most on record on a month-to-month basis.

290,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 12:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) on Thursday rejected a preliminary approach for its Italian business from France's Iliad and Apax Partners worth more than 11 billion euros, the first public skirmish in what could be a new wave of European telecoms deal making. 
Vodafone boss Nick Read, under pressure from new investor Cevian Capital and other shareholders, has been vocal in his wish to see European operators merge in local markets to build stronger companies that can invest in fibre and 5G networks. 
Reuters reported in January that Vodafone and Iliad discussed combining their businesses in the cut-throat Italian market, before the firm founded by billionaire Xavier Niel turned the tables by offering to buy Vodafone's local operations outright.
Iliad appeared to indicate it would not raise its all cash offer, describing it as reflecting a ""very high"" premium for Vodafone.
""Iliad takes note of the rejection by Vodafone of its 11.25 billion euros ($12.92 billion) offer for Vodafone Italy,"" it said in a statement, adding that it would ""pursue its stand-alone strategy"".
Vodafone, the world's second largest mobile operator, said on Thursday the offer was not in the best interests of shareholders. 
""The board and management of Vodafone remain focused on delivering shareholder value through a combination of its organic growth strategy over the medium-term and ongoing portfolio optimisation,"" it said, adding that it was pursuing several ""value accretive"" deals.
Analysts at Jefferies said selling to Iliad, a disruptor in Italy that helped turn the market hyper competitive, would set the wrong precedent. 
""Difficulties in Italy are largely attributable to Iliad's market entry in May 2018, and could be rapidly resolved if Iliad were to adjust its commercial approach in search of profitability,"" they said. 
They argued a joint venture between the two would give Vodafone exposure to market recovery. Jefferies said an 11 billion euro figure implied an enterprise value to core earnings multiple of 7 times, a figure it described as underwhelming. 
The news from Vodafone comes as all European operators look at ways to reinvigorate their operations, with bankers reporting talks in multiple countries. 
Operators are hoping that regulators in Brussels will show greater awareness of the need to invest in networks after the pandemic. British regulator Ofcom said this week it was no longer ideologically-wedded to the need for four operators. 
Iliad's bid, which was first reported by the Financial Times, comes as Italy's biggest phone group  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) is assessing a 10.8 billion euro takeover approach from U.S. fund KKR.

Vodafone's London-listed shares closed 0.8% lower.

IMF spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters that the Fund will seek support for IMF proposals to strengthen the G20's debt restructuring framework, which so far has attracted only three participants -- Chad, Zambia and Ethiopia.
Among proposals where there could be movement are an immediate standstill of debt service for countries that seek restructurings under the framework and firm timelines for completing those restructurings.
Adopting these provisions would better equip the IMF, World Bank and other institutions to handle what may be increased demand for restructurings, particularly this year after a nearly two year suspension of official bilateral debt service for poor countries expired at the end of 2021. 

""It could be, indeed, that we will see an accelerated demand for support, for debt restructuring in the period ahead,"" Rice said. ""It's critical that all of the participants -- creditors and debtors -- play their part as fully as possible.""
Rice added that Sri Lanka has not sought IMF financial assistance, but the Fund stands ready to discuss options for the country to deal with its debt burden. Its president asked China for new debt terms in January.

BEIJING/VILNIUS (Reuters) -China suspended imports of beef, dairy and beer from Lithuania this week, Lithuania's veterinary control agency said on Thursday, amid a growing trade dispute over the Baltic nation's relations with Taiwan.
China's General Administration of Customs had informed the country it was halting the exports due to ""lack of documentation"", the agency said in a statement.
It added that ""this is first such notification we ever received, because the importing countries usually start by asking for any missing information"".
The Chinese agency said earlier on Thursday it had stopped imports of Lithuanian beef but gave no specific reason.
Relations frayed after Lithuania allowed Taiwan to open a de facto embassy in its capital Vilnius last year, angering Beijing which regards the democratically-ruled island as its own territory.
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said on Wednesday during a visit to Australia that nations seeking to use trade as a retaliatory measure must be reminded that ""like-minded countries have tools and regulations that help withstand the coercion"".
Britain said on Monday it will join the United States and Australia in backing an EU trade case against China at the World Trade Organization over Beijing's alleged trade curbs on Lithuania.
The European Commission says overall exports from Lithuania, an EU member, to China fell 91% in December compared to the same month in 2020.
The Lithuanian agency said the country hasn't exported food products, including beef, to China since early December 2021. It did not immediately give further details.
""As far as I know, the Chinese move does not create practical problems, because we do not export these products to China now. The exporters have moved on to other markets"", Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte told reporters on Thursday.
""If the problem is procedural and bureaucratic, as China says, then it will get solved very easily"", she added.
CORRECT 'MISTAKES'
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian declined to elaborate on the beef suspension, but said Lithuania should correct its ""mistakes"".
""What Lithuania should do is face up to facts, redress its own mistakes, and come back to the right track of adhering to the one China principle, instead of confusing right with wrong,"" Zhao said, referring to China's policy demanding countries recognise its claim to Taiwan.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Joanne Ou condemned the latest Chinese move, calling it ""unilateral"" and ""bullying"" and the latest example of Beijing trying to change Lithuania's foreign policy.

China is the world's top importer of beef but shipments from Lithuania are minimal. It imported just 775 tonnes of beef from Lithuania in 2021, out of a total 2.36 million tonnes of beef imports that year, according to Chinese customs data.
Taiwan has stepped up its food imports from Lithuania to help ease the impact of Chinese curbs, most recently rum.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Prime Minister Najib Mikati indicated on Thursday difficulties in agreeing a financial recovery plan critical to steering Lebanon out of its devastating economic collapse, calling it a ""Kamikaze operation"".
A plan for addressing a $70 billion hole in the financial system is seen as the starting point for talks with the International Monetary Fund and vital to reviving the paralysed banking system. 
An IMF spokesperson said talks with Lebanon that began last month would end this week. ""Those discussions I would characterize them as progressing well, but extensive work still required in the period ahead,"" Gerry Rice told a news briefing. 
""The economic recovery plan is not easy...We think it is a difficult process, a Kamikaze operation,"" Mikati said in a televised news conference after the cabinet approved the 2022 state budget.
Lebanon has been in crisis since late 2019 when the financial system unravelled under the weight of huge public debts, sinking the currency by more than 90% and plunging a majority of the population into poverty.
""The recovery plan is not easy, not easy, not easy and is taking all this time,"" Mikati added. 
He said that what had been reported in the media about the plan was untrue. ""We have a number of options and we are discussing them with the IMF,"" Mikati said.
A draft recovery plan seen by Reuters last month proposed converting the bulk of $104 billion of hard currency deposits in the banking system to Lebanese pounds, with only $25 billion being returned to savers in U.S. dollars. 
A previous recovery plan drawn up by a government in 2020 was shot down by commercial banks, the central bank and powerful political parties who disagreed over the size and distribution of losses, torpedoing IMF talks at the time. 
Though the government has yet to formally cancel the old pegged exchange rate of 1,500 pounds to the dollar, the new budget for the first time applies a rate much closer to the market value for customs transactions of around 20,000.
'STABILIZATION BUDGET' 
""The main problem with this budget is that it's not anchored against a holistic economic recovery programme,"" said Mohamad Faour, assistant professor of finance at the American University of Beirut. He added that the inclusion of multiple exchange rates would continue to ""distort economic activity.""
The IMF has recommended unifying exchange rates. 
The budget projects spending at 47 trillion pounds with a deficit of around 7 trillion pounds, Mikati added, equal to around $330 million at the parallel market rate on Thursday.
He did not say what GDP growth forecast had been used in drawing up the budget, or give the deficit as a percentage of GDP.
Mikati said this deficit was set to increase when spending for the crippled state electricity sector was approved.
The budget still requires the approval of parliament.

""This is a stabilization budget,"" Samir El Daher, an economic adviser to Mikati, told Reuters.
""It's like someone is falling from the 7th floor of a building and you want them to land on their feet, not on their head. There's still a long way to go after it's approved.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors were bracing for more market volatility after a sharper-than-expected rise in consumer prices ramped up expectations for how aggressively the Federal Reserve will need to move as it fights to tame soaring inflation. 
The prospect of a more hawkish Fed has been the main theme for markets this year, sending U.S. yields higher and stocks lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield has now moved up some 50 basis points in 2022 alone as it hit 2% on Thursday, its highest in two-and-a-half years.
Thursday’s data, which showed U.S. consumer price index beating economists’ expectation to notch their biggest year-on-year increase since February 1982, may force investors to further recalibrate their portfolios to account for a Fed that will be more aggressive than expected. 
""Everyone knew that the inflation data was going to be hot. That's not a surprise,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. ""But the clues that everybody's looking for is whether or not the data is hot enough to induce the Fed to raise rates quicker."" 
Reaction in markets to the consumer price data was swift. As yields shot higher, U.S. equities slumped, led by a drop for the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which is replete with stocks that are particularly pressured by higher yields. By mid-morning, stocks had recovered from initial steeper losses with major indexes trading close to unchanged on the day. 
In particular, investors were zeroing in on the Fed's next policy meeting in mid-March. The central bank has already signaled it will hike interest rates at that meeting, but at issue for investors is whether that increase will be by an even steeper 50 basis points as opposed to 25 basis points. 
Federal funds rate futures on Thursday showed a 50% chance that the Fed will raise interest rates by 50 basis points in March, from a 30% chance before the CPI data. 
“This number re-emphasizes the sense of urgency for the Fed to act,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of US rates strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) in New York. ""The market is starting to price in a much more aggressive path of rate hikes.""
Following the CPI data, BofA Global Research analysts said they ""remain comfortable with our hawkish call"" for the Fed to hike seven times this year. ""For the Fed, this report provides another wake-up call,"" the BofA analysts said in a report. ""Inflation is here and it continues to make its presence known everywhere."" 
Rather than risk a larger 50-basis point hike, the Fed will likely accelerate the timing of its balance sheet runoff, said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. 
""They have a couple levers to pull to remove accommodation,"" Jacobsen said. ""The optics around a faster or sooner balance sheet runoff are probably better than a bigger than typical hike."" 
After swooning for most of January, stocks had been recovering more recently. The S&P 500 was last down about 4% so far this year, while the Nasdaq is down over 7% in 2022.

Investors will be keen for any more clues about the pace of inflation ahead of the March Fed meeting, including the next monthly U.S. jobs report.
February employment data ""could be the key point as to whether the Fed gets more aggressive,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech restaurant and hotel operators saw light at the end of the tunnel on Thursday as the government cancelled rules requiring vaccination certificates to enter restaurants and events as Omicron infections started to ebb.
Hotels and restaurants in Prague, a prime tourist destination, have suffered badly throughout the pandemic and now hope restrictions will not come back.
""The relaxation means guests can come without any restriction or persecution, that's of course welcome... This has been long for everyone, not just us in gastronomy but the entire society,"" said Tomas Lachman, a manager at Oblaca Restaurant at Prague's TV tower, 66 metres above the city. 
The Czech Republic is the latest European country to ease restrictions, as the government hopes the peak of the Omicron wave is over. Sweden lifted https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sweden-declare-pandemic-over-despite-warnings-scientists-2022-02-09 most restrictions on Wednesday.
The country of 10.7 million has suffered one of the world's highest death tolls per capita with 37,660 victims to date. Daily infections peaked at 57,232 on Feb. 1, falling to 29,059 on Wednesday.
Enforcement of the vaccination certificate requirement has been weak and many pubs did not require guests to show them. Some actively refused to follow the rules.
""We were in a perverse situation where those who followed the rules suffered while those who didn't give a damn and even declared it openly were making money,"" said Tomas Prouza, head of a lobby group for commerce and tourism, welcoming the end of the system.
""The numbers are going down, hospitals are not full, this is a time when we have to start living normally."" 
The number of people in hospital has still been going up, to 3,784 on Tuesday, but is far below peaks of over 9,000 in March last year. The number of patients in serious condition was at just over 10% of the peak.
The government maintained a mask mandate indoors and on public transport, as well as limits to the size of audiences at culture and sports events.
Mandatory regular testing at schools and workplaces will end on Feb 18.
Prime Minister Petr Fiala said on Wednesday that most remaining restrictions would be lifted from March.

Katerina Joklova, general manager at Vienna House Andel’s Prague Hotel, said it had an occupancy rate of 10-15% and any relaxation was welcome.
""It is certainly a light at the end of the tunnel, a sign that we are getting back to normal life.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields have shot higher this year, rising faster than many forecast. Investors are now assessing if anticipation of a more hawkish Fed will continue to push levels up, with the potential to upset riskier assets. 
Expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may increase rates more aggressively than anticipated to counter rising inflation have pushed up yields while flattening the U.S. Treasury yield curve. That matters as bond yields impact global asset prices as well as consumer loans and mortgages. The shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve can also help predict how the economy will fare. 
On Thursday, yields on 10-year notes hit 2% after higher-than-anticipated inflation data. Federal funds rate futures showed an increased chance of a half percentage-point tightening at next month's meeting after the data, while strategists said the data increased the chances of swifter moves to reduce the Fed's balance sheet. The central bank's nearly $9 trillion portfolio doubled in size during the pandemic.
""The market is starting to price in a much more aggressive path of rate hikes ... clearly there is a sense of urgency again"", said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Yields, which move inversely to prices, are up from 1.79% at the beginning of February. The last time they breached 2% was August 2019.
""I would say the chances of yields continuing to go higher are pretty high,"" said Gargi Chaudhuri, Head of iShares Investment Strategy, Americas, at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), speaking ahead of the data.
FOREIGN COMPETITION
Competition in other markets for yield may be sapping demand for Treasuries and helping push yields higher, Chaudhuri said.
A second rate hike by the Bank of England last week, and expectations of faster policy tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB), added to U.S. bonds' weakness, with borrowing costs in Europe - as well as Japanese government bond yields - having jumped to multi-year highs in recent days.
""Investors have these other markets to gravitate towards that they didn't in the past, and that will require investors that are focusing on U.S. markets to seek a higher term premium and therefore will impact yields higher,"" Chaudhuri said.
Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond yield is around its highest level since January 2016 at 0.220% while Germany’s 10-year government bond yield, at 0.255%, is at its highest since January 2019.
For Kelsey Berro, fixed income portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, the level of yields in overseas markets such as Japan or Germany have made U.S. rates comparably more attractive, preventing a sustainable sell off, but that is expected to change.
""Already you should start to see that some of these foreign investors take a second look at their home countries rather than reaching for yields in the U.S.,"" she said.
Still, there was strong demand seen for a recent 10-year Treasury auction, although it was unclear how much overseas bidders participated.
SPEEDY ASCENT 
The rise in US yields has come faster than many anticipated: In December, a Reuters poll forecast that 10-year note yields would rise to around 2% towards the end of 2022 - a level it has reached in the first couple of months. 
Some banks have been updating that view. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts on Wednesday raised their forecast for the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield to 2.25% by end-2022, from a previous year-end target of 2%.
The pace of gains has caused volatility in other assets. U.S. equities have been rocky this year, with shares of tech companies particularly volatile, as expectations of higher yields threaten to erode the value of their future earnings. 
Gene Podkaminer, Head of Research for Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions, called 2% on the benchmark 10-year a “psychological” level that could make U.S. government bonds more attractive versus other assets, such as volatile stocks. 
""When you start getting close to 2% ... all of a sudden Treasuries are looking more appealing,"" Podkaminer said earlier this week.
One commonly cited metric still favors stocks, however.
The equity risk premium – or the extra return investors receive for holding stocks over risk-free government bonds – favors equities over the next year, Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, said on Wednesday.
The S&P 500 has historically beaten the one-year return for the 10-year Treasury note by an average of 11.8% when the premium stood at Wednesday’s level of 260 points, Lerner said.

“I don’t think the U.S. 10-year yield hitting 2% would have a big impact on the stock markets per se,"" said Manish Kabra, head of U.S. equity strategy at Societe Generale, citing the equity risk premium. 
However, ""we could see some pressure if yields go to 2.5%,"" she said.

BELLINZONA, Switzerland (Reuters) - A former  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) employee testified on Thursday that she kept the bank's management fully informed of outflows from Bulgarian customers' accounts after authorities in Sofia asked Switzerland for judicial assistance.
In the first criminal trial of a major bank in Switzerland, Credit Suisse and the former employee face charges of allowing an alleged Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang to launder millions of euros, some of it stuffed into suitcases.
The former employee, who cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, denies wrongdoing. Credit Suisse has rejected all the allegations and said it is convinced its former employee is innocent, and that it plans to ""defend itself vigorously"".
Swiss prosecutors allege that Credit Suisse and the former relationship manager did too little to prevent the alleged drug traffickers hiding and laundering cash between 2004 and 2008, despite indications that the funds could be of criminal origin.
The indictment runs to more than 500 pages, and centres on relationships that Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-largest bank, and its ex-employee had with former Bulgarian wrestler Evelin Banev and several of his associates.
""I was informing, I was so stressed with the situation, I was so afraid of making a mistake just because I am not experienced, I was not competent. So that I was going on reporting, reporting, maybe even more than necessary,"" the former employee told the Federal Criminal Court in Bellinzona on Thursday, speaking in English.
""I KEPT INFORMING"" 
Prosecutors allege that the defendant, who left Credit Suisse in 2010, helped to launder dirty money by carrying out more than 146 million Swiss francs in transactions.
Documents at the trial showed that she had informed a designated Credit Suisse legal official of transactions after the Swiss attorney general in June 2007 informed the bank about Bulgaria's probe into five people with accounts alleged to hold illicit funds derived from drug trafficking.
""There was a procedure in place,"" she said, adding that she had to notify the bank's legal department of any flow of funds.
""I repeat again. I kept informing of every single step, the line managers, kept them informed of everything going on.""
Regarding transfers from the accounts of the Bulgarians involved in the case, she said: ""I was not in a position to authorise payments above 200,000 (Swiss francs). Never. Even if wanted, I could not.""
After the prosecution finished questioning her, she became visibly upset, calling the charges against her a ""scandal"".
""All this, what has been discussed this morning, have been in front of them for 13 years of my life,"" she said, before requesting a break to calm herself.
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS 
Banev does not face charges in Switzerland but was convicted in Italy of drug trafficking in 2017, and then in Bulgaria in 2018, for money laundering. Two of his associates are charged in the Swiss case. 
Banev was arrested in September in Ukraine as countries including Bulgaria and Romania sought his arrest. 
In Sofia, his attorney said Banev denied any involvement in money laundering through Credit Suisse.
Credit Suisse disputes the illegal origin of the money, a source familiar with its thinking has told Reuters, saying the alleged traffickers operated legitimate businesses in construction, leasing and hotels, and that it had performed extensive checks.
The presiding judge has ruled that a 15-year statute of limitations for aggravated money laundering means only events that occurred after Feb. 7, 2007, may be considered in the case. 
Switzerland had a staunch culture of bank secrecy before a U.S.-led crackdown began eroding its protection of foreign clients' information in 2008.
Swiss private banks have had to change their business models since the introduction of new rules aimed at ensuring that offshore accounts are known to authorities in the country where the account-holder pays tax.

At the time of the alleged offences, however, while there were rules requiring anti-money laundering checks, it was common practice for wealthy clients to bring money into Switzerland that was not declared to authorities, the former employee said - an opinion shared by Credit Suisse, according to a source familiar with its thinking.

298,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 10:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s a crunch on chicken wings coming ahead of Super Bowl Sunday that has the finger food favorite near all-time high prices for the time of year. Americans are projected to eat massive amounts of the game day snack, about 1.42 billion wings. That’s tied with last year for a record. But this year, there are signs that getting those volumes to consumers is harder and supplies are tighter. Add to that the turmoil that has been dogging U.S. food supply chains, from labor shortfalls to missing ingredients and soaring costs all around.
Restaurants have been scrambling. Some are getting ready to switch to frozen wings in case they run out of fresh. Others are reducing the number of wings that come in an order. In a sign of the times, companies like the one that owns Chili’s are booking their chicken orders into the summer and beyond to lay claim to whatever’s available.
As Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council, likes to point out: chickens unfortunately only have two wings.
“We’re definitely seeing this upward movement on the price of things. That’s on chicken and chicken wings,” Andy Wiederhorn, Chief Executive Officer of FAT Brands Inc., which owns Twin Peaks and Native Grill & Wing, said in an interview.
Wings in January were the priciest for the time of year in government data that goes back to 2010, before easing below last year’s record prices. Currently, they’re $2.70 a pound wholesale, which compares to a five-year average price of around $1.76 before the pandemic.
Popularity Contest
An unprecedented surge in chicken popularity is at the root of wing inflation. Nearly all types of restaurants have seen a drop in locations over the past four years except one, called “Southern,” and that’s because that category includes fried chicken joints like KFC, Popeyes, Bojangles and Raising Cane’s. Those types of restaurants have expanded 18%, compared with an 8% drop overall, according to industry researcher Datassential.
Still, there will be wings this weekend. That’s no accident. Poultry producers have been sending more birds to be cut up for parts instead of selling whole chickens, Super said, so there are more to go around.
There are also signs that wings at grocery stores are getting too expensive for some shoppers, which would cushion supplies. Grocers are devoting more space in refrigerators to thighs and tenders because consumers are looking for better bargains than wings, said Mark Jordan, senior livestock and poultry economist at LEAP Market Analytics in Jonesboro, Arkansas. At a store nearby him, the hot bar “has pretty much been deactivated” due to pricey wings, he said. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture sees chicken output edging up 1.3% in 2022. Pilgrim’s Pride, the second biggest producer which reported earnings Wednesday, said that’s not enough given demand.
On Super Bowl weekend, there will be constraints on wing mania. For example, football fans ordering from Domino’s Pizza Inc. may notice just eight boneless wings per order versus 10 previously.
The cut’s an effort to “recognize some of these costs that we’re incurring,” said CEO Richard Allison.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China has moved to give real estate firms easier access to presale proceeds from residential projects, local media outlet Cailianshe said on Thursday, as authorities seek to loosen a stifling liquidity squeeze in the property sector.
Chinese developers are allowed to sell projects before completing them but are required to put such proceeds into escrow accounts. Cash held in escrow typically equates to 50% to 70% of developers' presale funds.
In 2021, amid fears of sector-wide contagion from bluechip China Evergrande Group's debt problems, many local governments curbed withdrawals from escrow accounts, leaving some projects unfinished and developers short of cash.
Cailianshe, a financial news website, said on Thursday that a new regulatory framework - which Reuters first reported on Jan. 19 that China was drafting would ""correct over-tightening"" of escrow accounts by city or county-level authorities.

Curbs on withdrawals would use different calculation methods based on construction costs, allowing developers to withdraw more funds than previously, Cailianshe said.
A bloated real estate sector has undergone a deleveraging crisis in the wake of Evergrande's near-meltdown. Once China's top-selling developer, it is now the world's most indebted property firm with liabilities of around $300 billion.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's central bank said on Thursday it wants to get opinions from organisations, academics, companies and private individuals by March 20 on whether they think the long-standing inflation target of 1-3% and the way it is calculated would still be appropriate long term.
The bank has maintained the 1-3% target since it was set by the government in 2003. However, Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron said last July that he saw room for a change in the target as well as possibly the criteria for determining it, given structural economic changes such as technological advancements and online shopping pushing prices down. 
While the government sets the inflation target, the central bank has freedom to adjust interest rates as it sees fit to meet the target.
On Thursday, the bank said it is seeking opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of the current target relative to the conditions of the Israeli economy, and on various potential adjustments such as a different range, a single-point target rather than a range, a maximum target only and basing it on a different price index.
""Should the Bank conclude that there is room to change the current target, it will recommend to the government to act accordingly,"" the Bank of Israel said.
""The decisions that the Bank of Israel will make in the end will not be affected by inflation in the short term, but rather by the assessment that the Bank will formulate regarding the inflation target that will best serve the Israeli economy in the coming decades."" 
Governor Yaron in his comments last July about the target noted that the range had been set in early 2000 when the memory of hyper inflation from the 1980s was still fresh.

He has since said that a final decision on whether to adjust the target was likely in 2022.
Israel's inflation rate stood at 2.8% in December 2021, the latest available data and an eight-year high.

301,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 09:20AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation will return to trend without significant policy tightening by the European Central Bank as pandemic-related bottlenecks in goods as well as labour are resolved, the ECB's chief economist Philip Lane said on Thursday. 
Lane was defending his long-held view that the current, record-high inflation rate in the euro zone was temporary in the face of mounting pressure on the ECB to raise interest rates, both from investors and policymakers. 
""Since bottlenecks will eventually be resolved, price pressures should abate and inflation return to its trend without a need for a significant adjustment in monetary policy,"" Lane said in a blog post. 
He was echoed at a separate event by French governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau.
They were likely trying to dampen market expectations, which are for an early end of the ECB's bond purchases and rate hikes worth 50 basis points by December.
These were stoked by ECB President Christine Lagarde last week, when she refused to rule out a rate increase this year. Sources told Reuters some policymakers already wanted policy changes at last week's meeting.
But Lane defended the ECB's ""hold-steady"" approach.
""The logic underpinning a hold-steady approach to monetary policy is reinforced if the bottlenecks are primarily external in nature, caused by global disruptions in supply or a surge in global demand,"" he said in his blog.
""Since monetary policy steers domestic demand, a tightening of monetary policy in reaction to an external supply shock would mean that the economy would be simultaneously confronted with two adverse shocks.""
The ECB said in December it would buy bonds at least until October and only raise rates after those purchases end.
But this guidance is likely to change at its next policy meeting in March, when the central bank will also publish updated, and likely increase inflation forecasts.
Speaking at a separate event, ECB vice-president Luis de Guindos said inflation in the euro zone, which hit 5.1% in January, would not dip back below the ECB's 2% goal this year.
He backed the European Commission's forecast for an average 3.5% rate of price growth for 2022 and added euro zone wage growth was not keeping up with inflation so far but negotiations - and larger increases - may just have been delayed because of the pandemic.

The ECB last hiked rates in 2011 in what is now widely considered a policy mistake in the middle of a supply shock and debt crisis.
Its rate on bank deposits is currently minus 0.5%, meaning banks are charged to park their spare cash at the central bank overnight.

302,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 08:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Money markets ramped up their expectations for the pace of Federal Reserve tightening after the U.S. inflation figures came in hotter than expected, briefly pricing a supersized half-point hike next month as a more than one-in-two chance and fully pricing in a full percentage point of increases by the end of July. 
One percentage point by then is equivalent to a 25-basis-point increase at each of the next four policy meetings. The market also briefly priced in fully six standard quarter-point hikes for the year. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note surged after the data to within 2 basis points of the psychological 2% level.
U.S. consumer prices jumped in January by more than expected, representing a bigger hit to Americans’ paychecks as inflation charges ahead at the fastest pace since 1982 and the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates.
The consumer price index climbed 7.5% from a year earlier following a 7% annual gain in December, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. The widely followed inflation gauge rose 0.6% in January from a month earlier, reflecting broad increases that included higher food, electricity and shelter costs. 
Fed speakers were out in force on Wednesday, with Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic saying incoming data will show whether 25- or 50-basis-point increases are appropriate, adding that he was leaning toward four rate hikes this year. Cleveland Fed’s Loretta Mester meanwhile said she was less keen on such an outsized move, although she favored tightening next month, a sentiment shared by her San Francisco Fed colleague Mary Daly. 
The Fed slashed the upper band of its target funds rate to 0.25% at the onset of the pandemic in 2020, matching the lowest level on record, and has kept it there since to foster an economic recovery. 
After months of maintaining that rising consumer prices were transitory, Powell left the door open to increasing rates at every meeting. At a press conference after the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting he didn’t rule out the possibility of a 50-basis-point hike.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will publish this summer its first annual report on efforts to improve the global competitiveness of its financial sector, the government is due to say on Thursday.
Britain left the European Union without a deal for access to the bloc's financial services sector, putting the government under pressure to support the City of London, still Europe's biggest business hub. 
A review last year on improving London as a place to list companies recommended that Britain's finance ministry should present a short annual ""State of the City"" report which sets out steps taken or planned to promote Britain as a financial centre.
This would ensure long-term ""rigorous political focus"" on helping the City, historic home of the financial sector, fend off competition from New York, Singapore and now the EU, the review by former European commissioner Jonathan Hill said. 
Finance industry figures say that while the ministry has aired many of the reforms they want to see, a much faster pace of implementation is needed.
It could use indicators like the number of new listings and trading volumes to measure progress, Hill recommended.
Listing rules have already been eased to bring them in line with rival centres like New York, and the ministry set out reforms to the funds sector on Thursday.
Despite such reforms, SoftBank said this week it would list British chip designer Arm in New York rather than London.
Financial services minister John Glen is due to address lobby group TheCityUK's annual dinner on Thursday evening. The ministry said he is expected to announce that from this summer, the Treasury will publish an annual review of financial services competitiveness with the City of London Corporation.
""This will monitor progress and will reflect feedback from businesses on what’s going right and where improvements can be made,"" the ministry said.
Glen will say that Britain will not lower standards to win business.
""And we will never sacrifice the track record of international leadership on financial stability, that we’ve demonstrated since the 2008 crisis,"" Glen will say.

A ministry official said this week that Britain's financial regulators will be given a secondary objective to help keep the City globally competitive, but without undermining their main aim of maintaining sound firms, well functioning markets and consumer protection.
The State of the City review could be delivered by finance minister Rishi Sunak in his annual Mansion House speech in the 'square mile"" financial district.

(Reuters) - Erie, Pennsylvania could use a facelift. The lakefront city of 100,000 has been adding jobs and businesses downtown, but it remains saddled with vestiges of its industrial past: abandoned factories, ugly concrete buildings, decaying houses.
Leaders have written a stack of development plans, but lack the money needed to turn them into reality.
Now their dreams seem possible. Congress last year passed President Joe Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure law, which provides $550 billion in new funding for bridge repair, environmental cleanup and other projects that could transform places like Erie. 
It amounts to the largest U.S. public-works surge since the 1960s, but there is no guarantee those dollars will make it to Erie. Roughly half of the funds will flow through state governments, while the rest will be doled out on a competitive basis . 
To win the money, local governments will have to apply for it -- and after decades of belt tightening, many lack the bureaucratic muscle to do so. 
""Nobody is ready because nobody has needed to be ready until now,"" said Perry Wood, executive director of the Erie County Gaming Revenue Authority, which distributes gambling money for redevelopment projects.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic two years ago, local governments have shed 3.7% of their administrative jobs, according to the U.S. Labor Department. 
Some have had trouble handling the $500 billion in COVID-19 aid that Washington has sent to local governments. One out of five communities in Michigan missed out on the initial round of federal coronavirus aid because they didn't know how to fill out the paperwork, said Shanna Draheim of the Michigan Municipal League.
CHALLENGE FOR SMALL CITIES
Many turn to outside experts. The city of Mason, Michigan has set aside up to $40,000 to hire a consultant to apply for funding to upgrade its sewer system -- a substantial expense for a community of 8,300 people.
""It makes it very challenging for smaller communities to position themselves to be competitive,"" city manager Deborah Stewart said. 
Academic studies have found that federal homeless grants are more likely to go to communities that can show they will use the money effectively, rather than those that need it most.
That can favor cities which have the resources to navigate federal bureaucracy. In the past fiscal year, just 11 counties received 50% of the competitive grants awarded by the agencies that will handle most infrastructure spending, according to a Reuters review of federal data. 
Experts say smaller cities might get boxed out in the scramble for infrastructure dollars. ""It's going to be overwhelming in many cases and could actually favor large, prosperous metropolitan areas,"" said Bruce Katz, a Drexel University professor who is helping Erie seek infrastructure grants.
Many federal programs also require local governments to provide matching funds -- a hurdle that has kept Erie from participating in recent years, according to the city's planning director, Kathy Wyrosdick. Washington also provided little help navigating the red tape. 
""It's disingenuous to say, 'We'll give you the money if you figure your own stuff out,'"" she said.
The Biden administration says it is working to reduce those barriers. 
Many of the new competitive grant programs include carve-outs for ""disadvantaged"" communities that have suffered from poverty, pollution or racial discrimination. The administration also requires that at least 40% of its spending on clean energy and climate change benefit those areas. Matching-fund requirements can be waived in many cases, officials say.
The White House last week released a 461-page guidebook https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BUILDING-A-BETTER-AMERICA_FINAL.pdf that breaks down the law's funding opportunities, and the Transportation Department has held outreach sessions for local governments. 
Biden himself has met with mayors and other local leaders to promote the law, and the White House's infrastructure coordinator, former New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu, says he has spoken to hundreds of officials.
In Erie, civic groups, governments and private businesses like Erie Insurance, the city's largest employer, have developed a plan to win as many federal dollars as possible. 

A first step is to hire more planners, grant writers and other bureaucrats, with local philanthropies covering the $11 million cost. That should help the region weather other dramatic events, such as climate change or another pandemic, in years to come, Wyrosdick said.
""The system that needs to be in place to compete for these federal dollars is the system that should have always been in place,"" she said.

(Reuters) - A China-based financier, once reprimanded by U.S. regulators and barred from taking his company public, played a bigger role than is publicly known in the shell company that agreed to merge with former President Donald Trump’s new social media venture, Reuters has learned.
Little has been disclosed about the involvement of the financier, Abraham Cinta, and the Shanghai-based investment bank he leads, ARC Group Ltd, in the shell company’s regulatory filings. ARC is listed as “financial advisor” to Digital World Acquisition Corp, the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that signed a deal in October to merge with Trump’s new media platform. No details are provided in the filings other than that ARC could help the SPAC with contacts in government and the business world, as well as access to a “quality deal pipeline.” 
Now, new information - text messages, a financial document outlining proposed terms of the shell company, an agreement between ARC and one of Digital World’s creators, and interviews with five sources familiar with the situation - shows that Cinta and ARC did not just advise Digital World. They also offered money to create Digital World and recruited an executive to help put the company together.
ARC offered to provide at least $2 million to three businessmen to form Digital World, the SPAC that went on to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group, and Cinta had a say in how the SPAC’s management team would be compensated, according to the financial document and text messages between Cinta and others involved. 
A person familiar with the matter said ARC eventually made an investment in the SPAC that became Digital World. Reuters could not confirm whether the investment was for $2 million, as ARC originally discussed. The initial investors in the management entity, or sponsor, of Digital World put in a total of $11.8 million, disclosures show. 
The Washington Post and Bloomberg News previously reported that ARC has a stake in the sponsor of Digital World. The fact that ARC offered money to get the SPAC off the ground is reported here for the first time.
Cinta and spokespeople for ARC and Digital World did not respond to requests for comment.     
Reuters could not establish whether Trump had any role in creating or shaping Digital World or how much Trump knew about Digital World’s backers when his company signed the deal with the SPAC. Trump Media & Technology Group spokespeople and a Trump spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. 
ARC’s deep role in the deal is atypical for a financial advisor, which is the term used to describe ARC in Digital World’s regulatory filings. An advisor usually counsels a SPAC on how to put a deal together, but doesn’t ordinarily seed the SPAC with capital or get involved in determining its senior ranks. There are no U.S. rules against such arrangements and no requirements for disclosing them, however, according to two capital markets lawyers and two finance professors interviewed by Reuters. 
The details about ARC’s role shed new light on the financial firm behind the former president’s lucrative Digital World deal. ARC has carved out a specialty in funneling overseas money into Wall Street’s boom in SPACs. SPACs are listed shell companies that raise cash to acquire and take public a private company, allowing targets to sidestep the stricter regulatory checks of an initial public offering. The gold rush has been fueled by many mom-and-pop investors placing risky bets that often turned sour.
Digital World’s activities are coming under regulatory scrutiny. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have made inquiries to Digital World about the circumstances around the deal, according to a regulatory filing. The SEC is looking into Digital World’s policies and procedures relating to trading, as well as the “identities of certain investors” in the SPAC and where the money came from. FINRA has asked for details about ""surrounding events,"" including a review of trading that preceded the announcement of the SPAC’s merger with Trump’s company, Digital World has disclosed. 
The SEC and FINRA have not taken any action, and the agencies declined to comment on their inquiries. 
Many questions remain unanswered about the deal, including the origin of the bulk of the $11.8 million in funds used to set up Digital World. That stake would now be worth $705 million, according to Reuters calculations based on regulatory filings.
The $2 million that ARC proposed ponying up was to come through a Singapore-based fund that Cinta’s firm managed, according to the financial document with the proposed terms seen by Reuters. 
Besides the money ARC would invest with its Singapore fund, two investors from Israel, blockchain entrepreneurs Stas Oskin and Sebastian Stupurac, would put in an additional $350,000, according to the document, whose digital signature lists Cinta as its creator. 
Stupurac confirmed his participation in a text message to Reuters and said he recalled a different investment figure. He declined to disclose what his investment was and said that “all information should be public at some point”. He added he agreed “to sponsor the idea” because he believed in the SPAC’s management team, but did not get involved in its unfolding and did not follow subsequent events. He declined to provide more details.
Oskin did not respond to requests for comment. 
As part of the deal, ARC would have veto power over any deal the blank-check firm pursued, the document shows. Reuters could not establish the identity of the investors in the ARC Singapore fund that offered to invest in Digital World, or whether ARC secured veto power.
Securities regulations do not require Digital World to disclose the investors behind its sponsor. Digital World lists the sponsor in regulatory filings as a Delaware-listed company called ARC Global Investments II. The filings don’t say whether that entity is affiliated with China-based ARC. The papers list Digital World chief executive Patrick Orlando as the “managing member” of ARC Global Investments II. 
Orlando did not respond to requests for comment.
Digital World’s merger with Trump Media has been immensely lucrative for shareholders thus far. Trump has yet to launch his social media product, and industry analysts have questioned whether it can take on established platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Investors have snapped up shares in Digital World nonetheless, making it the best-performing SPAC of all time. Trump’s company, worth $875 million when the deal was inked in October, is now valued at up to $10.6 billion.
Other U.S. SPACs that ARC has worked on have underperformed peers. The average share price of 18 ARC-affiliated SPACs, excluding Digital World, stands at $9.45, below their $10 initial public offering price and the SPAC industry average of $9.88.
“THE DEAL HAS CHANGED”
Cinta’s early forays into public markets struggled. A former official at Mexico’s Ministry of Welfare, Cinta and several ARC colleagues were reprimanded by the SEC in 2017 for misrepresenting businesses they tried to take public and making false statements about their affiliation with them. In a rare move, the SEC stopped them from taking those companies public at the time. 
Cinta and the SEC didn’t respond to requests for comment for a Reuters report on the matter last October.
The financiers soon repositioned themselves as investment bankers in China and turned to SPACs as a new way to take companies public, a review of their deals shows. 
In creating SPACs to list in the United States, ARC often looks for American executives to become managers, and raises money from investors in China and other foreign countries to provide the initial capital needed to launch them, according to regulatory filings and five people familiar with the matter.
In a 2020 marketing presentation that has since been removed from its website, ARC stated it “was able to craft a Wuhan-based SPAC sponsored by a family office, structured by ARC in Singapore, to allow our client to enjoy the flexibility and benefits of the U.S. financial markets.” 
The SPAC, Yunhong International, led by Orlando and backed financially by Chinese businessman Yubao Li, liquidated last year, citing its “inability to consummate an initial business,” according to regulatory filings. 
Li did not respond to requests for comment.
ARC became involved in Digital World when a Singapore-based ARC executive introduced Cinta to Daniel Santos, a blockchain consultant and entrepreneur in the city-state in 2020, a source familiar with the matter said.
Santos signed a deal with ARC in September 2020 to connect ARC with executives who can form SPACs, according to a copy of the agreement seen by Reuters. In a hypothetical example of a $50 million SPAC, Santos would get up to $97,500 in fees plus 20% of the shares in the SPAC that ARC would receive, the agreement states.
Santos was discussing launching a SPAC with two executives in the U.S. video gaming industry, Lee Jacobson and Brian Fargo, according to the document, text messages and people familiar with the matter. Jacobson and Fargo sought capital - $556,090, according to a regulatory filing – to launch the SPAC. 
It was eventually decided that Jacobson, the head of a San Diego-based gaming company called Robot Cache, would be CEO of Digital World, while Santos and Fargo would be board directors, according to the document and a regulatory filing. In return, the three executives would get thousands of shares in the SPAC, the text messages and the financial document show.  
Jacobson and Fargo didn’t respond to requests for comment. 
In July 2021, Cinta told Santos that Santos would no longer be part of Digital World. “The deal has changed… new owner, new board and management, but I’ll make sure we get shares for you,” Cinta told Santos in one of the messages seen by Reuters.
Jacobson informed Santos that Jacobson’s role had changed from Digital World CEO to board director. Orlando, a Miami businessman whom ARC had worked with on another SPAC, succeeded Jacobson as CEO of Digital World. 

“Somebody else runs it now. We shall see how it all shakes out as I am still on the board,” Jacobson said in one of the text messages. Santos never received any Digital World shares or compensation for putting the SPAC together, one of the sources said. 
Orlando did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters could not learn what led to the changes in the management team and what role ARC played in them.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth will be slower than earlier expected this year because of a new wave of COVID-19 infections, high energy prices and continued supply-side disruptions, while inflation will be much higher, the European Commission said.
In its regular economic forecasts, the EU executive arm said gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro would grow 4.0% this year and 2.7% in 2023. 
The forecast is a cut compared to last November, when the Commission forecast 4.3% growth in 2022 and 2.4% in 2023 and is close to the latest view of the International Monetary Fund, which expects growth of 3.9% this year and 2.5% in 2023.
""Multiple headwinds have chilled Europe's economy this winter: the swift spread of Omicron, a further rise in inflation driven by soaring energy prices and persistent supply-chain disruptions,"" European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said. ""With these headwinds expected to fade progressively, we project growth to pick up speed again already this spring."" 
The Commission expects inflation this year will be 3.5%, well above the European Central Bank's target of 2.0%, and much higher than its own forecast from November of 2.2%. This is also a more pessimistic forecast than that of the ECB from December, when the bank projected inflation at 3.2% this year.
Worried by the longer than earlier expected surge in consumer prices, the ECB has taken a hawkish turn and started preparing markets for the end of its unconventional stimulus with some hawkish board members calling for a rate hike already this year. 
But the Commission, like the IMF, forecast inflation would slow again next year to 1.7%, below the ECB's target, so a potential rate rise would come just as price growth slows again. The ECB's own inflation in December was 1.8% for 2023.
""Price pressures are likely to remain strong until the summer, after which inflation is projected to decline as growth in energy prices moderates and supply bottlenecks ease. However, uncertainty and risks remain high,"" Gentiloni said.
The Commission said risks to the growth outlook were even as the COVID-19 infection wave could have a longer lasting impact and bring fresh disruptions to supply chains, but also household consumption could grow more strongly and investment, thanks to the EU recovery fund, could generate stronger activity. 

Inflation could turn out higher if more cost pressures are passed on from producers to consumers and if that boosts the likelihood of wage growth to compensate. 
""Risks to the growth and inflation outlook are aggravated by geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe,"" the Commission said referring to the risk of Russian military aggression against Ukraine.

The East African country pioneered mobile money payments with Safaricom's M-Pesa in 2007, but its central bank has not issued a digital currency due to concerns about the risks.
The risks included commercial banks being constrained by movement of deposits into the digital currency and financial exclusion of those without access to technological infrastructure or knowledge, the bank said on Thursday.
A digital currency could curb the effectiveness of monetary policy and increase risks of money laundering, the bank said.
But the bank also said a digital currency could offer some benefits especially in reducing cross-border payments costs.
""The balance of risks and benefits of central bank digital currency will vary from one economy to another,"" the bank said in a statement.
For the digital currency to work, the bank said, all countries in the region needed to participate in order to flatten ""the multi-layered correspondent banking structure"" and shorten the payment chains.

Tanzanian government officials said last year https://www.reuters.com/technology/tanzania-cbank-says-it-is-working-presidents-cryptocurrency-push-2021-06-25 they were working on a directive from the president to prepare for the introduction of digital currencies.
The central bank and other public bodies in Kenya are required to seek views from the public before taking major decisions.

Andrea Enria was presenting the results of the ECB's annual review of banks, which he said showed the industry had coped well with the coronavirus pandemic and capital relief measures could be allowed to expire at the end of this year.
But the euro zone's top banking supervisor warned of rising risk from cyber attacks, with a surge in hacks since 2020. 
""We are asking (banks) to strengthen their cyber regime measures and look at a potential increase in attacks and the danger of these attacks going forward,” Enria told a news conference.
Specifically, the ECB was telling banks to train staff so they could tackle this threat and look for weak spots in services they outsource. The central bank has also been running simulated hacks for years.
Reuters was first to report on Wednesday that ECB was preparing banks for a possible Russian-sponsored cyber attack.
Asked about such risk, Enria said the ECB would draw ""the attention of banks in relation to the potential worsening of global tensions that could indeed trigger more attacks."" 
CAPITAL
Enria said six euro zone banks out of the 115 it supervises had fallen short of ECB's capital demands at the end of September 2021, down from nine a year earlier, but this was due to structural issues such as low profits, rather than the pandemic. 
He did not name the six banks, but said two had already filled the shortfall and expressed satisfaction at how banks performed during the pandemic, with most exceeding the minimum requirements despite piles of bad loans in some industries. 

""We are broadly satisfied with the way that banks have operated so far during the pandemic,"" he said. ""Banks need to remain aware of the possible consequences for their balance sheets and strengthen their risk control and governance frameworks in particular.""
Enria added a waiver allowing banks to use some of their capital buffers, introduced at the onset of the pandemic in 2020, would be scrapped at the end of this year, as widely expected.

Investing.com -- U.S. consumer price inflation is set to reach a new 4-decade high in January, but it's still not clear that that will prompt a 50 basis-point rate hike from the Federal Reserve in March. Consumer giants Coke, Pepsi, Unilever (NYSE:UL), Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) et al will also give their company-level take on where prices are heading. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock and Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock are flying after strong quarterly growth numbers. Stocks are set to trade sideways until the big release (which will also be accompanied by jobless claims for last week). And oil resumes its upward march after the biggest weekly drop in U.S. crude stocks in four months. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 10th February.
1. Inflation - the macro and the micro 
The U.S. releases inflation data for January at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), with the annual headline rate set to hit another 4-decade high of 7.3%.  
So much for the sensationalism. The CPI continues to be distorted by things such as used car prices and fuel oil prices, which is why the Federal Reserve prefers to track the price index for Personal Consumer Expenditures (also currently at multiyear highs).
It’s doubtful whether even an upside surprise will stampede the Fed into a 50 basis point hike in March: Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester played down such a step on Wednesday, while Atlanta’s usually-hawkish Raphael Bostic said the inflation rate was “on the cusp” of turning.
For a holistic perspective on inflation, it may make more sense to look at what consumer giants such as Unilever, Coke,  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP), Philip Morris and the strike-hit Kellogg (NYSE:K) say about prices in their quarterly reports today. And don’t forget to check out weekly jobless claims numbers, also due at 8:30 AM ET.
2. Disney, Uber gain as pentup demand is unleashed 
Disney and Uber chose a good moment to report strong quarterly revenue growth at a time when the market started to think that it may have overdone the pessimism on long-duration growth stocks.
As such, both stocks are flying in premarket, even though Uber’s forecasts for the current quarter were below market consensus, and Disney confirmed that the unit that houses its streaming service  Disney+ lost nearly $600 million in the last quarter as it pursued growth at any cost. At least it delivered the growth, adding a net 11.8 million subscribers, way more than expected (and more than Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)). The theme parks business also had a banner quarter as pent-up demand was unleashed. 
Uber meanwhile managed to post a net profit due to gains on its equity investments. It’s also continuing to see strong growth in its food delivery business, despite the reopening of restaurants.
3. Stocks set for mixed open; earnings deluge to continue
U.S. stocks are set to give up some of Wednesday’s sharp gains at the open, with few people willing to make large bets ahead of the key inflation numbers later.
By 6:20 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 46 points or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.3%. The Nasdaq had risen over 2% on Wednesday as concerns over the pace and extent of Fed policy tightening eased a little.
Stocks likely to be in focus later, aside from the consumer companies mentioned above, include ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and L’Oreal, which reported during the European morning, along with Linde (NYSE:LIN),  Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK) and Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG).  Illumina,  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Verisign (NASDAQ:VRSN) report after the close.
4. China opens the credit spigot, again
Policy may be tightening in the developed world, but the liquidity floodgates are opening again in China after the central bank loosened monetary policy last month.
New loans hit a new all-time high in January, well ahead of forecasts, while M2 money supply growth accelerated to an annual rate of 9.8% from 9.0%, also faster than expected.
The news comes at a time when regulators are furiously trying to keep credit flowing to the real estate sector at a time when international bond markets are closed due to ongoing uncertainty over its hidden losses and over who bears ultimate liability for them.
5. Oil resumes upward march after EIA inventory data
Crude oil prices resumed their upward climb after a brief bout of profit-taking by financial players in the wake of Wednesday’s U.S. inventories data.
Prices had dipped after a renewed increase in U.S. oil demand was confirmed by a 4 million barrel drop in crude stockpiles last week, the biggest monthly drop in four months.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 1.2% at $90.70 a barrel, while Brent crude futures were up 0.8% at $92.28 a barrel.
OPEC releases its monthly report on the state of the oil market at 7:45 AM ET, according to newswire reports."

The ECB last week walked back on a pledge not to raise rates in 2022 and policymakers are now looking at how to start unwinding stimulus that has kept the euro zone afloat for years.
""In an uncertain situation - I also refer to the remaining geopolitical tension and its possible implications on energy prices and growth - it is better to watch than be sorry as the old saying goes, or to progress gradually and step by step in normalising the monetary policy,"" Rehn said in Helsinki.
Rehn echoed the words https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/euro-zone-inflation-could-subside-before-becoming-entrenched-lagarde-2022-02-07 of the ECB's President Christine Lagarde who on Monday said that any adjustment to monetary policy would be gradual.
Speaking at an event he organised to mark two decades of common currency in the euro zone, Rehn highlighted the euro's importance in strengthening unity within the European Union amid geopolitical turmoil that causes energy prices to rise and inflation to speed up.
Rehn said the ECB board had estimated there was a risk of inflation speeding up faster than expected.
""The ECB board works with all its tools to ensure that inflation will stabilize at its 2% target on medium term,"" Rehn said.
However, Rehn reminded that energy prices were out of monetary policy's scope of influence.
He said he believed energy prices would remain at a high level for a number of reasons, including low reserves and the need to replenish them after high demand caused by the cold season will subside in Europe.
The ECB board is closely watching wage inflation in Europe, in order to define the right moment for its rate hike, Rehn said.

When comparing the ECB's policy decisions with those of the U.S. Federal Reserve, he said it was worth noting that amid pandemic recovery wages have risen 5% to 10% in the United States and only around 2.5% in Europe on average.
""It's good to keep in mind the rate hikes back in 2008 and 2011 that stifled growth too early,"" he said.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's retail inflation likely accelerated to 6.0% in January, the upper limit of the Reserve Bank of India's tolerance band, driven by higher consumer goods and telecom prices along with a comparatively low rate a year ago, a Reuters poll found.
Inflation is climbing across the world and India is no exception but price rises have stayed relatively tame by historical standards, allowing the central bank to leave interest rates unchanged for now.
Still, prices of daily consumables like tea, cooking oil, pulses, among others, have increased by 20%-40% since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
On a month-on-month basis, prices of food, vegetables, fruits and edible oil showed signs of moderation last month.
The Feb. 7-9 poll of 37 economists predicted inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose to 6.00% in January on an annual basis, the highest in seven months, from 5.59% in December.
Over one-third of respondents, 14 of 37, expected inflation to have breached the RBI's 6.00% upper threshold. 
""Besides unfavourable base effects, non-food components in the inflation basket are likely to add to the headline's rise,"" said Radhika Rao, senior economist at DBS Bank, who forecasts inflation at 6%, in line with the Reuters poll median.
""These are likely to offset easing price pressures from a seasonal pullback in food and steady domestic fuel at the start of the year.""
Still, the RBI - which said reviving growth was an overarching priority - was expected to hold its benchmark interest rate on Thursday, according to a separate Reuters poll and was a close call for a lift-off even in April.
Indeed, inflation was expected to average 4.8%-5.8% in each quarter through at least end-2023, below the RBI's 2%-6% target range, another Reuters found last month.

""Inflation is not showing signs of being persistent yet and remains within the RBI's target band. It is therefore likely the central bank chooses to look through it for now,"" Sakshi Gupta, senior economist at HDFC Bank, said.
""We expect the RBI to support growth and raise rates only once there are greater signs of a more even recovery.""

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turkey's main opposition leader said he will not pay his power bills until Tayyip Erdogan withdraws recent price hikes, and the president's ruling party slammed the move on Thursday as a provocation amid growing discontent over surging inflation.
In January, inflation jumped to nearly 50% after a currency crash late last year triggered by Erdogan's unorthodox low interest rate policy, raising the cost of living for Turks already struggling to make ends meet. 
In response, the government has raised the minimum wage by 50% but also increased the prices of gas, power, petrol and road tolls to account for import price volatility. 
""I will not pay any of my electricity bills from today until Erdogan withdraws the price hikes which he signed on December 31,"" Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said overnight.
In a video released on his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account, Kilicdaroglu also called for a reduction in the value-added tax imposed on power bills to 1% from 18%.
Electricity prices were raised by as much as 125% for high-demand commercial users and by around 50% for lower-demand households at the beginning of January.
The soaring prices have hit Erdogan's opinion polls ahead of elections set for no later than June 2023. The government says credit, exports and investment will help the country weather inflation. 
""PROVOCATION""
A deputy chairman of Erdogan's ruling AK Party, Hamza Dag, said Kilicdaroglu's move was provocative and part of a years-old destructive role played by the opposition.
""This action amounts to a provocation, an attempt to create chaos,"" Dag told broadcaster CNN Turk in an interview when asked whether Turks might follow his lead and not pay their bills.
""I don't believe there will be such an outcome,"" he said, reiterating government comments that Ankara was working on efforts to address public concerns over energy price rises, which he said reflected global developments.
""We repeatedly say that our citizens should be affected by this as little as possible.""

Kilicdaroglu's announcement came after shopkeepers, city councils and a religious community group spoke out this week about the rising energy bills.
Some restaurant owners posted notices on windows highlighting ballooning electricity bills, social media posts showed, while Turkey's Alevi religious minority decided not to pay power bills for their places of worship, known as cemevis.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -The Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy committee (MPC) stuck to its accommodative policy stance to help the economy recover from the pits of the pandemic, keeping the key lending rate at record lows on Thursday.
As expected, the MPC held the lending rate, or the repo rate, at 4%. The RBI however, surprised some economists by also leaving the reverse repo rate, the key borrowing rate, unchanged at 3.35%.
The median forecast in a Reuters poll predicted the RBI would raise the reverse repo rate by 20 basis points to re-align it with short-term money market rates and narrow the corridor with the key lending rate.
The MPC voted unanimously to maintain the status quo on the repo rate and by a majority of 5-1 to retain the accommodative policy stance.
Continued policy support was warranted for a durable and broadbased recovery, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said, noting an improving inflation outlook, prospects for economic growth and uncertainties posed by the fast spreading Omicron variant of COVID-19, and the global economy.
""Private consumption, the mainstay of domestic demand, continues to trail its pre-pandemic level. The persistent increase in international commodity prices, surge in volatility of global financial markets and global supply bottlenecks can exacerbate risks to the outlook,"" he said in his policy address.
""Overall, there is some loss of the momentum of near-term growth while global factors are turning adverse. Looking ahead, domestic growth drivers are gradually improving.""
Elaborating on why the RBI had left the reverse repo rate unchanged, Das noted that the RBI had managed to achieve a rise in the effective reverse repo rate in the market to 3.87% as of Feb. 4 compared to 3.37% in end-August, in a very non-disruptive and seamless manner without adjusting the official rate.
The effective rate is based on the weighted average rate of the fixed rate reverse repo and the variable rate reverse repos of longer maturity. 
India's 10-year benchmark bond yield fell 11 basis points to 6.69% by 0746 GMT, in reaction to the policy, while rupee weakened just slightly to 74.93 per dollar.
The NSE Nifty 50 index rose 0.75% to 17,594, while the S&P BSE Sensex was up 0.78% at 58,923.83.
BEHIND THE CURVE?
Real GDP growth is projected at 7.8% in 2022/23 compared to expected growth of 9.2% this year, Das said.
Retail inflation accelerated to a five-month high of 5.59% in December from a year earlier, while wholesale price-based inflation, a proxy for producer prices, eased marginally to 13.56%, but remained in double-digits for nine straight months.
Data due on Feb. 14 is expected to show retail inflation has risen to 6%, the upper-end of RBI's tolerance band.
Rising oil prices pose a major upside risk to inflation but it should peak in the current quarter and then moderate closer towards the 4% target in H2 of 2022/23 providing room for monetary policy to stay accommodative, Das said, insisting that the RBI's policy was not behind the curve.
Some analysts disagreed.

""The RBI surprised by not only doubling down on its now familiar orthodoxy of keeping rates and stance unchanged, but also expressed a very dovish outlook for inflation for FY23, forecasting it at 4.5%,"" said Aurodeep Nandi, economist at Nomura. ""This suggests that the RBI is likely to remain behind the curve, until macro circumstances warrant a shift of gears.""
The central bank has slashed the repo rate by a total of 115 basis points (bps) since March 2020 to soften the blow from the coronavirus pandemic and tough containment measures. The rate is now 250 bps below its level at the beginning of 2019, when the easing cycle began.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank will review policy rate levels in the third quarter to head off any spike in inflation next year, Governor Perry Warjiyo said on Thursday, after it decided to keep rates unchanged for now to bolster an economic recovery.
Bank Indonesia (BI) kept steady its benchmark 7-day reverse repurchase rate at 3.50%, as widely expected in a Reuters poll. Its two other main rates were also left unchanged. 
The decision came after Southeast Asia's largest economy reported 5.02% growth in the fourth quarter as consumption perked up following the easing of coronavirus mobility restrictions and a booming commodity prices pushed exports to record highs.
Warjiyo told an online news conference inflation will remain benign this year as production capacity will be able to meet rising demand, while reiterating that policy rates will be unchanged until inflation fundamentally rises above BI's 2% to 4% target range.
""Our prediction is that will happen in 2023 and for that, we will review our monetary policy stance, especially interest rates in the third quarter of this year,"" he said.
Inflation climbed to within BI's 2% to 4% target range for the first time in nearly two years in January, at 2.18%.
Warjiyo has said the main focus for BI's monetary policy is maintaining financial market stability amid a global trend toward monetary tightening.
He noted that uncertainty is rising due to geopolitical tensions, high global inflation and rising COVID-19 cases, but he expected the rupiah currency to remain stable due to improving fundamentals. 
BI maintained the 2022 GDP growth outlook at 4.7% to 5.5%, expecting the spread of the Omicron variant to have an ""insignificant"" impact. 
""With the Federal Reserve priming to hike rates as early as March and with the Indonesian rupiah coming under pressure in the early goings of 2022, we believe BI could be closing in on a potential reversal of its stance in the near term,"" ING analysts wrote in a note, expecting the first rate hike in the second quarter.
The rupiah has lost 0.7% against the dollar so far this year.
Capital Economics said it expects BI to raise interest rates once by 25 basis points (bps) this year, followed by more in 2023.

In the past two years BI has slashed interest rates by 150 bps and injected over $60 billion of liquidity into the financial market to cushion the economy from the pandemic shock.
BI last month announced plans for three reserve requirement ratio hikes totalling 300 bps between March to September in anticipation of U.S. interest rate hikes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration is considering a new China tariff probe if talks fail to persuade Beijing to follow through on promised purchases of U.S. goods, energy and services, officials from the largest U.S. business lobbying group said on Wednesday.
The administration is also considering other options, including working more closely with U.S. allies to present a united front to China in demanding a level playing field for international firms, Myron Brilliant, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's head of international affairs, told reporters.
U.S. trade data on Tuesday revealed a massive shortfall https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/us-december-exports-china-drop-cementing-phase-1-purchases-shortfall-2022-02-08 in China's commitment to increase U.S. purchases under former U.S. president Donald Trump's ""Phase 1"" trade deal, implemented two years ago. 
China met less than 60% of its purchasing goal, failing to make good on its promise to increase U.S. purchases by $200 billion above 2017 levels during 2020 and 2021 - a two-year period disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain bottlenecks.
Asked about the ""Phase 1"" deal on Thursday, China's commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said the United States should cancel tariffs on China in order to create a favorable environment for trade cooperation.
Brilliant said the Chamber supports the Biden administration's talks with Chinese officials to hold them to the Phase 1 commitments.
""But should those talks not succeed in meeting the terms of the agreement, then I do think there are vehicles by which the administration can consider taking further action,"" Brilliant said. 
""The administration is considering a range of options, and we're not endorsing any of these options at this time, that could include obviously a 301 action and issues like that.""
The Trump administration used Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, a statute aimed at combating trade partners' unfair practices, to launch tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese imports in 2018 and 2019.
A new Section 301 probe could take a year before any new tariffs or other trade actions are recommended.
Brilliant said that based on his consultations with the administration, any actions would not involve tariffs in the short term.
""They recognize that the tariffs in place are putting pressure on American companies and therefore American workers, and they need to address that piece, despite the challenges presented by China's lack of enforcement of the Phase 1 deal,""
John Murphy, who directs trade policy advocacy for the Chamber, said that pressure was mounting from industry for a more robust tariff exclusion process for Chinese goods than the limited version https://www.reuters.com/business/us-lawmakers-urge-ustr-expand-tariff-exclusions-chinese-goods-2022-01-20 proposed by USTR.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Trade Representative's office could not immediately be reached for comment. In announcing her China trade strategy https://www.reuters.com/business/bidens-new-china-trade-plan-echoes-trumps-assumes-beijing-wont-change-2021-10-04 last October, top U.S. trade negotiator Katherine Tai did not rule out new tariff action.

Brilliant said that any actions that the Biden administration takes should be done in consultation with the business community and with U.S. allies.
""Any action against China that isn't done in a multilateral way, isn't worked out with Europe and with our friends in Asia, will not be as productive,"" he said.

""As long as our current price projection lives, there's no chance we will debate (an exit policy),"" the paper quoted Kuroda as saying in an interview.
""We're not engaging in any debate of an exit. Doing so is inappropriate given Japan's price developments.""
While rising fuel costs are pushing up wholesale prices, the chance of Japan's consumer inflation accelerating sharply was ""very small"" as households have yet to become tolerant of price hikes, Kuroda said.
""The key would be wage growth,"" he added, arguing that steady increases in wages would be crucial for consumer inflation to sustainably head toward the Bank of Japan's 2% target.
""Japan's economic recovery is slower than that of the United States and European countries, and (consumer) inflation is just 0.5%,"" Kuroda was quoted as saying.

""As such, there's no need to scale back monetary stimulus or shift toward policy tightening. Doing so is unlikely,"" he added.
The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield hit a six-year high of 0.225% on Thursday, creeping near the implicit 0.25% cap the BOJ sets around its 0% target, on speculation the BOJ could follow in the footsteps of other central banks and start dialing back its massive monetary stimulus.

COMMENTARY
RADHIKA RAO, ECONOMIST, DBS BANK, SINGAPORE
""The policy communique was predominantly dovish, with the central bank opting to keep rates unchanged, effectively seeing through firm inflation in the March 2022 quarter, and expecting a pullback towards the mid-point of the target range in FY23.""
""The absence of broad-based recovery further strengthened their resolve to maintain status quo. The central bank expects the economy to weather global volatility and spillover risks, courtesy the healthy reserves coverage ratios, narrow current account deficit and steady foreign investment flows, suggesting that domestic policy has the room to lag the hawkish pivot amongst the Western central banks.""
AURODEEP NANDI, ECONOMIST & VICE PRESIDENT, NOMURA, MUMBAI
""Sometimes markets expect dessert, but then realise that the main course is still not over. ""
""The RBI surprised by not only doubling down on its now familiar orthodoxy of keeping rates and stance unchanged, but also expressed a very dovish outlook for inflation for FY23, forecasting it at 4.5%.""
""This comes despite higher oil and commodity prices, growth-supporting fiscal policy, continued economic normalisation, and a distinctly hawkish Federal Reserve. This suggests that the RBI is likely to remain behind the curve, until macro circumstances warrant a shift of gears.""
PRITHVIRAJ SRINIVAS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, AXIS CAPITAL, MUMBAI
""The MPC kept policy rates and its accommodative stance unchanged, which is a surprise compared to market and our expectations that the central bank would signal an exit with a modest reverse repo rate hike and change in language to gradual withdrawal of accommodation."" 
""The government and the RBI are projecting weaker inflation and commodity prices in 2022 as global central banks unwind QE, which they hope will provide room to remain accommodative. We still see 10-year government bond rising to 7.5% by year end because of credit risk appetite improving and/or risk premiums rising, as markets anticipate faster policy rate hikes down the road.""
SANDEEP BAGLA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, TRUST MUTUAL FUND, MUMBAI
""Economics is all about making choices. RBI has chosen to prioritise growth over inflation. Given the expansionary budget, high oil prices, and elevated inflationary expectations, market players were expecting the beginning of the rate hike cycle in India. In the US, economists are expecting the U.S. Fed to raise rates between 5 to 7 times this calendar year."" 
""By keeping all key rates unchanged, RBI has displayed confidence that India can remain isolated from global monetary trends. RBI's average expectation of inflation at 4.5% in the FY22-23 is interesting. Bond yields should remain low given that they had risen in expectations of rate cycle reversal. RBI's status quo is a brave step, which could lead to an unpredictable reaction from the investor community in the longer run.""
SUVODEEP RAKSHIT, SENIOR ECONOMIST, KOTAK INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, MUMBAI
""It would have been opportune to start policy normalization with atleast a 20 bps hike in reverse repo without much of market impact. However, today's policy risks sharper adjustments if inflation risks materialise."" 
""Inflation risks, especially from fuel prices, remain a concern and can materialize relatively soon. Compared with RBI estimates, we estimate FY2023 GDP growth 30 bps higher at 8.1% and FY2023 CPI inflation 50 bps higher at 5%. We believe it would be opportune to increase reverse repo rate hike by 40 bps in the April policy.""
SUJAN HAJRA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANAND RATHI SHARES & STOCK BROKERS, MUMBAI
""The RBI remained more concerned on growth versus inflation, and thereby maintained all the policy rates. The monetary policy stance also remains accommodative. We think that the RBI had at least the space to do a symbolic 15 bps reverse repo hike so as to signal rate normalisation, commitment to be at the top of the inflationary situation and also keep the Indian monetary policy in alignment with the global trend.""
""We expect the rate hike to start in the next MPC meeting. The stance of monetary policy, however, is likely to continue as accommodative.""

""The MPC expectedly kept the key rates unchanged unanimously and reiterated its accommodative stance both on rates and liquidity... The possible hike in fixed reverse repo was a close call and it seems the RBI gauged that markets need to be assuaged over material tightening of financial conditions ahead as global dynamics change and decided to stay put.""
""The gradualist approach toward liquidity and rate normalization may be challenged by various global and domestic push-and-pull factors."" 
SAKSHI GUPTA, SENIOR ECONOMIST, HDFC BANK, GURUGRAM
""A dovish policy... The central bank continued to emphasize its approach of liquidity normalisation through its shift from fixed to variable rate window.""
""The somewhat comfortable inflation trajectory provides RBI space to withdraw monetary support only gradually and reduces the need of any sudden tightening actions.""
""We expect the RBI to support growth and raise the repo rate only by the August policy once there are greater signs of a more even recovery.""
""More importantly, looking ahead, the smooth passage of the borrowing program and the management of the yield curve remains key. The central bank did not commit to any specific actions in this regard in this policy, athough we expect it to continue with operation twists to put a cap on yields in FY23.""
KUNAL KUNDU, INDIA ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, BENGALURU
""The RBI kept the stance as accommodative to be able to continue to provide policy support on a durable basis.""
""Importantly, RBI projected FY22-23 real GDP growth of 7.8%, much less than the official expectation of between 8.0% and 8.5%. While still higher than our estimate of 7.0%, it does indicate a circumspect central bank and the willingness of the RBI to err on the side of caution."" 
""There is, therefore, a possibility that RBI would make every possible attempt to not hike the policy rate in April but push it further to June, though it would still be in line with our expectation of a hike in Q2 22.""
""Also, given that the expectation of inflation peaking by Q421 (similar to ours) may provide some comfort to the central bank. That said, we feel that continuing to ignore inflationary pressure for long will come at a cost and the central bank may eventually have to opt for a more aggressive tightening going forward, thereby by clamping down growth prospects.""
GARIMA KAPOOR, ECONOMIST - INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, ELARA CAPITAL, MUMBAI
""Facing a tough choice between policy rate normalisation amid sticky inflation and global tightening of financial conditions and limiting the increase in yields amid record high government borrowing programme for FY23, in line with our expectations, the MPC retained both policy repo and reverse repo rate and also maintained accommodative stance to support growth on a durable basis."" 
""The recent stress in the bond market, comfort on medium term inflation outlook and need to address uneven domestic growth seem to have prompted the decision. We now expect RBI to hike reverse repo rate in Q1FY23 followed by a repo rate hike in Q3FY23.""
PARTH NYATI, FOUNDER, TRADINGO, MUMBAI
""There were expectations that the RBI may hike the reverse repo rate and may change its stance to neutral from accommodative in tandem with hawkish global central banks amid rising inflation but it continued with its existing stance."" 
""The RBI believes that inflation will peak out soon and there is a need for continuous support to the economy. Generally, it is considered positive for the market but it will be important to see how the market will read it because there could be a risk that the RBI will remain behind the curve that may cause inflation in the future."" 
RUPA REGE NITSURE, GROUP CHIEF ECONOMIST, L&T FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, MUMBAI

""By staying pat on policy rates and keeping the stance at accommodative, the MPC is trying to avoid a knee-jerk reaction in the fixed income markets. This may help banks to avoid huge mark to market losses at the quarter end."" 
""Market participants are already moving towards normalisation following the signals coming from the global economy and the actions of the global central banks. However, today's monetary policy announcement will provide a short term relief to the market sentiment.""

The Monetary Policy Committee voted to keep the benchmark repurchase rate at 4% as predicted by all but one of the 39 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Reserve Bank of India also kept the reverse repo rate -- the level at which it absorbs excess cash from lenders -- unchanged at 3.35%, Governor Shaktikanta Das said in an online broadcast Thursday.
The six-member rate panel, which has been on pause since August 2020, retained its accommodative policy stance with a 5-1 vote, Das said, signaling the economy needed continued support despite accelerating inflation. While retaining the accommodative stance, he reiterated the “as long as necessary” language used since October 2019.
“Monetary policy actions will be calibrated and well telegraphed,” Das said, underlining that there won’t be any surprises.
Bonds and stocks advanced after the decision, while the rupee slid 0.3% against the dollar after the RBI’s dovish policy outlook.
The decision comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration announced a budget that proposed to borrow and spend big to support the economy’s world-beating recovery. As the government’s debt manager, the RBI has to ensure its $200 billion debt program goes through smoothly, while ensuring stimulus steps don’t fan inflation.
Das said he hopes that the market will “act responsibly” and contribute to “co-operative outcomes” on the government borrowing program.
Inflation Outlook
While consumer price-growth has stayed within the central bank’s 6% upper tolerance limit for seven out of nine months this fiscal year, price pressures are seen picking up after the growth-boosting budget and amid higher oil prices.
The RBI lowered the inflation outlook to 4.5% for next fiscal year, down from 5.3% in the current year. The central bank sees gross domestic product growth slowing to 7.8% next fiscal, down from a 9.2% expansion estimated by the government this year. 
“Taking into consideration outlook for inflation and growth, in particular the comfort provided by improving inflation outlook, the uncertainties related to omicron and global spillovers, the MPC was of the view that continued policy support is warranted for a durable and broad based recovery,” Das said.
He also announced new decisions on liquidity:

Speaking at a government news conference, Prime Minister Anibal Torres also emphasized that Castillo's leftist administration will promote a strong government that can prevent monopolies and other concentrations of economic power.
Torres, who previously served as justice minister, was tapped Tuesday night as the president's fourth prime minister since he took office last July.
""Our policy is the free market, free economic enterprise, free business, but with the participation of the state to control monopolies, oligopolies and (other) dominant positions,"" Torres said, as he was flanked by other ministers.
The Cabinet re-shuffle took place after the departure of the previous prime minister, who was heavily criticized for allegations of domestic violence, which he had denied.
Torres is seen as a Castillo loyalist and will be tasked with helping advance the president's agenda in a fragmented Congress dominated by conservative opposition parties.
Finance Minister Oscar Graham (NYSE:GHM), a more centrist technocrat who previously worked at the central bank, was kept on in the new Cabinet, which was welcome news for investors and other business-friendly advocates.

""They won't be able to label us communists because we haven't carried out any actions that align with that political ideology,"" said Torres.
He emphasized that the new Cabinet will seek measures to improve security as well as the South American country's COVID-19 vaccination program, which he pitched as key to economic growth.

Exports last month were expected to rise 17.2% from a year earlier, a Reuters poll of 18 analysts showed, slower than the 23.4% gain in December.
The export forecasts ranged between a rise of 9% and 26%, reflecting uncertainties over the global economic recovery and ongoing supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's government plans to unveil 3.7 billion reais ($706.73 million) in fresh agriculture subsidies after its initial allocation for the sector ran out amid sharp interest rate hikes, according to a source involved in the plan.
The source, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the government will soon sign an executive order announcing 800 million reais that will be allocated as credit to climate-affected producers in the south of the country, as well as farmers in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul.
Another 2.9 billion reais will be earmarked for subsidized loans to producers after the Treasury announced the suspension of these operations this week.
However, the funds for the subsidized loans are reliant on a bill that has yet to be sent to Congress, said the source, adding that the government is still studying what it can cut from this year's budget to accommodate the new spending.
Brazil's central bank has unleashed the world's most aggressive monetary tightening cycle to combat double-digit inflation. Last week it raised rates to 10.75% in its eighth consecutive hike since departing from record lows of 2% in March last year.

The rise in interest rates has burned through the government's subsidy pot, as it pays banks to make loans cheaper for producers. As rates go up, the government must pay more to the banks to maintain the low rates for the producers who have contracted the loan.

(Reuters) -The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on Wednesday named University of Michigan provost Susan Collins as its next chief, making her the first Black woman to lead a regional Fed bank and delivering a measure of new diversity to U.S. central bank leadership.
Collins will start her job on July 1, the Boston Fed said in a statement. By then, the Fed is likely to have already begun to tighten monetary policy to fight inflation, raising interest rates and perhaps shrinking its balance sheet.
Collins will be in place to weigh in on Fed policy within weeks of starting, at its July 26-27 policy meeting. Following Fed rules, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker will continue to vote for the Boston Fed until then.
She fills a vacancy left by longtime Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who resigned last fall during an ethics probe into personal trading by Fed officials during the pandemic.
Fed policymakers and outside observers say it is important for Fed leadership to diversify to look more like America and citing research that suggests a wider range of viewpoints improves decisions.
Choosing Collins is a ""historic step"" for the Fed, says Benjamin Dulchin, campaign director for policy advocacy group Fed Up. ""Working people want an economic recovery that includes everyone this time, and Dr. Collins has the deep expertise that the Fed will need.""
The Boston Fed is one of 12 regional Fed banks whose presidents, along with members of the Washington-based Fed Board, set U.S. monetary policy. Three other Fed bank presidents are women, and two are nonwhite men.
The Fed Board is all-white, though U.S. President Joe Biden this year nominated three new Fed governors who would make the Fed's top leadership the most diverse by race and gender in its 108-year history, if the U.S. Senate confirms them.
Two nominees, Davidson College's Philip Jefferson and Michigan State's Lisa Cook, are Black. The addition of Biden's third nominee, former Fed Governor Sarah Bloom Raskin, would give the Fed Board four women governors for the first time.
The Senate Banking Committee is slated to vote on Biden's Fed nominees next week. Regional Fed presidents, unlike nominees to the Fed Board, do not need Senate confirmation.
A KNOWN FIGURE
Like Cook and Jefferson, Collins comes from academia, a professor of public policy and economics with a PhD in economics. She is well-known among monetary policymakers, frequently moderating at the Kansas City Fed's annual Jackson Hole symposium, global central banking's best-known conference, among other work. She also served as a director at the Chicago Fed for nine years.
Her academic research has focused on emerging markets, exchange rates and trade. Other roles have included senior staff economist for President George H.W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, professor at Georgetown and Harvard Universities, and, in 2001, visiting scholar at the International Monetary Fund.
Less well known is her stance on monetary policy. In 2019, she suggested in an interview that the Fed would do well to consider raising its 2% inflation target to allow the labor market more room to heal. Her view on the current situation is unclear, with a strong job market and inflation at 7%.
In addition to helping set monetary policy, Collins' job will entail overseeing the Boston Fed's banking supervision, community outreach, and its lead role at the central bank in research on technology that could be used if the Fed adopts a central bank digital currency.
The bank recently released the first phase of a multi-year research project with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Collins' alma mater, and will explore issues such as security and programmability in later phases.

Former Boston Fed president Rosengren and Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan resigned last fall after disclosures they conducted active trading - Rosengren in real estate securities and Kaplan in stocks - as the Fed undertook an aggressive rescue effort.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has since overhauled ethics rules to bar most active trading by senior Fed officials, and asked the central bank's inspector general to launch an investigation into the trading. That probe is ongoing.

Investing.com – Correction? What correction? Markets appear to have found their bullish groove again, with Wednesday’s trading seeing the Nasdaq lead the way in U.S. markets, climbing more than 2%. The tech-driven index is now more than 8% above its late January bottom, even as the United States 10-Year Treasury approaches 2% itself.
There’s been one persistent threat to markets though, and that threat takes center stage on Thursday. Beyond the headline inflation report due out tomorrow morning, a full slate of earnings will offer plenty of individual company and sector catalysts.
Here’s what to watch in Thursday’s market.
The CPI and Core CPI report will come out pre-market and is expected to place pressure on the Fed, policymakers, and the market. Economists expect CPI and Core CPI to come in at 0.5% month over month; Core CPI (excluding energy and food prices) is expected to be 5.9% year over year, and CPI is expected to be 7.3% year over year. The latter would be the highest number since 1982.
Of course, expectations have a way of getting priced in; both rising yields and rate hike expectations suggest that the market anticipates a big number and subsequent Fed action in March. Perhaps the biggest question is whether this CPI number will be enough to nudge the Fed towards a 50 basis points hike when they next meet. And if so, can tech stocks and long duration assets hold up in the short term?
The two beverage giants report earnings before the bell. In what has been a more defensive market climate, the two staples have outperformed indices year to date. PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) is expected to show 7.8% revenue growth and 3.4% earnings growth, while  Coca-Cola Co  (NYSE:KO) is expected to post 4.5% revenue growth and a 12.7% drop in earnings per share. Beyond the specific numbers, the two rivals should be able to provide insights on commodity price inflation and what pricing looks like for consumers.
Several tech companies report tomorrow, and none have had flashier ups and downs than Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) and  Affirm Holdings  (NASDAQ:AFRM). Cloudflare, a cloud platform and services provider, is expected to post 47% revenue growth and come just shy of break-even on the earnings front. Affirm is expected to post 61% revenue growth while still showing losses on the net income front. The buy-now/pay-later fintech company is nearly 60% off of its highs set just last November, and whether enough of a slowdown has been priced in or whether they can change the market's mind on their own with their performance is to be seen.
The same goes for Cloudflare, which is down only 48% from its 52-week highs from November; today's Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) report is a sign of how the market can get offsides even as the broader narrative has shifted. Will these companies benefit from the same lowered expectations?"

(Reuters) -The Federal Reserve will have to move faster than it has in the past to remove accommodation and tame inflation that is well above target, but it may not be necessary to start the liftoff in interest rates with a half-percentage-point hike in March, Cleveland Fed Bank President Loretta Mester said on Wednesday. 
Inflation could ease to above 2% later this year as some of the constraints on supply are resolved and the U.S. central bank removes some of the support it provided to the economy during the coronavirus pandemic, Mester said. 
""I don't like taking anything off the table,"" Mester said during a virtual event organized by the European Economics and Financial Centre. ""But, you know, I don't think there's any compelling case to start with a 50-basis-point"" rate increase. 
Mester, who has a vote this year on monetary policy decisions, said rate increases are going to be ""in play"" at each Fed meeting and future hikes after the March 15-16 meeting will depend on the strength of inflation and how much it moderates or persists. 
Referring to the Fed's balance sheet, Mester said the central bank needs to move faster to reduce its nearly $9 trillion portfolio than it has in the past and that it may need to consider selling some of its mortgage-backed securities. 
The Fed said last month that it wants to take a primarily passive approach to shrinking its portfolio. But Mester said it may need to sell some mortgage holdings to meet its goal of having a portfolio that invests mainly in Treasury securities in the longer run. 

""I would support selling some of our mortgage-backed securities at some point during the reduction period to speed the conversion of our portfolio's composition to primarily Treasuries,"" Mester said. 
Asset sales wouldn't necessarily be a first step for the Fed, but rather something to consider later on for mortgage holdings because the Treasury securities in the portfolio have shorter duration and are likely to run off the balance sheet quickly, she told reporters.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's economy does not need more stimulus, but rather more investment from both government and businesses to build up supply capacity to meet strong consumer demand, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said on Wednesday.
Macklem, when asked in an audience Q&A session if government should be spending to further stimulate the economy, said Canada is already in the midst of a consumer-led recovery, and more capacity investment is needed to sustain that.
""To sustain a strong consumer-led recovery, you need investment,"" he said. ""Whether it's businesses or governments, what we need is more focus on building that supply capacity.""
""Demand is now looking self-sustaining,"" he added.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during his election campaign last year pledged C$78 billion https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-election-idCAKBN2FX3M7 ($62 billion) in new spending over five years to foster Canada's economic rebound.
Macklem said that with inflation well above the central bank's 2% target, productivity growth was more vital than ever. Businesses can help increase productivity by investing in new technology to boost efficiency, he said.
""For the economy as a whole, investment is critical to non-inflationary growth,"" he said.
If Canadian businesses fail to go ahead with planned investments, it could impact the path of rate increases, he later told reporters.
""If productivity growth is weaker, that means we're going to have less growth in potential output in the economy, less expansion of our supply capacity and, other things equal, that means that interest rates would have to go up more,"" he said.
PRODUCTIVITY LAGS
Despite a stronger rebound in employment than seen in the United States, Canada's productivity growth continues to lag. This is both due to more public health restrictions and lower business investment, said Macklem.
""The question is, does COVID-19 provide us with an opportunity to change our course? I believe it does,"" said Macklem, pointing to the pandemic-driven rise in digital investments and remote work.
Corporate balance sheets are strong, consumer demand is high and U.S. demand for Canadian exports is rising, with investment intentions among firms at their highest level since 1999, Macklem said. 
The central bank signaled last month it would soon start hiking rates https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/hike-or-not-its-toss-up-ahead-bank-canada-rate-decision-2022-01-26, saying the economy no longer needed pandemic-level supports.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New data on Thursday is expected to show U.S. inflation still at multi-decade highs, but Federal Reserve officials are holding out hope that the peak may be near.
""There is some evidence we are on the cusp"" of inflation that begins to ease perhaps by midyear, Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday.
In separate comments Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester said she also expected inflation to ease this year as the Fed steadily tightens credit. 
The headline consumer price index is expected to have increased more than 7% in January on an annualized basis, a level reminiscent of the inflation shocks of the 1970s and 1980s that has pushed the Fed to accelerate plans to raise borrowing costs and reduce its holdings of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities 
But the month-to-month pace of change has been easing, a sign the economy may be working through supply-chain and other difficulties created by the pandemic. 
Graphic: Peaking inflation? - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/klvykmjjwvg/chart.png 
""What we have seen is inflation not get worse on a month-to-month level, and I am hopeful that will translate into a slow decline as we move through the spring and into summer,"" Bostic said. That ""will give me some comfort that we are heading in the right direction"" and perhaps allow the Fed to raise rates at a slower pace as the economy continues to recover, he said. 
Graphic: Taking it in stride - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/lbvgnwmydpq/chart.png 
There is broad agreement at the Fed to begin raising interest rates at the March 15-16 policy meeting. But there is no clarity about how much the Fed will have to do to counter inflation, or how likely it is that goods supply chains and the U.S. labor market will return on their own to something like the pre-pandemic normal of low inflation alongside low rates of joblessness.
Some analysts argue the Fed is already out of step with where the economy is heading. The unemployment rate is currently 4%, low by historic standards, and may be heading much lower amid record numbers of job openings, rising wages, and an economy that may surge over the year as the current pandemic wave recedes.
Some see the unemployment rate dipping to or below 3% https://www.reuters.com/business/us-road-1950s-style-unemployment-it-may-only-be-pit-stop-2022-02-07 this year, something not seen since the 1950s.
""The economy is blowing through stop signs,"" Ethan Harris, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s head of global economics, said this week. Harris has been among the most aggressive forecasters in expecting the Fed will raise interest rates seven times this year, which would mean hikes at each of its remaining policy meetings in 2022.
""They are really not ready to capitulate and say we are late,"" in fighting inflation, he said. ""I think they should.""
A lockstep, meeting-by-meeting tightening cycle has not been seen since the early 2000s, at the end of former Fed chief Alan Greenspan's tenure.
But the pandemic-era economy has surprised more than once, and there are large competing forces at work - a decline of federal government spending, for example, that could slow consumption, and healthy household balance sheets that could sustain it.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expects a combination of rising inventories, eased global shipping conditions, and initial Fed rate increases will pull inflation down fast -- back to the Fed's 2% target sometime next year, with prices for keys goods like automobiles even falling later in 2022.
Rates will still need to rise, he said, but because the economy is improving, not because of a Fed ""sprint"" to battle inflation. 
Graphic: Where's the panic? - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/gdvzynjakpw/chart.png 
""This Fed will tread cautiously once they feel they have the trend inflation picture in hand. That should come by the middle of the year,"" Shepherdson said, when he anticipates car prices will be ""in free fall,"" housing price appreciation will slow, and year-to-year price comparisons will work in the favor of a lower inflation reading.
FINANCIAL MARKETS, SUPPLY CHAINS
In financial markets the interest rates charged to households and companies already have risen since the Fed started slowing its bond purchases late last year and signaled rate hikes to come. A ""shadow"" federal funds rate maintained by the Atlanta Fed shows bond markets have produced the equivalent since then of a nearly 2-percentage-point increase. The cost to finance a home is rising.
There is some evidence of supply-chain improvement as well. Inventories across many goods sectors have been rebuilt, a buffer against the sort of shortages that jacked up prices for goods early in the pandemic. 

Following the release of its latest earnings on Wednesday, executives at shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk said they anticipated a ""normalization"" in global shipping conditions in the second half of 2022. Port backlogs and container shortages have plagued companies throughout the pandemic as world manufacturers found it harder to reopen the global economy than it was to shut it down in response to the pandemic.
""Inflation has peaked,"" Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""As the pandemic continues to fade...so too will inflation. Global supply chains are ironing things out...And wage growth will moderate as workers get healthy again.""

FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is preparing banks for a possible Russian-sponsored cyber attack as tensions with Ukraine mount, two people with knowledge of the matter said, as the region braces for the financial fallout of any conflict.
The stand-off between Russia and Ukraine has rattled Europe's political and business leaders, who fear an invasion that would inflict damage on the entire region.
Earlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron shuttled from Moscow to Kyiv in a bid to act as a mediator after Russia massed troops near Ukraine.
Now the European Central Bank, led by former French minister Christine Lagarde and which has oversight of Europe's biggest lenders, is on alert for the threat of cyber attacks on banks launched from Russia, the people said.
While the regulator had been focused on ordinary scams that boomed during the pandemic, the Ukraine crisis has diverted its attention to cyber attacks launched from Russia, said one of the people, adding that the ECB has questioned banks about their defences.
Banks were conducting cyber war games to test their ability to fend off an attack, the person said.
The ECB, which has singled out addressing cybersecurity vulnerability as one of its priorities, declined to comment. 
Its concerns are mirrored around the world.
The New York Department of Financial Services issued an alert to financial institutions in late January, warning of retaliatory cyber attacks should Russia invade Ukraine and trigger U.S. sanctions, according to  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI)' Regulatory Intelligence.
HIGH ALERT
The United States, the European Union and Britain have repeatedly warned Putin against attacking Ukraine after Russia deployed around 100,000 troops near the border with its former Soviet neighbour.
Earlier this year, multiple Ukrainian websites were hit by a cyber strike that left a warning to ""be afraid and expect the worst"", as Russia had amassed troops near Ukraine's borders.
Ukraine's state security service SBU said it saw signs the attack was linked to hacker groups associated with Russian intelligence services.
Russian officials say the West is gripped by Russophobia and has no right to lecture Moscow on how to act after it expanded the NATO military alliance eastwards since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.
The Kremlin has also repeatedly denied the Russian state has anything to do with hacking around the world and said it is ready to cooperate with the United States and others to crack down on cyber crime.
Nonetheless, regulators in Europe are on high alert.
Britain's National Cyber Security Centre warned large organisations to bolster their cyber security resilience amid the deepening tensions over Ukraine.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said it was contacting financial firms to draw their attention to the NCSC's warning. 
On Tuesday, Mark Branson, the head of German supervisor BaFin, told an online conference that cyberwarfare was interconnected with geopolitics and security.
The White House https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/white-house-official-discuss-ukraine-cyber-security-with-european-allies-2022-02-01 has also blamed Russia for the devastating ‘NotPetya’ cyber attack in 2017, when a virus crippled parts of Ukraine’s infrastructure, taking down thousands of computers in dozens of countries.
The vulnerability was underscored again last year, when one of the globe's largest-yet hacking campaigns used a U.S. tech company as a springboard to compromise a raft of U.S. government agencies, an attack the White House blamed on Russia’s foreign intelligence services.
The attack breached software made by SolarWinds Corp, giving hackers access to thousands of companies using its products, rippling through Europe, where Denmark's central bank said that the country's ""financial infrastructure"" had been hit.

A spokesperson for SolarWinds said fewer than 100 customers were ultimately hacked.
Some, however, believe the Ukraine crisis has been blown out of proportion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Washington and media of fuelling panic.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - As guardians of stability in prices and financial markets, the last word central bankers want to be associated with is ""panic"".
Yet that is precisely the term used by two top European Central Bank watchers to describe the message communicated by ECB President Christine Lagarde since she opened the door to a rate hike in 2022 to curb record-high inflation. 
Investors took Lagarde's words last week - which were unexpected, as she had earlier all but ruled out a rate hike this year - as a signal the ECB would tighten policy soon, sending borrowing costs soaring across the 19-country euro zone. Government bond yields have held onto their gains even though Lagarde later sought to clarify and soften her meaning.
""There can only be one conclusion: communication mission failed. This is 'from patience to panic',"" ING's economist Carsten Brzeski said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
He drew a contrast with Lagarde's predecessor Mario Draghi, who in 2012 famously quashed speculation about a break-up of the euro with just three words - ""whatever it takes"".
""If you compare this to the Draghi era, it is extremely difficult for the market to know who to listen to,"" Brzeski added in an interview.
Investors' faith in a central bank's communication is arguably its most valuable asset when it comes to managing market expectations, something all central bankers, including Draghi, have struggled with.
But a costly slip of the tongue at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic - when Lagarde said the ECB was not there to close bond spreads for struggling countries - has led to her facing increased market scrutiny. 
Her challenge is compounded by the vagaries of a pandemic-era economy and her desire to maintain a public consensus among ECB policymakers.
Sources have told Reuters that a sizable minority of policymakers who take a hawkish stance on inflation wanted to start dialling back stimulus at Thursday's meeting.
""Lagarde panicked, and shifted to the hawkish side to prevent a return to the Draghi-era of public disagreement (particularly in Germany),"" UniCredit's chief economics advisor Erik F. Nielsen said in a research note. 
He added in an interview: ""If the institution is led by a President swaying between sides it is difficult to give a consistent message."" 
DISCONNECT
After Lagarde's news conference on Thursday, investors brought forward their expectations for when the ECB will end its bond-buying programme and raise interest rates for the first time since July 2011.
Analysts expect the former to happen well before year-end and money markets have priced in the ECB's deposit rate climbing all the way back to zero by December, from -0.5% currently.
This is the widest disconnect between market expectations and the ECB's official guidance, which is for rates to stay at their present record-low level or even be cut, since the guidance was introduced in 2013.
The rapid shift in expectations led another ECB watcher, Pictet economist Frederik Ducrozet, to ask on Twitter if Lagarde would be forced to give a remedial interview, as she did in March 2020 after her remarks had unsettled bond markets.
On Monday, Lagarde told the European Parliament there was no sign that a ""measurable tightening"" of policy was needed - a speech described by Paul Donovan, chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management, as ""accompanied by loud splashing sounds as policy was inexpertly rowed backwards"". 
But Lagarde's messaging has so far failed to soothe market nerves, a problem particularly for Italy and Greece, which have relied on the ECB's bond purchases to keep their financing costs in check throughout the coronavirus pandemic.
Yields on 10-year Italian government bonds have jumped from 1.4% to 1.8% in a matter of days and on their Greek counterparts from 1.8% to 2.5%, while risk premiums for the countries' debt compared to ultra-safe Germany's have widened. 
Lagarde's reassurances that the ECB has plenty of tools to keep spreads under control, including reinvesting proceeds from maturing bonds bought as part of its quantitative easing (QE) programme, has not reassured investors either.
""The spreads widened dramatically because if we don't have QE, what are the tools?"" UniCredit's Nielsen said. ""We only have investments but whether that's enough, no-one seems to believe it."" 
Even former ECB vice-president Vitor Constancio made a rare criticism of its hawkish shift following two record inflation readings, comparing its policy setting to ""looking out the window"" - a citation from U.S. economist Alan Blinder.

""Central banks must be forward-looking and therefore must use models and projections, adding, of course, some judgement,"" Constancio tweeted.
""Looking out the window, seeing the temperature, and deciding, is a very bad strategy for monetary policy.""

(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Wednesday said she is ""trying to keep an open mind"" about the usefulness of a U.S. central bank digital currency, the pros and cons of which the Fed is currently exploring and about which Bowman in the past has expressed skepticism. 
In that consideration, Bowman said, the most important thing is ""the preservation of an intermediated banking model,"" she said at an Independent Community Bankers (NASDAQ:ESXB) of America meeting. Separately, she also said she expects the Fed to release in the near future clearer guidance around the application and approval process for novel bank charters and account access at the Fed.

333,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 11:07AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's German policymakers openly discussed prospects for an interest rate hike on Wednesday, with new Bundesbank chief Joachim Nagel arguing that a move could come this year, as inflation remains uncomfortably high.
The ECB last week walked back on a pledge not to raise rates in 2022 and policymakers are now looking at how best to dismantle unconventional policies that have kept the euro zone afloat for much of the past decade.
Maintaining the Bundesbank's historically conservative line, Nagel, who took charge of the German central bank in January, warned that acting too late in normalising policy could be especially costly.
""If the (inflation) picture remains unchanged in March, I will be in favour of normalising monetary policy,"" Nagel told German newspaper Die Zeit. ""The first step is to discontinue the net asset purchases over the course of 2022. Then interest rates could be raised before this year is over.""
Nagel joined Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot in discussing a rate hike this year, which would be the ECB's first increase in borrowing costs since 2011.
ECB board member Isabel Schnabel, also a German, took a more measured view but also argued that a rate hike may be needed to offset the inflation shock.
""Raising rates would not lower energy prices,"" Schnabel said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) Q&A. ""But if high current inflation threatens to lead to a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, we may still need to respond, as our mandate is to preserve price stability."" 
Inflation hit a record high 5.1% last month and Schnabel warned that higher reading as still possible in the months ahead. 
Markets are pricing 48 basis points of rate hikes by December, which would put the deposit rate around zero, but policymakers and economists question market pricing, arguing for more gradual moves. 
""The process of normalisation will be data-dependent and gradual, avoiding unnecessary disruptions,"" Schnabel said.
Nagel, who has spent much of his career in central banking, said that prompt action by the ECB could avoid more radical moves later that could lead to market volatility. 
""The economic costs are significantly higher if we act too late than they are if we act in good time,"" Nagel said. 
""If we act later we would have to raise interest rates more substantially and at a faster pace. Financial markets would then respond with greater volatility.""
Nagel also said that inflation in Germany, the 19-country euro zone's biggest economy, is likely to ""significantly"" exceed 4% this year, more than twice the ECB's 2% target and also well above the Bundesbank's own projection of 3.6%.

""There are signs that the rise in energy prices could be more persistent, that it is affecting the prices of other goods and services, and that mounting demand is also behind it,"" he told the newspaper.
The ECB last week warned that inflation risks were now tilted to the ""upside"", suggesting that price growth could remain above target even in 2023, the third straight year.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's government can return to a balanced budget between 2022 and 2023, if it wants, taking advantage of a robust economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, central bank Governor Mario Centeno said on Wednesday.
Centeno said last year's budget gap could be ""very close to"" and possibly lower than 3% of gross domestic product. 
The government, which controls spending and revenue and has the final say on the matter, has a more reserved view, with Finance Minister Joao Leao predicting earlier the 2021 deficit would have settled ""slightly below"" the targeted 4.3%. 
The Finance Ministry declined to comment on Centeno's remarks.
""In 2022, the deficit meets the arithmetic conditions to be below 1% ... and the country is in a position to resume, between 2022 and 2023, the budget balance it had before the pandemic crisis,"" Centeno said in a speech published on the central bank's website. 
Parliament rejected the 2022 budget plan in October, triggering a snap election, which returned Socialist Prime Minister Antonio Costa to power on Jan. 30, this time with a majority needed to pass legislation. He is yet to announce a new government and present its budget bill.
The Bank of Portugal expects economic growth to accelerate to 5.8% this year from 4.9% in 2021, and Centeno said economic activity should return to pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter.
The country achieved its first budget surplus in 45 years of democracy in 2019, equivalent to 0.1% of GDP, but in 2020 the deficit ballooned to 5.8% due to measures to help families and companies through the pandemic, while the economy slumped 8.4% in its worst contraction since 1936.

Centeno said resuming the path of public debt reduction, supported by a credible budget consolidation plan, was ""the biggest challenge,"" but added ""we already know the way to go, we have already started it, we cannot hesitate.""
Public debt soared to a record 135% of GDP in 2020 and the government expects it to have dropped to 127% in 2021.

336,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 09:31AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy may be nearing a turn lower in inflation, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Wednesday, though he added he is still leaning towards a slightly faster pace of interest rate increases this year.
""I am very hopeful we are going to start to see that decline ... There is some evidence we are on the cusp of that,"" Bostic said in an interview on CNBC. 
While Bostic still expects just three quarter-percentage-point rate increases will be appropriate this year, he said: ""I am leaning a little towards four. We are going to have to see how the economy responds as we take our first steps,"" with an initial rate increase expected in March.
New inflation data on Thursday is expected to show the consumer price index continued to rise at an annualized pace of more than 7% in January - a high stretching back decades and reminiscent of the inflation shocks of the 1970s and 1980s. That has pushed the Fed to accelerate plans to raise rates and reduce its holdings of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
Bostic said more important to him than the high headline inflation number is whether the month-to-month pace of change continues to moderate, a sign the economy may be working through the supply-chain problems and other difficulties that have been driving prices higher but are associated with the bumpy reopening from the coronavirus pandemic.

""If we are going to see a return to numbers closer to our (2%) target we need to see those month-over-month changes start to decline,"" Bostic said. In recent months ""what we have seen is inflation not get worse on a month-to-month level, and I am hopeful that will translate into a slow decline as we move through the spring and into summer, which will give me some comfort that we are heading in the right direction.""
There is broad agreement at the Fed for the need to begin raising its benchmark overnight interest rate from the near-zero level set to offset the economic effects of the pandemic. But there is no clarity yet on how fast or high the U.S. central bank will move, with some officials still hoping inflation will ease on its own and allow them to be less aggressive in raising borrowing costs.

MADRID/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European countries and companies could end up defining their own standards on green investments if Brussels fails to impose the ""gold standard"" and classifies spending on gas and nuclear energy as sustainable, a Spanish minister said on Wednesday.
The European Union has split opinion among member states with its plan to include gas and nuclear plants - provided they meet certain criteria - in its sustainable finance taxonomy, a rulebook of investments that limits which can be labelled as green.
""I guess that we will have a silver standard,"" Spanish Energy and Environment Minister Teresa Ribera told an online conference organised by German media Der Tagesspiegel, Die Zeit, Handelsblatt and Wirtschaftswoche.
""But there will be many member states and many companies that could try to say that they do not include these technologies in their own portfolio. So I think that it is almost unavoidable that we will have different standards,"" she said, adding she would have preferred a ""green gold standard"". 
The move has also split investors, with some planning to exclude the fuels from their ""sustainable"" funds, despite the EU labelling them as such.
Spain says gas and nuclear technologies should have a role in the transition to green energy, but this should be dealt with separately from the investment framework - which was designed to give a green investment label to only activities that are aligned with the rapid emissions cuts needed to avert disastrous climate change.

While a handful of EU states have publicly opposed the plan, at least 20 would need to veto it - a threshold seen as unlikely. Austria and Luxembourg have threatened legal action over the plan to label nuclear investments as green, citing concerns about waste disposal. 
A majority in the European Parliament could also block it, and Green lawmakers say they will campaign to reach the roughly 350 lawmakers needed for a veto.

338,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation print would push the Federal Reserve closer to considering its single-largest rate hike in more than two decades.
The January consumer price index, due Thursday, is one of the most important data releases before the central bank’s March meeting, which Chair Jerome Powell has signaled will kick off a series of interest-rate hikes. 
A reading above the projected 7.3% annual advance in prices -- which would be the largest since 1982 -- may pressure the Fed to consider its first half-percentage-point increase since 2000, instead of a typical quarter-point move.
Powell indicated last month he wouldn’t rule out a half-point hike, and after an unexpectedly strong January jobs report in which payrolls beat all estimates and wages jumped, traders are all the more convinced that the Fed will be aggressive. Based on Fed funds futures, they now see a one-in-three chance of a 50-basis-point hike, up from one-in-five before the employment data.
“Because the Fed hasn’t taken it off the table, or said it’s extremely unlikely, the market is going to run with it,” said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies LLC. Given today’s strong labor market, “the Fed’s reaction function relies on one variable and that is inflation. These numbers are going to matter, big time.”
Even so, it’s a risky move for Powell, who’s awaiting confirmation to another four-year term at the helm. Critics say the Fed has been too slow to act and is now behind the curve in tackling inflation, and a half-point move could be perceived as an admission that they’re right.
And for President Joe Biden -- whose party risks losing a razor-thin congressional majority in this year’s midterm elections -- it’s all the more important that Powell gets it right. Biden’s approval ratings have fallen in recent months and many point to his administration’s stimulus package for supercharging prices. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“A 50bps hike is likely to receive serious consideration when Federal Reserve officials meet in March. CPI inflation will be another influential data point in that decision. With energy and food prices still rising, Bloomberg Economics estimates that January inflation continued to exceed the average monthly run rate consistent with an annual 2% inflation target. We expect inflation to peak in February.”
-- Anna Wong, Yelena Shulyatyeva, Andrew Husby and Eliza Winger 
Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices likely rose 5.9% in January from a year earlier, also the fastest in nearly four decades, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Still, there’s a lot of ways the numbers could shake out: estimates range widely from a monthly advance of 0.2% to 0.8% in the core.
Airfares and lodging away from home are two of the day’s biggest wild cards, as omicron and the related jump in Covid-19 infections curbed travel. Meantime, the two largest components of shelter -- rent of primary residence and owners’ equivalent rent -- are projected to post another solid advance in January, a theme that’s expected to continue over the coming months.
“We expect most of the softness to be concentrated in Covid-sensitive service prices,” said Robert Dent, senior U.S. economist at Nomura, which is predicting the Fed will hike 50 basis points. “Considering those components will likely rebound strongly as omicron fades, we believe the Fed will look through those price declines.”
The January CPI figures will also reflect an update to the relative importance of certain categories in the consumer basket. The weights, which were released Tuesday and are based on spending habits in 2019 and 2020, include changes like a bigger weighting for used cars and trucks and a smaller one for food away from home -- a reflection of how the pandemic changed consumption patterns in the U.S.
Even if the January jobs report had showed a decline in payrolls, which many had anticipated, market watchers still expected a rate hike in March. But with the gain of 467,000, plus the biggest monthly gain in average hourly earnings in more than a year, traders raised the odds of a 50-basis-point move amid further concerns about the persistence of inflation.
Fed officials other than Powell, even including hawks such as St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Kansas City’s Esther George, have recently stressed they prefer gradual moves. The Federal Open Market Committee in its December “dot plot” penciled in three hikes for all of this year, and those forecasts will get updated in March.
Fed policy makers are projecting that inflation, measured by a separate gauge focused on personal expenditures, will moderate to 2.6% by year end. But the recent broadening out of wage pressures could raise their concerns.
“They’ve pretty much signaled that they want to do this in a very kind of managed step-by-step fashion,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America Corp, who’s predicting a quarter-point move in March. “Now, could they do 50 at some point? Absolutely. If inflation doesn’t come down the way they’re hoping, 50 becomes a real possibility.”

COLOMBO (Reuters) -Sri Lanka's central bank said on Wednesday the country was committed to honouring all forthcoming debt obligations, adding that the island nation was not on the verge of a sovereign default.
Sri Lanka is facing its worst financial crisis in decades, and foreign exchange reserves have fallen to $2.36 billion, according to Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) data released earlier this week.
""The government and the CBSL are committed to honour all forthcoming debt obligations,"" the central bank said in a press release.
""The attention of the CBSL has been drawn to certain recent media reports which have claimed that Sri Lanka is at the verge of a sovereign default,"" it added. ""The CBSL wishes to state that such claims are totally unsubstantiated.""
The shortage of foreign currency is already affecting parts of the economy. 
At Sri Lanka's main port in Colombo, around 2,000 containers packed with food, including rice, sugar and lentils, have not been released for several weeks because of a lack of foreign exchange to pay demurrage and other charges, an importers association said.
Merchants pay demurrage for the use of containers within ports beyond a free time period.
""We have given the list to the trade minister and recommended that the containers be released as soon as possible,"" Nihal Seneviratne, Secretary of the Essential Food Commodities Importers Traders Association, told Reuters.
Seneviratne said an estimated $35 million was required to release the containers, even as food prices on the island steadily rise. Food inflation hit 25% in January, government data showed. 
$1 BILLION IN JULY
Sri Lanka has outstanding sovereign bonds amounting to $12.55 billion, with $1 billion of the bonds maturing in July.
Sri Lanka's trade ministry will hold a meeting with finance ministry representatives on Thursday to iron out payment modalities for the stuck containers, a government official said, declining to be named.
A finance ministry spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment about the central bank's comments or the meeting.
The CBSL has taken measures to secure alternative foreign exchange inflows through bilateral and multilateral funding arrangements with a plan to settle upcoming debt obligations, it said.
""With the realisation of expected forex inflows and the resulting build-up of international reserves, the need for initiating discussions with investors on debt restructuring... does not arise,"" the central bank said.

Citi Research on Monday said that confidence in the Sri Lankan government's external repayment position remains weak and foreign exchange reserves were declining faster than expected. 
""We stick to our base-case scenario that international bonds will need to be restructured by July,"" Citi Research said.

Investing.com -- The U.S. arrested and charged two people with laundering proceeds from the notorious hack of crypto exchange Bitfinex in 2016, seizing $3.6 billion in Bitcoin in the process. Bond markets continue to trade more calmly ahead of a key 10-year note auction in the U.S. later. Eurozone bond yields fall after a top ECB official says the market overreacted last week. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) earnings are due, and Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) is set to open higher after pushing through some chunky price rises in the last quarter. Oil prices edge lower despite fresh signs that OPEC+ can't keep up with rebounding global demand. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 9th February.
1. Bitfinex heist couple charged
The U.S. arrested and charged two people in connection with the hack of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex in 2016, one of the largest crypto heists in history.
New York-based Ilya Liechtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan (aka the self-styled rapper Razzlekhan) have been charged with attempting to launder money and to defraud the U.S. They now face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.
The arrests mark something of a landmark for a crypto industry that has failed to police itself effectively since its inception. It shows that the digital audit trail created by blockchain technology makes it hard, ultimately, to hide behind the anonymity that has attracted many illicit and libertarian users to the asset class. Prosecutors were able to recoup some $3.6 billion in Bitcoin that had been stolen.  
Bitcoin, meanwhile, edged down 0.9% after hitting its highest in nearly a month on Tuesday.
2. Bonds calm down ahead of 10Y auction; Bowman, Mester comments eyed
Bond markets continued to recover some poise ahead of key inflation data from the U.S. on Thursday.
The first big sale of Treasury notes this week passed off without too much incident on Tuesday, but the 3-Year notes failed to rally meaningfully in the wake of the auction, suggesting that caution over the pace of monetary tightening is still the dominant emotion. The Treasury auctions 10-Year notes later Wednesday.
Also of interest will be speeches by Fed Governor Michelle Bowman and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem and the Bank of England’s chief economist Huw Pill will also add some international flavor to the global monetary tightening story later. Eurozone government bond yields, meanwhile, dipped after Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau suggested that markets had overreacted to President Christine Lagarde’s press conference last week.
3. Stocks set to open higher amid pandemic end hopes; CVS earnings due as Chipotle impresses
U.S. stocks are set to open higher later, as the calmer mood music from the bond markets and increasing signs of pandemic-related restrictions being lifted combine to improve sentiment.
By 6:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 193 points, or 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.7% and Nasdaq 100 Futures were up 0.9%.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Chipotle, whose quarterly update late on Tuesday displayed an impressive amount of pricing power, while advertising giant Omnicom also impressed with its earnings after the bell. Early reporters are led by CVS, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME), Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), while Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) headlines the late session.
4. Ukraine war fears ease, despite new Russian maneuvers
The Russian ruble hit a new four-week low, suggesting that local market players are increasingly confident that there will be no invasion of Ukraine.
A diplomacy blitz earlier in the week had appeared to make some progress in taking the heat out of the situation, but both the Kremlin and, later, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken had downplayed claims by French President Emmanuel Macron that Russia’s Vladimir Putin had assured him there would be no further escalation in the near term.
Russia sent a handful of navy ships into the Black Sea earlier Wednesday for what it called drills. It still has tens of thousands of troops either engaged in military drills or on heightened alert just over the Ukrainian border.
5. Oil edges lower but OPEC+ is struggling to keep up with demand
Crude oil prices edged down further but remain close to the $90 level amid fresh evidence that OPEC and its allies are failing to meet their commitments on pumping more.
Platts’ monthly production survey showed that the OPEC+ group, all together, produced an average of 700,000 barrels a day below its agreed quotas in January, the biggest shortfall yet.
Prices are also still enjoying support from low inventory levels: the American Petroleum Institute reported on Tuesday that U.S. crude stocks fell by more than 2 million barrels last week. The U.S. government’s data are due at 10:30 AM ET, as usual."

BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany must focus on existing climate goals and invest further in infrastructure for electric vehicles to protect its position in the global auto industry amid growing competition, including from Chinese players, its auto assocation VDA said on Wednesday.
""We don't need more and more climate goals. The current ones are ambitious,"" VDA president Hildegard Mueller told a news conference. 
""The transformation requires higher speed and concrete policy measures. We as an industry can also be faster in certain areas."" 
A report by the Center of Automotive Management assessing which automakers produced the most innovative technologies placed German carmakers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Mercedes-Benz and BMW at the top of the rankings alongside Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) but three Chinese companies were also in the top ten for the first time - BYD, Great Wall and Geely. 
Building out infrastructure to support a rising number of electric vehicles on roads in Germany was key to protecting its position, the VDA said, pointing to a lack of 5G networks and charging stations among other weaknesses.
At its current pace of building out new charging stations, just 160,000 would be installed by 2030, the association warned - a fraction of the country's stated goal of one million.
It also needed to form partnerships with energy producers and raw material producers in other countries to make enough clean energy to power electric vehicles, the VDA said, predicting that domestic renewable energy production would not be sufficient.
The association expects the domestic car market to grow by 7% in 2022 to 2.8 million new vehicles, an improvement on last year's historic lows but still below pre-pandemic levels.
Globally, it predicted 4% growth in the market this year, with a 5% increase in Europe where recovery from the pandemic has been slower than the United States or China.

The ongoing chip shortage would likely continue to plague the auto industry until 2023, VDA president Hildegard Mueller said in a press conference, though there could be some slight relief in the second half of this year.
""Europe will not achieve independence on chips, but securing existing supply chains is of central importance and posessing a strategic market share in the global market could boost our negotiating position in the case of future scarcity,"" she added.

TORONTO (Reuters) - As the Bank of Canada prepares to shrink its bloated balance sheet, investors say the move could enable expected interest rate hikes to have more far-reaching impact on economic activity.
Canada's central bank, unlike the U.S. Federal Reserve, has never previously attempted to shrink its balance sheet, a process known as quantitative tightening (QT), having bought government bonds in large scale for the first time during the pandemic.
It currently owns about C$420 billion ($330 billion) worth, or 42% of the market, eclipsing the 28% slice of the U.S. market held by the Fed.
Reducing its share of the bond market could transmit monetary policy more effectively to the economy. That's because borrowing costs for households and businesses tend to be determined by longer-term rates rather than the very short-term rate that is set by the BoC.
""Because they own so much of the bond market, the bigger risk is that they don't roll off quickly enough,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities.
Another potential advantage of QT would be to reduce the reserves that the BoC created to pay for bond purchases.
Unlike the U.S. system, banks in Canada are not required to hold reserves at the central bank, while the excess liquidity has driven CORRA, a measure of the cost of collateralized overnight lending between banks, below the BoC's 0.25% target.
CORRA is expected to become the primary interest-rate benchmark in Canada, likely referencing trillions of dollars of derivatives.
The BoC is currently in the reinvestment phase of its asset-purchase program, buying about C$1 billion of bonds per week to replace those that mature. Analysts say the bank could announce a shift to QT as soon as the March 2 policy announcement, should it hike interest rates then as expected, or at the following meeting in April.
The BoC has said it will keep its bond holdings constant at least until it begins raising rates. Rather than selling bonds, it is expected to rely on debt rolling off its balance sheet as it matures.
A so-called passive approach is likely because of the maturity profile of the BoC's balance sheet, say analysts. Nearly 50% of its holdings mature by the end of 2024. 
Bank of Canada bond holdings - https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-CENBANK/BONDS/gdpzynnlzvw/chart.png 
With uncertainty around a number of QT issues, including the need to cap the pace of roll-off and the optimal balance sheet size in future years, analysts are standing by for guidance from the bank.
Prior to the announcement, ""they'll talk us through how the sausage is made,"" said Ian Pollick, global head FICC strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.
For the market, moving to QT would increase the amount of debt that it needs to absorb. By itself, that could be taken in stride, say analysts.
The risk comes from central banks globally also moving to shrink their balance sheets. The Bank of England last week announced the start of QT and the Fed could do so later this year.
The last time the Fed tried QT, from the end of 2017 to autumn 2019, it only managed to shrink the balance sheet by about 15% or so before it ran into trouble. 

""The more central banks that are concurrently unwinding their balance sheets, the more potential disruption there may be for markets which have become addicted to such purchase program,"" said James Athey, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments, in London.

YOKOHAMA/TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan needs a ""more credible"" target date than fiscal 2025 for achieving a balanced primary budget, an official at rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service said on Wednesday.
Christian de Guzman, a senior vice president in the agency's sovereign risk group, also said Japanese households are in a good position to spend once coronavirus curbs are removed and there is greater confidence about reopening the economy and international borders.
Last month, Japan stuck to its fiscal 2025 target for achieving a primary budget balance, even after rolling out massive spending to soften the social and economic blow from the coronavirus pandemic over the past two years.
""In order to achieve some semblance of material fiscal consolidation and balance sheet repair, there does need to be a more credible target with the necessary actions underlying that,"" De Guzman told Reuters in an online interview from Singapore.
Japan entered the pandemic already saddled with debt more than double the size of its $4.6 trillion economy, which means the fiscal strain from the stimulus it deployed during the crisis could be more serious than for other countries.
When asked how far Japan should push back the target - which serves as a key gauge of diagnosing a country's fiscal health - De Guzman said Moody's had no specific recommendation.
De Guzman added that Moody's already said in 2019, before the health crisis, that Japan's fiscal 2025 target was unrealistic, and the pandemic put it further away from it.
""We don't think that it's achievable at this point, given the current policy settings, especially in light of the ongoing accommodation being provided to the economy,"" De Guzman said. 
The government may need to take new measures to promote growth and increase revenues, he added.
""We can't rely only on expenditure consolidation to get you to that primary balance target.""

While Japan's debt burden is large, Tokyo's ability to fund its debt remains stable as a lot of the funding is, directly and indirectly, coming from ""very robust"" private-sector balance sheets, he added.
Moody's rating on Japan is A1, which is four notches below its top rating. Its outlook for Japan is stable.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's central bank left its key interest rate at a record low on Wednesday, seeking to maintain support for a fragile economic recovery, and ruled out a need to adjust monetary policy for now despite a jump in inflation.
The Bank of Thailand's (BOT) monetary policy committee unanimously voted to hold the one-day repurchase rate at 0.50% for a 14th straight meeting after three rate cuts in 2020. The rate decision was expected by all 23 analysts polled by Reuters.
""The committee assessed that the Thai economy in 2021 would expand faster than previously projected, and the recovery would continue into 2022 driven by higher merchandise exports, as well as a higher number of foreign tourist arrivals,"" the BOT said in a statement after its first policy meeting of the year.
""However, the recovery would remain fragile and uneven across sectors, especially in tourism,"" it said. 
The BOT said monetary policy would remain accommodative to aid the economy, still its priority, though played down the economic impact the Omicron variant of the coronavirus would exert given the limited pressure on the health system.
While headline inflation would be higher than previously assessed and could exceed the target range in the early part of the year, the average inflation for full-2022 would remain within target range, the BOT said.
Inflation in January breached the BOT's 1-3% target range, though assistant governor Piti Disyatat told a news conference ""there was no need to adjust monetary policy yet"".
Most economists do not see rates rising for at least a year and some see an even more distant horizon.
Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital markets research of Kasikornbank, does not expect rates to rise until 2023 ""once tourism improves sufficiently to have direct and indirect effects on income, wages, and inflation"".
Capital Economics predicts rates will be left unchanged until the end of 2023.
While the latest coronavirus outbreak had slowed economic activity early in the year, Thai authorities have been trying to kickstart the critical foreign tourism sector, which normally accounts for about 12% of gross domestic product.

Nearly 40 million people visited Thailand in 2019 before the pandemic, but this slumped in 2020 after borders shut and as a reopening started edged up to 428,000 last year. 
The BOT has forecast economic growth of 3.4% this year, with 5.6 million foreign tourists visiting the country.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Meera Sankar knew it was time to give up her dream of buying a home in Prague when she looked at a flat barely big enough for one person but carrying a budget-busting price tag.
The 31-year-old's experience is a common one in Prague and other cities in central Europe where high prices, squeezed by acute supply shortages, have pushed home ownership out of reach for many potential first-time buyers. As the region's central banks now hike borrowing rates, the problem is getting worse.
""I decided to keep renting when I went to an apartment advertised as 60 (square) metres (646 sq. ft) but the apartment itself was only 20 metres and the rest was a garden,"" Sankar, a special effects producer in the film industry, said about the property priced at 4 million crowns ($189,081).
""There was barely enough space for one person and a few pieces of furniture. I spent two years actively looking for something but it is too expensive and not getting any cheaper.""
Much has been made of eye-wateringly high house prices in western European cities such as London, Paris or Hamburg. But it is in central and eastern Europe where the disconnect between prices and local salaries - which on average are well below those in the west - is most acute.
The Czech Republic ranks as the least affordable housing market in Europe with an average of 12.2 gross annual salaries needed to buy a 70-square-metre apartment, according to Deloitte's housing affordability survey released in 2021. 
This compares to six average salaries to purchase a property in Germany and 5.1 in Norway. Czech housing prices also rose 22% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2021, the fastest rise in the European Union for a second quarter in a row, according to Eurostat data. 
""The people now getting into trouble are also the middle-income bracket, and even the slightly higher income,"" said Vit Hradil, chief economist at Czech brokerage firm Cyrrus. 
""So if you think of essential (workers) such as teachers, policeman, firefighters, they are probably unable to afford any kind of apartment in Prague nowadays.""

MORTGAGE COSTS JUMP
The spiralling gains are similar across other Czech cities and central European countries, where since 2010 Hungarian home prices have more than doubled.
In Warsaw's city centre the average price per square metre runs at about 4,000 euros ($4,562.00) compared with 3,770 euros in Brussels where the average monthly net salary is a little more than double the wage in the Polish capital, according to Numbeo, a website comparing costs of living.
An added problem in Prague is the long wait for developers to get construction permits, which has limited supply. In 2021 supply in the Czech capital hit a 10-year low, according to an analysis by developers Trigema, Central Group and Skanska Reality, with 3,300 new flats available on average in the year, 1,980 less than in 2020. 
Prices have also been driven up across the region by fast wage growth and a sustained period of low interest rates, until recent hikes, which made loans more accessible and spurred demand for investment properties.
""If you think of first-time buyers, who had never entered the real estate market before and are only entering now, they pretty much stand no chance to buy unless they are supported by family members with a significant amount of cash,"" Hradil said.
Central Europe has been ahead of most of Europe in raising interest rates after the pandemic, pushing mortgage costs to levels not seen since before the 2008/09 global recession and further raising the bar for those seeking their first step on the housing ladder.
Hungary's central bank said in January it would continue rate hikes to curb inflation. Poland - emerging Europe's biggest economy - raised rates again on Tuesday, by 50 basis points to 2.75%, and hinted at more tightening to come. 
The Czech National Bank, which is re-introducing mortgage lending limits such as loans at no more than 80% of a property's value or ceilings on borrowers' debt load relative to income, also lifted its main interest rate to a 20-year high of 4.50% last week.
Experts estimate mortgage rates could soon near 5%, up from around 2% seen by the market monitor Fincentrum Hypoindex before the Czech bank began lifting its rate from 0.25% in June last year.
""Around 20% of clients in my pipeline have pulled out of the search at least temporarily due to the increased costs,"" said Prague-based mortgaged broker Robin Petrasek, who estimates borrowing costs for each million crowns borrowed with a 30-year term have risen more than 25% from a year ago. 
""With the increased rates it's clear the amount of people able to buy properties will be getting lower.""

HELP ON THE WAY?
Officials are looking for ways to help first-time home buyers grapple with the soaring prices but limited supply of properties leaves them with few tools at their disposal.
Hungary froze retail mortgage interest rates for a six-month period from January to shield borrowers with floating mortgages and has targeted grants and subsidized bank loans worth up to a combined 25 million forints ($80,707.64) available to families.
In Poland, as part of the government’s ""Polish Deal"" economic programme, the state will guarantee the deposit on a property for up to 20% of its value, up to a maximum of 100,000 zlotys ($25,206.06) in order to help people who can’t save up for a deposit. 
Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib told Reuters the city has focused on reconstructing municipal flats to increase supply and keeping a number in reserve for essential workers, such as teachers, police officers and social workers.
""Housing affordability has been one of the main concerns of the current city council in Prague,"" Hrib said. 
The dizzying price increases spurred Tomas Klima and his fiance into action after they had postponed their search when the pandemic began in hopes prices would fall.
They rushed back into the market when prices kept climbing, only to find flats selling almost immediately or visited others that attracted multiple bids well over the asking price.
""We thought with COVID everybody would lose jobs and prices would go down,"" Klima,33, said. ""We looked at the market and saw prices rising all the time. We couldn't afford to wait.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The seismic supply shocks and wild price distortions of the pandemic could finally call time on 30 years of strict inflation targeting by the world's big central banks.
Faced with headline and core inflation rates surging far above 2% target rates and at their highest in decades, central banks have scrambled to lift interest rates from historic lows or flag rate hikes ahead - even though they insist inflation will be close to or even below those targets within two years.
U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers see their favoured measure - core annual gains in the personal consumption expenditures price index - back at 2.1% in 2024 even though it was more than twice that last year its highest in more than three decades.
The European Central Bank sees euro zone inflation more than halving to 1.8% next year while the Bank of England sees UK inflation peaking at 7.25% this year before tumbling far below target within three years. 
Yet the hawks are out in force to show government and the public alike that they have things in hand.
Perhaps these forecasts simply assume ""normalisation"" of monetary policy in the short term and a return to pre-pandemic settings as supply skews in energy and labour markets ease back.
But the problem reopens the debate about whether strict inflation targeting - only in vogue since the 1990s - should continue to guide monetary policy and what should replace it.
Many think the rising sovereign and household indebtedness means any flirtation with deflation - that effectively lifts the inflation-adjusted costs of accumulated borrowings over time and threatens prolonged depression - is simply unacceptable to most governments and economists.
And if so, the long-established 2% norm may just be too close or too risky for comfort. Most Western economies have dallied with either deflation or sub-target inflation since the banking crash of 2008 - hence the rollout of extraordinary loose monetary policies from bond buying to negative rates and all the other distortions that that brings in asset prices elsewhere.
While it may feel like the opposite problem today, it spotlights the flaw in point targeting inflation.
If no one wants to brutalise economic activity now by dealing with the sudden inflation overshoots caused by pandemic supply jolts - also fearing potentially lingering price pressures in its wake - then maybe the solution would be to up those targets and ""de-emphasise"" them in favour of greater discretion.

G7 inflation expectations - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/akpeznxxbvr/Two.PNG 
'PAST SELL BY'
Hedge fund manager Stephen Jen of Eurizon SLJ thinks that sort of pressure may well now build as the Fed acts hawkish but stays ""behind the actual inflation curve"" as the extent of supply distortions are assessed and many unwind.
""My sense is that most economists may still prefer high inflation to low inflation,"" Jen said. ""The debate of whether central banks should adopt a higher inflation target of, say 3%, has not even started in earnest - but it will.""
Financial markets doubt central banks will succeed in returning U.S. inflation to 2% targets any time soon - but inflation expectations in bond markets are 2.7% and 2.4% respectively over five- and 10-year horizons. 
Of course the Fed already bought itself a lot of wriggle room with its recent move away from a point inflation target in favour of aiming for a rather vague 2% average over time. And its mandate explicitly includes full employment as well as stable prices, balancing any tendency to stamp on inflation to the detriment of jobs.
While ECB lent in that direction too, neither it nor the other central banks have moved as far and their remits remain far stricter on meeting the explicit price goals.
Fears of an overreaction to missing the point target on the upside today in part mirrors the problem that largely sounded the beginning of the end for inflation targeting 15 years ago. 
Many accused central banks of the early 2000s of blowing the credit bubble that bust spectacularly in 2008 with overly loose monetary policy simply because headline inflation rates were well behaved are 2% targets and other metrics were ignored.
In retrospect, inflation targeting was still new at the time - only a decade or so old and having replaced a range of post-World War Two monetary goals from the gold standard and fixed exchange rates to ranges for money supply growth. 
All these had failed too and were similarly prone to either supply shocks or speculation.
The one untried alternative that's been proposed for years is that central banks instead target nominal gross domestic product growth. 
Advocates say it allows central banks a measurable goal they can affect rather than over or under-reacting to supply shocks they have no control over - crucially avoiding assumptions about economic slack and potential that are impossible to read in real time.
Former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) chief economist and UK Treasury minister Jim O'Neill says he's become a convert to the Nominal GDP target idea.

""Single point inflation targeting is way past its sell date,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -China's ""zero-COVID"" restrictions could weigh on world growth by prolonging supply chain disruptions and global inflationary pressures, a Bank of Japan policymaker said, warning of the broadening fallout from rising Omicron variant cases.
Board member Toyoaki Nakamura also said it was premature for the BOJ to tighten monetary policy, as inflation and wage growth remain subdued compared with other economies.
""I don't think conditions have fallen into place for Japan to modify monetary policy,"" Nakamura told a news conference.
""If we raise interest rates now or before wages pick up, we would be taking away from companies money that would otherwise have been used to raise pay,"" he said on Wednesday.
A former executive at Japanese electronics giant Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Ltd, Nakamura said supply chain disruptions won't disappear easily partly as China - the world's factory - maintains strict curbs on economic activity to combat the pandemic.
""There's a risk China's 'zero-COVID' policy amid widening Omicron infections could weigh on the global economy, as well as prolong global supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures,"" he said.
His remark follows a warning last month by International Monetary Fund head Kristalina Georgieva that China should reassess its zero-COVID approach to the pandemic.
""Semiconductor chips will probably be in short supply throughout this year,"" Nakamura said.
Japan's long-term interest rates have crept up on market speculation the BOJ could follow in the footsteps of other major central banks executing or eyeing rate hikes.
While global commodity and energy inflation is pushing up prices of some goods in Japan, such cost-push inflation will be short-lived unless accompanied by higher wages, Nakamura said.
There is also uncertainty over how quickly companies will pass on rising raw material costs to households, he said.

""We'll patiently maintain our ultra-easy monetary policy until wages begin to rise sustainably,"" Nakamura said.
Japan has not been immune to the impact of global commodity price rises with wholesale inflation hitting record highs. But core consumer prices rose just 0.5% in December from a year earlier, well below the BOJ's 2% target, as slow wage growth weighs on consumption and discourages firms from raising prices.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A surge in deposits caused by the government's huge cash payouts is straining some Japanese lenders, complicating the central bank's efforts to mitigate the side-effects of its negative interest rate policy.
Industry leader MUFG Bank was charged negative rates last month on deposits parked with the Bank of Japan - the first time since the policy was adopted in 2016.
It was an unintended consequence of a steady rise in deposits, as households and firms saved some of the payouts they received from the government to weather the pandemic's hit.
The balance of deposits at major banks, including MUFG, hit 446 trillion yen ($3.87 trillion) as of January, up 14% from pre-pandemic levels in early 2020.
Deposits could rise further as the government plans to spend another 2 trillion yen in cash payouts to households with children.
MUFG's case underscores how years of efforts by mega-banks to avert paying the interest, such as by shifting money out of BOJ reserves into investment and loans, may be reaching a limit.
""The amount of deposits exceeded a certain threshold. There are also limits to managing funds in the money market in ways that make economic sense,"" MUFG told Reuters in a written reply, when asked why it decided to keep as much funds in BOJ reserves at the risk of being charged 0.1% interest.
As part of efforts to keep borrowing costs low and prod lenders to loan out money rather than sit on the piles of cash, the BOJ imposes 0.1% interest on a portion of excess reserves financial institutions park with the central bank.
The BOJ has taken steps to limit the size of reserves forwhich the charge applies to mitigate the damage ultra-low rates inflict on bank profits.
Indeed, the charge applied only to about 300 billion yen of MUFG's reserves in a one-month period through Jan. 15, a drop in the ocean considering mega-banks' combined deposits at the BOJ worth some 186 trillion yen.
The BOJ also compensates major banks with a 0.1% interest reward for a separate layer of reserves. The total sum the banks receive annually is estimated at around 950 billion yen.
""I don't see it as any sign the potential demerit of our negative rate policy is materialising,"" BOJ Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe said last week, countering the view MUFG's case highlighted the drawbacks of massive stimulus.
But the episode comes at a delicate time for the BOJ, which is struggling to tame market speculation of a near-term policy tweak as other central banks eye an exit from ultra-low rates.

""Financial institutions are still angry about the BOJ's negative rate policy,"" said a source with direct knowledge of the BOJ's exchange with private lenders. ""Furthermore, they want a steeper yield curve that would widen their margin.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - As Indonesia's economy recovers from the pandemic, fiscal stimulus should no longer be a dominant factor driving growth, its finance minister said on Wednesday, signaling authorities will stick with their fiscal consolidation plans.
Sri Mulyani Indrawati was responding to a question at an investment forum about whether the government was considering extending the period during which it can design annual budgets with a deficit of more than 3% of gross domestic product.
The budget deficit ceiling was waived for three years from 2020 to allow bigger spending and debt to help Southeast Asia's largest economy weather the pandemic impacts. 
The ceiling will be reinstated next year, which some lawmakers and economists say could be difficult with the recovery not yet on a firm footing. 
""If the momentum of the recovery continues (to be) strong across the board ... then the support from the fiscal (side) should not become the most dominant one,"" Sri Mulyani said.
Indonesia on Monday reported 3.7% GDP growth for 2021, in what the minister said showed a broad-based recovery from a 2% contraction in 2020.
The government targets 5.2% growth this year, but Sri Mulyani said the economy faces headwinds from global monetary tightening and moderating commodity prices to a COVID-19 resurgence. 
Authorities, she said, will be open minded in policymaking, but the government needed to restore the fiscal space for any future shock.
""We need to continue to support the recovery until it's really stable and sustainable,"" she said, highlighting the importance of fiscal discipline. 

This year's budget deficit will likely narrow to near 4% of GDP, compared with an initial forecast of a 4.85% gap, Sri Mulyani said, expecting bigger revenue from tax reforms passed by parliament in late 2021.
Last year's fiscal deficit was 4.65% of GDP, much smaller than the government's expected 5.7% deficit, as state revenue got a boost from record exports amid high commodity prices.

LONDON (Reuters) -Almost overnight, inflation-linked bonds have become the hot ticket in global financial markets, pitting banks against hedge funds in a battle for market share and scarce trading talent.
The $4.4 trillion market for inflation-linked bonds, known as linkers, has shot to prominence as prices spiral higher in a post-pandemic world of supply chain glitches and abundant government spending.
""There is tremendous demand for the product, which is hot, just like green bonds are hot,"" said Ben De Forton, head of debt capital markets SSA France at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
When the United States issued its first Treasury Inflation Protected Security (TIPS) in 1997, inflation was just above 2%, now price growth is running at 7% in the world's biggest economy and not far behind in Europe.
Investment products whose payouts rise and fall in line with inflation have been around in various forms for several centuries. But in their current one they date to the 1980s when Britain issued its first linker, followed by Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United States and several emerging economies.
But while linkers are hardly new, most fixed income traders in London or New York will have begun working long after the last major inflation flare-up in the developed world, the 1970s.
They will probably have cut their teeth buying and selling bonds against a backdrop of record low price growth.
Even those who have traded linkers are unlikely to have done so daily and in large volumes, with the market previously driven primarily by long-horizon pension and insurance investors.
Orders for a 3 billion euro ($3.43 billion) French linker last month surpassed 23.5 billion euros and almost 200 investors bought in, double the average on past linker deals, France's debt agency head Cyril Rousseau told Reuters.
Another linker sale last week, by Italy, was almost four times subscribed and France is now exploring a green linker https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/france-keeps-2022-bond-issuance-plans-steady-eyes-green-linker-2021-12-08.
BULLISH INFLATION PICTURE 
""This inflation volatility is driving a real change in volumes and has become a focus in rates for the first time since 2008,"" Charles Bristow, global head of rates trading at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in London, said of the shift. 
Globally the linker market has almost doubled in size from $2.4 trillion a decade ago, but supply remains tight, which along with inflation fears has meant more volatile trading.
Data from electronic bond trading platform Tradeweb shows average daily trading volume of inflation-linked euro area sovereign bonds with a maturity of five years and under was up 90% in January from the same month last year. 
Meanwhile, average daily volume on TIPS approached $22 billion last year, the highest on record, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association says. 
""I've been doing this for about 12 years and I've always been quite bearish on inflation and for the first time now, we can see a fairly bullish inflation picture globally,"" said Su Liu, a managing director in rates trading at Citibank.
    ""The day is a lot more volatile, a lot busier."" 
Outstanding TIPs total $1.6 trillion, but make up barely 8% of the U.S. Treasury debt portfolio, while linkers make up roughly 10% of French and Italian issuance, and 24% in Britain.
But in an indication of the change underway, inflation-sensitive exchange traded products (ETPs) received record investment flows of over $47 billion last year, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) says, equivalent to the cumulative inflow during 2015-2020. 
BUMPER REVENUES
As banks tap a rich new revenue seam, the top 15 trading desks globally earned $2.3 billion from trading inflation products, a decade high and more than double 2019 levels, consultancy Vali Analytics estimates.
Growth may be driven by inflation swaps, with traders saying hedge funds are betting on the direction of inflation and single data prints, while insurance and pension investors are increasingly using swaps to hedge inflation exposure.
Colm Murtagh, head of U.S. institutional rates at Tradeweb, said he had ""definitely seen"" increased demand from hedge funds for inflation swaps launched on its platform last year.
    The boom is forcing some firms to beef up desks. One trader, who declined to be named, said the London-based bank he worked for was ""aggressively"" hiring from mid-tier rivals. 
Professional networking site LinkedIn shows hedge funds and banks aggressively adding inflation expertise. A search showed at least five inflation traders have jumped jobs in the last year.
And as central banks prepare an inflation crackdown for the first time in a generation, finding the right expertise is just as crucial for the investment community, said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) who worked at the Fed's risk section during the 2008 crisis.

""Most of your career has been characterized by falling interest rates on the long end,"" Tannenbaum said. ""And now it looks like we might be starting something, it may not be extreme, but it's a reversal. So how do you react?""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. goods exports to China fell in December, cementing a massive shortfall in Beijing's two-year purchase commitments under the ""Phase 1"" trade deal negotiated by former President Donald Trump's administration.
The U.S. Census Bureau said on Tuesday that the United States' 2021 goods trade deficit with China rose by $45 billion, or 14.5%, to $355.3 billion, the largest since a 2018 record of $418.2 billion.
The 2020 gap was $310.3 billion, a 10-year low driven by coronavirus pandemic lockdowns.
The global U.S. trade deficit in 2021 surged 27% to a record $859.1 billion as businesses restocked inventories to meet robust demand.
NO EXTRA PURCHASES
The data showed China by far missed its commitments to purchase an additional $200 billion worth of U.S. farm and manufactured goods, energy and services above 2017 levels - the year before a bitter trade war embroiled the world's two largest economies.
The purchase commitments were the centerpiece of Trump's Phase 1 trade deal with China, which launched in mid-February 2020 and halted a threatened escalation of tariffs. 
The deal also called for China to grant increased U.S. market access to its agricultural biotechnology and financial services sectors and mandated some intellectual property protection improvements.
An analysis of final 2021 Census trade data compiled by economist Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics showed China met just 57% of its full two-year goods and services targets.
Beijing's purchases of the goods, energy and services targeted in the Phase 1 agreement were not even enough to return to China's baseline 2017 level of purchases of U.S. imports after retaliatory tariffs had eroded them in 2018 and 2019, he said.
""Put differently, China bought none of the additional $200 billion of exports Trump’s deal had promised,"" Bown said in his analysis. 
China exceeded the 2017 baseline in agricultural purchases, but only reached 83% of the $73.9 billion two-year farm goods target, Bown's analysis showed.
Services exports to China, which had been a bright spot for U.S. trade, fell sharply as the pandemic slashed Chinese tourism and business travel to the United States and cut the flow of Chinese students to U.S. universities, reaching only 52% of the target.
""We have engaged the PRC (People's Republic of China) on its shortfalls for months, but have not seen real signs towards making good on the purchase commitments and our patience is wearing thin,"" Adam Hodge, a spokesperson for the U.S. Trade Representative's office, said in an e-mailed statement.
""Regardless of how these negotiations conclude, the fact remains that the Phase One Agreement did not address the core problems with the PRC's state-led economy,"" Hodge said, adding that the Biden administration would ""shape the environment around China"" by building U.S. competitiveness, diversifying markets and limiting the impact of China's ""harmful practices.""
Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington, said China has been working on implementation of the agreement ""despite the impact of COVID-19, global economic recession and supply chain disruptions.""
""The Phase 1 deal benefits China and the U.S. and the whole world,"" Liu added. 
Beijing has sought the removal of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods that were left in place by the Phase 1 deal.
The agreement contains a clause that the two parties ""project that the trajectory of increases"" in China's purchases ""will continue in calendar years 2022 through 2025"" without specific targets.
Former USTR chief of staff Jamieson Greer, who helped negotiate the Phase 1 deal, said that clause could be used to pursue ""retrospective enforcement for what's been missed.""

""It's in the interest of the administration to pursue enforcement,"" said Greer, a trade lawyer with King and Spalding.
""With a few kind of narrow exceptions, we haven't really seen that much enforcement"" on trade matters from the Biden administration, he added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China's development banks provided $23 billion in financing for infrastructure projects in sub-Saharan Africa from 2007 to 2020, more than double the amount lent by such banks in the United States, Germany, Japan and France combined, a new study showed.
The Center for Global Development think tank said a review of 535 public-private infrastructure deals funded in the region in those years showed that China's investments dwarfed those of other governments and multilateral development banks.
Nancy Lee, lead author of the paper and a senior policy fellow at the center, said overall public funding for projects in sub-Saharan Africa remained stuck at around $9 billion, well short of what the region needs for roads, dams and bridges.
""There is a lot of criticism of China,"" she said. ""But if Western governments want to boost productive and sustainable investments to meaningful levels, they need to deploy their own development banks and press the multilateral development banks to make these investments a priority.""
Between 2007 and 2020, China Exim Bank and China Development Bank provided $23 billion in financing, while all other major development finance institutions combined provided $9.1 billion, the report found.
It noted that the main U.S. development finance agency, now known as the U.S. International Development Finance Corp, lent just $1.9 billion for infrastructure in the region during that period, less than a tenth of what China provided.
Multilateral development banks like the World Bank provided just $1.4 billion per year on average for public-private infrastructure projects in sub-Saharan Africa from 2016-2020, the report found.
China's lending to Africa has come under heightened scrutiny in recent years for lack of transparency and its use of collateralized loans, with economists at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank warning that many low-income countries are facing or already in debt distress.
But Western countries have been slow to pump up investments despite ""much rhetoric,"" Lee said.
The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden in July unveiled a new push to expand business ties between U.S. companies and Africa, with a focus on clean energy, health, agribusiness and transportation infrastructure. But its ongoing review of trade policies has left the private sector skittish about committing funds.

More news could come soon.
A top U.S. trade official last week said Washington had been engaging in robust talks with Kenya as part of its drive to expand trade investment on the African continent, and would have more to say in coming weeks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Justin Soffer always enjoyed the car-buying process, with the typical back-and-forth negotiations that led to good discounts.
But seven dealers and three months later, the marketing consultant from the Berkshires emerged shellshocked last year – and a lot lighter in the wallet.
Along the way were several scenes from a classic farce, involving running to dealerships when cars arrived, salespeople scrambling to get keys and jacked-up prices. 
Welcome to car buying in the pandemic era.
""It's unusual and dysfunctional,"" says Soffer, who ended up buying a Toyota RAV4 in December – at the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price, which he considered a win. ""I gave up on the idea that I would get a good deal.""
Wheeling and dealing on car prices is an American tradition, but lately the dealer is in the driver's seat. Blame a mix of chip shortages, supply-chain slowdowns and consistently high consumer demand.
The result: The average new car price in the United States hit $47,077 in December, a new record, according to Kelley Blue Book. That is $5,742 more than the previous December – and up over $800 in a single month.
""The average price people are paying for cars is well above sticker at this point,"" says Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights for car shopping and research site Edmunds. 
That lack of negotiating power filters down into auto loans. The average loan balance on new cars for 2021's third quarter was $37,746, a new high that carries a monthly payment of $617, according to credit agency Experian (OTC:EXPGF). Even used cars are coming with big loans, with an average $26,230 and a $471 monthly bill.
So what is a car buyer to do? Here are tips for negotiating in this new era:
MAINTAIN FLEXIBILITY
If you have to drive a certain model, with certain trims, in a certain color, then your negotiating leverage is minimal. The fewer must-haves on your list, the better for dealmaking. 
""Flexibility is the key word here,"" says Matt Degen, editor for Kelley Blue Book. ""You want to have some wiggle room.""
The same principle applies to where you shop. Since so much car-buying takes place online these days, expand your radius far beyond just local dealerships.
USED CARS WILL NOT SAVE YOU
Traditional personal finance advice is to almost always buy used, since vehicles lose a big chunk of value the minute you drive them off the lot. Today you might be surprised.
""Used prices have skyrocketed as well, almost 30% year-over-year,"" says Caldwell. ""As those prices get higher, buyers are pushed further out in age – so if you were considering a three-year-old car, now you might have to go to five or seven years old.""
INTEREST RATES ARE STILL LOW
One bright spot for buyers is that interest rates are still fairly low, historically speaking. That means even a more sizeable loan could still be manageable on a monthly basis, especially since many automakers ""subsidize"" rates to offer enticing deals like 1.9% financing, Caldwell says.
The average loan rate on new cars in last year's fourth quarter was a modest 4.2% – although the Federal Reserve has signaled its intention to raise rates in coming months, so expect pricier loans in future. 
Consider coming into a car purchase with a loan preapproval from your own bank, so you are not limited to whatever financing the dealer offers.
MAXIMIZE TRADE-INS
If the price on all cars is headed up, that is good news regarding the trade-in you are currently driving. That is one area where you actually do have some negotiating leverage. And do not feel obligated to negotiate with the dealer you are buying from: You could get a superior offer from a competing dealer, or by selling privately.
USE TIME TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
If you need a car tomorrow, that is one thing. But if you can wait – continue driving your old car for another year or two, for example – then you should consider doing so. The current supply-chain nightmare will not last forever, and red-hot car prices should start to normalize.
If you do have some time flexibility, you can also consider the ""European model of building your car to order,"" Degen says.

More American automakers are moving in this direction, which expands your options beyond whatever dealers happen to have available – which is not a lot right now. 
Says Degen: ""The upside is that you get the exact vehicle you want. The downside is that you will have to wait.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Thousands of Argentines marched through the streets of Buenos Aires on Tuesday to protest against a likely deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to revamp more than $40 billion of debt the country cannot pay back.
The protesters paraded through the capital with banners saying ""no to paying the IMF"" and ""no to an IMF deal"", a sign of rising tension in the South American nation over the tentative agreement struck late last month.
Argentina and the IMF announced a breakthrough in talks in late January to revamp a failed 2018 loan, which would see debt payments pushed back but involve pledges to meet certain economic targets agreed with the lender.
That agreement still needs details ironed out and approval from both Argentina's Congress and the IMF board.
""No to the government's deal with the IMF,"" said Celeste Fierro, a protest leader, wearing a T-shirt reading ""scams are not paid"".
""They want us to pay with more (fiscal) adjustments, with more precariousness and taking more out of us, that is why we cannot allow the submission of our people to the designs of the IMF."" 
IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said last week that while an agreement had been reached in principle with Argentina on a new standby loan, ""hard work"" still lay ahead.
In Argentina, splits have appeared in the ruling Peronist coalition over the deal, with one prominent lawmaker stepping down from his position in Congress in opposition to it.
Juan Carlos Giordano, a representative for a leftist group in the march, said that the debt deal was akin to making working class people foot the bill and that the funds should be used to pull people out of poverty.

""The aim is to defend wages, defend work so that the money goes to combat social ills,"" he said, blaming the previous government of conservative Mauricio Macri for taking on the IMF debt.
""We are marking a path. The path of no submission, no to resignation, and no to the IMF.""

""We could have it be worse before it gets better but it is definitely going to get better,"" Daly told CNN, adding that even so she doesn't expect inflation to have fallen to 2% by the end of the year. Consumer prices rose 7% last year, eating into American paychecks.
The Fed is expected to begin raising interest rates from near-zero levels next month, a move Daly said she supports. When it does, Daly said, the Fed should do neither too little nor be ""overly aggressive,"" mindful that the Fed alone cannot cure inflation that's caused in large part by ongoing pandemic disruption.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a bill on Tuesday to provide the Postal Service (USPS) with about $50 billion in financial relief over a decade and requiring future retirees to enroll in a government health insurance plan.
The House voted 342-92 for what House Oversight Committee chair Carolyn Maloney said would ""preserve and strengthen the Postal Service for future generations.""
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he plans to ask the Senate to approve the bill by Feb. 18. ""This postal reform legislation has been over a decade in the making,"" Schumer said. 
USPS has reported net losses of more than $90 billion since 2007 and Tuesday reported a net loss of $1.5 billion for the quarter ending Dec. 31.
One reason is 2006 legislation mandating it pre-fund more than $120 billion in retiree healthcare and pension liabilities.
Senator Gary Peters, who chairs the committee overseeing USPS, said the bill will ""help the Postal Service overcome unfair and burdensome financial requirements, provide more transparency and accountability to the American people, and continue its nearly 250-year tradition of service.""
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy in March 2021 proposed cutting $160 billion in predicted losses over the next decade, which included https://about.usps.com/what/strategic-plans/delivering-for-america/assets/USPS_Delivering-For-America.pdf#:~:text=The%20Plan%E2%80%99s%20strategic%20initiatives%20are%20designed%20to%20reverse,next%20ten%20years%20by%20achieving%20break-even%20operating%20performance financial reforms in the House bill. USPS also adopted new delivery standards in October https://www.reuters.com/world/us/slower-us-mail-standards-take-effect-friday-2021-09-29 that slow some first-class mail deliveries. DeJoy called the legislation ""vital to the United States Postal Service and the American People.""
The bill eliminates requirements USPS pre-fund retiree health benefits for current and retired employees for 75 years, a requirement no business or other federal entity faces. USPS projects it would sharply reduce its pre-funding liability and save it roughly $27 billion over 10 years.
It requires future retirees to enroll in Medicare. About 25% of postal retirees do not enroll in Medicare even though they are eligible, which results in USPS paying higher premiums than other employers. USPS estimates the change could save it about $22.6 billion over 10 years.
The White House and postal unions support the bill as does the Greeting Card Association, Hallmark and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).

The bill requires USPS to maintain six-day a week mail deliveries and develop an online weekly performance data dashboard by ZIP code, and expands special rates for local newspaper distribution.
USPS generally does not receive taxpayer funding but Congress gave it a $10 billion loan in 2020 to address COVID-19 expenses that it opted to forgive.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday approved legislation to fund federal government agencies through March 11 and avoid a chaotic shutdown of many of Washington's operations when existing money expires at midnight on Feb. 18.
The House voted 272-162 to approve the stop-gap measure that will give Democratic and Republican negotiators in the House and Senate an additional three weeks to work out a deal on a full-year funding bill.
The temporary measure -- the third since the start of the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1 -- now goes to the Senate, where Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has promised prompt action.
Negotiators have been struggling for weeks to agree on the so-called ""omnibus"" spending bill to finance the federal government's wide-ranging activities through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year.
During House debate, Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro noted that the ""omnibus is the only way to unlock"" the full $1 trillion in spending on infrastructure projects authorized by Congress late last year.
The measure would also beef up spending on defense and veterans programs, along with environmental, education and other domestic initiatives. 
Schumer also expressed confidence that a full-year funding bill would be set in place by March 11.
Meanwhile, Senator Richard Shelby, the senior Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters negotiators were nearing a deal on top-line spending for such a bill. That figure might hover around $1.5 trillion.
Republicans were insisting the money be equally divided between defense and non-defense programs, while Democrats who control Congress fashioned bills providing slightly more money on the non-defense side of the ledger.

Once the framework of a bill is sketched out through an overall spending level, negotiators are expected to dive into resolving disagreements over specific line-items, such as environmental programs and border security, while also settling perennial battles over policies related to divisive issues such as abortion and Internal Revenue Service activities.
""With these basic things, a bipartisan deal should be achievable,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday upheld a rule that allows national banks to sell loans without adhering to state interest rate caps, rejecting three states' claims that the rule invites abuse.
Judge Jeffrey White in San Francisco found that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) did not act arbitrarily in approving the rule, which states that when a bank lends at a valid interest rate, the rate remains valid when the loan is sold to a nonbank.
Under federal law, national banks can charge the interest rates allowed by their home states, regardless of where the borrower lives.
California, New York and Illinois sued the OCC in 2020, arguing the rule allowed banks to improperly extend that policy to non-bank financial companies in an end-run around state regulation of consumer finance.
""We are disappointed with today's ruling, but remain committed to doing all we can to protect vulnerable California borrowers from predatory lenders and others who would seek to take advantage of them,"" a spokesperson for the California attorney general's office said in an email.

Banking trade groups had argued that undoing the rule would threaten secondary debt markets that allow billions of dollars to flow from lenders to U.S. borrowers every year.
The judge rejected the states' claims that the regulator had failed to consider whether the rule would lead to ""rent-a-bank"" schemes, in which third-party lenders seek to evade interest rate caps by having national banks originate loans they then purchase.

362,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 05:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda faces a growing challenge to convince investors that a policy pivot isn’t on the horizon following a wave of hawkish turns by global central bankers.
Kuroda continues to insist that the BOJ’s yield control framework is firmly bolted down without any tinkering under consideration given continued weakness in Japanese price growth. But he may need to take action as early as Wednesday to shore up that stance.
The rising tide of worldwide yields has reached Japan, pushing 5-year and 10-year rates to the highest levels since 2016. The moves suggest that sooner or later the central bank will have to back up its message with actions instead of words. 
“At this point, the market needs to see the BOJ affirming its easing commitment through actual steps,” said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. “Speculation over possible policy adjustments will only ease once the BOJ jumps in to stop yield rises.”
Kuroda remains the last staunch dove at the world’s biggest central banks outside of China, after European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde last week swiveled in the direction of tightening policy and Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe sketched out an interest-rate-hike scenario this year as inflation strengthens.
But Kuroda is already in his last full year at the helm of the BOJ, and investors are looking beyond his stimulus-focused stance to a future track toward possible policy normalization. 
To some degree the BOJ has been here before. In 2018, speculation of policy adjustments rocketed during a previous Federal Reserve tightening cycle. The BOJ defended its yield target range at that time right up to an announcement of adjustments, an about-turn that continues to feed ongoing chatter now.
Higher foreign ownership of Japanese bonds this time around means that more of a tussle could lie ahead as the BOJ looks to keep markets in line.
The yield on the 10-year JGB reached 0.21% on Tuesday, its highest since January 2016 and within sight of the BOJ’s ceiling of around 0.25% above its zero target. 
“I think the BOJ will refrain from taking any action until the 10-year yield reaches 0.25%,” said Ayako Sera, a market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. She thinks moving too soon risks overplaying the bank’s dovish position and causing an unpopular weakening of the yen.
The next watchpoint for observers of the standoff between bond traders and the BOJ comes Wednesday morning with a scheduled bond-buying operation. According to the central bank’s quarterly purchase schedule, it should swoop into the market for 425 billion yen ($3.7 billion) of JGBs in the five to 10-year range.
If the BOJ buys more it will be the first concrete action to stem the latest wave of yield gains. Like Sera, though, most analysts expect the central bank to resist the temptation to act until it becomes absolutely necessary.
“It’s more difficult for the BOJ now than in the past to prevent Japanese yields from following rising overseas yields due to foreigners’ increased holdings of yen assets and the higher correlation between local and overseas markets as a result,” said Takahiro Sekido, chief Japan strategist at MUFG Bank Ltd. in Tokyo.
Should markets continue to test the BOJ’s resolve, the bank may go straight to its heavy weaponry in the form of a fixed-rate operation that more clearly marks out its line in the sand. It could later offer a rate below the current market yield, essentially offering a payout for any bond holder who wants to grab it. 
While costly for the BOJ, that’s a hugely potent weapon that has worked so far to bring speculators to heel.
At the verbal level, Kuroda already appears to have pulled out all the stops.
The bullish message that 2% price growth is looming marked the first years of Kuroda’s leadership at the BOJ. But that signaling has long since turned 180 degrees as the governor now touts distant inflation as a justification for continuing with the BOJ’s stimulus program.
He ruled out the chance of looming policy normalization at a press conference in January after the bank forecast price growth of little more than half its 2% target in the years through early 2024.   
He even denied the possibility of raising interest rates before stable inflation was attained, going beyond a BOJ policy statement commitment just to increase the monetary base until then. Some of his colleagues on the board have also weighed in.
“The BOJ board members’ clear denial of a possible rate hike has had a strong effect,” Chotaro Morita, chief rates strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., wrote in a note. 
“There’s a strong belief in the market that the BOJ won’t abandon its 0.25% ceiling without making a formal decision first,” he added, contrasting the BOJ’s stance with the RBA’s abandoning of yield curve control last year.
Still, it’s getting harder for Kuroda to be persuasive on the BOJ’s future policy direction. 
“It’s still vivid among investors that Kuroda introduced negative rates a few days after he clearly denied it,” said Hiroshi Shiraishi, a senior economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA, referring to an unpopular surprise the governor pulled in 2016. 
“Investors also know it’s hard to flag a shift in the yield curve control well in advance,” Shiraishi said. “Because if you did, it would cause sharp volatility in the market.”

""We expect the shortage of semiconductors to stabilize throughout the year and towards the second semester they may return to levels that we had prior to the pandemic,"" AMIA head Fausto Cuevas said in a press conference.
Official data last week showed that Mexico's auto production and exports fell in January from a year earlier, the seventh straight monthly decline, as COVID-19 pandemic shocks and the semiconductor shortage has hurt the sector.
A return to more normal supplies of semiconductors would allow Mexican carmakers to increase use of installed capacity.
""It seems to me that every time there's enough supply (of semiconductors), carmakers recover their previous capacity levels as soon as possible,"" Cuevas added.

Vehicle production fell 2% in 2021 compared with 2020, the fourth consecutive annual decline, as the semiconductor shortage in recent months prompted automakers in Mexico and the rest of North America to implement rolling shutdowns, curtailing output.
AMIA has previously estimated output will not return to pre-pandemic levels until late 2023 or in 2024.

365,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 01:17PM ET</span>","PARIS (Reuters) -A $600 million contractual and safety dispute between Airbus and Qatar Airways deepened on Tuesday when the European planemaker revoked orders for two A350-1000 jets, days after ripping up an order from the Gulf carrier for 50 A321neos.
Qatar Airways has sued Airbus for more than $600 million and is refusing to take delivery of further A350s until its regulator receives a formal analysis of erosion to the painted surface and underlying lightning protection on 21 of the jets.
Airbus, which has two completed A350s ready for delivery to Qatar Airways, has said it has provided the necessary information on the problem of surface degradation and that the damage does not amount to a safety issue.
The planemaker said in a UK court filing last month that it was declaring Qatar Airways in default on two A350 jets that were completed and ready to be delivered.
It also took the unusual step of cancelling an order for 50 A321neo jets on the grounds that the alleged default on the larger planes had triggered a clause allowing it to revoke the order for A321neos, which are in high demand.
Qatar Airways last week ordered 25 competing Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, plus options for another 25, as well as 34 new 777X freighters during a visit by the Gulf state's ruling emir to Washington.
The airline has denied in legal arguments that it has broken its contract by refusing to take two A350s waiting on the tarmac in Toulouse. It also says Airbus is not entitled to claim a ""cross-default"" allowing it to cancel the A321neo deal.
An Airbus spokesman said on Tuesday the company had ""terminated delivery positions for two A350s for Qatar Airways in full compliance with our rights"". 
Qatar Airways had no immediate comment.

Airbus included the cancellations for 50 A321neos and two A350-1000s in a monthly summary for January, pushing it into negative territory with a net total of minus 16 orders for the first month of the year, after receiving 36 new orders.
The planemaker delivered 30 airplanes in January.

Investing.com -- It was inevitable really.
The realities of the post-pandemic surge in inflation worldwide finally overwhelmed the European Central Bank last week, forcing it to acknowledge – if still only implicitly - that it will have to tighten policy earlier than it thought.
Eurozone government bond yields have leaped in the wake of President Christine Lagarde’s press conference last Thursday, and short-term interest rate futures now assume that the ECB’s discount rate, which has been stuck at -0.5% since 2019 and has been below zero since 2013, will rise by some 40 basis points by the end of the year.  
Eurozone bank shares, depressed for years by the ECB’s negative rates policy, have taken flight, accordingly. The Stoxx 600 Banks index is up 13% so far this year, while the shares of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and its smaller rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) are up over 30% at their highest since 2018.
Seldom can markets have moved so much on the basis of what was not said, rather than what was said. Markets reacted to how Lagarde declined an invitation to repeat comments that she had made in December, namely, that an interest rate hike was “very unlikely” this year.
Instead came the rather lapidary comment that: “The situation has indeed changed.” And to make sure nobody missed the shift, Lagarde talked up the importance of the bank’s next meeting in March, when it will update its economic forecasts for the next two years.
The ECB always like to synchronize major policy shifts with its forecast updates. The ones due in March will likely show inflation staying above the bank’s medium-term target of 2% for all of this year and possibly next year too. That will give the ECB all the justification it needs to tighten monetary policy.
As with the Federal Reserve, the ECB sees it as necessary to stop its bond purchases first, before raising interest rates. The ECB has been buying around 80 billion euros a month of bonds through the pandemic. That was due to taper down to 40 billion a month from April, 30 billion from June and reach an open-ended commitment of 20 billion in September. But if, as the hawkish Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot said at the weekend, the first hike should come in October, asset purchases will have to stop entirely by then. Small wonder that bond markets didn’t like the change in Lagarde’s tone. 
For many, the surprise will be that the ECB has waited so long to join what has been an almost global trend of central banks trying to stop inflation taking root. While emerging markets and then the Federal Reserve dialed down their pandemic-era stimulus settings already over the last year, the ECB has resolutely resisted the trend, haunted by the memory of its premature rate hikes after the Great Financial Crisis a decade ago. Those mistakes triggered a devastating crisis of confidence in the viability of the euro and, for some members of the currency union, a lost decade of economic growth.
In fairness, the ECB has some strong arguments against blindly following the herd of central banks rushing to tighten. The euro area is an economy large enough to generate its own dynamics; labor shedding at the outset of the pandemic was not as dramatic in the Eurozone as it was in the U.S., so although there are pockets of tightness today and the official jobless rate is at a euro-era low of 7.0%, the Eurozone labor market is nowhere near as tight as the U.S. one. Wages have – so far – shown little sign of workers trying to claw back what they have lost to inflation.
Most importantly, most of the record 5.1% annual inflation registered over the last 12 months has been due to energy prices, over which the ECB has no power, and which can come down just as sharply as they go up.
There is, however, reason to believe that this time is different. It is not oil prices that are behind the current spike so much as natural gas prices. The standoff with Russia over Nord Stream 2 has already lasted longer than many expected, and wholesale gas and energy prices have settled into ranges well above their historical averages.
So far, the response of governments across Europe has been to announce subsidies for household fuel bills, on the assumption that this spike will pass like others before it and the subsidies – like so many before them – can be phased out in better times. That may yet be, but in the near term, the billions mobilized by the EU’s ‘Next Generation’ program, are going to be spent on fiscally unsustainable subsidies for environmentally unsustainable fuel consumption. If that isn’t enough to turn the self-consciously green ECB hawkish, it’s hard to see what will."
367,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 12:31PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday urged Americans to file their 2021 tax returns in order to collect thousands of dollars in child and earned income tax credits that were still available.
Yellen told non-profit groups and community organizations that most families had only received half their child tax credits, or even less, and workers were only starting to see the expanded earned income tax credit, as they filed their taxes.
Those programs had already helped lower poverty, reduced food instability and cut stress for many families, but more gains were possible if Americans got the credits, Yellen said at a ""day of action"" hosted by the White House. 
The Internal Revenue Service began sending out monthly child tax credit payments in July, reaching the families of 61 million children between July and December 2021, but families must file a tax return to receive the second half of the money.
But many families did not receive an advance payment because their child was only born last year, or they had not filed taxes before, or they are residents of Puerto Rico, Yellen said.
""In many cases, we're talking about families who are still entitled to $3,000 to $3,600, depending on the age of their child,"" Yellen said, adding that the only way those people could receive the money was to file their taxes.
The Biden administration's COVID-19 rescue plan expanded the existing U.S. child tax credit from $2,000 per child to $3,600 for children under the age of 6 and $3,000 for children aged 6 to 17.

It also nearly tripled the earned income tax credit for workers without dependent children, raising it to $1,500 from around $540 for 17 million workers without dependent children, making it available for previously ineligible younger workers aged 19-24, and older workers over 65.
The White House said events were planned by dozens of organizations in all 50 states and Puerto Rico to encourage Americans to file taxes and get the credits. More information is available at http://www.childtaxcredit.gov

Investors have rushed to cash in on the infrastructure boom as real estate firms have benefited from record-low interest rates since the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The uptick in demand with economic recovery gaining steam is boosting profits.
Discussions regarding the Global Infrastructure Partners V fund are in the early stages and the infrastructure fund manager hasn't made final decisions on its size, as per the report.
GIP did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.
Founded in 2006 and led by Adebayo Ogunlesi, GIP manages roughly $77 billion in assets. It raised $22 billion for its last flagship fund, Global Infrastructure Partners IV, in 2019.

The amount has doubled compared to 2020 to equal ""2.7% of Greece's GDP (gross domestic product),"" the Vice-President of EIB Christian Kettel Thomsen told a virtual ceremony alongside senior Greek finance ministry officials in Athens.
EIB offered 2.7 billion euros in guarantees, through European Guarantee Fund, to help companies affected by the coronavirus-related lockdowns secure loans from the country's four largest lenders Alpha Bank, Eurobank, National Bank and Piraeus Bank.
Those guarantees will mobilize more than 6 billion euros in investments in tourism, green energy and digital economy, Greek Finance Minister Christos Staikouras said.
EIB is also planning to manage 5 billion euros of funds that Greece is due to receive from the European Union's pandemic recovery fund in coming years.
Athens is due to get 19.4 billion euros in grants and 12.7 billion euros in cheap loans from the fund in coming years, an equivalent of about 16% of its gross domestic product.

Its conservative government plans to use the funds to make Greece's economy greener and push its digital transformation.

LONDON (Reuters) - The surprise split vote behind the Bank of England's interest rate hike last week, which was too small for almost half its officials, threatens to obscure the British central bank's intentions and potentially hurt the economy.
Some BoE watchers say emerging evidence of division among policymakers over how to respond to inflation could sow confusion about its reaction function - the way investors and the public can expect a central bank to respond to economic developments. 
The BoE has already been accused of mixed messaging after wrong-footing investors who expected a rate hike in November, then raising borrowing costs in December. 
""The on-and-off-again November interest rate hike was only a microcosm of that,"" said economists Robert Wood and Kamal Sharma from BofA Global Research. 
""What we see as changes to reaction function leave us more concerned about the current inflation episode."" 
With the BoE warning that inflation could soon surpass 7% - almost four times its target - four of the nine Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members voted on Feb. 2 to raise Bank Rate to 0.75%.
That would have represented the biggest one-off increase in borrowing costs since the BoE became operationally independent 25 years ago.
In the end, a slim majority of five, including Governor Andrew Bailey, voted for a 0.25 percentage point increase to 0.5% - still historically very low. 
While the MPC agreed that further modest tightening of monetary policy was likely in the coming months, the difference between the two camps was about more than a few basis points. 
Minutes from their meeting showed they had different approaches to bringing inflation back towards the BoE's 2% target.
Policymakers backing a 25 basis point increase worried that a bigger rise might provoke an ""outsized"" shift in Bank Rate expectations among investors, which already looked steep enough to push inflation well below target in three years' time.
From this group, Chief Economist Huw Pill said on Friday he was keen to avoid the impression the BoE was going ""foot to the floor"" in a rapid and steep cycle of policy tightening that risked hurting the economy unnecessarily.
The minority of four MPC members who wanted a bigger rate hike thought the BoE should aim to jolt expectations about higher inflation and cut out the risk that price pressures get embedded in pay deals and expectations for future inflation.
The BoE could probably squash inflation by raising Bank Rate a couple more times to 1% in May and running down its nearly 900 billion pound ($1.2 trillion) bond-buying programme, alongside ""consistent, forceful communication"", Wood and Sharma said. 
But they warned that any lack of a clear message risked creating an economic downturn that could possibly have been avoided.
While the U.S. Federal Reserve looks set to raise rates in March, there seems less chance of similar differences emerging among its officials about how to tighten policy.
Even St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, a strident supporter of early and fast policy tightening, told Reuters last week it was not clear what starting off with a bigger, 50 basis point, hike would accomplish.
NO CLEAR MESSAGE?
While the BoE has sometimes faced accusations of groupthink during normal times, in past periods of economic upheaval its policymakers mostly stuck to the same script, helping businesses and households to plan ahead, Wood and Sharma noted.
Its current approach differs from the forward guidance policy of former governor Mark Carney, who tried to issue clear statements about the reaction function - although he too faced criticism that this made the BoE a hostage to fortune.
Most BoE officials did not speak publicly before last week's rates announcement and after the communication missteps of last year Bailey said he could imagine going back to the days of no guidance.
But some economists warn that without a consistent message at a critical juncture for expectations about the economic and policy outlook, the BoE risks losing control of the narrative, with real world consequences.
The market reaction to Thursday's decision may have been a taster of that scenario.
Investors ratcheted up their bets for future interest rate hikes, despite the signal from the BoE's inflation forecasts that it thought the market view of the rates outlook was already aggressive.
If the market goes too far in pricing rate hikes, and for too long, it would tighten financial conditions and hurt the ability of businesses and households to access finance.

""We think markets are currently pricing in too many hikes; something that could persist until the BoE clarifies its approach,"" said Vivek Paul, UK chief investment strategist at the BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute.
""The MPC will need to communicate clearly what its motivation is, in our view, to avoid over-tightening financial conditions and hurting the real economy.""

Investing.com -- Bond markets remain under pressure ahead of a test of strength in the shape of three big Treasury auctions this week. The first of those takes place later Tuesday. Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON)'s CEO John Foley steps down and says the company is open to anything that will repair the 80% drop in its stock price.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) reports earnings with the end of the pandemic seemingly coming over the horizon, while jaw-jaw in Moscow and Washington seems to have made some progress in stopping war-war in Ukraine. Oil prices retreated from overbought level as tension was ratcheted down a notch. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 8th February.
1. Bonds yields push higher ahead of Treasury auctions
U.S. bond yields pushed higher ahead of a series of auctions that will show whether the market thinks it has now priced in all the monetary tightening that it needs to.
A three-year note auction by the Treasury later will be followed by sales of 10-year notes on Wednesday and 30-year bonds on Thursday, with all three maturities currently trading at or near their highest in over two years.
In Europe, however, the market has consolidated after ECB President Christine Lagarde told the European Parliament that any tightening of its policy would be ‘gradual’ and ‘data-dependent’.
The data calendar holds few terrors for either market Thursday, with U.S. trade figures for January due at 8:30 AM ET and surveys from the NFIB and Redbook Research also out. In Europe, the Polish Central Bank is expected to raise its key rate again, by 50 basis points to 2.75%.
2. Peloton switches CEO, announces big job cuts 
Peloton stock fell in premarket after the company said its CEO John Foley will step down and be replaced by former Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) executive Barry McCarthy.
The maker of connected fitness machines has seen its stock drop by more than 80% from its peak as pandemic-driven behaviors have started to revert back to normal.
The company also said it will cut 2,800 jobs – around 20% of total corporate headcount – and announced the appointment of other new directors. It gave no detail on rumors about possible bid interest from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), but Foley - who together with other company insiders still controls around 80% of Peloton’s voting stock – told The Wall Street Journal that “we are open to exploring any opportunity that could create value for Peloton shareholders.” Peloton reports its quarterly earnings after the closing bell later.
3. Stocks set to open mixed; Pfizer earnings due; Chip deal finally scrapped 
U.S. stock markets are set to open flat later, with little appetite for big new moves ahead of the Treasury auctions and, even more importantly, the January consumer inflation data due on Thursday.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 11 points, less than 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures and NASDAQ 100 futures were down by less than 0.15.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), which slid another 5% on Monday as long-time backer Peter Thiel prepared to resign from its board, reportedly in order to focus on helping Republican candidates at the mid-term elections in November.
Also in focus will be Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which finally took the long-awaited step of cancelling its planned purchase of chip designer ARM from Softbank (OTC:SFTBY), paying the Japanese company $1.25 billion for its pains.
Pfizer leads the day’s earnings roster, along with Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG)  and DuPont (NYSE:DD). Videogames publisher Take Two Interactive, meanwhile, is indicated lower after giving a disappointing outlook late on Monday. 
4. Signs of detente in Russia-Ukraine crisis help European energy prices
European gas prices continued to ease gradually and the Russian rouble rose to its highest in four weeks amid further signs that diplomacy will prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin hinted that lengthy talks with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron had made tentative progress, saying that some of Macron’s proposals ""could form the basis of further joint steps."" French officials quoted by the BBC said that Russia had made a commitment not to take any new military initiatives, in order to allow a de-escalation. However, the Kremlin disputed that interpretation.
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday that the U.S. will close down the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline if Russia invades. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, standing next to Biden, couldn’t bring himself to mention the controversial project but said Germany would side with the U.S. in such a case.
Other stresses on Europe’s energy supplies remain, however: French power giant Electricite de France, which has already revised down its output forecast for this year, was forced to halt output at three further nuclear reactors due to unscheduled maintenance, AFP reported.
5. Oil corrects after bull run; API, STEO eyed
Crude oil prices slipped below $90 a barrel as signs of a de-escalation in the Russia-Ukraine situation increased. By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 1.8% at $89.67 a barrel, while Brent crude futures kept their $90 handle at $90.81, despite a 2% drop.
The American Petroleum Institute will report its weekly inventory data at 4:30 PM ET as usual, while the U.S. will also publish its regular Short-Term Energy Outlook.
Meanwhile in Vienna, talks on lifting the U.S. sanctions on Iran in return for better behavior on its nuclear program have made little progress."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France, facing a presidential election in weeks, has halted moves to clear an EU trade deal with Mexico which would allow in 20,000 tonnes of beef imports and wants to make it tougher to access the bloc's markets, diplomats say.
The European Union's second largest economy runs a consistent overall trade surplus with non-EU countries and its companies benefit from the lower tariffs of trade deals, but farmer sensitivity to beef imports in particular makes trade politically explosive.
A new trade pact might spark farm protests or fuel anti-globalisation rhetoric from far-right opponents, hampering President Emmanuel Macron's expected re-election bid in April and legislative elections in June.
Interbev, France's meat federation, has urged Macron to oppose the deal and block ongoing negotiations that could lead to further ""ultra-competitive"" meat imports from the likes of Australia, New Zealand or the Mercosur bloc, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. 
Conveniently, France holds the rotating presidency of the bloc for the first half of the year, giving it the chance to steer EU policy.
One trade agreement that would normally have been put to EU governments for approval is the update of an existing deal with Mexico, signed in 2020, which would allow in 20,000 tonnes of beef imports.
Trade talks were indeed suspended with Australia after French fury over a cancelled submarine contract. France also put on hold the conclusion of negotiations to modernise its trade deal with Chile, according to EU diplomats and officials.
""The (EU) Commission has accepted, due to the importance of the election and the sensitivities around trade and globalisation, that nothing will get through. It's frustrating. We can complain, but this is how it is,"" said one EU diplomat.
A French government spokesperson said it was not France holding up trade deals.
Trade Minister Franck Riester points to Chile having a new president, who only begins in March and whose administration will need to work with the Commission to finalise a deal. The Mexican agreement is in the hands of the Commission, he said.
A PAUSE OR A DAMAGING DELAY?
Paris is not without allies. Some EU countries, with sizeable farm sectors to protect, are quietly backing Paris. Many EU lawmakers also favour greater reciprocity and trade based more on European values.
""There's more than just French fingerprints on this trade paralysis,"" said a senior EU diplomat.
Some diplomats and trade experts believe this is just a pause given the next holders of the EU's rotating presidency are the more free trade-minded Czech Republic and Sweden.
Others say it undermines the bloc's credibility among trade partners, who spend years negotiating deals with the Commission, only to find it taking years more for it to be sold to EU lawmakers and governments.
There is also a matter of timing, in terms of the leaders, domestic politics and the electoral cycle. 
""The question is whether the stars are aligned. For the EU deals with Japan and Vietnam they were aligned, but it may not have happened again,"" said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of trade think tank ECIPE.
TRADE DEFENCE
By contrast, France is enthusiastic on more protective trade measures.
It wants agreement by early March on legislation designed to limit foreign bidders for EU public procurement contracts if their own countries do not reciprocate.
It is also keeping a keen eye on a review of conditions for striking a free trade agreement with Europe.
The latter centres on environmental and labour standards that the bloc insists its free trade partner must uphold. France though has raised eyebrows with its talk of a need for ""mirror clauses"".
Riester says such clauses already exist in bans on growth hormones in meat or plans to limit trade in products linked to deforestation. Other EU members are concerned they could go much further, deterring would-be partners that would need to mirror EU working practices with no EU commitment to mirror theirs.

Bernd Lange, the influential head of the European Parliament's trade committee, said the EU was learning, along with other economies, that trade policy needed to take workers and the environment more into account.
""The old-fashioned theory of trade based on Ricardo and Smith, that you just withdraw trade restrictions and growth will come, benefiting everybody, is quite wrong,"" he said.

374,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 05:26AM ET</span>",,,,,,"PARIS (Reuters) -France posted a record trade deficit last year as imports surged on higher energy prices and Airbus exports fell, official data showed on Tuesday, casting a rare cloud over President Emmanuel Macron's economic record.
The trade deficit in goods hit 84.7 billion euros ($97 billion) in 2021, equivalent to 3.4% of economic output, as the energy import bill swelled to 43.1 billion euros, the trade ministry said.
In December alone, the trade gap reached more than 11 billion euros in the biggest monthly shortfall between exports and imports since French customs records began in 1970.
Nearly two months from a presidential election in which Macron is widely expected to seek a second term, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the deficit marked a ""blemish"" on Macron's presidency which has otherwise been particularly strong on the economy.
Growth hit a 52-year high last year of 7% as that the European Union's second-biggest economy recovered faster than expected from the coronavirus crisis. 
However, the record economic activity also fuelled demand for imports while exports were hit by a slump in new aircraft shipments, although Trade Minister Franck Riester said on Tuesday that they should rebound in coming years judging by full order books.
Le Maire said that ultimately France needed the re-election of Macron in April to complete efforts to restore exporters competitiveness. 
Macron, a former investment banker and economy minister, has cut various taxes paid by companies and eased France's traditionally strict hiring and firing rules.
""There is no other solution to improve France's external trade balance than to massively and quickly re-industrialise,"" Le Maire said on France Inter radio.
While the trade deficit grew to record levels, France's services surplus more than doubled to 36.2 billion euros last year despite still weak revenues from tourism. As the world's top tourism destination, the sector was traditionally a reliable source of income prior to the pandemic.

With French ports picking up business from congested rivals elsewhere in Europe, transports services swung massively into a surplus for the first time since 2004, trade ministry data showed.

""Gradual"", ""data-dependent"" - those were the words ECB President Christine Lagarde used to soften the hawkishness of her message last week. But after three days of violent repricing on euro debt markets, there is likely more to come.
Borrowing costs for Europe's southern flank have risen sharply, with investors now demanding a yield premium of 160 basis points to hold 10-year Italian bonds relative to safer German equivalents. That's 30 bps more than before last Thursday's ECB meeting. 
European corporate debt may be due a correction too; Citi reckons top-quality credit spreads could widen to 90 bps from 70 bps at the end of 2021.
The recent moves are raising the risk of fragmentation along national lines of debt markets and the derailment of southern European economic recovery, especially given the post-COVID rise in spending deficits. The question now is: How far can the selloff go before policymakers offer reassurance - in other words, the ECB 'put', along the lines of the backstop the U.S. Fed is typically seen to provide equity markets?
The answer? It might still have some time to run. Yields, while rising, are low in absolute terms and Europe still has the safety net of the EU recovery fund. Lagarde promised ""the ECB is ""obviously going to respond"" if sovereign spreads widen a lot. But as yields resume their climb on Tuesday, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts note ""the market may be willing to test this commitment"".
Elsewhere, Softbank (OTC:SFTBY)'s deal to sell chip designer Arm in a $60 billion deal has collapsed Facing regulatory roadblocks, SoftBank drops sale of Arm to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), will seek IPO amid regulatory hurdles.

TOKYO (Reuters) - When Japan handed Tokyo bus driver Keiki Nambu and his wife, Takako, $870 for each of their nine children, they spent it exactly as the government had feared: paying down a mortgage instead of going shopping.
That kind of financial prudence has helped Japanese households amass a staggering $17 trillion in assets over the years, with more than half of that parked in savings. But it also represents a headache for policymakers, who struggle to kick-start consumption and boost a moribund economy.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government has paid nearly $17 billion in cash stimulus to families. But unlike U.S. stimulus that lifted consumer spending, the impact is seen as limited in Japan, where households are more likely to save the money or repay debt like the Nambus.
It highlights a consistent problem in the world's No. 3 economy, where public debt is already more than twice the size of the gross domestic product (GDP).
""If dad's salary remains the same but prices keep going up, all we can do is ask him to do his best and work as much as he can,"" said 39-year-old Takako.
Her husband makes about $44,000 a year, including the discretionary ""bonus"" paid twice yearly by Japanese companies but cut when times are lean, as happened during the pandemic. In the end, the stimulus money is just helping to make up for that shortfall, Keiki said.
The Nambus' children range in age from less than a year to 17. Kids only get water and milk to drink, although the family consumes about five litres of milk a day. Keiki makes sure the kids take quick showers to keep the water bill down.
In terms of size, the Nambus are hardly typical - the average Japanese household has shrunk https://tmsnrt.rs/3Go0HeD to 2.21 people as of late 2020 from 2.82 in 1995, according to census data. Tokyo's average was even smaller, at 1.92.
Their frugality is common, however.
BIG SAVERS
Private consumption accounts for more than half of Japan's GDP.
But households may be spending just 10% of the stimulus cash and saving the rest, said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. Economic insecurity keeps consumption flat, Miyamae added, and a recent surge in Omicron infections has also made people hesitant to spend.
Another economist, Hideo Kumano of Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, reckons that about 75% of the handouts will end up as savings, although he cautions that number could be higher if parents decide to set aside more for their children's education.
Concern that the money would end up in savings prompted some municipalities to pay half of the stimulus as vouchers. Tokyo wasn't one of them. 
Separate cash payments to all residents of Japan earlier in the pandemic saw about 27% of the money spent, according to a July 2020 survey by Mitsubishi Research Institute. 
The Nambus received around $8,700 in total from this round of stimulus - 100,000 yen ($870) yen per child and another one-off payment from the government.
They initially flirted with the idea of an overnight family trip to a hotel run by their city ward. In the end, frugality won out, although they did spend about $210 on sushi and ice cream.
They will also use some of the money to buy a school bag and gym clothes for Keifu, 6, who is starting primary school in April.

The hand-me-down gym clothes were too threadbare after being worn by six of his older siblings.

LONDON (Reuters) - Governments and utilities need ambitious plans to cut red tape to install vehicle chargers if Europe is to be ready for 130 million electric vehicles (EVs) by 2035, a new report from EY and Eurelectric said on Tuesday.
According to ""Power sector accelerating e-mobility,"" by the professional services group and Europe's utilities trade body, Europe will need 65 million EV chargers - 9 million public and 56 million residential - to handle the huge growth anticipated in EVs from the 3.3 million on Europe's roads today.
One in 11 new cars sold in the European Union in 2021 was fully electric, a jump of 63% versus 2020.
Europe currently has 374,000 public chargers, two thirds of which are concentrated in just five countries - the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom - while some European countries do not have a single charger per 100 km (62 miles) of road, and this ""polarisation between economies risks destabilising"" electrification. 
To keep up with demand, Europe needs half a million public chargers annually through to 2030 and one million a year after that, EY global energy and resources leader Serge Colle told Reuters. 
But building out public charging infrastructure today ""faces massive delays,"" because of planning and permitting issues, said Eurelectric secretary general Kristian Ruby. 
""We're sending a wake-up call to politicians at all levels that ambition requires permission,"" Ruby said. ""If we want to pursue this (charging infrastructure) ambition then we need permission to run.""

Rising EV sales will push up European electricity demand 11% annually, the report says. 
To mitigate the risk to local grids, the report recommends supporting smart charging solutions - such as offering tariffs to EV owners to charge during off-peak overnight houses - which could lower spikes in peak power demand by 21%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Monday released a highly anticipated report from its labor task force that highlights low union participation in the U.S. government, and includes nearly 70 recommendations on how the government can help workers join labor unions and bargain collectively. 
More than 300,000 employees in the federal government, the country's largest employer, are eligible to join a union but have not, the report said. 
The government will offer unions seeking to build membership greater access to federal employees, the reports says, and push agencies such as the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Labor Relations Authority to coordinate on worker organizing.
The 43-page report also asks the Labor Department to ensure that workers who face retaliation when engaged in organizing receive full protection. And it aims to prevent the misclassification of workers as independent contractors - part of a long-running battle for the Labor Department with companies that rely on so-called ""gig economy"" workers. 
President Joe Biden established the task force in April with the goal of reversing a decades-long decline in union membership. He appointed Vice President Kamala Harris as the chair of the task force and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh as vice chair of the group, which also includes over 20 heads of agencies and Cabinet officials.
Union support was important to Biden's victory in several Rust Belt states in the Midwest and Northeast in 2020, and those voters' choices in 2022 will play a key role in the midterm congressional and gubernatorial elections.
Only 10.3% of the U.S. workforce was represented by a union in 2021, down from more than 30% in the 1950s, the White House says. The numbers are even lower for private-sector employees, where union membership has fallen to 6.1% in 2021 from 16.8% in 1983.
""This report is going to do some good things for workers in America,"" Labor Secretary Walsh told Reuters in an interview.
Harris and Walsh, who held more than two dozen meetings with stakeholders around the country, met with Biden on Friday to discuss the report, a source with knowledge of the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
During the meeting, Walsh said, Biden and Harris were focused on ""what's the follow-up going to be, so it's not just the paper documents."" They discussed ""coming up with a system"" that helps report progress, he said.
The task force will submit a second report in six months, which will describe progress in implementation, he said.
Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the country's largest labor federation, comprising 57 affiliated unions and 12.5 million workers, told Reuters the U.S. labor movement will ""be the eyes and ears on the ground,"" making sure the report gets implemented.
""I think this could be a game changer, to have the power of the federal government examining itself and how its practices can be utilized to advance worker organizing,"" she said.
Biden's administration may be the most overtly pro-labor since Harry Truman left the Oval Office nearly 70 years ago, labor leaders and outside analysts have said, citing actions that have put unions ""at the center of policy. 
Biden has rarely missed a chance to highlight his interest in bolstering the U.S. labor movement, including through a slew of provisions in his legislative initiatives. 
The White House report does not state how much union membership has risen since Biden took office a little over a year ago but says the pandemic has boosted union approval. Sixty-eight percent of Americans currently approve of labor unions — the highest level since 1965. 

Unions have lobbied for passage of the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, which would prohibit employers from holding mandatory anti-union meetings and impose financial penalties for violating workers' labor rights. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the measure in March and Biden supports the legislation, but it faces long odds in the Senate. 
""It is important to acknowledge that the task force recommendations do not and cannot take the place of the robust legislative change that is needed to fix our labor laws,"" the report said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan's long-term interest rates rise, investors are wondering at what point the central bank will step in to defend its 0% target for the 10-year yield as part of an ultra-easy monetary policy.
Prospects of accelerated U.S. policy tightening have pushed the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields to six-year highs above 0.2%, close to the implicit 0.25% ceiling the BOJ sets around its 0% target.
Speculation the BOJ could change the target of its yield-curve-control to the five-year note from the 10-year has also pushed the five-year JGB yield to a six-year high and above zero.
Analysts at J.P.Morgan say expectations of such a policy tweak have already made domestic banks and long-term investors reluctant to buy more JGBs, and some are even betting on this through short positions in bond futures.
HOW WORRIED IS THE BOJ ABOUT RECENT YIELD RISES?
Not much, at least for now. Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe said he saw no problem with recent rises as the 10-year yield was moving within the implicit 50-basis-point band set around the BOJ's target.
The rise in yields and trading activity, in fact, eases some concern among policymakers that the BOJ's huge presence in JGBs is crowding out private investors and draining market liquidity.
To breathe life back into the dormant JGB market, the BOJ clarified in a policy review in March last year that it will allow the 10-year JGB yield to move 25 basis points on either size of zero.
A natural rise in JGB yields, driven by prospects of higher U.S. interest rates, is therefore a welcome development for BOJ policymakers fretting about the side-effects of prolonged easing.
WHEN WOULD THE BOJ INTERVENE?
While the BOJ will allow the 10-year yield to move freely within its implicit band, its focus remains on keeping borrowing costs low to stimulate the economy.
In the March policy review last year, the BOJ concluded that any rise in borrowing costs won't hurt the economy much - as long as the 10-year yield stays below 0.25%.
The BOJ is thus likely to rein in any rise in the 10-year yield above 0.25%. And the central bank could intervene before that level, if it sees any rise as too rapid or driven by factors out of line with fundamentals.
WHAT TOOLS WOULD THE BOJ USE?
The most powerful weapon would be to offer buying an unlimited amount of 10-year JGBs at a set price. The BOJ can keep doing this for as long as necessary to keep yields under control.
But deploying this tool could be risky. It would force the BOJ to keep buying bonds aggressively, a move that could undermine its efforts to gradually unwind its asset holdings and allow market forces to drive bond prices more.
The BOJ could thus take a softer approach such as conducting unscheduled bond-buying operations, or increasing the amount of bonds it buys in scheduled market operations.
WOULD RISING YIELDS PROD THE BOJ TO TARGET SHORTER JGBS?
If global bond yields continue to rise, the BOJ may consider loosening its grip on long-term interest rates.

Shifting the zero target to a shorter duration than the current 10-year note could be among options. But such a move won't come any time soon, with the economic recovery still fragile and inflation distant from the BOJ's 2% target.
The hope among BOJ policymakers is for markets to steepen the yield curve and ease the strain on financial institutions hit by years of narrowing spreads.

381,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 09:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Reserve Bank of Australia could announce an interest-rate increase at any of its meetings from June onwards, given the timing of wage data and a pending election, economists at two of the nation’s major lenders said.
“Our call is that the first rate hike will come in September. But given the risk to wages that could come as early as June, every meeting from June is live,” said Felicity Emmett at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd. “It’s really more about the timing of the wages report.” 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s Gareth Aird echoed that view, adding another factor that could help shift the rate dial is that a federal election -- due by May -- will be out of the way. Aird’s official forecast is for an August hike. The pair spoke on a panel at an Australian Business Economists event.
The suggestion that the June policy meeting is “live” dovetails with market pricing for rate liftoff that month. It comes after RBA Governor Philip Lowe acknowledged last week that there is a “plausible scenario” for the cash rate to rise this year, in the event wages growth accelerates and ensures inflation is sustainably within the bank’s 2-3% target.
RBA’s Lowe Flags Rate Rise Possibility This Year for First Time
Underlying inflation is already within that range, fueled by rising costs caused by Covid-induced supply chain blockages that are expected to abate as virus cases subside.
Australia’s wage price index for the final three months of 2021 will be released Feb. 23 and  data for the first quarter is due out on May 18. In a quirk of timing, first-quarter gross domestic product -- which also contains labor cost figures -- will also be released before the RBA’s June meeting, giving the board extra information on the $1.5 trillion economy.
Those data points are all likely to point to price pressures in the economy climbing to a sustainable level that could prompt the RBA to turn hawkish, Emmett and Aird said. 
Former RBA board member John Edwards said he expects the RBA to raise rates four times in succession late in 2022, according to an interview with Dow Jones.
Concern about looming rate hikes have already rattled Australia’s highly indebted households, with ANZ’s weekly gauge of consumer confidence falling 1.9%. It also showed that views on “future financial conditions” had dropped 3.5% to a 15-1/2 month low.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank will raise rates faster than thought just a month ago as concerns mount about a weaker rupiah as the Federal Reserve gears up to increase its own interest rate next month amid soaring U.S. inflation, a Reuters poll showed.
But unlike many major economies, Indonesian inflation has largely remained benign, only inching up to 2.18% in January after spending most of the previous two years below Bank Indonesia's (BI) target range of 2%-4%.
All 26 economists polled Feb. 2-7 expected BI to hold its benchmark seven-day reverse repurchase rate at a record low of 3.50% at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Thursday.
Over one third of respondents, 8 of 20, expected a hike as soon as next quarter but medians in the latest poll predicted 50 basis points of tightening in July-September, compared to 25 basis point increases in the third and fourth quarter in a January poll.
""If inflation is picking up and the external pressure is stronger from previous expectations, they (BI) need to adjust their rates as well by 50 basis points in the third quarter,"" said Irman Faiz, an economist at Bank Danamon.
Although the median forecast was for no move in the final quarter, economists' predictions were on a knife edge.
Eight of 17 respondents saw BI's key interest rate at 4.25% or higher - two said 4.50%. Another six said 4.00%, two said 3.75% and one respondent said BI would keep it on hold all year at the current 3.50%.
But much will depend on how the Indonesian rupiah performs. The currency has been fairly stable this year, falling just 1% against a strengthening dollar. A Reuters poll taken six weeks ago showed the rupiah trading around current levels in 12-months.
Economists at ING noted the ""trigger points"" for BI shifting from an accommodative stance to one where it is focused on price pressure ""would be accelerating inflation coupled with depreciation pressure on the Indonesian rupiah linked to Fed tightening"".

Emerging market central bankers are keeping an eye on the Fed in case its tightening cycle leads to capital outflows.
Southeast Asia's largest economy expanded 5% in the final quarter of 2021, slightly stronger than a Reuters poll median. But a recent spike in COVID-19 infections may prompt policymakers to stay cautious for now.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Britain will join the United States and Australia in backing a European Union trade case against China at the World Trade Organization over Beijing's alleged trade curbs on Lithuania, a move the UK trade minister said would oppose ""coercive trading practices"".
The EU launched a challenge at the Geneva-based trade body last month, accusing China of discriminatory trade practices against Lithuania that it says threaten the integrity of the EU's single market.
""We will request to join the EU's WTO consultation into these measures as a third party to ensure we combat economic coercion in trade together,"" Anne-Marie Trevelyan said in a tweet.
The United States, Australia and Taiwan have already signalled they intend to join the consultations.
U.S. Trade Representative spokesman Adam Hodge said the Biden administration is ""deeply concerned"" by China's discriminatory trade practices against Lithuanian goods and EU goods with Lithuanian content.
""We will continue working with Lithuania, the EU, and like-minded allies and partners to push back on the PRC’s coercive economic and diplomatic behavior,"" Hodge said in a Jan. 27 statement. ""The United States will request to join these WTO consultations in solidarity with Lithuania and the European Union.""
Vilnius is under pressure from China, which claims democratically-ruled Taiwan as its own territory, to reverse a decision last year to allow the island to open a de facto embassy in the capital under its own name. 
China has downgraded diplomatic ties with the Baltic nation and pressured multinationals to sever ties with it.
The challenge at the WTO allows 60 days for the parties to confer in order to reach a settlement. If none is reached, the EU may choose to launch a formal dispute that would set up a WTO panel to study its claims against China.

A Geneva-based trade official said the participation of other Western countries, assuming they are not blocked by Beijing, would be ""helpful"" to the EU's case.
""If you have other members arguing on your behalf and putting forward arguments, I think the panel would look at that,"" he said.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Environmentalists and some European nations are set to clash with the United States over a possible comeback of supersonic travel, saying efforts to set noise guidelines by the middle of the decade could weaken efforts to fight climate change.
Nearly two decades after the last flight of Anglo-French Concorde, a panel of United Nations aviation experts is meeting from Monday and will consider updating a decades-old supersonic noise standard by 2025, according to meeting papers seen by Reuters.
The U.S.-backed push by aerospace companies is supported by U.S.-based Boom, which has vowed to launch a quieter and less polluting form of supersonic travel than the sleek but noisy Concorde, which ferried the rich and famous across the Atlantic.
Even though it co-developed the only commercial jet to break the sound barrier in the 1960s, France has teamed up with Norway and Sweden to try to delay procedural work on future supersonic jetliners to focus on emissions rules for subsonic flight.
All three countries have made climate action a political priority and want U.N. experts to focus on the source of the current industry emissions, people close to the International Civil Aviation Organization discussions said.
Montreal-based ICAO sets standards on everything from runway markings to crash investigations, which its 193 member states typically translate into regulatory requirements.
Planemakers need those standards ""well in advance"" to ensure they meet official expectations, said Dan Carnelly, vice-president at the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industries Associations, an international aerospace lobby.
""No manufacturer can take the risk that they invest billions of dollars to design and test a new product only for it to become obsolete due to a new regulation imposed soon after it enters into service,"" he said.
The very technical discussion is key for a niche market promising to create thousands of jobs. Boom plans a North Carolina plant and has orders from United Airlines. 
But critics say focusing on supersonics now would divert time and expertise that could be put toward reducing broader emissions from aviation, a priority this year for ICAO's full membership, including the United States.
""Supersonic aircraft are a huge distraction for ICAO,"" said Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a U.S.-based environmental research group. 
Aerospace companies warn that ignoring supersonics at this early stage could be a recipe for countries to go it alone.
""A patchwork of local, different regulations would be very difficult, if not impossible, to manage,"" Carnelly said.
ICAO declined comment while discussions at its Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection run from Feb. 7 to 18. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) declined comment.
Supersonics have struggled to meet the noise and emissions standards set for conventional planes.
Boom says its 'Overture' jet would meet noise levels that already apply to subsonic planes and run fully on sustainable aviation fuel when it starts flying passengers in 2029. 
Carnelly said guidelines specifying that noise limits should be the same for supersonics and subsonics are needed for technical reasons. 
""The best thing for the industry is to have clear, timely and global standards,"" a Boom spokesperson said. 

The company aims to start certification flight tests in 2026 ahead of commercial flights before the end of the decade.
Some analysts remain cautious over its schedule, which originally called for the plane to enter service in 2023.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday is expected to debate legislation funding federal government programs through March 11, and avoid a politically embarrassing partial government shutdown when existing funds expire on Feb. 18.
The move would give Democratic and Republican negotiators more time to work out funding for the remainder of the fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30, House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro said in a statement on Monday.
If approved by Congress, this would be the third such temporary funding measure since the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1.
House passage would send the bill to the Senate, which would attempt to approve it and send along to Democratic President Joe Biden for signing into law before the midnight Feb. 18 deadline. The effort will take bipartisan cooperation in the Senate, where at least 60 votes are needed to advance most legislation and Democrats control only 50 seats in the 100-member chamber. 
Democrats and Republicans have been at odds for months over spending priorities in a massive appropriations bill with a price tag that is expected to be around $1.5 trillion.
Congress is scrambling to carry out one of its most basic duties: funding regular government operations ranging from military programs to securing airports, enforcing environmental laws and helping state and local governments with law enforcement, housing and education programs.
But with their control of the White House and Congress, albeit by the narrowest of margins, Democrats will be fighting to advance many initiatives that are important to their supporters in this so-called ""omnibus"" spending bill, especially with focus now turning to the Nov. 8 congressional elections.
These include $200 million for programs to get to the root of gun violence, which is responsible for more than 110 deaths daily in the United States, according to Rukmani Bhatia, senior federal affairs manager at the Giffords anti-gun violence organization.
Republicans are objecting to Democrats' large increase in funding to battle climate change and have been blocking separate attempts to help ""Dreamers"": immigrants brought into the United States as children illegally by parents or others.

The spending bill would allow these people, many of whom have grown up in the United States, to be hired for federal jobs.
Meanwhile, negotiators have been focusing on setting a top-line spending number, as Republicans insist that military spending be on par with domestic programs and Democrats push for more money for education and environmental programs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Banks in Latin America and emerging Europe are most exposed to dollarization among developing economies, making them vulnerable to weaker local currencies and increasing withdrawals in the face of tighter U.S. monetary policy, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said on Monday.
Interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve are likely to slow capital flows to emerging markets, weakening countries' currencies and economic growth, and potentially triggering credit risk at highly dollarized banks, Moody's said. 
""Banks with large volumes of foreign-currency loans and deposits on their balance sheets are vulnerable to a spike in credit losses and pressure on their profitability and liquidity when the local currency drops sharply in value,"" Moody's analysts wrote.
""It becomes harder for unhedged borrowers to repay foreign-currency loans, and depositors are prone to withdraw funds. High dollarization also threatens financial stability in times of crisis if central banks have insufficient reserves of foreign currency to bail out banks with dollar shortfalls.""
Moody's found that dollar deposits are highest across banks in Latin America, emerging Europe and the former Soviet countries, though relatively low in Asia Pacific and moderate in Africa. Higher exposure in Gulf states is offset by strong foreign currency reserves.
Uruguay's steady depreciation of the local peso and high inflation have lifted the country to the top of Moody's list of dollarized countries at 74% of deposits - a trend that is there to stay. Savings from non-residents, mostly neighboring Argentina where inflation is expected to hit by year-end, will remain high at 10%.
Turkey, another developing economy that park deposits in hard-currencies has seen locals grapple with high inflation and a weakening currency, will see dollar deposits rise to 65% by end-2022, up from 47% in 2020 and 63% last year.
""Retail depositors continue to convert a material portion of their local-currency deposits into foreign currency (mainly U.S. dollars) to protect their savings from depreciation and inflation,"" Moody's said.
Foreign-currency deposits fell sharply in Argentina, from 40% in 2019 to 16% in 2021 due to an erosion in confidence after the 2019 elections.

""There is a chance of further outflows of dollar deposits if confidence in public policies or the central bank deteriorates further,"" Moody's said, noting the central bank had little to no foreign-currency reserves to support banks in a crisis. 
Trends of lower dollarization will continue in the short-term in Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Peru and Ukraine. But banks in Azerbaijan, Armenia and Belarus also have the highest exposure to unhedged borrowers, having no income in the foreign currency of the loan.

BEIRUT (Reuters) -Lebanon's banking association said on Monday it opposed proposals set out in a draft government plan reported by Reuters last week for tackling the financial crisis, saying they would cause a long loss of confidence in the financial sector.
Responding to written questions from Reuters, the Association of Banks in Lebanon (ABL) said that it had not seen an official version of the plan. 
A senior Lebanese government source told Reuters the plan had not yet been finalised and was being discussed with the IMF.
The draft aims to plug a huge hole in the financial system and foresees returning just $25 billion out of a total $104 billion in hard currency deposits to savers in U.S. dollars. [L1N2UD1JU]
Lebanon's banks have been a major lender to the government for decades, helping to finance a wasteful and corrupt state that went into financial meltdown in 2019.
The collapse has resulted in depositors largely being shut out of their savings and the local currency losing more than 90% of its value. 
""This hypothetical draft plan indicates it can eliminate the so-called 'losses' in order to balance the books. This approach... is a liquidation approach and will lead to a persistent loss of confidence for generations to come,"" the ABL said in its written responses.
""Other than what has been published and reported in the media, we haven’t seen any official draft of any plan prepared by the government,"" it said, adding it had not participated in drafting the blueprint. 
Under the draft, the majority of dollar deposits would be converted to Lebanese pounds at several exchange rates, including one that would wipe out 75% of the value of some deposits. It estimates losses in the financial sector at $69 billion and sets a 15-year timeframe for paying back all depositors.
The ABL's approval is not required for the government to adopt and begin implementing a plan, but experts say support from the banking sector could contribute to solving the crisis. 
""If true, this reported approach in addressing the losses occurred in the financial sector is not acceptable at all, and will definitely not reverse the spiral downhill of the economy,"" the ABL said. 
BAIL-IN
The ABL said it would not endorse a plan that would lead to a ""nominal haircut on customers' deposits"" or totally wipe out shareholder equity, but was open to shouldering some losses from Eurobonds restructuring and private sector loans.
The government began talks with the IMF in January as part of efforts to secure a bailout seen as crucial to begin charting a path out of the crisis. A viable financial plan is key to that process. A previous plan drawn up under a government in 2020 was shot down by banks, the central bank and powerful political parties, ending IMF talks at the time. 
An IMF spokesperson said last week it could not comment on reports that the fund had rejected aspects of the government's plan during the talks that began in January. 
A Lebanese official source told Reuters the IMF had asked Lebanese officials to ""work on parts of the plan"". 
As part of efforts to plug the $69 billion hole in the financial system, the draft plan envisions a bail-in of large depositors to the tune of $12 billion, equivalent to 72% of shares in the banking sector, thereby reducing shareholders and creditors to less than a third. 

The ABL said any bail-in should be assessed on a case-by-case basis for each bank and should only come after ""we get to a consensual and comprehensive agreement with the government, and after the government fulfils its legal obligation to restore Central Bank solvency"".
The ABL also noted its ""strong objection"" to a proposal for bank shareholders to maintain majority shares in the sector in exchange for injecting $1 billion in fresh capital.

""Everyone should feel comfortable with how their personal information is secured, and we are quickly pursuing short-term options that do not involve facial recognition,"" said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig.
While the agency will roll out another authentication process that does not involve facial recognition, it said the transition would take weeks to complete as it works to prevent disruptions during a tax filing season already in motion.
The move comes about a week after the Treasury Department, the IRS' parent agency, said it would consider dropping the use of ID.me, a private provider of facial-recognition technology, for identity verification. Lawmakers and opponents of the technology called into question the system's transparency and its bias against darker skin individuals.

ID.me has said its digital identity services are used by 10 federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans affairs, and 30 U.S. states.
Treasury initially began relying on ID.me and other third-party services due to the lack of funding to modernize IRS information technology systems, the department said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials called on Monday for ""concrete action"" from China to make good on its commitment to purchase $200 billion in additional U.S. goods and services in 2020 and 2021 under the ""Phase 1"" trade deal signed by former President Donald Trump.
The officials said Washington was losing patience with Beijing, which had ""not shown real signs"" in recent months that it would close the gap in the two-year purchase commitments that expired at the end of 2021. 
The comments come a day before the U.S. government is due to release full-year trade data that analysts expect to show a significant shortfall in China's pledge to increase purchases of U.S. farm and manufactured goods, energy and services.
Through November, China had met only about 60% of the goal, according to trade data compiled by Peterson Institute for International Economics senior fellow Chad Bown.
U.S. President Joe Biden has said the trade deal did not address the core problems with China's state-led economy, but U.S. officials have pressed Beijing to make good on the deal as signed.
""Because we inherited this deal, we engaged the (People's Republic of China) on its purchase commitment shortfalls, both to fight for U.S. farmers, ranchers and manufacturers and give China the opportunity to follow through on its commitments. But our patience is wearing thin,"" said one of the officials.
China continued to engage with U.S. officials on the issue, but Washington was seeking ""concrete action"", not ""talks for the sake of talking,"" the official added.
U.S. officials said they would continue to press China to show ""serious intent"" to reach an agreement on their purchase commitments, but conceded the framework of the deal offered them little leverage to enforce the purchase commitments.
Regardless of how the negotiations wind up, U.S. officials said they would continue to target the core problems of China's state-led economy, while working to boost U.S. competitiveness by diversifying markets and working with allies and partners.
Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi told a trade conference on Tuesday that China had failed to meet its purchase commitments under the deal and the conversations between Washington and Beijing had been ""very difficult.""
The agreement, signed by Trump in January 2020, defused a nearly three-year trade war between the world's two largest economies, but left in place tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of imports on both sides of the Pacific.
Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, said on Monday that the United States should work with China to push foward economic and trade ties.

""For the specific problems which emerge in economic and trade relations between the two countries, both sides should appropriately solve them in the spirit of mutual respect, equality and consultation,"" Zhao told a news conference.
China's Ministry of Commerce did not respond to a faxed request for comment.

392,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 11:55AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has warned of ""geopolitical clouds"" over the European economy due to possible fall-out from further escalation of tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine. 
From rising energy and food prices to economic sanctions and the harm done to investment confidence, the impacts could be far-ranging but hard to quantify. Following are the key variables and vulnerabilities.
WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT ON INFLATION? 
An outright conflict, even of a limited kind, would likely generate immediate and rapid fuel and food price inflation.
European Union countries buy 41.1% of their imported gas from Russia and 27% of their oil, according to EU data: any restriction of supplies would quickly lead to higher energy prices. That would ripple through the economy from higher heating and fuel bills to costlier transport and power for businesses. 
Food supplies would also likely be hit. Natural gas is the main component in many fertilizers, so higher gas costs would likely push up all crop prices. Separately, Ukraine exported over 33 million tons of grain last year so any disruption there would reverberate across global markets - including in Europe. 
Overall, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities estimates an escalation could push euro zone inflation up 1 percentage point to 4% for 2022.
AND ON TRADE AND INVESTMENT?
    If Russia decided to stop all imports from the EU, it would affect the 80 billion euros worth of goods which the EU exports to Russia annually, worth 0.6% of EU GDP. 
These EU exports are mainly machines and cars, chemicals and manufactured goods. Among EU countries, Germany is both Russia's biggest exporter and importer, while the Netherlands, Poland, Italy, Belgium and France also have sizeable trade. 
In time, European firms would look to secure alternative trading partners, as indeed many already have done since the confrontation over Crimea in 2014. The euro zone's export exposure to Russia has roughly halved since then.
    The EU is also the largest foreign investor in Russia with total direct investment of 311.4 billion euros in 2019. Russian investment in the EU is 136 billion euros. Depending on the severity of any sanctions and counter-sanctions, some or all of the European presence in Russia could be impacted. 
    ""On paper it is a lot, but this is only a small fraction of overall foreign FDI of EU companies,"" said Daniel Gross, head of the CEPS think tank in Brussels, who added he saw little risk of Moscow wanting to expropriate plants run by EU companies because of the complexities entailed in running them.
SO WHAT IS THE OVERALL IMPACT TO THE EURO ZONE ECONOMY?
Clearly negative, nonetheless. Higher energy and food prices would sap household purchasing power and erode confidence. Consumption would be hit quickly and investments would likely fall in the weeks and months afterwards.
""The geopolitical clouds that we have over Europe, if they were to materialise, would certainly have an impact on energy prices and, through energy prices, an increased cost throughout the whole structure of prices,"" the ECB's Lagarde said last week, citing hits to consumption and investment. 
Moreover, since high energy prices hit lower income families disproportionately, governments are likely to introduce subsidy measures, which in turn would put more pressure on state coffers already stretched by pandemic support measures.
The Bank of America study reckoned an escalation would put at risk 0.5 percentage point of Europe's output directly through the drag on private consumption. Many consumers have built up buffers in the form of excess savings amassed during the pandemic, but some of those savings have already been eroded by sharp rises to fuel bills.
WHAT WOULD THE ECB DO?
The ECB would not tighten policy to offset a conflict-related inflation surge. It normally looks past short-term volatility because policy is only effective 12-18 months out.
Still, with inflation already at a record high 5.1% and the ECB planning to unwind stimulus in the coming months, a conflict and associated further rise in inflation would put public pressure on the bank to act quicker, even if that made little economic sense. 

""There’s not much that monetary policy can do to influence energy prices,"" Neil Shearing at Capital Economics said. 
""While a rise in energy prices increases inflation in the short term, all other things being equal, the subsequent squeeze on real incomes is disinflationary over the medium term.""

The central bank held the design competition as part of its preparations for Croatia adopting the euro as its currency, which it hopes to do in January 2023.
On Friday, designer Stjepan Pranjkovic was declared the competition winner for his image of a pine marten, a reference to Croatia's current currency. The Croatian kuna is named after the pine marten, whose pelts were once a valuable trading commodity.
However, as soon as the winning entry was announced, social media users pointed to the design's strong resemblance to a photograph by Scottish author Iain Leach, which also features a pine marten standing on a tree branch. 
""Driven by unpleasant atmosphere in media and social media, as well as pressures I have been exposed regarding my design of the back of the pine marten coin, I decided to withdraw my proposal,"" Pranjkovic said in a letter published by Croatia's central bank.
He also said he would give up 70,000 kuna ($11,000) prize.
In an email to Reuters, Leach said he was pleased the design had been withdrawn. 
""I am not going to sue anybody. The right decision has been made and that is the end to it for me,"" he wrote.
The central bank has yet to decide whether the award goes to the runner-up or if it will organise a new contest.
Masa Milovac, head of Croatian Designers Association, said the central bank should have involved more designers in the selection process. 

""In this case, Croatia's central bank made a mistake by taking on itself a decision which was not within their expertise.""

Pointing to mounting inflation risks, Lagarde opened the door last week to an interest rate hike later in 2022 and said that a March 10 meeting will be crucial in deciding how quickly the bank would wind down its long-running bond buying scheme, a cornerstone of its stimulus efforts.

""This increases the likelihood that the current price pressures will subside before becoming entrenched, enabling us to deliver on our 2% target over the medium term,"" she said. 
While Lagarde herself did not commit to any decision, several policymakers argued that the first move will be to speed up an exit from the bond buying scheme, which is due to run indefinitely but at least until October.

An interest rate increase could only come thereafter but quicker tapering could mean a raise, the first since 2011, before the end of the year.
Markets now price 50 basis points of rate hikes this year but economists are more cautious, with most predicting the first move either at the end of the year or early 2023.

395,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 10:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"MADRID (Reuters) -Spanish Economy Minister Nadia Calvino suggested on Monday that each EU member state should play a leading role in setting its own fiscal targets instead of having common goals defined by the bloc's rules.
EU countries are currently discussing a change to the fiscal rules, officially called the Stability and Growth Pact, that limit government borrowing to protect the value of the common euro currency - shared by 19 states.
The rules have been suspended since 2020 to give governments leeway to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
With growth now back on track, the rules were to be reinstated from the start of 2023. The discussion focuses on the need to acknowledge the EU's new economic realities - the high post-pandemic public debt, wide deficits and the need for huge public investment to fight climate change.
""For the future, member states must play a leading role in setting their own fiscal targets,"" Calvino told an event in Madrid she was attending alongside her Irish counterpart and the chairman of euro zone finance ministers, Paschal Donohoe.
The issue is politically divisive as EU countries with more fiscal discipline are wary of their more profligate partners and EU officials said last week that talks were likely to last well into next year, leaving the bloc in a quandary over a framework for 2023 to cautiously reduce spending.

Donohoe, who told a news conference that Spain's view on the future of the fiscal rules was well known across the bloc and that he was confident of an eventual agreement, said the plan for 2023 was a more pressing matter in the coming weeks.
""That work is already under way and I am confident as we move into March that we will have guidance in place for how we can have the right bugetary policies (for 2023) to continue to support a recovery in Europe,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Assets in European funds marketed as sustainable have hit 4 trillion euros -- almost 40% of all assets managed in European Union-domiciled funds -- Morningstar said on Monday in the latest sign of soaring demand for products considered greener.
Investment funds marketed as sustainable under the EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation managed 4.05 trillion euros in assets ($4.63 trillion) at end-2021, Morningstar said in a new report. That is up from about 2 trillion euros in April last year shortly after the rules were introduced.
The growth is down to investors putting more money into products that tout environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, and as managers reclassify more of their existing products as sustainability-aligned.
Under the new regulations -- an attempt to deliver transparency for investors trying to make sense of the many ESG investment products -- managers can classify their funds under different Articles. 
Article 9 means they are fully focused on sustainable objectives while Article 8 means the funds promote ""among other characteristics, environmental or social characteristics, or a combination of those characteristics"".
Investments classified as Article 6 are traditional products not focused on sustainability.
While the EU's new regime has been hailed as a significant boost to transparency, critics say loose definitions have allowed managers to take very different approaches to how they classify their funds.
That has led to a wide range of products, from 'light green' funds with limited claims to sustainability, to climate-focused 'dark green' products marketed under the same categories.
Morningstar said some funds classifying themselves as sustainable had made no changes to their portfolio, such as selling out of certain companies or sectors. 
""Such light-touch and business-as-usual approaches have legitimately raised concerns that asset managers are greenwashing their product ranges,"" the report's authors said. 
Investors ""could be misled in thinking that funds marketed as promoting ESG characteristics or pursuing sustainable goals"" were different from funds not marketed as such.
""That said, it is also important to keep in mind that SFDR classification is about disclosing relevant ESG information, but it doesn't constitute an ESG label and additional analysis and metrics are required to assess funds' ESG credentials,"" the authors added. 
Morningstar said in the fourth quarter of 2021, Article 8 and 9 funds captured 64% of all European fund inflows -- up from 41% in the second quarter.
Since SFDR's introduction, almost half of all new fund launches have been under Articles 8 and 9.

Morningstar's analysis covered 91% of the funds domiciled in the EU.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rapid action is needed to update how cross-border financial services are scrutinised and consumers protected as the sector becomes digitalised with ""Big Tech"" playing an increased role, European Union regulators said on Monday.
People are turning to social media and using smartphones to buy and sell shares, move money around bank accounts and make payments, a trend accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving regulators playing catch-up.
""Digital finance has unlocked new synergies between financial and non-financial activities that potentially introduce systemic risk into the market for financial services,"" a joint report from the EU's banking, insurance and markets watchdogs said.
Cloud computing, or banks and other financial firms using outsourced providers for services, is booming, the report said.
It is sometimes unclear how to categorise some digital financial services under existing rules, creating uncertainty over data privacy, anti-money laundering safeguards and how much capital they should be holding, the report said.
It called on the bloc's executive European Commission, which has opened a public consultation on digital finance, to take a ""holistic"" view of supervising financial services.
New ""supervision structures"" may be needed to capture transactions spread across ""mixed activity"" groups or MAGs, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other Big Tech firms offering financial and non-financial services.
The crash of German payments company Wirecard demonstrated that complex arrangements within a group providing both financial and non-financial services create specific challenges for supervisors, the report said.
""The growing digitalisation and datafication of financial services necessitate closer cooperation between financial and relevant non-financial authorities,"" the report said.

The report said that regulatory action may be warranted given that some posting on social media are effectively advertisements.
""In securities markets in particular, the growth of digital trading platforms has coincided with new trends, such as ‘social trading’, or investment advice shared over social media—which brings new opportunities but risks as well.""

Investing.com --  Bond markets continue to struggle after the ECB's hawkish turn on Thursday and the surprising revisions to U.S. employment data on Friday. Stocks are also set to open lower, but Peloton is bucking the trend after reports suggesting that both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) are looking at bidding for the company. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visits Washington as the west scrambles for a unified line to take on Russia's threats to Ukraine, while oil prices barely come off the boil as diplomats prepared to resume talks on lifting sanctions on Iran. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 7th February.
1. Bond yields keep rising
Bond markets around the world remained under pressure after Friday’s U.S. employment data, which showed that the labor market had been far stronger in the last three months than initially expected. That reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates by 50 basis points at its March meeting, rather than just the 25 basis points which is still – just – the consensus.
U.S. Treasuries have stabilized in the ranges they fell into on Friday, but in Europe, yields continue to rise - and spreads between core and peripheral Eurozone markets continue to widen - following the European Central Bank’s meeting on Thursday, when ECB President Christine Lagarde pointedly refused to rule out an interest rate hike this year. Lagarde speaks in the EU Parliament at 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT).
Dutch central bank head Klaas Knot, a noted ‘hawk’ said in an interview at the weekend he expects a hike as early as October. Italian 10-Year government bond yields rose 11 basis points, while their Greek equivalents rose 22 basis points. The benchmark German 10-Year yield rose 3 basis points to 0.24%, its highest in three years.
2. Peloton in play
Amazon and Nike are both considering a bid for Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON), according to various reports over the weekend.  The stock responded by rising 22% in premarket trading.
The maker of connected fitness equipment has come into play after losing over 80% of its value since peaking at the end of 2020, due to widening losses that have forced it to abandon its niche as a high-end hardware maker and seek a broader base of customers.
The group is already under pressure to shake up performance from activist shareholders. However, any acquisition by a Big Tech name would be likely to provoke substantial interest from antitrust regulators, who appear less inclined than before to accept Big Tech’s relentless expansion.
3. Stocks set to open lower on rate concerns; Tyson, Hasbro report earnings
U.S. stocks are set to open lower again on Monday, having had a mixed day on Friday in response to the labor market report.
By 6:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 81 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures were down by a similar amount. NASDAQ 100 futures were down a little less, by 0.1%.
With only second-tier economic data due – consumer credit numbers for December come at 3 PM ET – the focus is likely to be on earnings, where  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), Loews (NYSE:L), Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) and ON Semiconductor are all due to report.
Also in focus will be  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), amid reports of a possible share sale by Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) coming down the line.
4. Scholz in Washington, Macron in Moscow
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visits U.S. President Joe Biden in an attempt to iron out a sanctions package in case of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.  U.S. sources briefed again at the weekend that such a scenario is likely, despite Russian insistences to the contrary.
Various reports suggest that the U.S. and its European allies are struggling to find alternatives to Russian natural gas supplies which would give them the leverage to refuse flows through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. That pipeline is currently awaiting final approval from German regulators. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Monday that Europe’s gas prices are likely to remain high for some time.
French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, is to visit his Russian counterpart in Moscow. Putin received an endorsement of his position on Ukraine from Chinese President Xi Jinping when he visited Beijing last week.
5. Oil still bubbling despite Iran news
Crude oil prices continue to trade well above $90 a barrel, despite the lack of any major disruption to Texas’ energy complex from the winter storm at the end of last week.
There was only minor relief from news that talks on lifting sanctions on Iran will resume on Tuesday.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 0.9% at $91.50 a barrel, while Brent crude was down 0.4% at $92.86 a barrel.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The last time the U.S. unemployment rate fell below 3%, as one Federal Reserve official has predicted it will this year, the Korean War was nearing its end and a recession that saw legions of workers lose their jobs was just around the corner.
While the circumstances were unusual, it nonetheless presented a now-familiar pattern - a falling unemployment rate eventually giving way to recession - that current Fed officials will be challenged to avoid as they try to slow the fast pace of inflation without wrecking an expansion that is delivering strong gains for workers.
Emblematic of the current confidence in the job market's strength, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard last week said he expects the U.S. unemployment rate to fall below 3% this year. That flashback to the 1950s in itself would be a warning for some economists.
Such a low unemployment rate is ""a red flare"" that the economy is overheating, with fast price and wage increases that are unavoidable and the U.S. central bank pushed to be more aggressive, said Tim Duy, a University of Oregon professor and the chief economist of SGH Macroadvisers. ""I don't see where there is a good way out"" that tames inflation without triggering a recession and the associated jump in unemployment.
It's a tradeoff - of jobs for price control - the Fed thought had become less relevant. In the decade before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, unemployment drifted towards 3% without triggering inflation, and policymakers felt that showed the economy could put far more people to work than previously thought with prices remaining stable.
'HARD LANDING' AHEAD?
The pandemic has rekindled that debate and raised doubts about whether inflation, the work choices of Americans, even the global economy overall, will follow the patterns that existed before two years of mass infection, fear and lockdowns. 
In 2019, for example, the unemployment rate hovered around 3.5% while inflation struggled to hit the Fed's 2% target. Going into 2022, amid a global tangle of supply-chain bottlenecks, workers' reluctance to take jobs, and the ongoing pandemic, the unemployment rate was about 4%, businesses wanted far more workers than were willing to take a job, and inflation was nearly triple the Fed's objective.
U.S. central bank officials still think they can avoid a recessionary ""hard landing"" as they begin what Fed Chair Jerome Powell says will be a steady removal of the low interest rates and other measures meant to help the economy through the pandemic. Policymakers at this point support that approach, with the first rate hike widely expected to come next month.
Yet despite their seeming agreement, a subtle divide exists between those who feel much of the current inflation remains tied to the pandemic and will likely ease on its own and those who feel the Fed itself will have to do the bulk of the work on inflation, lifting interest rates enough to slow the economy.
In the simplest case that difference is a matter of timing, and could resolve itself in a few months if inflation moves clearly in one direction or the other, and pulls policymakers' opinions along with it. But more fundamentally it's about how the economy may have changed since March 2020, a debate that will shape how upcoming economic data gets interpreted, how fast monetary policy may veer in one direction or the other, and whether the pace of inflation can be tamed without a downturn.
POTENTIAL FOR MISTAKES
Bullard, for one, said in a Reuters interview that it was ""premature"" for anyone to argue the Fed was behind in its inflation fight. Indeed, he said the central bank was well-poised to do what was needed.
But he also said he felt monetary policy, by limiting demand through higher interest rates and controlling expectations about inflation, would be responsible for ""a significant portion"" of the inflation fight. He was ""pessimistic"" that improvements in global supply chains, the return of individuals to the job market, or other improvements would offer any imminent help and allow the Fed to proceed less aggressively.
""I am not deaf to the supply-side arguments,"" he said. Yet while policymakers are aligned on the initial rate increases, ""there will be a moment at some point in the future where it will be a tougher decision ... How much do you want to tighten policy and how much are you risking recession?""
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari by contrast has said rates may only need to rise ""a little bit,"" more like easing off the accelerator of an automobile than tapping its brakes.
Mistakes, and recession risks, can come from either direction - doing too little and allowing inflation to take deeper root; doing too much and causing an unnecessary downturn.
UNPREDICTABLE DATA 
The Labor Department's jobs report for January, which was released earlier on Friday, showed what the Fed is grappling with in an era when neither prices or employment - the two pillars of its policy mandate - are behaving as expected.
Many analysts forecast that the economy had actually lost jobs last month amid a record surge in COVID-19 cases and as businesses scaled back either out of caution or because their employees were sick.
The report, however, showed employers added 467,000 jobs, and wages jumped, a sign of the pressures building in the economy despite the jump in infections driven by the Omicron variant of the virus. 

A surprise to the other side: Labor force participation rose and the unemployment rate actually edged up a tenth of a percentage point, a trend that if established could work in favor of a less aggressive Fed.
But as it stands ""we have to take the numbers at face value, and they paint a picture of a labor market on fire,"" wrote Jefferies economists Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons, with the Fed likely heading towards ""a more sustained tightening cycle and a higher terminal rate.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank could end its stimulus programme earlier than planned but it is unlikely to raise its main interest rate in July as investors are expecting, ECB policymaker Martins Kazaks told Reuters.
Investors have brought forward their bets on the bank's first rate hike in more than a decade after ECB President Christine Lagarde on Thursday opened the door to such a move and acknowledged mounting inflation risks.
But Kazaks, who is Latvia's central bank governor, pushed back against market bets on a July move because this would imply a complete winding down, or ""tapering"" of the ECB's bond purchases before that date.
""July would imply an extremely and unlikely quick pace of tapering,"" Kazaks said in an interview. ""But overall, at the current juncture, naming a specific month would be much premature.""
The ECB has long said it would end its bond purchases ""shortly before"" raising its deposit rate from minus 0.5%, and Lagarde and colleagues have reaffirmed that commitment in recent days. 
Asset purchases are currently set to run at least until October although sources have told Reuters the ECB is likely to bring that date forward at its March 10 meeting.
With euro zone inflation at a record 5.1% in January - more than twice the ECB's 2% goal - Kazaks was also open to action.
""If we see that inflation remains high and the labour market remains strong or strengthens further, if we see that the economy keeps going, the direction is clear: we may act sooner than we assumed in the past,"" the 48-year old economist said.
Kazaks noted that wages, a key driver of growth in prices, had surprisingly failed to pick up, but he still saw mounting risk that high inflation persisted in the euro zone, lessening the need for ECB largesse.
""With the economy recovering, inflation at this level and increased risk of persistency of inflation, new net asset purchases become less necessary,"" Kazaks said.
He favoured laying out a new ""roadmap"" for how bond purchases would be reduced rather than setting the pace at every policy meeting, which would create ""recurrent cliff effects"" for the bond market. 
Euro zone government bond yields rose across the board on Monday. Italian bonds, which are highly sensitive to ECB's purchases due the country's high debt burden, were among the worst performers. [GVD/EUR]
Kazaks singled out a potential war between Russia and Ukraine as the biggest risk to the ECB's policy path.
""If a war breaks out, God forbid, we reassess the baseline scenario and act accordingly,"" he said.
Money markets have priced in a 15 basis point rise in the ECB's deposit rate in July, plus nearly a further 40 basis points by December.

The ECB's deposit rate has been below 0%, meaning banks are charged to park their spare cash at the central bank overnight, since 2014. 
Dutch central bank governor Klaas Knot said on Sunday he expected the first ECB rate rise to come in the fourth quarter of this year. France's Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Friday that markets shouldn't ""rush to conclusions"" about the timing of any ECB move, while Slovakia's Peter Kazimir said the ECB ""will be wiser in March"" when it has more data.

MYBank was also warned and fined for failing to follow the central bank's know your customer (KYC) requirements and instructions to report suspicious transactions, the Hangzhou branch of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a penalty decision dated Jan. 29.
A spokesperson at MYBank told Reuters on Monday the relevant problems had been rectified by 2020. 
China’s financial regulators have been ramping up anti-money laundering efforts for online financial institutions, as part of Beijing’s efforts to rein in financial risks.
The PBOC and China's Ministry of Public Security are leading a three-year campaign to fight money laundering in a bid to safeguard national security and social stability.
China also ordered Ant to become a more strictly regulated financial holding firm and strictly comply with the requirements of credit information business regulation after its record $37 billion IPO was derailed by regulators in 2020. 

Nine executives and managers at MYBank including then-deputy chief executive Feng Liang were also fined for such violations, according to the penalty decision.

403,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 04:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Julien Ponthus. 
The European Central Bank's meeting last week turned out to be quite a policy pivot. 
With euro zone inflation running above 5%, money markets had already been betting the ECB would wake up, smell the coffee and possibly signal when it might follow the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in tightening policy. 
But by opening the door to a rate hike in 2022, President Christine Lagarde unleashed a massive readjustment, with German 10-year government yields seeing their biggest jump since the March 2020 COVID-19 crash.
ECB governing council member Klaas Knot doubled downed over the weekend, saying he expected rates to start rising in the fourth quarter. 
Quick take? Well, with the ECB also now on board to tighten policy, this looks like a new financial markets cycle.
""The times of low growth, low inflation, low rates and excess central bank liquidity are over in our view"", Berenberg analysts write. 
All eyes will be on Lagarde when she addresses the European Parliament later on Monday. In the meantime, strategists are adjusting equity risk premium models to the paradigm shift. 
Shares in European banks hit their highest since 2018 and the continent's tech index is down 20% from its November highs.
Wall Street meanwhile has been on a roller coaster after Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc's historic $200 billion market value plunge, but also a $190 billion jump by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Overall though, there seems no cause for alarm -- 78% of S&P 500 earnings have beaten forecasts so far according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S. And the U.S. economy also created far more jobs than expected in January.
So despite a dip on Asian stocks earlier, European and U.S. futures indicate a cautiously optimistic mood. Clouded of course by the Ukraine diplomatic crisis and oil prices north of $90 a barrel.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday:
-Indonesia's GDP speeds up
-China's Jan services activity expands at slowest rate in five months 
-German industrial production dips in December 
-UK house prices rise at slowest pace since June

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Thailand's central bank will wait for at least a year before raising interest rates from record lows to support the tourism-dependent economy hit hard by coronavirus-related travel restrictions, a Reuters poll found.
Economic growth in the Southeast Asian nation is yet to return to pre-pandemic levels and the recovery continues to be fragile due to an outbreak of the Omicron coronavirus variant that crippled the crucial tourism industry.
Although inflation breached the Bank of Thailand's (BOT) target range of 1-3% in January, it was expected to fall back within that range in the coming months, giving the central bank the space to maintain an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth.
That comes despite multi-decade highs for inflation in many countries, including the United States, where the Federal Reserve is due to raise interest rates next month.
Past Fed tightening cycles have led to capital outflows from less developed economies like Thailand, but analysts are not as concerned this time around. 
All 23 economists in the Feb. 1-4 Reuters poll unanimously predicted the BOT to hold its one-day repurchase rate at an historic low of 0.50% at its Feb. 9 meeting and the rest of the year.
The central bank was expected to raise its key interest rate to 0.75% in the second quarter of 2023, followed by another 25 basis points in the December quarter of next year.
""The Bank of Thailand's interest rate lift-off would likely only take place in early 2023 when Thailand's real GDP returns to pre-COVID levels, assuming inflation and impact from U.S. interest rate normalisation remain manageable,"" said Chua Han Teng, an economist at DBS.
""Thailand's diverging monetary policy with the U.S. Federal Reserve could result in heightened capital flow volatility, but the BOT has more than adequate reserve buffers to deal with potential capital flow fluctuations and baht weakness.""
Indeed, the Thai baht was expected to be one of the best performers among emerging market currencies, rising nearly 3% to 32.07/$ in a year, a separate Reuters poll showed.
Another Reuters survey of economists published last month showed inflation was expected to average 1.5% this year and slip to 1.2% in 2023. Thailand's economy was expected to grow 3.9% this year and 4.1% in 2023.

""While there is a risk of higher inflation, we believe the inflation problem remains transitory for Thailand,"" said Lattakit Lapudomkarn, an economist at Kiatnakin Phatra Securities.
""However, if inflation is proven to be persistent and expectation becomes entrenched, the policy interest rate should be the primary tool to manage.""

SEOUL (Reuters) -Seoul's housing market, one of the most unaffordable in the world, has begun to show signs that its red-hot five-year boom could be running out of steam - just in time for the March presidential vote.
Housing is one of the biggest issues in the neck-and-neck election, with prices in the capital having doubled since 2017 when President Moon Jae-in first took office, leaving many millennials facing a lifetime of financial insecurity. 
An average apartment in Seoul, for instance, is estimated to cost around 18 years of South Korea's median annual household income, up from 11 years in 2017.
Recent data, however, has lent weight to the view that restrictions on loans, hikes in interest rates and pledges to massively boost the supply of homes by both presidential candidates have begun to have an effect.
South Korean residential property transactions plunged 62% in December to 53,774 from a year earlier - the smallest number for the month since 2008 when the market was battered by the global financial crisis.
Additionally, a weekly index for Seoul's apartment price growth edged 0.1% lower for the last week of January, the first decline in 20 months.
Analysts also note that there's been a natural lull in activity as people wait to see if the March 9 election will bring about changes to capital gains taxes and other levies.
""Loan restrictions and higher borrowing costs began to really cool the market towards the end of last year and even serious buyers and sellers are waiting for policy changes so we're in for a quiet market for months to come,"" said Yeo Kyoung-hui, a property market analyst at Real Estate 114.
""It's possible that we will see supply outpace demand going forward.""
A narrow majority, 51%, of some 500 property market experts expect South Korean home prices to decline this year, according to a survey by the Korea Development Institute in January. Around 30% see further price gains while the rest either expect no change or a year of both price increases and falls.
""A sharp downturn is unlikely, but it does look like the market has turned a corner with interest rates set to rise further,"" said Park Hab-soo, a professor of real estate studies at Konkuk University.
The election will pit Lee Jae-myung, chosen by the Democrats to succeed Moon, against Yoon Suk-yeol from the conservative People Power Party. Recent polls show they both have 35% of voter support.

Lee has sought to distance himself from Moon's property market policy failures and has pledged to build about 2.5 million homes through public housing. 
Yoon has made a similar pledge and has also promised to loosen curbs for first-time buyers so they can borrow up to 80% of a home's value. That compares with a current cap of 40% for those in the capital region.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and South Korea will on Monday sign an agreement to reinforce pandemic-damaged supply lines for key products like semiconductors, with trade minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan due to host her counterpart Yeo Han-koo in London.
The ministers will also begin work on an improved trade deal as Britain looks to use its exit from the European Union to build stronger ties with faster-growing economies throughout Asia and the Pacific.
""This is our Indo-Pacific tilt in action – strengthening ties with one of the largest economies in the world,"" Trevelyan said in a statement.
Monday's meeting is a precursor to formal trade negotiations, which are expected to begin later this year, to improve an existing agreement which effectively keeps in place the terms Britain had as a member of the EU.
Ahead of that, the delegations in London will look to improve supply chain resilience in the face of global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which is driving up production costs and fuelling inflation - currently at its highest in nearly 30 years in Britain.
Details of the agreement were not published in advance. 
Britain said it wanted to ensure critical goods kept flowing between the two countries, citing chips used in advanced manufacturing as an example. Britain's auto industry, like others around the world, has been held back by a global shortage of semiconductors.
World leaders last year sought ways to strengthen supply chains by improving transparency and diversifying sources of key products.
Trade between Britain and South Korea was worth 13.3 billion pounds ($18 billion) in the year to September 2021, the government said. Both countries are seeking to join a trans-Pacific trade pact.

Leaving the EU has given Britain the power to strike bilateral trade deals, and ministers see South Korea and its wealthy middle classes as an important potential market for premium British goods, from folding bikes to pottery and Scotch whisky.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Klaas Knot, the Dutch central bank president and a member of the European Central Bank's Governing Council, said on Sunday he expects the ECB to raise interest rates in the fourth quarter of this year.
In an interview on Dutch television programme Buitenhof, Knot, known as one of the more hawkish members of the ECB's board, said he supported winding down the euro zone central bank's asset purchasing programme as quickly as possible.
""Personally I expect our first rate increase to take place around the fourth quarter of this year.... Normally we would raise rates by a quarter percentage point, I have no reason to expect we would take a different step."" He added that he thought a second hike would likely follow in early 2023.
Knot's remarks come after ECB President Christine Lagarde https://www.reuters.com/business/ecb-seen-hold-may-acknowledge-inflation-risks-2022-02-02 on Thursday opened the door to an interest rate increase in 2022 but said it was ""unlikely"".
The bank must first end its asset purchasing programmes, currently set to be wound down in steps to 20 billion euros ($22.89 billion) per month by the fourth quarter. However, since Thursday bond markets have begun pricing in around 40 basis points of rate hikes by December.
""The first two rate increases will follow each other quite quickly, as they will take us out of negative territory,"" Knot said.
""After that, if we don't see a wage-price spiral and inflation expectations remain anchored around our 2% target there is not much reason for us to increase rates significantly and quickly.""

Knot said that inflation in the euro zone, at 5.1% in January, was too high, and will probably last into 2023 before receding - assuming there is no further unexpected increase in energy prices.

(Reuters) - Ecuador is expecting a planned trade deal with China to increase commerce between the two countries by about 35%, though the South American country will seek to protect some local industry, Exterior Commerce Minister Julio Jose Prado said on Sunday.
The two countries on Saturday said they would seek to reach a trade deal by the end of the year. The announcement was made during a state visit to China by Ecuadorean President Guillermo Lasso.
China became Ecuador's top lender over the past decade, with millions of dollars in long-term credit tied to the handover of crude oil, large investments in hydro-electric and mining projects and other loans. China is a leading buyer of Ecuadorean products including shrimp and bananas and a major importer to the Andean country.
""There will be an increase of trade with China of at least 30% to 35% of what we have today,"" Prado, accompanying Lasso on the trip, told Reuters in a video call from Beijing. ""It is an accord with a broad reach. ... It will cover intellectual property, public purchases, commercial defense.""
Though Ecuador will seek to reduce tariffs on products shipped to China to a minimum, it will also look to protect local industries including steel, textiles, shoes and assembly works that are sensitive to competition from imports, Prado said.
""For those products we would need to seek large tax exemption periods to allow the industry to be more competitive, to reinvent,"" Prado said.
Some products may also be excluded from the deal, he said.
""Having the formal trade deal will make the rules of the game for imported products clearer,"" Prado said.
Non-oil Ecuadorean exports to China between January and November last year totaled some $2.8 billion, while imports in the same period totaled $3.96 billion, according to the central bank of Ecuador. Ecuador's oil exports to China are tied to debt re-payments, which Lasso is seeking to renegotiate. 

Ecuador also expects to sign trade deals with Mexico, South Korea and the Dominican Republic this year, Prado said. It also is seeking a trade deal with the United States, Prado noted.
""Ecuador needs to open itself to the world, it needs to open itself to the United States, and we'll keep seeking that deal long-term,"" Prado said. ""While that progresses, it's necessary to look to Asia in the same way we've looked previously to Europe.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's central bank should be prepared to raise interest rates and taper foreign exchange intervention if inflation pressures intensify further, the International Monetary Fund said on Sunday.
In a statement following its annual visit, the IMF said there was room for Israel's government to raise taxes while also advising more efficiency in state spending.
Israel's inflation rate was 2.8% in 2021, within an official 1-3% target and well below rates seen in many Western peers, but the IMF said rising services prices, a high rate of capacity utilization, and wage gains in some sectors ""show incipient signs of underlying inflationary pressures"".
""If underlying upward pressures become more salient, the Bank of Israel should be ready to tighten monetary policy,"" the IMF said. 
Iva Krasteva Petrova, IMF mission chief for Israel, told reporters that since inflation is within target there is no need for monetary tightening now but that the central bank should remain vigilant. She also expressed concern over high housing prices.
At the same time, the IMF said ""foreign exchange purchases should taper off, allowing the shekel to be determined by market forces, without precluding future purchases should (shekel) appreciation pressures threaten to move inflation or inflation expectations below the target band"".
The central bank has said it is not worried about an inflation outbreak, and that allows it patience in conducting monetary policy.
The IMF praised the government's management of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aim of lowering Israel's debt burden over the medium term.
But it warned the planned consolidation relies on spending reductions that may prove challenging given already low civil spending. ""Conducting a review of public spending efficiency would be useful,"" it said
The government has scope to increase tax revenues, the IMF said, adding: ""The tax system could be made more progressive and the tax base could be broadened, including by reducing pension tax exemptions and personal and corporate tax incentives for selected groups.""

After 6.5% growth in 2021, the IMF expects solid economic growth in Israel in 2022, supported by consumer spending, investment and exports.
It said that new COVID variants could be a threat to economic growth, while tightening of global financial conditions could jolt stock markets, lower government revenue and raise the cost of capital.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wild swings in stocks and a sharp run-up in government bond yields are putting the spotlight on next week’s U.S. inflation data, as investors brace for more volatility across assets.
A turbulent week in markets ended with a surge in Treasury yields to their highest level in more than two years after surprisingly strong U.S. jobs data stoked expectations of a more hawkish Federal Reserve.
Robust data on inflation – which hit its highest annual level in nearly four decades in December – could further bolster the case for a more aggressive Fed and extend the climb in yields, dulling the allure of an equity market struggling to rebound from last month’s tumble.
Due out on Thursday, the U.S. consumer price index for January is expected to have risen 0.5%, culminating in an annual rise of 7.3%, which would be the largest such increase since 1982, according to a Reuters poll. 
“We could potentially get a very difficult number to digest next week on the inflation front and that has the potential to cut the markets off at the knees,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which moves inversely to prices, has climbed about 40 basis points in 2022 to over 1.9% as investors factor in at least five rate increases from the Fed this year. 
The climb has weighed on equities overall while contributing to steep declines in the shares of many tech and growth stocks, whose valuations rely on future profits that are discounted more steeply as bond yields rise. The benchmark S&P 500 is down about 5.6% so far to start the year, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq logging a nearly 10% drop.
“The reason why people are hitting the reset button ... is because valuations were pulled forward a lot,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management. ""With rising rates, the valuations just can’t be justified. So whenever there is a little bit of a miss (on earnings) is when these stocks get punished quite a bit.""
The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 has fallen to 19.5 times from 21.7 times at the end of 2021, while the forward P/E for the S&P 500 tech sector has dropped to 24.4 from 28.5, according to Refinitiv Datastream.
Some investors believe stocks have further to fall before they become attractive. Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on Friday urged clients to sell into equity rallies as “a tightening Fed historically brings lower returns and great uncertainty for equities” and wrote that the S&P 500’s fair value is closer to 4,000. The benchmark index on Friday rose around 0.5% to 4,500.
Others are questioning whether the growth stocks that have led the markets higher for years are ceding leadership to so-called value stocks, comparatively cheap stocks that are expected to do better in a rising rate or inflationary environment.
The S&P 500 value index, replete with shares of energy firms, financial companies and other economically sensitive names, had declined 1.4% so far this year as of Thursday, versus a 10.2% drop for its S&P 500 growth counterpart. That disparity would be close to value's biggest annual outperformance over growth in two decades.
""You are seeing gradually higher market interest rates that is causing investors to reassess and to look at near-term profitability and the value and cyclical trade,"" said John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Wealth Management.
The market was also digesting a topsy-turvy week of high-profile earnings. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) soared after their respective quarterly reports while megacap peer Meta Platforms Inc tumbled after the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner's dour forecast.
Next week, reports are due from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp set to report the following week.

As with Meta Platforms, any disappointments in reports - especially from companies whose valuations remain expensive - could result in severe market fallout, investors said. 
""It’s been a volatile start to the year with investors swinging between concerns over Federal Reserve tightening and confidence in the economic recovery,"" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said in a research note. ""Meta aside, a solid earnings outlook is helping to ease the uncertainty, at least for the moment.""

The leaders, who met on the sidelines of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, agreed on a five-year plan for agricultural cooperation and identified key areas to grow and diversify trade and investment in the sector.
China is a major buyer of Argentine soybeans and beef. It also has a major currency swap deal with the country, which helps to bolster its dwindling foreign reserves. Fernandez is battling to revive the economy of Argentina, a major grains producer.
Argentina's government said in a statement that the two sides had highlighted the importance of the currency swap between their central banks and agreed to continue ""strengthening cooperation"" in this regard.
The two also signed a memorandum of understanding related to China's signature Belt and Road initiative, a platform for Chinese investment in railways, ports and highways worldwide.
""This strategic decision will allow the national government to sign different agreements that guarantee financing for investments and works for more than $23.7 billion,"" Argentina's government said. The Chinese side did not give such a figure.
In a 40-minute meeting, Xi and Fernandez agreed to cooperate and invest in areas such as green and sustainable development, as well as digital economy.
China is willing to share development opportunities with Argentina and help it expand exports and upgrade its industries, China's foreign ministry quoted Xi as saying.
He was quoted as saying the two countries should deepen cooperation in trade, agriculture, energy and mining, infrastructure, investment and financing, anti-epidemic efforts, the digital economy, green development and other areas.

European Central Bank Governing Council Member Klaas Knot said he expects an interest-rate increase as early as in the fourth quarter.
Borrowing costs are typically tightened in 25 basis-point steps and “I don’t have reason to think differently this time,” he said in a Buitenhof interview on Sunday. 
The ECB last week made a hawkish pivot, with President Christine Lagarde -- faced with the fastest inflation since the euro was created -- now no longer excluding a rate hike this year. Policy makers privately see a shift in formal guidance materializing as soon as next month, when they’ll get new economic forecasts and reassess their bond-buying. Tightening policy would bring the Frankfurt-based in line with global peers.
Knot, one of the ECB’s most hawkish officials, said he expects euro-area inflation to stay above 4% for much of 2022. 
“We are not in the same situation as the U.S. where the inflation is internally caused,” he said. “The majority of inflation comes from abroad, there’s not much we can do about it.”
Inflation in the Netherlands accelerated to 7.6% in January, the highest level in data going back to 1997. In the euro area, consumer prices unexpectedly jumped an annual 5.1%, remaining more than double the ECB’s 2% target.

Investing.com - February started with a tug-of-war in markets, or with a game of follow-the-leader crossed with musical chairs. Outsized moves from tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (+7.3%), Facebook/Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) (-26.4%), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (+13.5%) dragged the market along with it, best illustrated by the NASDAQ Composite's yo-yo finish to the week. A surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report also suggested continued strength in the economy, while oil climbing to 7-year highs and cryptocurrencies back on the upward march are a reminder of the inflation hedge trade. The end result was a 1.5% rise for the S&P 500 on the week, with the Nasdaq up 2.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1%.
Which sets us up for a week with a CPI report and a slew of earnings reports. Many will be watching the Russia-Ukraine conflict as well, with its obvious geopolitical import as well as direct effects on the commodity sector.
Here’s what you need to know to start your week:
January saw the U.S. add 467K jobs, surprising economists and analysts who expected that the Omicron variant disruption might have a deeper impact. It’s a reminder of how much of the U.S. has decided COVID-19 is not a cause of huge concern, and also that the U.S. economy is fairly hot. Thus inflation.
The CPI and Core CPI Report come out Thursday pre-market. Economists expect CPI to come in at a .5% increase month over month and 7.3% year over year, with core CPI (excluding food and energy prices) also expected at .5% month over month and 5.9% year over year. With rumblings that the Fed might not only hike four times this year but also jump straight to a 50 basis points hike in March, this report will have real weight.

One way to read Meta Platforms’ muted guidance and earnings report was as a new sign that pandemic-related tailwinds are gone for tech companies. Amazon’s rebound after its reports was as much about the worst already being priced into the shares, as the company took a big hit in Q3.
We’ll continue to get read-throughs on both “Covid plays” and “reopen plays” this week, with the following companies reporting:
Peloton’s report will get extra attention with news breaking of Amazon’s purported interest in the fitness equipment and subscription company, which is at least a sign that Peloton could be up for sale. Uber will also have an investor day on Thursday morning following its report, which will be closely watched.

The other big story to watch across this earnings season is the impact of inflation on different companies. We have companies from the materials sector, consumer goods and food, and healthcare reporting, all of which should add to the picture of how widespread inflation is and whether there are signs of easing ahead, whether supply-chain related or otherwise.

Diplomatic efforts and military maneuvering is set to continue between Russia and Ukraine as well as Western countries. Reuters reports that French President Emmanuel Macron is set to visit Russia to speak with President Vladimir Putin Monday and Tuesday, while the Washington Post reports that U.S. President Joe Biden is scheduled to meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday. This comes after reports of a briefing given by the Biden administration to U.S. congress officials that Russia has built up 70% of the necessary force to invade Ukraine entirely, though the briefing did not affirm that would be Russia’s final decision.
The stakes for Ukraine and then Russia and the broader geopolitical landscape are significant, and from the market perspective, the price of Oil – which crossed the $90/barrier for the first time since 2014 as it continues its recent ascent – and natural gas will be in focus and susceptible to any resolution or escalation.

Cryptocurrencies were an asset class that appreciated the turn of the calendar page. After losing nearly 20% in January, Bitcoin has risen nearly 8% in February, and Ethereum has risen nearly 12%.
As ever, the question is what will be the incremental driver of price performance in the sector. The rebound has timed pretty closely with the Nasdaq’s (at least temporary) bottom from the January correction, suggesting that crypto performance – and maybe tech stocks too? – is just an output of risk appetite. With another part of the rationale for bitcoin, at least, being its use as an inflation hedge, the CPI report may have be the next catalyst, for higher or for lower.

QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador expects to pull together a trade deal with China at the end of this year and will begin formal debt re-negotiations with the Asian country, Ecuadorean President Guillermo Lasso said on Saturday, after a Beijing visit with his counterpart Xi Jinping.
China became Ecuador's top lender over the last decade, with millions of dollars in long-term credit tied to the handover of crude oil, large investments in hydro-electric and mining projects and other loans.
""In China we had a productive meeting with President Xi Jinping,"" Lasso posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""We achieved great results in commercial openings, cooperation in health and debt re-negotiation."" 
At the meeting the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding meant to pave the way for a trade deal at the end of the year, which would benefit Ecuadorean exports of shrimp, bananas, cacao, other fruit and minerals.
China said on Sunday the two countries have agreed to open negotiations for a free-trade pact. The commerce ministry, in a statement on its website, offered no details on the planned talks.
At the meeting on the sidelines of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, Xi said China and Ecuador should use negotiations on the free trade agreement as an opportunity to deepen practical cooperation between the two countries, China's Xinhua news agency said.
Xi was quoted as expressing hope that Ecuador would continue to provide a fair business environment for Chinese companies to invest and operate in Ecuador, while saying China would continue to help Ecuador fight COVID-19.
Lasso, who took office in May, has said more trade and foreign investment are key to stimulating the South American country's COVID-battered and liquidity-poor economy.
""It would increase the market by nearly $1 billion more in export opportunities,"" commerce minister Julio Jose Prado said during a virtual press conference. ""And that will mean we could almost be doubling the exports we make to China in various products.""
The countries have agreed their finance ministries will conduct initial talks on debt re-negotiation, as Ecuador seeks to improve its payment periods and interest rates.

Ecuador is also seeking to disconnect the handover of crude from outstanding debts with Chinese banks worth some $2.08 billion, according to foreign minister Juan Carlos Holguin, which would free up some $400 million per year in potential spending.
China will donate 2.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for inoculation of 3- to 5-year-olds, the Ecuadorean government added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will sign an executive order on Friday requiring ""project labor agreements"" in federal construction projects over $35 million, a potential boost to workers and unions that negotiate these deals, and a shift the administration says will speed up building times. 
The order will apply to $262 billion in federal construction contracting and impact nearly 200,000 workers, the White House said late on Thursday, confirming news first reported by Reuters.
Project labor agreements are collective bargaining agreements between building trade unions and contractors, which set wages, employment conditions, and dispute resolution on specific projects. Democratic presidents in the past have typically supported applying such agreements to the massive U.S. federal contracting budget, while Republican presidents have rescinded them.
The order, which will go into effect immediately, comes on the heels of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law by Biden that invests in the country's roads, ports and bridges. 
Much of that money will flow through federal agencies to states and local governments. The new executive order excludes projects funded by grants to non-federal agencies, a senior administration official said, adding that will make up for a bulk of the projects under the bill. But it will apply to billions of other federal spending on waterways, military bases and other areas.
The White House said Biden would visit Ironworkers Local 5 in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, Friday to sign the new executive order, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh.
The U.S. construction industry - including workers, owners, developers, contractors - has been one of the hardest hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to a slowdown of available goods and labor and the termination of entire projects.
Biden has vowed to strengthen unions and increase membership in the United States after years of steady decline, and to increase salaries for hourly workers in construction, health care and other jobs. 
""Contractors who offer lower wages or hire less qualified workers will need to raise their standards to compete with other high-wage, high-quality companies,"" the order says, according to a draft viewed by Reuters. Earlier executive action by Biden requires federal contractors in new or extended contracts to pay a $15 per hour minimum wage.

Biden's move won praise from some contractors.
""This streamlines the negotiation process and gives employers access to a highly skilled pool of craftworkers,"" Daniel Hogan, chief executive of the Association of Union Constructors, that represents 1800 contractor companies, told Reuters.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's nominees to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors have completed their first official step in the confirmation process with nomination hearings before the Senate Banking Committee. 
Here's what's next for the new leadership of the U.S. central bank as it girds for its battle with high inflation. 
THIS WEEKEND: FED CHAIR POWELL'S TERM EXPIRES 
Jerome Powell's four-year term as Fed chair ends this weekend. On Friday, the Fed's board appointed him chair pro tempore, effective Saturday, so he can continue to carry out his job while the Senate considers his renomination.
The last time a Fed chief's term expired before a Senate confirmed a new term was in 1996. The Fed's board voted to appoint Alan Greenspan as chair pro tempore on Friday, March 1 of that year, the last business day before his term expired. The Senate confirmed his third term as Fed chair on June 20, 1996.
Powell remains in charge of monetary policy. In January, he was reelected as chair of the Federal Open Market Committee by the members of the policy-setting panel, the Fed said on Friday. 
FEB 15: SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE VOTE
Former Federal Reserve Governor Sarah Bloom Raskin, Michigan State University's Lisa Cook, and Davidson College's Philip Jefferson had their confirmation hearings on Thursday. Hearings on Powell's renomination as chair and the elevation of Fed Governor Lael Brainard to the post of Fed vice chair were held in January.
Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the committee's chair, has set Feb. 15 for the committee vote on all five nominees. The panel's membership is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. 
During the hearings at least one Republican, and in some cases more than one, indicated support for the nominations of Powell, Brainard, Jefferson and Cook, signaling those four could be ""reported favorably"" for confirmation consideration to the full Senate. 
The outlook for Raskin, Biden's pick for vice chair of supervision, was less clear. ""She tried to convince Republicans that she would not be heavy-handed, but I don't think she was very successful,"" said Derek Tang, an economist at LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics. 
If the committee ""fails to report favorably"" on any nominee, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer can have the full Senate vote on ""discharging"" the Senate banking panel from considering Raskin's nomination further. A confirmation vote could be held a week or so later, once a couple other technical procedures are complete. The process was used last fall to move forward on the stalled nomination of Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Director Rohit Chopra. 
DATE TO BE ANNOUNCED: CONFIRMATION 
Brown has said he has spoken to Schumer about getting the Fed nominations quickly to the Senate floor. 
With the Senate split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, the Fed nominees may find their fates hinge on the vote of Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia. Asked earlier this week for his views, Manchin said the nominees were ""extremely qualified,"" but the rest of his response indicated he was referring to potential nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court, not the Fed. 
Manchin has said he is concerned about inflation. Cook, Jefferson and Raskin all said they viewed fighting inflation to be the top job for the Fed. Manchin also opposes aggressive climate action, which is what Republicans say Raskin's confirmation would mean. 
One further twist: the vote may also depend on attendance. 
President Donald Trump's attempt to get his one-time economic adviser and controversial Fed nominee Judy Shelton confirmed failed in 2020 in part because a couple of Republicans were quarantining due to COVID-19 exposure and could not come to the Senate floor to vote.
Senator Ben Ray Luján, a Democrat from New Mexico, suffered a stroke last week, and his absence has already forced the postponement of several nominations. His recovery will reportedly take four to six weeks, putting off the earliest likely confirmation vote on the Fed nominees until March. 

WHAT ABOUT POWELL'S UPDATE TO CONGRESS?
The Fed chief typically gives Congress a monetary policy update in February and November each year. But even if that testimony is delayed at this critical moment in U.S. monetary policy, the Fed chair pro tempore has plenty of other venues by which to get out his message. 
 
"
420,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 03:08PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Jerome Powell will become interim Federal Reserve chair on Saturday, ensuring continuity in leadership at the U.S. central bank while his renomination by U.S. President Joe Biden awaits Senate action. 
""The Federal Reserve Board on Friday named Jerome H. Powell as Chair Pro Tempore, pending Senate confirmation to a second term as Chair of the Board of Governors,"" the Fed said in a statement Friday. ""The action, effective February 5, enables him to continue to carry out his duties as Chair after the expiration of his term on the same day, and while the confirmation process is underway.""
A Senate Banking committee vote on the renomination of Powell and on four other Fed nominees is set for Feb. 15. The full Senate is to consider the nominations at some point after that.
The last time a Fed chair's term expired before the Senate confirmed a new term was in 1996. Alan Greenspan served as Fed chair pro tempore from March 3 to June 20.

Powell began his four-year term as Fed chair on Feb. 5, 2018. Biden announced his renomination in November, and at a January hearing, Senate Banking committee members from both sides of the aisle said they will support him for another term. 
Powell remains in charge of monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee separately named him as its chair at its January meeting, the Fed said Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Friday it has appointed Germany's former Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann to lead a new external panel to strengthen institutional safeguards in the wake of a data scandal involving IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva during her time at the World Bank.
The IMF expert panel will conduct an independent review to identify ""how the Fund can ensure that it has in place robust and effective channels for complaint, dissent and accountability,"" the IMF said in a statement.
It added the work includes reviewing the Fund's current framework for addressing complaints applicable to IMF managing director and executive board officials.
The external panel was formed as a part of efforts to strengthen research and institutional safeguards that included a new IMF Executive Board steering group formed in December, about two months after the board cleared Georgieva of any wrongdoing in the World Bank data-rigging scandal following a weeks-long review.
Georgieva was accused in September of putting ""undue pressure"" on World Bank staff in 2017, when she was the lender’s CEO, to alter data in its flagship ""Doing Business"" report to boost China’s ranking. 
The allegations were published in the investigation report of a law firm hired by the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors, but vigorously denied by Georgieva. A second report on the incident is expected in coming months.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who supported the IMF keeping Georgieva in her job, had called for ""proactive steps"" to reinforce the IMF's credibility.
Appointment of the external panel comes two days after Reuters reported that an initial sentence critical of Japan's continued financing of high-emission coal projects was deleted from the final published version of a staff mission statement on the Japanese economy, irritating climate activists.
Weidmann, a critic of the European Central Bank's ultra easy monetary policy, stepped down from the Bundesbank in October, five years before the end of his term. He was previously the board chairman of the Bank for International Settlements and an economic advisor to former German chancellor Angela Merkel.
Other members of the panel include:
-- Susan Raines, professor at Kennesaw State University's School of Conflict Management , Peacebuilding and Development in Georgia.

-- Olufemi Elias, a judge in the Islamic Development Bank's Administrative Tribunal and law professor at Queen Mary University of London
-- Ruben Lamdany, a panel advisor who is a former deputy director of the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office and a former World Bank senior economist.

LONDON (Reuters) -Two top Bank of England officials stressed on Friday the need for restraint on pay rises, drawing an icy reaction from unions and government, a day after the BoE sought to head off inflation running at a 30-year high by raising interest rates again.
Governor Andrew Bailey said rising wage pressure threatened the BoE's ability to keep a grip on inflation, even as households faced the biggest calendar year squeeze on their incomes since at least 1990.
""I'm not saying nobody gets a pay rise, don't get me wrong, but I think, what I am saying, is we do need to see restraint in pay bargaining otherwise it will get out of control,"" Bailey told BBC radio in an interview broadcast on Friday.
""We are looking, I think, to see quite clear restraint in the bargaining process because otherwise, as I say, it will get out of control. It's not at the moment, but it will do.""
Asked about Bailey's comments, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said: ""Well, it's not something the Prime Minister's calling for - we obviously want a high growth economy and we want people's wages to increase.""
Finance minister Rishi Sunak on Thursday said it was not his job to set private-sector wages, but that the right way to achieve higher wages was through greater productivity.
Britain's largest trade union, Unite, said working people were not to blame for the rising energy costs driving inflation.
""Workers don't need lectures from the Governor of the Bank of England on exercising pay restraint. Why is it that every time there is a crisis, rich men ask ordinary people to pay for it?,"" Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham (NYSE:GHM), said.
Bailey received a salary package and pension benefits worth 575,538 pounds ($779,278) last year.
The hit to ordinary households' living standards is posing a major challenge to Johnson, who is also battling to keep his job after criticisms over social events in Downing Street during lockdown.
Sunak announced measures to ease the hit from a 54% leap in energy costs in April, when higher social security contributions are also due to kick in.
BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill, asked by Bloomberg Television if he agreed with Bailey's call for a slowdown in pay increases, said: ""You're not going to get me to criticise my boss,"" before echoing some of the concerns.
""A key assumption in our forecast... is that we don't see from the middle of next year, persistence emerging in wage and domestic cost developments, stemming from these second-round effects,"" Pill said.
""It's that lack of that, the fact that policies including monetary policy do enough to avoid that, that is central to bringing our inflation back towards target. If we were to see developments that were not consistent with that assumption, then of course, we would have to think about further action."" 
On Thursday the BoE raised borrowing costs for the second time in two months, taking its Bank Rate to 0.5%. Nearly half its policymakers wanted a bigger increase to 0.75%.
The BoE said consumer price inflation - which was 5.4% in December - was set to hit around 7.25% in April on the back of surging energy costs before dropping, and post-tax income for working households would fall by 2% this year.
Bailey said the BoE faced a ""very difficult balance"" to steer the economy between the pain of falling living standards and the fight to bring down inflation.
The BoE on Thursday flagged further modest tightening ""in the coming months.""
Investors on Friday added to their bets on borrowing costs rising at the BoE's next meetings with rate futures pointing to Bank Rate hitting 1.0% by May and almost 1.5% as soon as August. 

The Bank Rate stood at 0.75% before the pandemic swept Europe, which prompted the BoE to cut it to all-time low of 0.1%.

(Reuters) - Poorer 'emerging market' countries are facing the headwind of rising global interest rates this year, which in the past has prompted international investors and their capital to up anchor and sail out.
The issue is that when big developed economies like the United States jack up rates, the returns on investments like government and corporate bonds and higher interest rates offered by developing countries no longer look quite so worth the extra risk.
And financial markets now expect U.S. interest rates - which tend to drive EM borrowing costs - to go up 5 times this year and some Wall Street analysts are even predicting seven.
The last time that happened within such a short window was August 2005 to June 2006. The 10-year Treasury yield is now at 1.85% from just over 1.5% at the start of the year, which has pushed up EM rates. The average cost for an emerging market government to borrow in its own currency is now almost 6%.
(Graphic: EM sovereign bond yields, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjvqkawwlvx/Pasted%20image%201643738218207.png) 
The International Monetary Fund has made a point of warning developing economies to prepare for potential bouts of turbulence if U.S. rates go up rapidly and/or if the coronavirus pandemic worsens again.
It also says that those with strong inflation pressures or weak institutions should be ready to let their currencies drop and raise their own interest rates. 
Brazil's real, Colombia's peso and, in eastern Europe the Czech crown and Hungarian forint, have all risen this year as their central banks have raised interest rates. 
(Graphic: Performance of emerging countries' currencies this year, https://graphics.reuters.com/EMERGING-ECONOMIES/EMERGING-ECONOMIES/klpykmqdapg/chart.png) 
These charts show some of the other metrics which traditionally make a developing country vulnerable to rising global interest rates.
1/ DEFICIT NUMBER 1
Colombia, Chile and Egypt have the biggest current account deficits as percentage of their gross domestic product (GDP), according to data from Oxford Economics, which makes them more likely to borrow the money to pay for their imports. 
(Graphic: Emerging markets' current account balance ( % of GDP ), https://graphics.reuters.com/EMERGING-ECONOMIES/EMERGING-ECONOMIES/lgpdwxoemvo/chart.png) 
2/ DEFICIT NUMBER 2 
Colombia, South Africa and Thailand have the biggest budget deficits, meaning they have to borrow more to fill the gap.

3/ ORIGINAL SINNERS
Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Hungary have higher levels of dollar and other 'hard currency' debt, making up more than 80% of their GDP. Borrowing in another country's currency is described by economists as the 'original sin' as a falling local currency can make it very expensive to pay back that debt very quickly.

4/ RESERVE JUDGEMENT
Argentina, Qatar and Egypt are among the countries with the lowest stockpiles of foreign exchange reserves which can be used to bolster domestic currencies and pay for goods, if needed.

5/ PAINFUL PAYMENTS 
Sri Lanka spends far more than it brings in in taxes and other revenues just paying the interest on its debt, let alone the underlying amount. Ghana uses 44% of its revenues while Egypt, Pakistan and Kenya use 30%-40%.
(Graphic: Drowning in debt, https://graphics.reuters.com/EMERGING-DEBT/zjvqkanzrvx/chart.png) 
6/ GET REAL
In real effective exchange rate terms (REER), the Brazilian real and Colombian peso are currently trading at a more than 20% discount to their 10-year averages, according to Bank of International Settlements data. In contrast, the Czech crown's REER is at a 10% premium. 
(Graphic: Emerging markets' real effective exchange rates, https://graphics.reuters.com/EMERGING-ECONOMIES/EMERGING-ECONOMIES/gdpzynmaevw/chart.png) 
REER is calculated on a trade-weighted basis against a basket of currencies and adjusted for inflation.
Economists say that higher and lower REERs are misalignments and both come with associated risks. 

In the case of higher REERs, the risk could be economic overheating, excess and unhedged borrowing and excess capital inflows, analysts at DBS explain. With lower REERs the risk would include high imported inflation, loss of purchasing power, and external debt service difficulties.

(Reuters) - Bigger-than-expected U.S. job gains last month are fueling market bets that the Federal Reserve will kick off its interest rate hikes in March with a hefty half-point jump. 
That's likely a bridge too far, given what Fed policymakers have said, where the jobs market is now, and what history suggests. But they do cement expectations that the Fed will raise rates at most of its remaining seven meetings this year as it moves to battle high inflation without undermining the labor market recovery.
Interest-rate futures traders largely expect Fed policymakers to raise the target range of the overnight borrowing rate between banks by a quarter-of-a-percentage point, to 0.25%-0.50%. But they are also pricing in a 31% chance of a bigger, half-point rate hike
That's up from about a 13% chance priced in before the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported employers added 467,000 jobs in January. The job gains surpassed even the most optimistic of economist estimates in a Reuters poll; most had expected that the surge in COVID-19 cases would dent demand for workers.
But the report suggested the opposite, as average hourly wages rose 5.7% from a year earlier, and the number of people employed or looking for work increased, a metric closely watched as a sign of labor market health. There are still 2.8 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic hit the U.S. economy in March 2020, but the jobs gap is narrowing steadily.
(Graphic: The jobs hole facing Biden and the Fed, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/JOBS/jbyprzlrqpe/chart.png) 
Since the 1990s, when the Fed is considered to have largely tamed inflation, 50 basis-point hikes have been the exception and have never been used to start a tightening cycle.
To St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, one of the Fed's most strident supporters of earlier and faster policy tightening, it wasn't clear what starting with a bigger bang would accomplish.
Since late last year markets have been tightening financial market conditions on their own, anticipating Fed actions that have not been taken yet. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose Friday to 1.9%, the highest it's been in over two years. 
(Graphic: Financial conditions tighten, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/FINANCIALCONDITIONS/byvrjxmabve/chart.png) 
At this point ""It is not clear what you are buying with a 50 basis point move,"" Bullard told Reuters Tuesday. ""In a way we have done a lot of the work already and I am not sure it behooves us to do a dramatic funds rate increase"" in March. 
But the January data might cause the Fed to reassess somewhat. Policymakers had expected the recent surge of coronavirus cases to at least slow hiring. Instead the economy powered through and wages continued rising. 
Labor force participation, which the Fed had worried might be permanently stuck low, rose to 62.2%. 
(Graphic: Labor market progress, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/FEDPROGRESS/yzdvxmmmdpx/chart.png) 
Several industries, including transportation and retail, today employ more people than they did before the pandemic, though the workforce in the leisure and hospitality industry - hit harder than other sectors - remains 10% below its pre-pandemic level. 
(Graphic: Jobs by industry, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INDUSTRY/qmypmdoolvr/chart.png) 
The strong January hiring - along with big upward revisions for past months - ""completely changes the narrative about the labor market and the broader economy,"" writes Jefferies' Aneta Markowska. 

""What looked like a summer surge followed by a winter freeze, now looks like a very steady growth momentum that's not abating at all,"" Markowska wrote. That could signal the Fed may need to continue its tightening cycle well into 2023 and even 2024 to keep a grip on inflation, she said. Others agreed.
""We still think that a slowdown in first-quarter GDP growth will persuade officials to start slow, although they could project a bigger cumulative tightening over the next few years,"" economists at Capital Economics said after the jobs report.

425,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 01:05PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The economists got it wrong. Again.
After some estimates called for U.S. payrolls to decline by as much as 400,000, the labor market shockingly added that many jobs in January -- and then some. It’s not just last month: the median estimate has missed by an average of about 95,000 in the past year before revisions, versus less than 20,000 in the six months through March 2020.
Forecasting throughout the pandemic has proven to be a constant challenge -- economists have had to balance traditional indicators like job openings that are backward-looking, with high-frequency data like daily coronavirus cases that can be extremely volatile. But in January, economists underestimated how much businesses would retain workers and overestimated how many workers would drop off payrolls due to omicron.
“The January employment report is a crazy mess, but not in the ways that were expected,” Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, said in a note.
Most economists -- including those at the Federal Reserve and White House officials -- were bracing for a weak, or even negative payrolls print, due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. If the strong relationship between infections and employment held true, 2.3 million Americans would have lost their jobs in January, ZipRecruiter Chief Economist Julia Pollak said in a note.
Other indicators leading up to Friday also pointed to an impending doomsday. Jobless claims recorded during the employment report’s reference week surged the most in nearly 10 months, while ADP Research Institute data showed companies shed 301,000 employees in January, the most since April 2020.
Even if the negative projections came to fruition, most economists said the report would have done little to sway the Fed, which is expected to hike interest rates next month by 0.25 percentage point to curb the fastest inflation in nearly 40 years. The upside surprise, as well as a jump in hourly wages, only reinforced investors’ conviction further, and added to bets that the central bank would proceed with a half-point move.
One reason for the January payrolls advance was the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ seasonal adjustment, which helps account for employers dismissing workers hired for the holiday season. But in this case, especially in service sectors hit hard by omicron, businesses held onto employees due to the tight labor market.
“January is by far the biggest month for layoffs as seasonal work ends and schools close for winter break,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. economists Sarah House and Michael Pugliese said in a note. They had forecast a payrolls decline of 100,000. “However, with many businesses already understaffed, employers let go fewer workers than usual.”
The job gains were broad-based, led by a 151,000 advance in leisure and hospitality. Transportation and warehousing, retail trade and professional and business services also posted solid increases.
Economists also famously got it wrong in April 2021 when they thought rising vaccinations would lead to more people returning to the workforce, and helping explain a forecast for a 1 million jump in payrolls. But the U.S. only added 266,000 jobs that month. Projections were overly optimistic about November too, overshooting payrolls by more than twofold.
Another quirk in January’s report was revisions to reflect updated population estimates used in the household survey. Had it not been for those controls, the number of employed Americans would have dropped by 272,000, according to the Labor Department. 
By the same token, the participation rate -- the share of the population that is working or looking for work -- would have been unchanged from December, rather than the registered 0.3 percentage point increase.
Despite the better-than-expected headline payrolls figure, the impact of omicron on the labor market in January was significant. There were 3.6 million employed Americans not at work due to illness, more than double that in December. At the same time, 6 million people were unable to work in the month because their employer closed or lost business due to the pandemic, roughly twice that in December.
“These absences do have a really big economic impact,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor. “It’s unclear how that will show up in the aggregate data, but is a trend to definitely keep an eye on.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday issued a set of recommendations to combat illicit finance in the high-value art market and warned that the emerging digital art market, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), may present new risks.
In a study published on Friday, the Treasury found that there is some evidence of money laundering risk in the high-value art market, but limited evidence of terrorist financing risk, the Treasury said in a statement.
It said that those most vulnerable in the market are businesses offering financial services that are not subject to anti-money laundering or countering terrorism financing obligations, warning that asset-based lending ""can be used to disguise the original source of funds and provide liquidity to criminals.""
A senior Treasury official told reporters next steps include engaging stakeholders such as those in Congress or in the industry to get their feedback, adding that the Treasury hopes the study will encourage industries to take additional steps to make it harder to launder illicit proceeds through the art market. The Treasury will give further thought as to whether additional regulatory steps are needed in this market, the official said.
The study also said that depending on the structure and market incentives, the digital art market, such as NFTs, may present new risks, as the characteristics of digital art make it vulnerable to money laundering.
NFTs are a form of crypto asset which exploded in popularity last year. All kinds of digital objects - from art to videos and even tweets - can be bought and sold as NFTs, which use unique digital signatures to ensure they are one-of-a-kind.
The study recommended the consideration of several options to address the risks, including updating training for law and customs enforcement, enhancing private sector information-sharing and applying anti-money laundering and countering terrorism financing requirements to certain participants in the art market.

But it said that the multi-billion-dollar industry, compared to other sectors that pose terrorist financing and money laundering risk, should not be an immediate focus for the imposition of requirements to combat the illicit financing.
Most art market participants are currently not subject to anti-money laundering or counter terrorism financing requirements, though the study said that several qualities inherent to art and the high-value market make it attractive for money laundering.

(Reuters) - From Hershey to Clorox (NYSE:CLX) and Kleenex maker Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), major consumer-products companies have announced plans to boost U.S. prices further or more broadly than previously proposed this year, signaling that the fastest inflation rate in a generation may not ebb soon.
Product makers generally hold conversations with U.S. retailers at year-end about price hikes planned for the following year. But company executives disclosed during recent quarterly results that they are taking a more aggressive approach this year to protect margins. 
Clorox late on Thursday said it plans to raise prices on 85% of its products by the end of June, up from a previously planned 70%, with some of the company's brands set for multiple rounds of price hikes. 
CFO Kevin Jacobsen said its executives are ""having conversations with retailers"" about additional price increases that would go into effect during the next two quarters, beyond those previously disclosed in October. 
""We stand prepared to take more pricing (action) if necessary,"" Jacobsen said. ""We want to see how inflation will play out this fiscal year,"" which ends June 30, 2022.
Chocolate maker Hershey said it would raise prices further in the first half of 2022 in the United States on top of price increases that will go into effect in the first quarter ended March 31, 2022. Its executives didn't quantify the price hikes. Hershey also said it expects its gross profit margins to fall in 2022 despite its new plans to raise prices.
Kimberly-Clark said last week it would undertake more price increases -- following four rounds of price hikes in 2021 -- as pulp, labor and transportation costs continue to bite.
Consumer packaged goods companies also have pulled back on some of the discounts they are offering consumers, adding to the effect of price hikes. 
Food products such as frozen snacks and refrigerated meals have seen the biggest drop in promotions offered to customers in the week ending Jan. 23 compared to last year, according to an index from data analytics firm IRI.
""With supply constraints, there is no point in promoting,” said Krishnakumar Davey, the president of client engagement at IRI. ""Promotions have come down a bit from COVID.""
Pandemic-driven supply-and-demand imbalances have pushed up prices on everything from Big Macs to household staples, which caused the U.S. inflation rate in 2021 to climb at its fastest pace in nearly four decades. 
The comments from executives on post-earnings calls show that firms are grappling with higher costs on nuts and vegetable oils, surfactants and plastics as global supply chain glitches linger. Transportation and labor costs are also up. 
The average adjusted operating margin of the eight biggest publicly traded U.S beverage companies fell to 25.7% in 2021from 26.4% in 2020, according to Citi. Among the top U.S. household product companies, average pre-tax margins fell to 19.4% in 2021 from 19.6%-- with  Kimberly Clark , Clorox and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) all seeing their margins hit. Among food companies, average margins fell to 17.2% from 17.3%, with Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), McCormick (NYSE:MKC) & Co and  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) all seeing margins slide.
At Clorox, Jacobsen described an ""extreme level of cost inflation."" The bleach maker cut its full-year earnings forecast and said it expects its full-year gross margin to shrink by about 750 basis points.
""I do think it's going to take several years for us to rebuild margin (to pre-pandemic levels),"" Jacobsen said on a call with analysts. 
Cadbury Chocolate and Oreo cookies maker Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) International last month disclosed that there could be ""multiple pricing waves"" this year to keep up with inflation. Colgate said it was fast tracking a round of price hikes to the first half instead of the second half of the year. 
Colgate CEO Noel Wallace said sales volumes will ""fall off"" when shoppers understand that they have to pay more. He said the declines will be seen by all companies and across categories, not just Colgate.
Food companies McCormick and  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) also flagged this week that they expect consumer sensitivity to price changes to increase over the next few months.

At Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), executives said they had informed retailers about increases planned for fabric care products like Tide detergent and Downy dryer sheets to take effect on Feb. 28. In mid-April, the company plans to raise prices on some of its personal healthcare products, they said. 
The consumer goods behemoth so far hasn't lost market share where it implemented price hikes, executives said. Despite commodity-led price hikes, shoppers traded up to more expensive Tide pods over its cheaper liquid detergent.

429,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 08:41AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world's top central banks are about to embark on ""the largest quantitative tightening in history"", analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said on Friday, estimating that $2.2 trillion worth of support would disappear over the next 12 months.
A surge in global inflation is forcing the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and Bank of England to reel in the support measures used during the coronavirus pandemic.
The Fed is now expected to hike U.S. interest rates five times this year, which would be the fastest since 2005-06. This week has also seen the BoE raise its rates for the second time in three months, while the ECB has fanned bets that it will deliver its first hike in a decade.

""G4 central bank balance sheets will peak in May,"" Morgan Stanley's analysts said, adding the $2.2 trillion reduction they expected would be 4.5 times larger that in 2018 when the around $500 billion was lost.
""We forecast the European Central Bank's balance sheet to actually shrink faster than the Fed's from May 2022 to May 2023, given less liquidity via TLTROs,"" they said referring to ECB's ultra-cheap and unlimited funding provision to euro zone banks.

FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - In just a few short weeks, the balance of power at the world's top central banks has shifted to conservatives, heralding the biggest wave of policy tightening in years. 
Yet the rapid retreat of doves in the face of sky-high inflation increases the risk of a policy error as economic fundamentals are not changing as fast as policy sentiment. 
The problem is that central banks are under social and political pressure to deal with soaring prices that sap household incomes, erode wealth and dominate the news cycle. 
But monetary policy is ineffective in curbing near-term price pressures and action now will only start to take effect when inflation is likely to be retreating sharply anyway. 
Still, the European Central Bank put a 2022 rate hike on the table on Thursday and the Bank of England raised rates a quarter percent with a big minority pushing for an exceptionally big 50 basis point interest rate hike. 
These moves came just days after the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled a series of rate increases, with the first one likely coming next month, possibly followed by three more moves this year.
With the ECB joining the hawkish camp, the Bank of Japan remains by far the biggest outlier, not even contemplating policy tightening as inflation there remains stuck below target.
""Central banks cannot ignore something that has attracted this much popular attention,"" Paul Donovan an economist at UBS Global Wealth Management said. 
""The result has been a rather difficult ballet, trying to stress that they still realize inflation is worthy of attention but at the same time suggesting it's not a problem that requires an urgent policy response,"" he said. ""None of the major central banks seem to have got the ballet quite right.""
ECB chief Christine Lagarde gave the social consideration an important nod on Thursday.
""We know that the burden is first and foremost borne by those who are most vulnerable, most exposed and who face the day-to-day hardship of having to put up with higher prices,"" she said. ""I can assure you that that concern was across the board and around the table in equal numbers."" 
ERROR?
To be sure, early action is not futile. 
Quick moves could prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched if companies, whose wage decisions influence future price moves, believe that central banks will not tolerate deviations from their target. 
Inflation is without a doubt painfully high. In the euro zone, it hit a record high of 5.1% last month and could still go higher, while in Britain, the peak could be over 7% later this year. 
But there is nothing monetary policy can do about global commodity prices like oil, gas and grains, the big drivers of inflation. 
And inflation will quickly retreat from its peak. In the euro zone, it could be back around 2% by near the turn of the year. In Britain it could take another year to get to the target but the drop in the second half of the year is still going to be rapid.
Given these limits on policy effectiveness, the swing in favour or policy hawks has been too big for some. 
""The doves have thrown the towel,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said.
""The risk of this ending up as another 'Trichet moment' is not zero,"" the bank said, referring to the ECB's 2011 rate hikes to temper a small inflation bump on the eve of the bloc's debt crisis, arguably the biggest policy error in the institution's history. 
Indeed, one ECB policymaker who asked not to be named, confirmed that policy doves, in the majority for over a decade, are dwindling in numbers.
""In March they (the hawks) will probably be a majority and we'll have to make a decision,"" he said. ""The first thing is to accelerate the tapering and only after we'll consider a rate hike.""
Some also see a similar risk at the Bank of England.
""The risk of a policy mistake is probably rising,"" UniCredit economist Daniel Vernazza said. 
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey attempted to temper expectations, warning that while further rate hikes are possible, investors should not get ""carried away"" and he stressed the ""very difficult balance"" facing the central bank.

That message was mixed for some, appearing as though the bank was trying to cater to several interests at the same time. 
""It came across as an awkward attempt to be hawkish and dovish at the same time, with the bank seeming to be caught between fear of the 1970s redux and of amplifying a slowdown driven by a record squeeze on real disposable income and driving the UK economy into recession,"" analysts at consultancy Evercore said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Automaker Volvo Cars and battery manufacturer Northvolt will build their joint battery plant in Gothenburg, western Sweden, the two companies said on Friday.
The new 50-gigawatt-hour (GWh) plant will create up to 3,000 jobs and make battery cells specifically developed for use in pure electric Volvo and Polestar cars, the Sweden-based companies said. Operations will begin in 2025.
The two companies said last year they would form a joint venture to develop batteries, including setting up a gigafactory for production and an research and development centre, a total investment of about 30 billion crowns ($3.3 billion).
Northvolt and Volvo said former Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) executive Adrian Clarke had been appointed to lead the production company. 
""He comes with a long experience from Tesla as well as around how to build these type of factories,"" Northvolt CEO Peter Carlsson, who also previously worked for Tesla, told Reuters.
Volvo Cars head of engineering and operations, Javier Varela, said access to fossil-free energy, skills and infrastructure had been factors for choosing Gothenburg, Volvo's hometown.
Competition for talent is fierce, with most battery engineers based in Asia. Tesla and Asian companies such as LG and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI are also setting up factories in Europe.
Northvolt's gigafactory in the Swedish town of Skelleftea assembled its first battery cell at the end of December, making it the first European company to design and manufacture a battery in Europe.
Carlsson said it was running as planned, although he said global supply-chain problems, semiconductor shortages and the COVID-19 had made it more of a challenge. ""It has not been the easiest of times,"" he said.
Volvo Cars, majority owned by China's Geely Holding, aims to sell 50% pure electric cars by the middle of this decade and fully electric cars only by 2030.

Northvolt, whose biggest shareholder is Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), has so far receive more than $30 billion worth of contracts from customers such as BMW, Fluence, Scania, Volkswagen, Volvo Cars and Polestar.

LONDON (Reuters) -Investment banks brought forward their calls on European Central Bank interest rate hikes after a hawkish turn from the ECB that opened the door to the possibility of increased borrowing costs this year.
With euro zone inflation at a record high in January, ECB President Christine Lagarde declined to repeat her past comment that a 2022 rate hike was very unlikely at a news conference following the bank's policy meeting on Thursday.
Sources told Reuters after the meeting that a decision to dial back stimulus now looked likely in March, starting with a faster-than-expected wind-down of the bank's bond purchases, which according to ECB guidance need to end before rate hikes.
The updated calls brought banks somewhat more in line with market pricing. Adding to a sharp repricing on Thursday, money markets moved on Friday to price in a first, 10 basis-point (bps) rate rise by June 2022 and 50 bps worth of hikes by December.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said on Friday that they expected the ECB to raise interest rates by 25 bps each in September and December, putting the bank's policy rate at 0% by the end of the year.
Policymakers would decide in March to end the asset purchase programme by June and raise its deposit rate by 25 bps each in September and December, they forecast.
""Following large upside inflation surprises and yesterday's hawkish policy pivot, we now look for a substantially earlier ECB exit,"" strategists at the U.S. investment bank said in a note, where they also revised their inflation forecasts higher.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), BofA and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) also amended their forecasts late on Thursday to expect lift-off to start in September with two, 25 basis-point hikes by the end of the year, and expecting bond purchases to end in the second or third quarter. 
Others, such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Danske Bank, were slightly more cautious, expecting only one 25 bps rate hike in December.
ING and Citi economists also said they saw room for one rate hike this year.
Banks, however, diverged on how far the ECB could hike rates after a move this year.
After two hikes this year, Goldman Sachs expected a pause until June 2023, followed by hikes every six months until a terminal rate at 1.25% in June 2025. 

BNP Paribas expected a further two hikes in 2023, with potential for further policy tightening thereafter. Deutsche Bank expected rates at 1% before end-2024. 
Commerzbank expected rate hikes to pause next year and only resume in the second half of 2024.

Investing.com -- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) put a trampoline under technology stocks, but U.S. markets are still set to open under pressure later. Markets bet on ECB rate hikes already by the end of the year, pushing the euro 2 cents higher against the dollar and Eurozone bond yields to multiyear highs. U.S. jobs data for January are due at 8:30 AM ET and Omicron suggests that the figures will be messy. And oil prices surge to new highs as Texas braces for a big freeze. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 4th February. 
1. Amazon's too-good-to-be-true Q4
Amazon stock rebounded sharply after reporting a quarter that was flattered by a one-off gain on its stake in electric van maker Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN). The $11.8 billion paper gain on Rivian, which went public in the fourth quarter, meant that net profit nearly doubled from a year ago. Rivian stock has fallen 40% since the end of the year, meaning that much of those gains will be reversed in the current quarter, absent a recovery in the EV-maker's performance.
Amazon Web Services continued to churn out cash, with an operating profit of over $5 billion, while the strength of its advertising business – broken out for the first time – also impressed. However, the company lost over $1.8 billion on its core e-commerce operations due to rising labor and transportation costs – something it aims to address with a 16% hike in its Prime subscription fee.
Amazon’s results may only partly allay fears that its pandemic-driven boom is fading: it sees operating income at between $3 billion and $6 billion in the current quarter, down from $8.9 billion a year ago.
2 Payrolls data due
The U.S. releases its official labor market report for January at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), two days after payrolls processor ADP indicated that private-sector employment actually fell by over 300,000 through the middle of last month.
ADP’s figures were heavily affected by the wave of Omicron-variant Covid-19, which hit the service sector disproportionately hard.  
Consensus forecasts, which predate the ADP’s release, are for a gain of 150,000 nonfarm jobs last month, down from 199,000 in December. Given the hit to employment will once again hit (relatively low-paid) service sector work, the risk is that the Omicron wave also translates into an upside surprise on average hourly earnings, which are expected to rise 0.5% on the month.  
3. Stocks set to open mostly lower, but Snap snaps back
Amazon – and, to a lesser degree, Snap and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) – are supporting NASDAQ futures in the overnight session, but U.S. stocks are set for a mixed opening later.
By 6:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 178 points, or 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.1%. Only NASDAQ 100 futures were up, rising 0.7%, and even that represents only a modest bounced after Thursday’s 3.7% drop in the NASDAQ Composite.
Snap stock was up more than 45% in premarket trading after it defied the general pessimism about long-duration tech stocks, posting its first-ever quarterly profit and seemingly putting problems with Apple’s new privacy settings behind it.
Other stocks likely to be in focus later include Ford Motor (NYSE:F), whose earnings fell short of expectations, and Clorox (NYSE:CLX), whose quarterly numbers were the latest to show some mean reversion after pandemic-era distortions.
4. Bonds tumble, euro rises as hawks are seen over Frankfurt 
Another factor weighing on global markets overnight has been the sharp repricing of euro interest rate risk, in response to ECB President Christine Lagarde’s press conference on Thursday. Money markets now imply 40 basis points of rate hikes from Frankfurt by year-end.
German benchmark 5-Year notes traded with a positive yield for the first time in nearly four years, while 10-Year yields touched a three-year high of 0.2%, while the euro has surged nearly 2 cents to $1.1466.
While the ECB’s statement had repeated that it doesn’t expect to raise interest this year, Lagarde pointedly avoided repeating that guidance in her press conference, acknowledging that inflation had risen further and was lasting longer than the bank had forecast, and appearing to set the stage for a shift in guidance at the bank’s meeting in March. 
5. Oil hits new highs ahead of Texas freeze
Oil prices roared above $90 a barrel on precautionary buying ahead of extreme winter weather that has been forecast for Texas.
Winter storms in Texas last year badly hit the state’s energy complex, freezing gas field well-heads and taking down power stations and transmission lines. So far, market operator ERCoT hasn’t reported any major disruptions, but it will need to bring some 10 gigawatts of largely gas-fired power online in the course of the morning to meet the expected demand surge.
U.S. crude futures meanwhile, were up 1.7% at $91.78 a barrel, while Brent crude futures were up 1.6% at $92.54, both having hit fresh eight-year highs earlier."
434,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 06:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill said the benchmark lending rate in the U.K. will probably rise again in the coming months and a squeeze on living standards is probably unavoidable.
Speaking on Bloomberg TV the day after the BOE increased interest rates to 0.5% in its second successive hike, Pill said the bank as working to ensure that the U.K. didn’t suffer so-called second-round effects from high inflation.
“As long as things play out broadly as we expect, we would expect to see a further modest tightening of monetary policy which would embrace a rise in bank rate,” Pill said in an interview Friday with Bloomberg Television. “Given the nature of the shock we’re facing, real incomes in the U.K. will suffer to some extent. That’s unavoidable.”
Some officials pushed for an even bigger move on Thursday, and markets responded by pricing in rises at three of the next four meetings. The degree of tightening priced in by markets, which would be the fastest since the BOE gained independence, comes as the central bank predicts inflation will hit 7.25% in April, and the U.K. faces a cost of living crisis that by one metric will leave incomes squeezed by the most in at least 30 years. 
Still, Pill cautioned that BOE forecasts showed inflation would drop below target in the future, and drew attention to Governor Andrew Bailey’s comments that markets shouldn’t get carried away.
Pill added that monetary policy can’t fix inequalities in society and said that the BOE’s best contribution would be to limit inflation, and also declined to criticize a suggestion from Bailey that workers should show restraint in asking for pay increases.
“Monetary policy can and should focus on ensuring that we don’t see a repeated attempt, which is inflation generating, by different groups, different,workers, firms etc to try and shift the burden of that shock onto others, like pushing up their wages, pushing up their margins,” he said."

SEOUL (Reuters) - Seoul's housing market, one of the most unaffordable in the world, has begun to show signs that its red-hot five-year boom could be running out of steam - just in time for the March presidential vote.
Housing is one of the biggest issues in the neck-and-neck election, with prices in the capital having doubled since 2017 when President Moon Jae-in first took office, leaving many millennials facing a lifetime of financial insecurity. 
An average apartment in Seoul, for instance, is estimated to cost around 18 years of South Korea's median annual household income, up from 11 years in 2017.
Recent data, however, has lent weight to the view that restrictions on loans, hikes in interest rates and pledges to massively boost the supply of homes by both presidential candidates have begun to have an effect.
South Korean residential property transactions plunged 62% in December to 53,774 from a year earlier - the smallest number for the month since 2008 when the market was battered by the global financial crisis.
Additionally, a weekly index for Seoul's apartment price growth edged 0.1% lower for the last week of January, the first decline in 20 months.
Analysts also note that there's been a natural lull in activity as people wait to see if the March 9 election will bring about changes to capital gains taxes and other levies.
""Loan restrictions and higher borrowing costs began to really cool the market towards the end of last year and even serious buyers and sellers are waiting for policy changes so we're in for a quiet market for months to come,"" said Yeo Kyoung-hui, a property market analyst at Real Estate 114.
""It's possible that we will see supply outpace demand going forward.""
A narrow majority, 51%, of some 500 property market experts expect South Korean home prices to decline this year, according to a survey by the Korea Development Institute in January. Around 30% see further price gains while the rest either expect no change or a year of both price increases and falls.
""A sharp downturn is unlikely, but it does look like the market has turned a corner with interest rates set to rise further,"" said Park Hab-soo, a professor of real estate studies at Konkuk University.
The election will pit Lee Jae-myung, chosen by the Democrats to succeed Moon, against Yoon Suk-yeol from the conservative People Power Party. Recent polls show they both have 35% of voter support.

Lee has sought to distance himself from Moon's property market policy failures and has pledged to build about 2.5 million homes through public housing. 
Yoon has made a similar pledge and has also promised to loosen curbs for first-time buyers so they can borrow up to 80% of a home's value. That compares with a current cap of 40% for those in the capital region.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Student budgets in Japan may come under pressure after Cup Noodle, a cheap meal long associated with late night study sessions, became the latest target of price rises in the land of its birth.
The one-two punch of global commodity inflation and a weak yen have spurred a wave of price rises among Japanese consumer staple makers, who have more often relied on ""shrinkflation"" - or smaller portion sizes - to pass rising costs onto their price-sensitive customers.
Nissin Foods Holdings Co Ltd on Thursday said it was raising the price of its signature Cup Noodle to 214 yen ($1.86) per regular package, up from 193 yen, effective from June - the first such increase in three years.
Cup Noodle was a 1971 fast-food innovation consisting of dry noodles, soup powder and ingredients such as vegetables or meat in a disposable cup that hurried consumers - students included - can prepare just by adding hot water. 
Cup Noodle rapidly became a hit round the world and remains the No. 1 brand of instant noodles in Japan, spokesman Kazuki Tsurumaru said.
With costs rising for transportation, wheat and wrapping materials, Nissin was left with no choice if it wanted to retain the brand value of its 50-year-old bestseller, Tsurumaru said, adding that Nissin has never shrunk the package size.
""Cup Noodle is a product with a certain set volume,"" he said.
""It wouldn't be good for us to cut that, so that customers said 'hey, there isn't so much shrimp,' or 'the noodles have decreased' or 'the flavour's thin.' That's a stance we at Nissin just fundamentally will not take."" 
Nissin also announced 5% to 12% price rises elsewhere in its instant food lineup, ranging from ramen to udon to tofu soup, targeting 70% of the company's around 270 products.
Nissin is not alone, with the price of beef bowls, margarine, scissors and many other everyday items going up recently as well.
Last month, the company making popular corn puff snack Umaibo jolted the country by raising its price from 10 yen to 12 yen a piece. It was the first hike since Umaibo's debut in 1979.
But Japanese noodle buyers can still consider themselves lucky. In the United States, Nissin has raised the price of Cup Noodles - as the product is known globally - twice in the last year.

The ECB kept policy unchanged on Thursday but finally acknowledged mounting inflation risks and even opened the door to an interest rate increase this year, in a turnaround for a bank that has kept policy ultra-easy for the past decade.
Inflation this year is seen at 3%, according to the ECB's Survey of Professional Forecasters, below the bank's own projection for 3.2%. In 2023, price growth could slow to 1.8%, the survey showed, in line with the ECB's own expectation.
Inflation in the 19-nation currency bloc hit a record high 5.1% last month, more than twice the ECB's 2% target and also well above projections, indicating that the bank is struggling to fully understand current price trends.
Responding to persistent overshoots in recent quarters, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that risks were now ""tilted to the upside"", suggesting that higher readings were still possible before a decline later in 2022. 

The survey, normally a key input in policy discussions, showed inflation then picking up to 1.9% in 2024 and to 2% in the longer-term, defined as 2026.
The survey also saw this year's economic growth at 4.2%, in line with the ECB's December projections. It is then seen slowing to 2.7%, below the 2.9% previously projected by ECB staff.

Wage growth is a crucial indicator for the ECB in assessing the future path of inflation and setting the timing of what would be its first rate hike in over a decade.
The ECB spoke to 74 large companies operating in the euro area outside the financial sector in mid-January, finding that labour market conditions were getting tighter and wages were rising or expected to do so after a near freeze in the past two years.
""Typically, contacts said they expected average wage increases to move from around 2% in the recent past to 3% or possibly more this year,"" the ECB said in a report.
""Significantly higher rates of wage inflation were described or anticipated in relation to those jobs for which it was a challenge to recruit and retain staff, for example in the fields of construction and road haulage and for IT experts and software engineers.""
The companies told the ECB that demand was strong or growing but they were struggling to meet it because of supply constraints, a side-effect of measures designed to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
Just under half of companies reported an increase in activity in the final quarter of last year, a smaller proportion than in the previous round of the survey three months ago. 
As for prices, the share of companies reporting an increase fell but remained greater than half of the total.

""Many contacts said that prices were being adjusted more frequently than in the past to avoid margins being squeezed and that prices would continue rising through much of 2022,"" the ECB said.
The ECB finally acknowledged mounting inflation risks at a policy meeting on Thursday and even opened the door a crack to an interest rate increase this year, marking a remarkable policy turnaround for one of the world's most dovish central banks.

1/PRICE POINT
Fears of a hawkish Federal Reserve brought a tumultuous start of 2022 for U.S. stocks - inflation data on Thursday could show is the concerns are fully justified.
January's U.S. consumer price index is expected to rise 0.4%, a Reuters poll shows. That's after 0.5% in December, culminating in the largest annual rise in nearly four decades.
Given that Fed Chair Jerome Powell has pledged a sustained battle to tame inflation, the U.S. central bank seems on course to hike interest rates in March. Analysts are upping rate calls; BofA for instance expects seven 25 basis points hikes this year.
How inflation is hitting corporate America's bottom line will be in focus too, as more fourth-quarter reports roll in, including from Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).

2/ HOT HOT HOT
The Bank of England now reckons Britain's inflation rate could top 7%, well above previous forecasts. No wonder nearly half of its policymakers wanted a bigger increase than the 25 bps hike they agreed on.
With a cost of living crisis a political issue, the government has set out a series of financial support schemes to take the sting out of rising energy prices. 
December industrial production data and a Q4 GDP estimate on Friday should provide a sense of how the economy is holding up.
Complicating the picture is a political crisis. Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces anger over a series of missteps, not least the alcohol-fuelled parties held at Downing Street during coronavirus lockdowns. The coming days could bring more clarity on his future. GRAPHIC: UK consumer confidence at its lowest since Feb 2021, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxoaxwjpx/GBTHEME.PNG 
3/ ""STREAMLINED, SAFE AND SPLENDID""
That's Chinese President Xi Jinping's promise for the Beijing Olympics. He could well have been referring to the yuan, this year's lone currency outperformer against a buoyant dollar. 
As China returns from a week-long Lunar New Year break, markets want to know if that outperformance can continue in the face of a growing monetary divergence between the world's top two economies. January was the strongest month for the yuan since 2017, but Chinese New Year often heralds a reversal. 
Yet other factors are at play: elevated commodity prices, curbs to contain Omicron and heavy foreign inflows into domestic bonds - all positive for China's trade surplus. And Russian President Vladimir Putin is in China for the Olympics, signing more than 15 agreements with Beijing. Both countries are keen on joint financial infrastructure to guard against sanctions from other countries. That probably calls for a strong yuan.

4/INDIAN DOVES TO DUCK OUT?
    India's inflation-targeting monetary policy committee has reiterated time and again it will remain supportive of growth until economic recovery is firmly entrenched. But the recent budget may force a rethink.
    Sticky inflation and improving confidence on the growth outlook may set the stage for the key lending rate to rise in the coming fiscal year.
    The Reserve Bank of India may kick off changes at its Wednesday, possibly by raising its borrowing rate in order to shrink the corridor with the lending rate. Investors will also listen out for the RBI's views on the budget and how it might help markets absorb a record 14.95 trillion rupees ($200 billion) in borrowing.

5/ STICKY OIL 
After a month of simmering geopolitical tensions and a 15% oil price surge, OPEC and its allies took a record-quick 16 minutes to decide that, after all, they would stick to previously planned output increases.

Crude prices are around seven-year highs of more than $90 a barrel due to fear of supply disruptions from a multitude of geopolitical flare-ups, above all, a possible Russia-Ukraine conflict. Europe is scrambling to find alternatives to Russian gas, while U.S. winter storms, at a time of general underproduction are an added problem.
Energy prices also risks turning into a political hot potato for governments. Having already contributed to record-high inflation, further price gains risk slowing growth momentum.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely rebounded in the final three months of 2021 as consumption rose during a drop off in COVID-19 cases, a Reuters poll showed, though it could slide back into contraction this quarter after a spike in Omicron variant infections. 
The poll also showed wholesale prices continued to rise in January from a year earlier, a sign higher energy and raw material costs will keep eroding corporate profits.
The world's third-largest economy likely grew an annualised 5.8% in October-December, rebounding from a 3.6% contraction in the third quarter, according to a median forecast of 18 economists polled by Reuters.
The increase was driven largely by a 2.2% rise in private consumption, which accounts for more than half of Japan's gross domestic product (GDP), the poll showed.
Capital expenditure likely gained 0.5%, while external demand added 0.3% point to GDP growth in October-December after neither adding nor shaving off the previous quarter's figures, the poll showed.
""Japan's economy clearly turned up in October-December, as foot traffic recovered thanks to the lifting of COVID-19 curbs and falling infection cases,"" said economists at SMBC Nikko Securities.
Separate data will likely show wholesale prices rose 8.2% in January from a year earlier, slowing for the second straight month but still hovering near the record 9.0% hit in November, the poll showed.
Household spending likely rose 0.3% in December from a year earlier, marking the first rise in five months, the poll showed.
The government will release preliminary October-December GDP data at 8:50 a.m. on Feb. 15 (2350 GMT, Feb. 14) and household spending data at 8:30 a.m. on Feb. 8 (2330 GMT, Feb. 7).

The Bank of Japan will release the wholesale price data at 8:50 a.m. on Feb. 10 (2350 GMT, Feb. 9).
The government reinstated coronavirus curbs in most areas in Japan, and local authorities are mulling over even stricter restrictions to stop the fast spread of the Omicron variant. On Thursday, Japan's daily infections exceeded 100,000 for the first time.

LONDON (Reuters) - Unnerved by the sabre-rattling between Russia and the West over Ukraine, traders are scouring global markets for investments that could provide them with protection against losses in case the conflict escalates.
Any conflict risks triggering a rout in riskier investments such as global stocks and a rush into so-called safe havens such as government bonds, gold and currencies like the U.S. dollar and yen, leaving those exposed to equities with large losses. 
Typically, investors hedge against potential losses by buying assets that would pay out if the situation reverses, such as derivatives that could profit from a fall in stocks or commodities.
But with markets already gyrating in the face of rising inflation, worries about global growth and tighter monetary policy, the cost of that protection has gone up sharply in recent days, according to five traders.
Europe's equivalent of Wall Street's fear gauge -- an index which calculates how volatile investors expect stocks to behave in the short term -- is currently trading more than 50% above its 2021 average, indicating how increased demand is pushing hedging costs up. 
Investors are having to peer deeper and farther across markets for ideas that offer affordable protection. 
In interviews, traders and investors said they are looking at a range of strategies, from derivative bets on how wildly French stocks will gyrate or how much German stocks will fall to simply looking for assets that are currently out of favour but would benefit if markets got worse. 
Two traders at major global banks, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, said they are recommending their clients look at the French stock market and place derivative bets on volatility, a measure of the intensity of market swings. 
Their expectation is that volatility in French stocks will increase in the event of a conflict because it is one of the most liquid markets in Europe.One of the traders, who heads derivatives strategies at a top bank in London, is recommending that his clients buy call options on French stock market volatility, which would allow them to buy the underlying financial asset at a fixed price even as it rises in the event of a conflict. 
To defray some of the cost of such a bet, the trader is telling clients to sell options on U.S. stock market volatility, which he thinks is likely to be less impacted by any escalation of the conflict. Taking such a two-pronged bet would, however, also reduce some of the profits should a conflict ensue. 
Swiss bank UBS is recommending buying call options on the yen or the U.S. dollar, according to a note published this week. The two currencies would likely strengthen as investors seek out safe havens in the case of a conflict, making the bets profitable. 
Another suggestion from UBS is to buy put options on German stock benchmarks, a bet that will pay out if the market falls. That is a possibility because of the reliance of German companies on Russian energy for production. 
Some investors appear to be taking up that idea. A March 2022 DAX index put option, which would become profitable if the German index were to fall 10% below Wednesday's closing levels, saw record volumes on Jan. 24 and again on Wednesday.
ENDURING APPEAL OF GOLD 
The upfront costs of protection against what many still see as an unlikely event are leaving some investors reluctant to hedge, said Peter Ganry, head of strategy at Saxo Bank.
Investment houses like Amundi, for example, assign only a 10% probability of a full-fledged invasion. 
Ganry recommends a different type of bet -- purchasing listed market-making firms like Virtu Financial (NASDAQ:VIRT) and Flow Traders NV, which benefit when market volatility rises and the difference between the asking and the offering price of a security, called the bid-ask spread, increases.
Some like Sumit Kendurkar, a trader at market maker Optiver in Amsterdam say there is also interest in buying upside calls on options in energy stocks exposed to both natural gas and oil. UBS estimates that Russia and Ukraine combined account for nearly 20% of global gas and oil supplies. 

Roberto Lottici, fund manager at Banca Ifigest in Milan, has a straightforward old-school strategy of going for gold, doubling the size of gold and silver investments to 6% of his fund, while cutting put options and other hedging instruments that are becoming expensive. 
“If the situation spirals out of control,"" Lottici said, ""then it's going to be one of the very few assets that can offer protection.” GRAPHIC: Russia ukraine graphic, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkplgjlkjvb/Russia%20ukraine%20graphic.JPG

TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan must keep monetary policy ultra-loose as inflation remains well below that of other economies, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said, brushing aside the view it could follow in the footsteps of more hawkish U.S. and European peers.
Mounting inflation risks have prompted central banks across the globe, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, to withdraw crisis-mode stimulus measures and raise interest rates.
Inflation remains subdued in Japan due to a delay in the economy's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, and the public's sticky deflationary mindset where households and firms act on the assumption that prices won't rise much, Kuroda said.
""In Japan, nominal wages haven't risen much. It's hard to see inflation sustainably reach our 2% target unless wages rise in tandem with prices,"" Kuroda told parliament on Friday.
""It's important to maintain powerful monetary easing to support the economy, and help generate steady wage and price growth,"" he said.
The remarks came after the European Central Bank, considered among laggards in dialling back stimulus, surprised markets with a hawkish shift by acknowledging inflation risks and opening the door to a possible rate hike this year.
Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki told the same parliament session the government hopes to work closely with the BOJ to ensure Japan makes a sustained exit from deflation.
While Kuroda has repeatedly said it was in no rush to follow in the footsteps of other central banks, market speculation the BOJ might tighten policy pushed the benchmark 10- and five-year government bond yields to six-year highs on Friday.
Slow wage growth and weak consumption have kept Japan's core consumer inflation stuck at 0.5% in December, the highest level in nearly two years but still well below the BOJ's 2% target.
BOJ Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe said inflation may accelerate to around 1% in the coming months, though that would still be much lower than 5% in the euro zone and 7% in the United States.
And yet, the policy shift by other central banks and the rising cost of prolonged easing have drawn calls among some lawmakers for the BOJ to dial back stimulus including its huge buying of exchange-traded funds (ETF).

Kuroda acknowledged the BOJ's ETF buying was an extraordinary step not taken by any other central banks, but stressed the move has been effective in keeping markets stable.
""We would buy ETFs only when markets turn extremely risk aversive, and hold off on buying when it's unnecessary to do so,"" Kuroda said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will sign an executive order on Friday requiring ""project labor agreements"" in federal construction projects over $35 million, a potential boost to workers and unions that negotiate these deals, and a shift the administration says will speed up building times. 
The order will apply to $262 billion in federal construction contracting and impact nearly 200,000 workers, the White House said late on Thursday, confirming news first reported by Reuters.
Project labor agreements are collective bargaining agreements between building trade unions and contractors, which set wages, employment conditions, and dispute resolution on specific projects. Democratic presidents in the past have typically supported applying such agreements to the massive U.S. federal contracting budget, while Republican presidents have rescinded them.
The order, which will go into effect immediately, comes on the heels of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law by Biden that invests in the country's roads, ports and bridges. 
Much of that money will flow through federal agencies to states and local governments. The new executive order excludes projects funded by grants to non-federal agencies, a senior administration official said, adding that will make up for a bulk of the projects under the bill. But it will apply to billions of other federal spending on waterways, military bases and other areas.
The White House said Biden would visit Ironworkers Local 5 in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, Friday to sign the new executive order, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh.
The U.S. construction industry - including workers, owners, developers, contractors - has been one of the hardest hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to a slowdown of available goods and labor and the termination of entire projects.
Biden has vowed to strengthen unions and increase membership in the United States after years of steady decline, and to increase salaries for hourly workers in construction, health care and other jobs. 
""Contractors who offer lower wages or hire less qualified workers will need to raise their standards to compete with other high-wage, high-quality companies,"" the order says, according to a draft viewed by Reuters. Earlier executive action by Biden requires federal contractors in new or extended contracts to pay a $15 per hour minimum wage.

Biden's move won praise from some contractors.
""This streamlines the negotiation process and gives employers access to a highly skilled pool of craftworkers,"" Daniel Hogan, chief executive of the Association of Union Constructors, that represents 1800 contractor companies, told Reuters.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain must ditch plans to make regulators ""cheerleaders"" for global finance and instead focus on promoting financial inclusion at home, consumer campaign groups said on Friday.
The finance ministry is reviewing financial rulemaking after Britain's departure from the European Union, and has proposed giving the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority a secondary objective of promoting the international competitiveness of finance.
""Asking regulators to take on this task risks eroding their independence,"" the 37 campaign groups and charities said in a joint statement.
""Balanced input from industry and civil society advocates, with the regulators acting in the public interest and maintaining independence, is more likely to produce well-designed regulation that delivers better outcomes.""
The charities include the Centre for Responsible Credit, the Financial Inclusion Centre, Greenpeace, Stamp out Poverty, Positive money, Tax Justice System and Finance Innovation Lab.
Financial rules were written in Brussels when Britain was an EU member, and some lawmakers want the UK to use Brexit ""freedoms"" to ease rules in one of Britain's biggest export sectors.
Brexit means the industry has been largely cut off from the bloc, which is now a competitor.
The finance ministry has said Britain will adhere to high international standards and not return to the ""light touch"" regime seen before the 2007-2009 global financial crisis when taxpayers bailed out UK banks.
Finance should help Britain meet carbon neutral goals and 'level up,' meaning closing wealth disparities between regions, the charities said, adding there should be a statutory duty for regulators to promote financial inclusion.

There should also be mandatory registration of all lobbyists and regular reporting of their activities, they added.
""Now that the financial crisis is over a decade behind us, banking lobbyists are agitating for a relaxation of the very regulations that are designed to keep our money safe,"" Vince Cable, a former business minister, said in the joint statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the International Monetary Fund on Thursday said an agreement reached in principle with Argentina on a new standby loan was ""pragmatic"" but ""hard work"" still lay ahead.
Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told reporters that details of the program were still being worked out, and the global lender recognized the limitations of what could be done, citing political opposition immediately after the announcement.
The main focus, she said, was to get Argentina out of ""this very dangerous path of high inflation,"" adding that the staff agreement being worked out now would also include structural conditions aimed at ensuring Argentina raised its tax revenues and boosted transparency of public spending.
Argentina and the IMF on Friday said they had reached an understanding about a new $44.5 billion standby deal, a major breakthrough that came after over a year of tense talks about restructuring loans the country cannot repay.
The new deal has been sharply criticized, including by Maximo Kirchner, a prominent Argentine lawmaker and son of Vice President Cristina Fernandez, who broke ranks with the ruling party on Monday.
Argentine President Alberto Fernandez and his government have been negotiating with the IMF to revamp debt outstanding from a failed $57 billion loan deal from 2018, the fund's largest ever.
Argentina's dollar bond prices fell slightly on Thursday, hanging on to most gains since the understanding was announced, but not far from record lows and in deeply distressed territory. The bond maturing in 2029 is priced at 35 cents on the dollar, with a yield of 24%.
Asked if the IMF was repeating mistakes made in 2018 by accepting conditions on deficit reduction and a lack of firm commitment to phase out energy subsidies, Georgieva said: ""As you can imagine, this is something we are debating, we have been debating and we will continue to debate at the fund.""
But she said the agreement in principle had factored in lessons learned from the failed 2018 deal, and IMF staff were focused on lowering inflation.
""We are confident that this is a pragmatic program that ... provided it is implemented, and if necessary, adjusted as we go ... would help Argentina to deal with the most significant structural problems,"" Georgieva said.
Further structural adjustments could be agreed later, she said.
The IMF's objective was to reduce Argentina's deficit to zero by 2025 and support the government to ""finally take a key step on energy subsidies that have been quite generous,"" with additional conditions to be included in the staff agreement on the deal now being worked out, Georgieva said.

""We also recognize the limitations of what can be done over the next years,"" she said. ""So we have to calibrate the program to be implementable.""
The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday it was ""too early"" to say if the world was facing a period of sustained inflation, but warned that failure to make economies more resilient to future shocks could lead to big problems.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told reporters that global policymakers need to carefully calibrate their fiscal and monetary policies in 2022 to ensure that widespread withdrawal of COVID-19 support funds and rising interest rates did not undermine the recovery.
The IMF last week cut its economic forecasts for the United States, China and the global economy, and said uncertainty about the pandemic, inflation, supply disruptions and U.S. monetary tightening posed further risks.
Unlike the first year of the pandemic in 2020, when finance ministers and central bankers coordinated and synchronized their actions, circumstances varied widely now across the world, and that required more ""specificity"" in responses, she said.
Georgieva said the COVID-19 pandemic remained the biggest risk facing the global economy, and it was imperative to step up efforts to increase vaccination rates in low-income countries, and meet a global target of vaccinating 70% of people in countries around the world by mid-2022.
The IMF chief said inflation had lasted longer and risen higher than expected, due to supply chain disruptions, stronger-than-expected consumer demand for goods, and climate shocks on food prices.
Asked if those circumstances, and the escalating crisis between Russia and the West over Ukraine, could usher in an era of sustained inflation, Georgieva said, ""The short answer is, it is too early to say. What we can anticipate is a more shock-prone world.""

She said efforts now to invest more in resilience of people, the economy and the environment would help create more opportunities for greater job growth and prosperity.
Failure to make such investments would result in a bleaker outlook, which would result in ""more unexpected events for which we are not prepared,"" Georgieva said, adding that policymakers were also not well-prepared to deal with more than one crisis at a time.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's fragmented parliament approved the minority leftist government's labour reform on Thursday by a margin of just one vote, which the main opposition party said had come from one of its members by mistake and vowed to try to annul the result.
The decree that overturns a previous conservative administration's pro-business reforms by granting more power to unions in bargaining contracts is a cornerstone of a raft of conditions for Spain receiving the next 12 billion euro disbursement of European pandemic recovery funds.
The result of the vote was so close that House Speaker Meritxell Batet initially said the bill had been rejected, causing consternation among government members present, but quickly corrected herself.
The Socialist-led government's usual allies in the house for the past two years, such as the Catalan separatists ERC, voted against the legislation. 
Unprecedented support by the opposition centre-right Ciudadanos and the conservative Catalan pro-independence PdeCat allowed the bill to narrowly pass in a 175-174 vote.
A lawmaker from the People's Party voted remotely for the reform, which the party blamed on a computer error, claiming in a statement that the MP ""voted no, but on the screen the vote appeared as yes"".
His attempts to alert house officials about the error were allegedly ignored, which the party said infringed remote voting protocol that requires confirmation of the vote by telephone. It lodged a complaint with the governing body of Congress and promised legal action if the error was not acknowledged. 
The landmark reform is a long-standing electoral commitment of the Socialists and their coalition partners Unidas Podemos.
""This is the most important law of the legislature,"" Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz told parliament before the vote. 
She said the legislation would counter Spain's chronic problem of unemployment, the European Union's second-highest after Greece, and precarious work.
Spain is the EU country with the highest use of temporary contracts, covering around a quarter of the workforce. 
The new regulation tightens conditions for their use, limiting them to short periods of time. Also, providers of outsourced staff will have to adapt workers' terms to those of the company they are assigned to.
Parliament is highly fragmented and polarised, making the administration reliant on a number of small regional parties to pass laws. 
Although positive for the reform and government's immediate goals, support from Ciudadanos could drive a wedge between some of the leftist parties, particularly junior ruling coalition partner Podemos, and Catalonia's ERC.
Whether the vote will redefine or diminish support for the government still remains to be seen. 

One of the labour groups that stands to benefit the most from the new legislation are hotel housekeepers, known locally as Kellys, long a symbol of precarious work in the tourism-dependent country. Diaz said such workers' annual income would increase by about 2,500 euros in some cases.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Hedge funds Citadel and Saba Capital Management sidestepped January's stock market selloff to post gains as many other firms started the year off in the red, investors in the funds said on Thursday.
Ken Griffin's Citadel told investors that its multi-strategy flagship Wellington fund gained 4.71% last month. The firm's global fixed income fund returned 4.91%. A spokesman declined to comment.
Boaz Weinstein's Saba performed even better. The fund, which often delivers big gains during times of market turmoil, returned roughly 7% in January, an investor said. A spokeswoman could not be reached for comment.
Israel Englander's Millennium Management also ended the month with gains, posting a 1.72% return, an investor said. A representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
January marked a difficult start to the year with many hedge funds, especially ones that invested heavily in technology stocks, posting double digit losses for the month.
Fears of interest rate hikes and geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine weighed on trading, leaving the broader S&P 500 down 5.3% for the month, its worst monthly performance since dropping 12.5% in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic.

Firms like Citadel and Millennium which have teams of traders that concentrate on different investments can sometimes weather these kind of declines better. 
But Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management, which also employs teams of traders, ended January with a 1.26% loss, an investor said. A representative did not respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global equity markets slumped lower on Thursday while gold prices steadied and the dollar weakened as frightened investors digested disappointing updates from major central banks about the outlook for inflation and interest rates. 
The European Central Bank and the Bank of England soured investor sentiment around inflation on Thursday, while a downbeat status update from the firm formerly known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) further spooked traders. 
Europe's main bourses were down as the BoE delivered its widely expected second interest rate hike in three months, which helped buoy sterling and lift the euro.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost about 1.8% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.2%, in response to a seemingly worldwide surge in inflation, analysts said.
On Wall Street, Facebook-owner Meta Platforms' dour forecast sent its stock plummeting, abruptly ending a nascent recovery built on upbeat earnings from big tech companies.
In the currency market, the defensive mood dented the dollar after an earlier step to regain its footing. Inflation pressures were weighing on bonds as the ECB kept its policy unchanged as expected on Thursday.
Making only the smallest change to its statement, the ECB removed a clause stipulating that its next policy move could be in ""either direction."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 1.5%, the S&P 500 index shed more than 2% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped more than 3%.
""There's a big impact from the results of Meta, it's like a real earthquake,"" said Mikael Jacoby, head of Continental European sales trading at Oddo Securities in Paris.
""We had good results here for European tech ... I'm quite surprised by the resilience of the market here. I would say I'm not positive for markets moving forward: this is the last quarter when earnings will enjoy such a favorable comparison year-on-year, (interest) rates are going up and there's a major geopolitical risk.""

IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda said there's even more expected volatility in stocks to come, especially in terms of how far the Federal Reserve will go in tightening monetary policy this year.
""It doesn't look like we are out of the woods yet. There's been little resolution to the key Fed questions: How many hikes? What will the pace, size and timing of quantitative tightening be? Until that becomes clearer, volatility should remain heightened.""
U.S. DATA
Earlier on Thursday, the U.S. government reported that new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week as COVID-19 infections subsided, suggesting an anticipated slowdown in job growth in January was likely temporary.
U.S. job openings, however, are near historically high levels as companies seek to rebuild staff or pivot in response to changes in consumer demand, and there aren't enough workers to fill all the positions, a reshuffling in the labor market which has seen more workers quit at near record levels.
In emerging markets, pressure was building on Turkey's lira again after annual inflation there came in at nearly 50% in January. Russia's rouble also dropped as tensions over Ukraine were fanned by the movement of 3,000 U.S. troops to Eastern Europe.
The dollar index fell 0.779%, with the euro up 1.25% to $1.1444.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 6.3 basis points to 1.829%. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 4 basis points to 1.196%. 
Oil prices edged higher, maintaining their upward trajectory built on expectations that supply will tighten further even after OPEC+ producers stuck to planned moderate output increases.[O/R]
U.S. crude was up 2.2% to $90.20 per barrel on the day while Brent gained 1.73% to $91.02 per barrel.

Analysts have looked to U.S. oil output as a salve, though overall production was at 11.5 million bpd in the most recent week, according to federal data. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance said on Thursday that he now expects more production growth in the United States this year than he did a few weeks ago.

(Reuters) - Gina Marino quit two jobs last year.
In the summer, she left a position at a small social media marketing agency for a bigger firm offering more money and greater responsibility.
Three months later, despite liking her colleagues and the company but realizing she lacked passion for the industry she was supporting, she quit again.
Marino, 25, wasn't out of work for long. A more targeted job search brought fast responses from companies needing to fill spots immediately.
""The help was really needed,"" said Marino, who lives in Stamford, Connecticut. Last fall, she landed another social media marketing role - this time for a hair care company, which is more in line with her interests.
She's hardly alone. Nearly 4 million Americans on average quit their jobs each month last year, an unprecedented wave of workplace turnover as the economy emerged from a pandemic-induced recession that, while brief, appears to be leaving a lasting imprint on the U.S. job market. (Graphic: Wave of workplace turnover Wave of workplace turnover, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/QUITS/lgpdwxnrnvo/chart.png) 
Job openings are near historically high levels as companies seek to rebuild staff or pivot in response to changes in consumer demand, and there aren't enough workers to fill all the positions. As of December, there were nearly two openings for every unemployed person, according to the Labor Department. 
That mismatch means that many workers are finding themselves with more options - and taking them. With hiring still outpacing the level of quits, some economists say the trend dubbed the ""Great Resignation"" is really more of a great reshuffling as people take advantage of the tight labor market to move into jobs with better pay, more flexibility or to try something new. 
""The job has become a commodity,"" said Nela Richardson, chief economist for the payroll processor ADP. ""If you don’t like this one, you can get another one."" (Graphic: High demand for workers, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/QUITS/egpbklonovq/chart.png) 
HELP FOR FINDING HELP
Companies with open positions need to cast a wider net to reach the right candidate and some are seeking more help.
Business is booming for Goodwin Recruiting, which works regularly with hospitality customers. Allegra Highsmith, vice president of operations, said the firm is now recruiting for roughly 4,700 openings, up from about 1,500 at the start of March 2020, just before the pandemic shuttered the economy.
The firm also doubled its network of independent contractors that help to recruit workers, to more than 200 from about 100 at the end of 2019.
Recruiters are increasingly having frank conversations with employers about how they need to make their offers more appealing by raising pay, improving benefits or adding bonuses and other perks, said Highsmith. 
Gianfranco Sorrentino, the owner of three Italian restaurants in Manhattan, Il Gattopardo, Mozzarella & Vino, and The Leopard at des Artistes, is experiencing that firsthand. He bumped up the hourly pay for some kitchen roles, such as porters and dishwashers, to $18 from $15. He also increased the salaries for workers in management by between 15% and 20%. 
But Sorrentino, who also owns a catering business, said he is still having a hard time finding skilled managers, servers and bartenders. ""We have to be competitive not only with the other restaurants, but with every other kind of industry that is offering the same things,"" he said. 
HAVING TO STEP AWAY
Not all people who quit are moving to better jobs. Some people are struggling to work because of ongoing disruptions with childcare, and others have had to quit because they don't have paid sick time or are worried about facing increased health risks on the job, said Elise Gould, a senior economist for the Economic Policy Institute. 
""It could be a short-term spell of having to step away,"" said Gould. 
Nearly 9 million people said they did not work in the first few weeks of January because they were sick with coronavirus or caring for someone who was, according to a Census bureau survey https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2021/demo/hhp/hhp41.html#tables. Economists are dimming their outlooks for job growth in January, with more forecasting that the U.S. economy lost jobs as the Omicron wave hampered demand and led to event cancellations.
How long will the labor shakeup last? It's possible the churn could slow this year as the reopening phase winds down and more employers either find the workers they're looking for or learn to manage without them, Richardson said. 
Some companies are using technology and automation https://www.reuters.com/technology/robots-marched-2021-with-record-orders-by-north-american-firms-2022-02-02 to get by with smaller staffs or to minimize the risk of disruptions and shutdowns when COVID-19 infections rise, which could lower the demand for workers.
Meanwhile, more people may re-enter the labor market if a subsiding pandemic eases the strains that are keeping them at home, and with more competition for jobs, fewer people might quit, Gould said. 
In the meantime, some workers are rethinking what they do and how they spend their time. 
Gabby Ianniello didn't have a job lined up when she quit her job in real estate development in February 2021 seeking a way to spend more time with family and avoid burnout. 

She left her Upper West Side Manhattan apartment and moved back in with her parents in Long Island, where she was able to dedicate more time to a podcast and website called the Corporate Quitter, where she shares stories of people like herself who quit their jobs. She earns money from digital product offerings like courses and guides and through consulting, partnerships and affiliate marketing. 
Now Ianniello, 28, no longer has to get up at 5 a.m. to squeeze in a run and a shower before getting to the office at 8 a.m. Instead of wearing pencil skirts and heels, she can work in her pajamas. ""The great thing is I have autonomy on my schedule so I can kind of pick and choose what I want to do and set the parameters of when I take calls and when I don't,"" she said. ""It's freedom.""

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) unveiled on Thursday long-awaited technical research and open-source code that could be used as the groundwork for a potential central bank digital currency.
The research does not suggest that the U.S. central bank will move toward launching a CBDC, a step it has said it would not take without clear support from the White House and Congress.
""There has been no decision to move past this research phase, but if a CBDC was launched it would be something that would have to evolve over time,"" Jim Cunha, an executive vice president at the Boston Fed, told reporters on Thursday.
The first phase of the multi-year project, dubbed ""Project Hamilton,"" focused on developing software that is flexible and resilient. The work resulted in code that is capable of handling 1.7 million transactions per second. Researchers also found the ""vast majority"" of transactions settled in under two seconds. 
The team developed technology that can be adjusted as more policy questions regarding the structure and purpose of a CBDC are addressed. 
For example, the first version of the code did not include intermediaries or fees, but researchers said those roles and features could be added after policymakers and other parties make decisions on the best way for consumers to access their funds and conduct transactions. 
In a separate discussion paper released last month by the Fed's Board of Governors, the central bank said a digital dollar would ""best suit"" U.S. needs if it were intermediated through the current financial system, but did not rule out other approaches.
""Any system that might be used in the future, I think, is going to depend a lot on what policymakers decide,"" said Neha Narula, director of MIT's Digital Currency Initiative. 
Fed policymakers and lawmakers are divided on the need for a CBDC. Some say it could improve financial inclusion, while others worry the costs could outweigh the potential benefits. 
The paper looked at some of the tradeoffs that could appear with different structures. For instance, researchers found that using distributed ledger technology, which underpins most cryptoassets and verifies transactions without the use of intermediaries, has ""downsides."" They said the approach could create bottlenecks and could lead to more privacy issues. 

In the next phase, the Boston Fed and MIT will explore alternative designs and look more closely at other issues such as security and programmability. They will also look at ways to balance privacy issues with concerns about compliance. 
The Fed wants to hear from the public about how a potential CBDC could be used or structured. Project Hamilton researchers released their software under an open-source license, adding that they want to receive feedback from other experts. And the Fed board is collecting comments on the issue via an online form.

Asked by the BBC whether people should rein in their wage expectations, Bailey said: ""In the sense of saying, we do need to see a moderation of wage rises, now that's painful. 
""I don't want to in any sense sugar that, it is painful. But we need to see that in order to get through this problem more quickly.""
Earlier on Thursday, the BoE raised interest rates for the second time in two months, taking Bank Rate to 0.5%. Nearly half its policymakers wanted a bigger increase to 0.75%.
The central bank said consumer price inflation - which was 5.4% in December - should peak at around 7.25% in April and post-tax income for working households would fall by 2% this year even as it trebled its forecast for wage growth this year to 3.75%.
The squeeze on living standards is turning into a political problem for Prime Minister Boris Johnson and finance minister Rishi Sunak who on Thursday announced measures to soften a hit to households from a jump of more than 50% in domestic energy tariffs starting in April, when taxes are also due to rise.
Before his BBC interview, Bailey told reporters that Britain was not at risk of a wage-price spiral.

""What we are saying (...) is that we are seeing upward movement in what firms expect to be wage settlements,"" he said.
""After adjusting for all the sort of the various COVID effects on the data, I think the underlying rate of wage growth is somewhat higher than we would expect it to be at this point in the cycle.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve needs to begin raising interest rates but it is too soon to say how far or fast that process will need to go to bring inflation under control, Richmond Federal Reserve president Thomas Barkin said Thursday.
He said it remained uncertain, given the ongoing pandemic and the tangled state of global supply chains, whether U.S. inflation would dip on its own back towards the Fed's 2% target, or be driven persistently higher by rising wages, higher input costs, and businesses developing more aggressive pricing strategies.
With the Feds' target policy rate still near zero, he said, the immediate challenge is ""to get ourselves in a better position to do what we might need to do should the least optimistic scenario come true, while not constraining the economy"" in the meantime, Barkin said in a Reuters interview.
""It is a straightforward call to say we ought to get rates back into better position,"" Barkin said, but with so much unknown, ""it does not feel to me like there is enough information to say holy cow we have to restrain the economy right now.""
His comments were a more tempered view of a situation that has prompted some market analysts to conclude the Fed has lost control of inflation and will be forced to raise interest rates faster and higher than anticipated -- potentially putting the economic recovery at risk. Prices currently are rising at levels not seen since the early 1980s.
The Fed at its March meeting is expected to raise the target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point from the current near zero level, and provide some guidance on how it intends to proceed from there. 
Barkin would not say how many rate increases he anticipates will be appropriate this year. Investors have priced 5 quarter point hikes into contracts linked to the federal funds rate, and his colleagues talk in terms of 3 to 5.
Barkin said that in general he feels the federal funds rate should be increased to where it was just before the pandemic -- at the end of 2019 it was set in a range between 1.5 and 1.75% -- before reassessing how much more might be needed.
He did not specify a timeline for that, and said the behavior of inflation could swing policy in either direction.
""Pre-pandemic levels are the place to reassess. Where we were pre-pandemic was under every member of the (Federal Open Market Committee's) assessment of where neutral was,"" meaning the Fed at that point would not be actively restricting the economy, Barkin said. 
""Then we can look around and say do you want to then start to move into the range ... where we are starting to restrain?""
At this point, Barkin said, it remains uncertain what will happen in the economy once the effects of the pandemic lift more fully. As it is, millions of workers might be sidelined sick at home in a given week, or global hubs like China have parts of their manufacturing base shut down at any given time.

That makes it difficult to judge how prices and employment will behave once pandemic risks recede, Barkin said, and hard to anticipate how monetary policy will need to respond.
“Covid is still here. Still influencing supply chains. Still influencing demand,"" Barkin said. At this point ""I don't know how to declare the regime we are in.""

International Monetary Fund spokesman Gerry Rice told Reuters that the fund did not comment on leaks of draft documents. But he said the Jan. 28 statement issued by staff after an Article IV surveillance mission to Japan did include ""robust analysis on the issue of climate change.""
Reuters reported Wednesday that the Jan. 28 concluding statement omitted a sentence included in an earlier draft, which said global efforts on climate policy would benefit if Japan ended exceptions from its pledge to end financing of new unabated coal projects.
The IMF initially declined to comment, but offered a longer statement on the Article IV surveillance process on Thursday.
Climate activists said deletion of the passage on coal from the staff's concluding statement was disappointing coming so soon after the IMF board agreed to focus more on climate change in its surveillance of countries' economies.

The report did include a section entitled ""Shifting to a Low-carbon Economy"" that made no mention of coal but said meeting carbon emissions reduction goals would be especially challenging for Japan given its heavy reliance on fossil fuels for energy since a 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
Rice also noted that decisions on concluding statements were made by the staff country team. Management and the board were only involved in the next phase of the Article IV surveillance process, which leads to publication of a more detailed staff report.

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's inflation fight should be its top priority, President Joe Biden's nominees to the central bank's Board of Governors told lawmakers on Thursday, signaling support for a hawkish pivot in U.S. monetary policy that's already well underway. 
In a nearly three-hour Senate Banking committee confirmation hearing for Fed nominees Lisa Cook, Philip Jefferson and Sarah Bloom Raskin, legislators focused mostly on non-monetary policy issues, with Republican senators repeatedly challenging vice chair for supervision nominee Raskin on her views about the Fed's role in mitigating climate risk. 
The nominees' broad backing of the Fed's bid to bring inflation under control was largely in line with the direction signaled by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose renomination banking panel members from both sides of the aisle have said they will support. 
The panel is set to vote on all five of Biden's Fed nominees, including the renomination of Powell and the elevation of Governor Lael Brainard to the vice chair spot, on Feb. 15, with a vote in the closely divided full Senate to follow sometime thereafter. 
INFLATION VS EMPLOYMENT
The Fed is preparing to raise interest rates next month for the first time since cutting them to near zero about two years ago to shield the economy from the effects of the global coronavirus pandemic. 
While the Fed's goals are ""equally"" maximum employment and price stability, the clear need now is to bring inflation down from its highest rate in four decades and back toward the Fed's 2% target, Jefferson said.
""So in this moment ... the inflation rate is high relative to the Fed's target and so the directive is clear,"" Jefferson, an economist and currently dean of faculty at Davidson College in North Carolina, told lawmakers. ""The Fed must take steps to bring inflation back in line with its target.""
""Everyday Americans are suffering from high inflation,"" said economist Lisa Cook of Michigan State University, adding that this suffering is what motivates her, even as she emphasized her policy views would be data-dependent. ""I agree with the Fed's path right now as we're speaking, but when we get to a decision point I would look to the data, the evidence, that would be made available at that time.""
Raskin used her prepared remarks to call inflation a top priority for the Fed, but she spent most of her time during the hearing making the case that she will stick within the Fed's regulatory mandate and while she believes banks need strict oversight, it is not her job to tell them how and where to lend.
Cook and Jefferson got far fewer questions from lawmakers, but said that if confirmed their policy views will also be shaped by the Fed's mandate, the data, and discussion with their fellow policymakers, all points that Fed policymakers regularly underscore as they describe their decision-making. 
""In times of uncertainty... we have to be patient with the data,"" said Cook. ""I would make sure that I pose questions of the data we were receiving and engage with the deliberations with my colleagues with an open mind if confirmed."" 
""The way in which the Fed, within its authorities, can best improve the recovery from the pandemic for low-wage workers is to stick to its dual mandate, which is to keep a focus on maximum employment and stable prices,"" Jefferson said.

Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the panel, led the charge against Raskin, who of all the nominees appeared to be the least likely to win support from a majority of the panel. Toomey said he would support Jefferson's nomination, but said he was ""very disappointed"" with Cook's responses on the inflation challenge, saying they lacked ""clarity.""
John Kennedy, another Republican, said he would support both Jefferson and Cook.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Joe Biden's pick to be the Fed's top bank regulator, told U.S. lawmakers on Thursday that she believes banks need strict oversight, but that it is not her job to tell them how and where to lend.
Raskin was repeatedly challenged by Republicans, who argued that her previous comments suggest that, if confirmed to the role of vice chair for supervision, she would use her post to discourage banks from lending to oil and gas companies in a bid to combat climate change.
Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Raskin insisted that is not the Fed's role, but rather it needs to assess the risks banks face from climate change and whether they are properly protected.
""It is banks, bankers who are making the decision about who to lend to. That is not a Fed decision, and it never should be,"" she said. ""It is not a regulatory and supervisory function for a regulator to take over the basic business decision that the bank is making.""
Raskin testified alongside Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson, two of Biden's nominees to become Fed governors.
Raskin, a former Fed governor and senior Treasury Department official during the Obama administration, will take on a sweeping agenda at the Fed if confirmed, where climate change is expected to play a central role.
The Fed is already in the process of building tools to gauge how much risk climate change poses to the financial sector, whether through increasingly frequent severe weather events or the potential devaluing or certain assets as governments and companies shift to less carbon-intensive policies.
Republicans insisted Raskin would use the post to discourage banks from investing in oil and gas companies, pointing to her previous remarks suggesting financial regulators need to be more aggressive on policing climate risk at banks.
""Maybe it’ll be increased capital weightings, maybe it’ll be exposure limits, but the idea will be to allocate capital away from the heavily carbon-emitting parts of our economy,"" said Senator Pat Toomey, the senior Republican on the panel.
Progressives praised Raskin, citing her lengthy stints of government service, included twice being confirmed for senior roles at the Fed and Treasury. But she will also need to ensure the support of moderate Democrats in order to be confirmed by the narrowly divided Senate. 
Senator Sherrod Brown, the committee chairman, previously said he would like the committee to advance the trio, along with the renomination of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the elevation of Fed Governor Lael Brainard to the U.S. central bank's vice chair position, on Feb. 15.
On Thursday, there was little sign of moderate discomfort with Raskin's nomination. Senator Mark Warner, a moderate Democrat from Virginia, noted he had heard from bankers who had good relationships with her. And Senator Jon Tester from Montana expressed support for the Fed learning more about climate change, noting its impact on agricultural production.
""It is rather obvious climate change has to be part of the information you have to gather,"" he said.
In her testimony, Raskin vowed to be an attentive, comprehensive bank watchdog, tracking everything from internal bank risks to cyberattacks.

Raskin said cybersecurity was the top concern she hears from bankers, who have spent large amounts to bolster their safeguards.
""You would be really amazed to learn how much money banks have spent actually trying to defend themselves against these cyber attacks,"" she said. ""It’s not the role of the Fed certainly to stop cyberattacks, but I do think it’s important from a supervisory and risk perspective to make sure that the financial sector feels that it has the defenses.""

LONDON (Reuters) -The Bank of England raised interest rates to 0.5% on Thursday and nearly half its policymakers wanted a bigger increase to contain rampant price pressures, which the British central bank warned would push inflation above 7%.
In a surprise split decision, four of the nine Monetary Policy Committee members wanted to raise rates to 0.75% in what would have been the biggest increase in borrowing costs since the BoE became operationally independent 25 years ago.
A slim majority, including Governor Andrew Bailey, voted for a 0.25 percentage point increase. 
The pound briefly jumped above $1.36, its highest level since Jan. 20, and touched a two-year high against the euro before falling back after the European Central Bank raised the possibility of a rate hike of its own.
British government bonds sold off, with the 10-year yield at its highest since January 2019.
The BoE, which in December became the first major central bank to raise rates since the pandemic, flagged further modest tightening ""in the coming months"" even though growth will be hurt by global energy and goods price inflation. 
But Bailey told investors not to assume the BoE was embarking on a long series of rate hikes, and said there would have to be a trade-off between strong inflation and weakening growth as many households see their incomes squeezed.
Earlier, finance minister Rishi Sunak detailed measures to help households cope https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-sunak-sets-out-financial-support-help-with-energy-bills-2022-02-03 with a leap in energy prices in April, when taxes for workers and firms are due to rise.
Bailey said he had a ""hard message"" for the public.
""We have not raised interest rates today because the economy is roaring away,"" he told reporters. ""An increase in Bank Rate is necessary because it is unlikely that inflation will return to target without it.""
Britain was facing an ""extreme example"" of an economic shock that would raise the cost of living for everyone, Bailey warned.
Some analysts said the BoE risked adding to the financial pain.
""We think that they are effectively cracking a supply side nut with a demand side hammer,"" Richard McGuire, head of rates strategy at Rabobank, said.
James Athey, investment director at abrdn, said inflation expectations in financial markets were little changed by the BoE's announcement.
""The Bank seemingly cannot win in such a scenario as the market is essentially saying that if they don't create a recession then inflation won’t come down far enough,"" he said. 
Thursday's move marked the first back-to-back increases in Bank Rate since 2004.
After the BoE's announcement, investors priced in Bank Rate hitting 1.0% by May and 1.5% by year-end.
""It would not be surprising if we see a further increase, but please don't get carried away,"" Bailey said.
SPLIT DECISION
The BoE said consumer price inflation - which was 5.4% in December - should peak at around 7.25% in April, which would be the highest rate since the recession-ravaged early 1990s and miles off its 2% target.
High inflation meant post-tax income for working households would fall by 2% this year and 0.5% next year, while weakening demand would push unemployment up to 5% in three years' time.
The BoE said it will start to unwind its 895 billion pound ($1.2 trillion) quantitative easing programme by allowing the government bonds it holds to roll off its balance sheet as they mature. It will sell its much smaller stock of corporate bonds.
Price pressures look set to persist for much longer than forecast in November by the BoE, which trebled its forecast for wage growth this year to 3.75%.
Inflation in a year's time is now seen above 5% based on the market outlook for interest rates. 
But in a sign the BoE thinks investors have priced in too many rate hikes, it predicted inflation in three years' time would be below target at around 1.6%.
Bailey, his deputies Ben Broadbent and Jon Cunliffe, Chief Economist Huw Pill and external MPC member Silvana Tenreyro all voted for a 25 basis-point rate hike.
The BoE said they recognised the risks of strong price pressures but also the potential for inflation to fall faster if global energy and goods costs ease as markets expect. 
They warned a larger rate hike could have an ""outsized impact"" on expectations for borrowing costs.
Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden and external members Michael Saunders, Jonathan Haskel and Catherine Mann voted for a half-percentage-point rate rise to reduce the risk that recent pay growth and inflation expectations became more firmly embedded. 
BOND SALES
The BoE said the unwinding of its asset purchases would start next month when a British government bond held by the central bank matures. The 27.9 billion pounds of proceeds will not be reinvested, the BoE said - and nor will future gilt redemptions, worth around 70 billion pounds over 2022 and 2023.

The BoE will consider actively selling gilts once Bank Rate hits 1%.
It said it plans to reduce its 20 billion pounds of corporate bond holdings to zero no sooner than end-2023, by not reinvesting maturing bonds and a sales programme.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A sizeable minority of European Central Bank policymakers wanted to dial back the ECB's monetary stimulus already at Thursday's meeting and a decision in March now looks likely, barring a big drop in inflation, two sources told Reuters. 
The sources said that winding down the ECB's bond purchases faster was the first port of call for policymakers. They are now scheduled to run at least until October.
An ECB spokesperson declined to comment.
The ECB finally acknowledged mounting inflation risks on Thursday and even cracked the door open to an interest rate increase this year, marking a remarkable policy turnaround for one of the world's most dovish central banks.
But as the ECB has pledged not to raise rates while it is still buying bonds, policymakers need to speed up the pace at which they taper their Asset Purchase Programme first.

The sources added the ECB's ""mechanical"" projections for inflation, which incorporate economic data since the last meeting and the market price for oil among other things, were already above the official forecasts it published in December. 
The decision in March will depend on actual and expected inflation as well on any sign that wages were rising faster. (This story corrects to fix spelling in first paragraph)

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank finally acknowledged mounting inflation risks and even opened the door a crack to an interest rate increase this year, marking a remarkable policy turnaround for one of the world's most dovish central banks. 
The ECB has long argued that high inflation will fall back below its 2% target on its own later this year but a string of record-high readings have challenged a narrative that other central banks abandoned months ago.
""Inflation is likely to remain elevated for longer than previously expected but to decline in the course of this year,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde told a news conference. 
""Compared with our expectations in December, risks to the inflation outlook are tilted to the upside, particularly in the near term,"" she said, arguing that price growth across the 19 countries that use the euro is becoming more broad-based. 
""The situation has indeed changed.""
While Lagarde said the ECB would not rush into any move, she declined to repeat her previous guidance that an interest rate increase this year was ""very unlikely"".
Sources close to the discussion said that a sizable minority of policymakers had pushed for the bank to take action on Thursday, possibly by announcing a faster reduction of bond purchases, before agreeing to hold off until March.
The sources said policymakers were clear that a rate increase this year should no longer be excluded given the inflation risks and uncertainty in forecasts. 
Investor reaction was fierce and market moves were unusually large. Around 40-45 basis points of rate hikes were priced in by December after the news conference, compared to 28 basis points beforehand. Such a move would put the ECB's deposit rate not far below zero percent after years in negative territory.
The euro firmed three-quarters of a percent against the dollar while yields on German 10-year bonds rose 10 basis points. 
""The European Central Bank made a remarkable hawkish backward roll,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. ""Today's ECB meeting marks an important hawkish shift. 
MARCH
Lagarde, however, insisted that the sequence of the ECB's future policy moves will not change, so asset buys, now set to run indefinitely, will have to end before borrowing costs can be increased.
""We will continue to observe the sequence we have agreed and we will be gradual in any determination we make,"" she said.
She said March's meeting will be crucial as new economic projections could provide the justification for any policy move.
A first step is likely to be acceleration in winding down bond purchases, now set to be reduced in several steps to 20 billion euros a month by the fourth quarter. 
While global peers such as the U.S. Federal Reserve https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-officials-say-march-rate-hike-track-future-increases-data-dependent-2022-01-31 and the Bank of England https://www.reuters.com/business/bank-england-hikes-rates-clamour-contain-inflation-2022-02-03 tighten policy, the ECB has been a notable outlier. It is still providing copious monetary stimulus after undershooting its inflation target for most of the past decade.
Euro zone inflation hit a record high 5.1% in January, well above the ECB's own projections. Lagarde admitted that the figure, driven by higher energy and food prices, had caught even the central bank off-guard.
Analysts, always more cautious than market investors, said that a rate hike this year is far from a done deal but the chances are rising.

""There is a chance now that the criteria for lift-off will be met as soon as in March, or by June at the latest,"" Pictet Wealth Management strategist Frederic Ducrozet said. 
""Discussion will then focus on a possible faster tapering of the asset purchase programme."" 
 
"
461,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 11:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on track to provide copious stimulus this year even as inflation runs at a record high, exceeding both the bank's 2% target and its projections.
Following are highlights of ECB President Christine Lagarde's comments at a news conference after the policy meeting.
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EURO AREA AND U.S.
“I think we should be a little bit cautious about what I am hearing a lot, which is constant comparisons between the U.S. and the euro-area, the Fed and the ECB. 
""We are really operating in different environments with different economic data. Just to give you an example, our demand here in the euro-area is pretty much back to where it was pre-COVID, in the U.S. it is 30% up. Ask yourself why? Because of this massive fiscal stimulus that the U.S. economy has had, unlike the euro area, where it has been more moderate, not excessive and which is producing the measured pace at which some factors are significantly improving.”
BOND SPREADS
“We are not seeing any such development and while yields have moved up, spreads have not widened in any significant manner. We very much look into these matters very carefully. We have no reason to believe that it is going to be different. If it was, we are obviously going to respond, and we have all the tools, all the instruments and the adequate flexibility if it is justified.”
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WEEKS
""Clearly what will happen in the next few weeks and what we can see, both for our March meeting and then later on our June meeting will be critically important to determine whether the three criterias of our forward guidance are fully satisfied.""
UPSIDE RISKS TO INFLATION
""In the recent past, we have not actually mentioned, we have not included in our monetary policy statement, the characterisations of risk in relation to inflation. So I think that is a very explicit indication that it might very well be significantly higher than what we had expected over the course of the year and possibly higher than we had anticipated at the end of the year. So risk is to the upside in particular in the near term."" 
GEOPOLITICAL CLOUDS
""The geopolitical clouds that we have over Europe, if they were to materialise would certainly have an impact on energy prices and through energy prices and increased cost throughout the whole structure of prices.
""But it would also impact growth as a result of reduced income and possibly as a result of reduced consumption and deferred investment.
""So the pure economic impact would certainly be significant than what we are seeing at the moment."" 
MEDIUM-TERM INFLATION
""I’m very sorry to say but we do assess risk to the upside for the near term, particularly for the near term. We will know better what impact it will have on the medium-term inflation but let me just say one thing, we are getting much closer to target and this is so because in the medium term there are factors, drivers of inflation that are helping us, finally reach, hopefully, that target and that has to do with the labour market, that has to do with the broad-based inflation that we have, which concerns more than 60% of the items and it has to do with the inflation expectations.”
MARCH MEETING
""Come March, when we have additional data, when we have been able to integrate in our analytical work the numbers that we have received in the last few days, we will be in a position to make a thorough assessment again on the basis of data."" 
WON'T ROCK BOAT
""It all goes back to how do we make our decisions? We make them on the basis of data, we make them on the basis of the forward guidance when it comes to interest rates we make them gradually because we are not here to rock the boat if I may say. We are going to use all instruments, all optionalities in order to respond to the situation but the situation has indeed changed.""
ON THE INFLATION OUTLOOK 
""The situation has indeed changed. You will notice in the monetary policy statement I have just read we do refer to upside risk to inflation in our projection. So the situation having changed, we need to continue to monitor it carefully, we need to assess on the basis of the data and then we will have to take a judgement."" 
PROJECTIONS
""We don't just take projections at face value, and this is particularly relevant in the current circumstances given the level of uncertainty, given the geopolitical risks around.
""There has to be an element of judgement and that actually belongs to the table of the Governing Council.""
ASKED IF 2022 HIKE STILL UNLIKELY
""You know, I never make pledges without conditionalities and it is even more important at the moment to be very attentive to that. So as I said, we will assess very carefully; we will be data-dependent. We will do that work in March.""
CRITICAL DIFFERENCE WITH UK
""The UK has a history of much higher inflation than we have in the euro area.
""The critical difference now has to do with the labour market, where clearly there is a lot of pressure on wages where there is scarcity of workers for jobs that are available.
""I don't want to take a political stand but there was a lot of non-UK labour force that eventually had to leave the UK (after Brexit) that has not been totally replaced and the shortage of workers is actually having a bearing on ... the labour market in the UK. 
""So that's really what is causing the significant difference between the two."" 
NO RUSH TO A DECISION
""There was a determination not to rush into a decision."" 
UNANIMOUS CONCERN
""With the upside surprise that we have seen first in December, second in January, there was unanimous concern around the table of the Governing Council about inflation numbers and obviously the impact that it has in the near term and on our compatriots in Europe.""
UPSIDE INFLATION RISKS 
""Compared with our expectations in December, risks to the inflation outlook are tilted to the upside, particularly in the near term. 
""If price pressures feed through into higher-than-anticipated wage rises or the economy returns more quickly to full capacity, inflation could turn out to be higher."" 
ECONOMIC RISKS BROADLY BALANCED
""We continue to see the risks to the economic outlook as broadly balanced over the medium term.""
UNDERLYING INFLATION RISES
""Most measures of underlying inflation have risen over recent months, although the role of temporary pandemic factors means that the persistence of these increases remains uncertain.""
WIDESPREAD PRICE RISES
""Price rises have become more widespread, with the prices of a large number of goods and services having increased markedly.""
BOTTLENECKS STARTING TO EASE
""Shortages of equipment, materials, and labour in some sectors continue to hamper the production of manufactured goods, delay construction, and hold back the recovery in parts of the services sector. There are signs that these bottlenecks may be starting to ease, but they will still persist for some time.""
REDUCED PURCHASING POWER
""High energy costs are reducing the purchasing power of households and the earnings of businesses, which constrains consumption and investment.""
NEED FLEXIBILITY
""In view of the current uncertainty, we need more than ever to maintain flexibility and optionality in the conduct of monetary policy.""
STANDS READY
""The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation stabilizes at its 2% target over the medium term.""
ENERGY COSTS
""Shortages of materials, equipment, and labour continue to hold back output in some industries. High energy costs are hurting incomes and are likely to dampen spending."" 
SUPPLY STRAINS SHOULD EASE
""The economy is affected less and less by each wave of the pandemic and the factors restraining production and consumption should gradually ease, allowing the economy to pick up again strongly in the course of the year.""
RECOVERY CONTINUING 
""The euro area economy is continuing to recover and the labour market is improving further, helped by ample policy support.""

SUBDUED GROWTH
""Growth is likely to remain subdued in the first quarter as the current pandemic wave is still weighing on economic activity.""

(Reuters) -Ralph Lauren Corp raised its annual revenue forecast on Thursday and became the latest luxury goods retailer to top market estimates for holiday-quarter revenue as demand for high-end apparel soars.
Shares in the New-York based designer, which also announced a new $1.5 billion stock buyback program, rose 4% in morning trading. 
Global luxury groups, including Versace owner Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI), LVMH and Prada (OTC:PRDSY), have reported strong results as customers coming out from lockdowns splurge on luxury fashion, propelling sales to above pre-pandemic levels. 
Capri on Wednesday raised its annual sales outlook and said it would further increase prices across its brands, including Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, to take advantage of soaring demand. 
The surge in luxury demand will continue if international travel can return to pre-pandemic levels over the next 12 to 24 months, Zachary Warring, equity analyst at CFRA Research said.
Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) said it expects current-quarter revenue to rise by about 17% to 18% on constant currency basis, helped by higher prices, which the company said will also offset higher freight and raw material costs.
Chief Executive Officer Patrice Louvet said demand was strong to support ""many more quarters"" of price hikes.
""Our company is fundamentally healthier than it was 2 years ago. We're bringing in a younger, higher-value, less price-sensitive consumer,"" Louvet said on a call with analysts.
The company said it expects constant currency revenue for fiscal year 2022 to rise 39% to 41%, compared with a 34% to 36% increase it forecast earlier.
Ralph Lauren's net revenue rose 27% to $1.82 billion in the third quarter ended Dec. 25. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $1.64 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Revenue rose 30% in North America and 47% in Europe. 
Excluding certain items, Ralph Lauren reported a profit of $2.94 per share, beating estimates of $2.17.

(Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Governor Sarah Bloom Raskin, Michigan State University's Lisa Cook, and Davidson College's Philip Jefferson are due to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday for a confirmation hearing on their nominations to the U.S. central bank's powerful Board of Governors.
If approved, the three would fill out the seven-member board headed by recently renominated Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with Raskin, as Fed vice chair for supervision, becoming one of the country's top banking regulators and the central bank's lead on Wall Street rule-making. 
But what does a Fed governor do, anyway, to earn $203,700 a year, and what can the nominees expect when they get behind their desks? 
SETTING INTEREST RATES
The first task of any Fed governor is to help set monetary policy, with the goal of keeping inflation in check and maximizing employment in the world's biggest economy.
Eight times a year, the Fed's governors and the presidents of the 12 regional Fed banks hold a two-day policy meeting, usually in the two-story chandeliered boardroom of the U.S. central bank's building in Washington. At the end of each meeting, looked over by a large mural of the United States, they decide whether to raise interest rates, cut them, or leave them alone. 
The Fed's chair and vice chair, along with the president of the New York Fed, lead that process, huddling multiple times ahead of each meeting to assess the economic outlook and sift through policy choices. Fed governors typically spend 20% to 30% of their time on monetary policy, concentrated in an intense one- to two-week period leading up to each policy meeting.
Emergency Fed actions during periods such as the 2007-2009 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 threw that schedule out the window, with meetings lasting from early morning to the late evening.
MAKING THEIR MARK ELSEWHERE
A large chunk of time is then taken up by the governors' committee work, from roles regulating the banking industry to overseeing financial stability, payments, the regional Fed banks, community outreach efforts, the research agenda, and the central bank's own inner administrative workings.
""Those committees https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm are real work,"" said Betsy Duke, who was a Fed governor from 2008 to 2013. ""You couldn't possibly go into this job as a one-issue person.""
Governors typically chair a committee and serve on a couple of others, usually according to their expertise and interest. Raskin, for example, would lead the committee on supervision and regulation, driving policy on bank oversight including capital requirements and annual ""stress tests,"" setting rules governing financial technology firms, and helping shape the Fed's approach to climate-change risk, among other tasks.
GIVING SPEECHES, DELIVERING PROJECTS
The job also typically includes a range of other work like giving speeches, running special projects or acting as the Fed's point person for a region or international group. The mix depends largely on the interests of each particular governor.
""There is no playbook,"" said Randall Kroszner, a Fed governor from 2006 to 2009, noting there is deference to members who want to shape their own path on the board.
Former Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida spearheaded a year-and-a-half review of the Fed's policy framework that helped shape the central bank's aggressive response to the pandemic. Governor Lael Brainard, recently nominated to take over from Clarida, gave 15 speeches last year, more than any of her colleagues, laying out her thinking on everything from monetary policy to digital currencies to climate change. 
By contrast, Governor Michelle Bowman, who chairs a subcommittee on small banks, has largely focused on community banking and related issues. 
NAVIGATING FED'S CULTURE
One thing is certain: it likely will take some time for Cook and Jefferson, despite his stint as a research economist at the Fed, to get up and running as they come to grips with the vast apparatus they will help oversee, as well as the idiosyncrasies of the central bank's culture.
The Fed's board employs more than 2,500 people, including more than 400 PhD-holding economists, while the wider Fed banking system has almost 23,000 employees. 
""That first few months or a year is challenging because the Fed is so complex,"" said Andrew Levin, a former Fed staffer who is now a professor of economics at Dartmouth College. ""There's just a learning curve.""
The exception is Raskin, who having served as a governor from 2010 to 2014, will likely quickly slot back in.
The governors' offices are housed along the same corridor at the Fed's imposing headquarters in Washington, but government transparency regulations mean only a maximum of three governors are allowed to meet informally to discuss work at any time.
For new recruits, that means no quick way of getting a lending hand from more seasoned colleagues. To comply with the rules, staffers usually brief governors individually or in small groups ahead of formal meetings, rather than all at once, removing the chance to hear fellow governors' questions and concerns. 
""That was a bit frustrating,"" said Kroszner, who contrasts it with the semi-open door policy practiced in much of academia and the corporate world. ""Sometimes you just want to talk through some ideas with your fellow governors, not in a formal decision-making way, but just bounce ideas and get some views.""
PROVIDING DIVERSITY OF VIEWS

The Fed seeks to reflect the diversity of America in shaping its policy decisions, but has struggled to do so. Fed governors have tended to be men and come predominantly from careers in law, banking and business, although there have been at least three farmers, a member of the military, and a newspaper owner.
The addition of Cook, who would be the first Black woman to become a Fed governor, and Jefferson, only the fourth Black man, would give the board a record four women and make it more racially diverse than it has ever been. But by occupation it would be less so - the additions would bring to four its number of economists.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -One of President Joe Biden's nominees for the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors received a key Republican endorsement on Thursday when the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee called Philip Jefferson 'well-suited' to the job, a strong indication that he may soon be confirmed. 
But Republican Senator Pat Toomey took aim at two of Biden's other nominees for top U.S. central bank positions, signaling they could face a harder path to confirmation in the closely divided Senate. 
""I think Professor Jefferson is well suited to the position for which he has been nominated,"" Toomey, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, said during a confirmation hearing for Jefferson, Michigan State University economics professor Lisa Cook and former Fed Governor Sarah Bloom Raskin.
Jefferson is the dean of faculty at Davidson College in North Carolina. 
Toomey's remarks followed harsher comments he made about Cook, who Biden has nominated to be a Fed governor, and Raskin, who was nominated to be the central bank's top banking regulator. 
The Pennsylvania Republican said he is concerned the Fed could become political through its work related to climate change and racial inequality. 
Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, who heads the Senate Banking Committee, expressed support for all three nominees at the start of the hearing and said he expects they will be confirmed.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors seeking to gauge the impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-hiking plans are keeping an eye on less closely watched corners of the U.S. Treasuries market that appear to have priced in the risk of a sharp economic slowdown.
The shape of the U.S. Treasuries yield curve reveals monetary policy and economic growth expectations, and curve inversions - which happen when shorter-dated debt yields more than government bonds with longer maturities - are seen as presaging recessions, particularly in the closely followed two-year and 10-year spread. 
Analysts are pointing to inversions in lesser-followed sections of the curve: The yield premium of U.S. Treasury 10-year bonds over seven-year notes went negative in intraday trade last week for the first time since mid December, and forwards contracts saw an inversion. 
""Whenever you see an inversion, it does raise concerns,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.
Technical factors may contribute to some of those inversions, but some investors still see them as reflecting broader concerns that the U.S. central bank may hurt the economy by hiking interest rates too aggressively to counter inflation.
""Markets are still a little bit nervous of the Fed overshooting,"" said John Herrmann, director of U.S. interest rates forecasts and strategy at NatWest Markets Securities.
""When I talk to clients, 90% of clients are in the camp that they're worried over the next two years to three years that the Fed does a policy mistake,"" he said, pointing to concerns that the Fed may have to resort to cutting rates after raising them, should its planned policy tightening damage the economic outlook.
Yields of shorter-dated U.S. government bonds have been rising at a much faster pace this year than longer paper, flattening the curve on expectations of an aggressive path of interest rate hikes. 
""That sort of dynamic in the spot market is going to translate into much flatter forward curves in the forward market,"" said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
""So it's not something that's imminent ... but it's not something that you totally ignore either.""
The yield curve steepened slightly this week after Fed officials spoke cautiously about the central bank's path after a widely expected March hike.
'RARE EVENT'
Investors typically look at inversions between two-year and 10-year notes as a classic sign that a recession may be coming in about one to two years. That part of the curve is not close to inversion, although it has been flattening sharply. 
Other inversions, such as the one between three-month bills and 10-year notes, are also closely watched for their recession-presaging track record. That spread is also not close to inversion. 
However, other parts of the curve have inverted.
The 7s/10s spread became negative briefly last week. The 20s/30s spread, in negative territory since late October, has widened to about -6 basis points from -3.30 bps on Dec. 31. 
Those parts of the curve are influenced by supply and demand dynamics that make them less relevant for recession risk. For instance, pension and insurance companies looking to invest long-term tend to park their money in 30-year bonds more than 20-year ones, reducing the spread between those two maturities.
Additionally, in a flight-to-safety scenario such as when stocks tumble, investors would typically buy 10-year Treasuries, therefore reducing their premium over seven-year paper.
Still, ""it's really hard to know how much of that is technical versus something fundamental,"" Rajappa said in reference to the brief inversion of the 7s/10s curve.
In the forwards market, which prices Treasuries for future deliveries, the two-year forward curve measuring the gap between two-year and 30-year Treasuries inverted on Monday, Citi analysts said in a note, calling it a ""rare event"".
Five-year and seven-year Treasuries yields were inverted in two- and three-year forward contracts on Monday, said Herrmann.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said on Wednesday that a yield curve inversion this time around may not be the perfect predictor of a recession, given current economic conditions and the Fed's focus on reducing inflation.

Matthew Nest, global head of active fixed income at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, said he was focused on the 2s/10s and 5s/30s curves, rather than the forward market. The 5s/30s curve has also been flattening this year.
""Curve inversions generally lead recession by 12-18 months so if the curve inverts in two years time, it is likely three years before recession becomes a real threat,"" Nest said.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece plans to repay more than 7 billion euros in loans from the International Monetary Fund and eurozone partners in the next two months, paying down the rest of the IMF funds it borrowed to prevent bankruptcy during the financial crisis, two officials said.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters on Thursday the Treasury would repay 1.8 billion euros ($2.03 billion) in IMF loans ahead of schedule, the last batch of a total 28 billion euros the lender provided in two bailouts between 2010 and 2014. 
In addition, it would repay some 5.3 billion euros in loans from Greece's eurozone partners expiring in 2022 and 2023 by the end of the first quarter.
""We plan to complete the repayment in the next two months,"" one official told Reuters.
""This will help us reduce our debt to GDP ratio. It will also send a signal to the markets that the Greek economy is strong and healthy,"" a second official added. 
Athens needed three international bailouts from the European Union and the IMF between 2010 and 2015, totalling more than 260 billion euros. Since exiting the bailouts in 2018, it has relied solely on the markets for its financing needs. 
Greece repaid about 6 billion euros to the IMF ahead of schedule in 2019 and 2021 and has 1.8 billion euros in outstanding loans due by 2024.
It started paying off the first bailout loans to its euro zone partners last year and wants to speed up the pace.
Disagreements and confrontations between the IMF delegation in Athens and successive Greek governments over the harsh austerity conditions imposed by the fund were frequent during the crisis years when Greece was in deep recession with unemployment reaching as high as 27%.
Greece expects to exit enhanced surveillance conditions that allow the European Commission to closely scrutinize its adherence to commitments in the summer. IMF could continue to provide advice and counsel.

The government is estimating the economy grew 9% in 2021 after the economy rebounded from the first wave of COVID lockdowns and forecasting growth of more than 5% this year. It has a cash buffer of about 32 billion euros, enough to cover at least three years of maturing debt.

(Reuters) - Stocktwits.com, one of the social media sites at the heart of last year's retail trading mania, launched a crypto trading platform on Thursday, looking to tap into the growing interest in trading bitcoin and other digital tokens.
Along with Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, Stocktwits was among the online message boards used by an army of retail traders last year to drive huge gains in meme stocks GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC, costing bearish hedge funds billions of dollars. 
Stocktwits, which has more than six million registered users, said it would offer its customers the option to make their trades or portfolio public.
Cryptocurrencies gained immense popularity last year, with bitcoin hitting a peak of $69,000 in November, as risk-on investors sought different asset classes in a market flooded with liquidity, although the currency has nearly halved in value since then on inflation fears and worries of aggressive rate hikes by central banks.
The New York-based company said is partnering with cryptocurrency exchange FTX US, which was valued at $8 billion in its first funding round last month.
""While crypto is the first leg, it's not where we stop,"" Rishi Khanna, chief executive officer of Stocktwits, said. 
The company is planning to launch U.S. equities trading by early next quarter, with trading in stock options, crypto derivatives and other asset classes lined up ahead.
Stocktwits members use a cashtag — a dollar sign before a stock ticker — to share their stock tips or ideas related to a company. The social media firm then analyses posts and message volumes around the ticker to aggregate sentiment and list out the most touted stocks on its platform.

The company's new feature introduces a transaction-based revenue model, which would add to its primary revenue stream on the social media side — advertising, Khanna said. 
Stocktwits' existing investors include Alameda Research Ventures, ffVC, Foundry Group, Social Leverage, Times Bridge, and True Ventures.

470,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 09:13AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. worker productivity rebounded more than expected in the fourth quarter, curbing labor costs growth, but the coronavirus pandemic has distorted the data and prevented a clear trend.
The Labor Department said on Thursday that nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 6.6% annualized rate last quarter. Data for the third quarter was revised up to show productivity declining at a 5.0% rate instead of the previously reported 5.2% pace.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity would rebound at a 3.2% rate. Productivity has been volatile since the pandemic started in the United States three years ago. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, productivity grew at a 2.0% pace. Productivity increased at a 1.9% rate in 2021, slowing the 2.4% growth logged in 2020. 
Hours worked rose at a 2.4% rate last quarter, pulling back from the 7.3% growth pace in the October-December period.
Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - advanced at a 0.3% rate. They surged at a 9.3% pace in the third quarter. Unit labor costs rose at a 3.1% rate from a year ago. They grew 3.3% in 2021 after increasing 4.5% in 2020.
Last quarter's tepid rise likely does not offer an accurate picture of labor costs for businesses.

The government reported last week that the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 1.0% in the fourth quarter after increasing 1.3% in the July-September period. Labor costs surged 4.0% on a year-on-year basis, the largest rise since the fourth quarter of 2001.
Thursday's productivity report also showed hourly compensation surging at a 6.9% rate last quarter. That followed a 3.9% growth pace in the third quarter. Compensation increased at a 5.1% rate compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. It increased 5.2% in 2021 after rising 7.0% in 2020.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's flag carrier El Al Airlines, forced to slim down following a government bailout during the pandemic, said on Thursday it has entered a non-binding memorandum of understanding to buy smaller local rival Arkia.
Under the proposed deal, Arkia would become a fully-owned subsidiary of El Al. In return, Arkia's shareholders would get a 10%-14% stake in El Al through shares and options, the airline said in a regulatory filing.
Arkia, in its own statement, said the deal stipulates it would continue operating as an independent brand.
""We still have a long way to go before the deal to acquire Arkia is completed, which is part of El Al's strategy to expand into additional areas of activity,"" said El Al chairman Amikam Ben Zvi.
Any deal would need approval from the government, Israel's competition regulator and the companies' labor unions.
The companies hope to reach a binding agreement 30 days after a month of due diligence. After that they will have up to 150 days to complete the transaction.
El Al in 2018 had sought to buy another small carrier, Israir, but the competition regulator did not allow the merger.
Shares in El Al were up 8.7% to 3.86 shekels in afternoon trading in Tel Aviv.
El Al said in October it had entered talks with Arkia regarding a possible acquisition. Both airlines have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with Israel's borders largely closed to foreign tourists since March 2020.
In exchange for a government bailout, El Al -- which recently changed ownership and management -- was forced to trim its workforce by one-third, eliminate routes and reduce its all Boeing (NYSE:BA) fleet size to 29 from 45 planes.

Privately owned by the Nakash Group, Arkia has seven aircraft and mainly flies domestic routes and to Europe using Embraer and Airbus aircraft.
El Al has long been interested in flying to the Red Sea resort city of Eilat in southern Israel -- a route controlled by Arkia and Israir.

The company, whose shares fell 2.7% before the bell, reported a decline in sales in three out of its four segments, with its Safety and Productivity Solutions unit — that makes masks — seeing a 10% slide in the fourth quarter.
Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) expects lower demand for masks this year, mirroring what rival 3M Co said last week, although the latter had said near-term demand for its N95 respirators had picked up.
Sales at Honeywell's high-margin aerospace segment, which makes parts for planes produced by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY), also fell 3% as raw material and parts shortages hit sales.
Supply chain problems, along with inflationary pressures, hit Honeywell's earnings last year and analysts have been lowering their sales expectations for the quarter over the last two months. The company's sales still missed expectations.
Total sales for the fourth quarter slid 2% to $8.66 billion, compared with analysts' expectations of $8.73 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Price increases to combat inflation helped Honeywell post a rise in profit. Its net income rose 5% to $1.43 billion, or $2.05 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.36 billion or $1.91 per share a year earlier.

Excluding items, Honeywell earned $2.09 for the fourth quarter, beating expectations by one cent.
The company forecast 2022 sales of $35.4 billion to $36.4 billion, lower than analyst estimate of $36.76 billion.

(Reuters) - Investor Kyle Bass, who spent much of his career betting on sovereign debt crises and interest rates, is shifting focus from hedge funds to the environment with a firm that will buy rural land and create environmental mitigation offsets.
The new firm, Conservation Equity Management, was officially launched on Thursday and plans to rebuild wetlands, streams, and endangered species habitats to help create offsets, or tradable credits, to diminish the ecological damage from development. These types of credits are highly sought after by large corporations and developers which generate emissions in their businesses but are pledging to cut or offset them.
The land in Texas and nearby states might also be used for regenerative cattle grazing and renewable energy, Bass said. And the firm plans to elevate the ecosystem of the properties it buys and then sell the parcels for more over time.
Bass, who grew up playing in streams and woodlands near his home in Texas, is pivoting to a new form of investing as pension funds, endowments and wealthy families search for ways to make money while improving the environment.
""This is the right moment for Conservation Equity,"" Bass said.
""As more companies and people move to Texas and other pro-business, low-tax states, there will be devastating environmental consequences, forcing firms to consider their physical environmental impacts, carbon footprints and mitigation options.""
The new firm marks a fresh chapter in the life of a hedge fund manager who rose to prominence by having bet against the overheated housing market during the financial crisis and later on Greek debt and the Japanese yen.
Bass launched Hayman Capital Management in late 2005 in Dallas and in 2007 the fund gained 200% on bets against the subprime market. By the end of 2020, Hayman's assets had dwindled to roughly $300 million and Bass decided to return the bulk of the money to investors in 2021 after having earned them a return of 14% in the first three quarters of the year.
Now he has teamed with forester and biologist Terry Anderson to shift into a more private-equity focused firm he says will pay off over time, as investors need hard assets like real estate as a hedge against rising prices and federal monetary policy sparked by the pandemic.

""Conservation Equity seeks to capitalize on meaningful trends in geography, migration, central bank balance sheet expansion, and rural land as an asset class in order to offer investors both purpose and profits,"" Bass said.
Conservation Equity Management has already completed two transactions: the Bahia Grande Conservation Parcel and the Cherokee Ridge River Farm, where Bass held an investor meeting this week as a winter storm hit the area.

474,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 07:56AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Following is the statement from the European Central Bank following its policy meeting.
The Governing Council confirmed the decisions taken at its monetary policy meeting last December.
Pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) In the first quarter of 2022, the Governing Council is conducting net asset purchases under the PEPP at a lower pace than in the previous quarter.
It will discontinue net asset purchases under the PEPP at the end of March 2022.
The Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2024.
In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made the Governing Council’s efforts to achieve its goal more effective.
Within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability.
In particular, in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time.
This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic.
Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic.
Asset purchase programme (APP) In line with the step-by-step reduction in asset purchases decided on in December 2021 and to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with inflation stabilising at the Governing Council’s target over the medium term, monthly net purchases under the APP will amount to €40 billion in the second quarter of 2022 and €30 billion in the third quarter.
From October onwards, the Governing Council will maintain net asset purchases under the APP at a monthly pace of €20 billion for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates.
The Governing Council expects net purchases to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.
The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
Key ECB interest rates The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.
In support of its symmetric 2% inflation target and in line with its monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it sees inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term.
This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target.
Refinancing operations The Governing Council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy.
The Governing Council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance.
As announced, it expects the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III to end in June this year.
The Governing Council will also assess the appropriate calibration of its two-tier system for reserve remuneration so that the negative interest rate policy does not limit banks’ intermediation capacity in an environment of ample excess liquidity.

*** The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's dollar will strengthen more than previously thought over the coming year as oil prices climb and investors bet the Bank of Canada will hike interest rates at a faster pace than the Federal Reserve, a Reuters poll showed.
The median forecast in the Reuters poll was for the Canadian dollar to gain around 2% to 1.25 per U.S. dollar, or 80 U.S. cents in three months, compared to 1.26 in last month's forecast.
It was then expected to climb to 1.22 in a year's time.
Oil is one of Canada's major exports. Its price has climbed to nearly $90 a barrel, the highest since October 2014, and some experts are expecting further gains.
""Our energy analyst in the Middle East has just raised quite notably his forecasts for crude oil for 2022,"" said Derek Halpenny, head of research, global markets EMEA and international securities, MUFG Bank. ""We see that as one of the factors helping lift CAD.""
Major oil producers blame surging prices on the failure of consuming nations to ensure adequate investment in fossil fuels as they shift to greener energy, while recent tensions between Russia and Western powers have added to concerns about tight supply.
The potential for the Bank of Canada to tighten monetary policy more than the Federal Reserve in 2022 could also support the loonie, Halpenny said.
Last week, Canada's central bank left its benchmark interest rate on hold at a record low of 0.25% but said hikes would be needed to cool inflation. Money markets expect the first hike in March and six in total this year, which is one more than expected from the Fed.
Canada's economy climbed to above pre-pandemic levels for the first time in November, while a preliminary estimate shows gross domestic product grew an annualized 6.3% in the fourth quarter, beating the BoC's forecast of 5.8%.
The Canadian dollar was the only G10 currency to gain ground against the greenback in 2021, rising 0.8%.

Potential for further gains has not been lost on speculators. They have raised bullish bets on the currency to the highest level since July last year, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows.

476,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 07:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England hiked its key interest rate as part of a package of measures to contain inflation that’s on course to top 7%, as policy makers came within a whisker of delivering an unprecedented 50-basis point increase.
The increase to 0.5% from 0.25% was supported by five of the bank’s nine policy makers. In a surprise move, four voted for a bigger hike, to 0.75%, an increase that has not been seen since the bank gained independence in 1997. All said further modest tightening would be needed in coming months.
Officials also signaled the start of a new era for the 895 billion pounds of bond holdings amassed over the past decade under quantitative easing, and unanimously voted to begin the process of shrinking the balance sheet.
The BOE will immediately stop reinvesting the proceeds of expired gilts, allowing more than 200 billion pounds to run off by 2025, and announced plans to offload the entire 20 billion pound stock of corporate bonds by the end of 2023.
“Some further modest tightening is likely to be appropriate in the coming months” if the economy evolves as the BOE expects, the rate-setting committee added.
Stressing its inflation-fighting mandate, the BOE said that “the remit is clear the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the U.K. monetary policy framework.”
BOE officials lifted their forecasts for the peak of inflation to 7.25% in April, more than triple the BOE’s 2% target. Inflation had previously been expected to peak around 6%.
They also said the labor market remains very tight. They sharply increased their wage-growth forecasting, predicting the underlying pace will hit 4.75% in the coming year. Higher energy prices added further pressure, while cost of living pressures will slow GDP growth.
Against that backdrop, four officials - Dave Ramsden, Michael Saunders, Catherine Mann and Jonathan Haskel - voted to boost rates by 50 basis points, seeing the need to act faster to curb inflation expectations. The majority, including Governor Andrew Bailey, opted for the 25-basis-point rise.
The increase marks the first back-to-back hike since 2004. Bailey will hold a press conference at 12.30 p.m. in London to explain the decision.
The U.K. central bank is leading the way in a global tightening of monetary policy, as institutions move to tackle a rapid acceleration of prices in the aftermath of pandemic lockdowns. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to unleash its own rapid tightening cycle this year, and there has been speculation that may include a 50-basis-point hike.
The decision also comes with the U.K. in the grip of a cost of living crisis, which will bite harder starting in April when higher taxes and energy prices hit consumers.
Despite the improved outlook for wages, the BOE warned that real household incomes, after adjusting for inflation and tax rises, will shrink both this year and next.
An hour before the BOE’s announcement, the U.K. energy regulator Ofgem said the energy bill for a typical household will rise 54%, or around pounds, in April.
While the BOE admitted the hike itself can do little to address those immediate price rises, they stressed it was necessary to anchor longer-term stability. The government is preparing a multi-billion pound package of measures to mitigate the impact of rising energy bills. The measures may also bring down the headline rate of inflation.
“The sharp rises in prices of global energy and tradable goods of which the U.K. is a net importer will weigh on real aggregate income and spending. This is something monetary policy is unable to prevent,” the BOE said.
The squeeze on incomes will drive unemployment up to 5%, from around 4% now, and lead to increased slack in the economy by the end of the forecast period. The economy is expected to return to its pre-pandemic level this quarter, with growth recovering from the hit from omicron restrictions in February and March. 
After that, growth is expected to slow to “subdued rates”, with a slightly weaker outlook than in November due to the impact of the cost of living crisis. 
The BOE currently forecasts inflation will be a little above target in two years’ time, and drop below their goal in three years. The projection is based on interest rates reaching 1.5% by the middle of next year, which suggests the BOE may not go that far.
An alternative scenario, based on energy prices following their futures curve, rather than remaining constant after six months, would lead to inflation dropping to around 0.75 points below target in two and three years’ time.
Markets have priced in steeper hikes since the forecast window was closed, and are close to pricing in a level of 1.5% by the end of this year. That would imply the biggest tightening of policy for any calendar year since 1997. 
The BOE also said it would immediately halt the process of reinvesting the proceeds from expired bonds held under its QE program, the first step in reducing its mammoth 895 billion pounds of holdings.
That will start in March, when 28 billion pounds of gilts mature. The bank reiterated it will start considering accelerating the process by pursuing active sales once rates hit at least 1%.
The bank also said it will halt reinvestments of its 20 billion pound corporate bond plan, and design a programme for outright sales. That will see the entire stock unwound by towards the end of 2023 at the earliest.

Tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol, signed as part of Britain's exit from the EU, flared on Wednesday when the British province's Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots ordered an immediate halt to checks on agri-food goods coming into the region from the rest of the United Kingdom.

""Checks are continuing to take place at ports in Northern Ireland as they have done before,"" Johnson's spokesman told reporters.
""We are monitoring the situation closely and keeping the legal position under review .... The operation of those checks is a matter for the Northern Ireland executive ... We want the executive to resolve this issue in the first instance and we are in close contact with them.""

Investing.com -- Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms is set for a $200 billion wipeout when it opens later, after reporting a drop in users and predicting more pain from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy settings late on Thursday. The mixed performance of the so-called FAANG stocks will make Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s earnings after the bell particularly interesting. Jobless claims data are due, a day after a shocking fall in private employment in January. The Bank of England is expected to raise its key rate for the second meeting in a row, but the European Central Bank is set to stay strictly in talking mode. Shell (LON:RDSa) adds to the good news from Big Oil. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 3rd February.
1.  Meta's Mega Selloff 
Facebook owner Meta Platforms is set to lose nearly $200 billion of market value when it opens later, after reporting its first ever drop in daily active users and a broader set of quarterly numbers that spelled various kinds of trouble for the company.
The company managed another gain in revenue thanks to higher ad rates, but the squeeze from Apple’s new privacy laws is set to get worse this year, costing it $10 billion in revenue, according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Profit, meanwhile, fell due to ever-heavier investment in long-term plays related to the so-called Metaverse.
That makes the Facebook owner the second of the once-untouchable FAANG club to endure a wipeout after its fourth-quarter report (Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) being the first). The numbers will add to the importance of Amazon’s results for market sentiment. The e-commerce giant reports after the close.
2. Jobless claims and unit labor costs
After the shock drop in private hiring in January reported by ADP, there’s an added spice to this week’s jobless claims numbers at 8:30 AM ET, which will show how quickly and to what degree the labor market is getting over the soft patch caused by the wave of Omicron-variant Covid-19. The Institute of Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index for January will also throw out some clues on that score, given that services were disproportionately hard hit by Omicron.
Analysts expect initial claims to have fallen to 245,000 from 260,000 the previous week. If that bears out, then it will put claims firmly back on a path to test their recent lows.
Also due later are data on U.S. unit labor costs for the fourth quarter, which will provide fresh fuel for the inflation debate. 
3. Stocks set to open lower; T-Mobile set for new 2022 high
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower again after Meta’s shocking results sparked fears that even the most reliable cash generators of recent years aren’t immune to abrupt repricings. The owner of Facebook was in good company on Wednesday, with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) also losing a quarter of its value in response to weak earnings and guidance.
 By 6:15 AM ET, Dow futures were down 138 points, or 0.4%, while S&P 500 futures were down 1.3% and NASDAQ 100 futures were down 2.4%, more than reversing Wednesday’s gains.
Late earnings on Wednesday weren’t uniformly negative – T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) blew past expectations and is marked up 7.4% at a new high for the year. McKesson (NYSE:MCK) stock is also set to open at a new all-time high after it handily beat expectations.
Companies reporting early on Thursday include pharma giants Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) and Merck  (NYSE:MRK), along with Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), Cigna (NYSE:CI) and Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX). Joining Amazon later will be  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).
4. ECB and BoE meetings
The Bank of England is set to raise its key interest rate in back-to-back meetings for the first time since before the Great Financial Crisis when its monetary policy council meets later.  Analysts expect a 25-basis point increase to 0.5% in the refinancing rate.
That comes on the same day that the country’s energy markets regulator Ofgem announced it would lift the cap on some energy bills by 54% from April, a move that’s set to take a big bite out of disposable incomes, especially among low earners.
Meanwhile, over in Frankfurt, the European Central Bank will keep its interest rates unchanged despite a shock rise in inflation to 5.1% in January, suggesting that prices will stay higher for longer than the bank anticipated. That means  the key variable will be any change in guidance about the pace at which it runs down its asset purchases after the scheduled end of the Pandemic Emergency program in March.
5. Oil weakens on fresh demand fears
Crude oil prices came off their recent highs after Meta’s earnings and the ADP payrolls report sent a chill through risk assets in general.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 1.5% at $86.91 a barrel, while Brent crude futures were down 1.4% at $88.20 a barrel.
The market has overcome any brief disappointment it may have had about OPEC and its allies not speeding up the return of oil to the global market, but the spread of the new and more infectious subvariant of Omicron is leading to fresh fears that the disruption to demand may last longer than first thought.
Earlier, there was fresh evidence of prices restoring the health of Big Oil, as Shell followed Exxon (NYSE:XOM) in reporting stellar earnings. It also increased its buyback program by $3 billion. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) reports its earnings later."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund is in talks with banks to exercise an extension option on a $15 billion revolving credit facility it took out in March last year, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The Public Investment Fund's one-year loan was provided by 17 banks and has four extension options.
Sources previously said the loan would be used for general corporate purposes. A revolving loan is one that can be drawn, repaid and drawn again during the agreed lending period.
PIF, which is chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and is the engine of his economic transformation plans for Saudi Arabia, declined to comment.
""The lenders obviously have the right to say no when they come and ask for an extension, but given that it's a relationship facility, given everything that's happening in Saudi and how much business people are chasing with PIF, I think they'll get most of the banks - if not all of them - rolling their exposures over,"" one of the sources said.
PIF, which manages about $480 billion in assets, is at the centre of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, a national strategy aimed at diversifying the economy and cutting the kingdom's reliance on hydrocarbons.
The sovereign wealth fund started raising bank debt in 2018 with an $11 billion facility, followed in 2019 by a $10 billion loan, which it then repaid in 2020.
The banks involved in the loan were BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citi, Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), First Abu Dhabi Bank, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC, Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Mizuho,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Natixis, SMBC, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), sources have previously said.
Fitch Ratings on Wednesday assigned PIF an 'A' credit rating, in line with the sovereign's, and said it expected the fund to gradually tap the international debt markets.

Reuters reported last year that PIF was setting up an environmental, social and governance (ESG) framework under which it is likely to issue multibillion-dollar green bonds.
Its governor, Yasir al-Rumayyan, said in September PIF was working with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) on the framework and planned to announce its debut green bonds ""soon"", without providing details.

481,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 04:26AM ET</span>",,,,,,"ROME (Reuters) - World food prices rebounded in January and remained near 10-year highs, led by a jump in the vegetable oils index, the U.N. food agency said on Thursday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 135.7 points last month against an upwardly revised 134.1 in December. That figure was previously given as 133.7.
Higher food prices have contributed to a broader surge in inflation as economies recover from the coronavirus crisis and the FAO has warned that the higher costs are putting poorer populations at risk in countries reliant on imports.
Rome-based FAO also raised its projection of global cereal production in 2021 to 2.793 billion tonnes from a previous estimate of 2.791 billion tonnes, according to its cereal supply and demand outlook.
FAO said its vegetable oils index rose 4.2% month-on-month in January to reach record levels, shunted higher by reduced export availabilities and other supply-side constraints, especially labour shortages and unfavourable weather. 
""There is a concern the impacts of these constraints will not ease quickly,"" Boubaker Ben-Belhassen, head of FAO's Markets and Trade Division, said in a statement.
The FAO dairy price index increased 2.4%, its fifth consecutive monthly rise, with the steepest gains registered by skim milk powder and butter. 
The cereal price index rose just 0.1%, with maize posting a 3.8% gain on the month, spurred by worries about persistent drought conditions in South America, FAO said. 
By contrast, world wheat prices fell 3.1% on the back of large harvests in Australia and Argentina. [GRA/]
Meat prices edged up in January, while sugar was the sole index to post a decrease, shedding 3.1% from the previous month due partly to favourable production prospects in major exporters India and Thailand, FAO said. 
FAO said it raised its projection of global cereal production in 2021 because of larger-than-previously estimated wheat outputs in Argentina and Australia, along with slightly higher production estimates in Russia and Ukraine. 

""For 2022, global wheat plantings are expected to expand, buoyed by mostly conducive weather conditions in the northern hemisphere, although high input costs could deter a larger expansion,"" FAO said.
World cereal utilization in 2021/22 was forecast to rise 1.6% above the 2020/21 level, hitting 2.805 billion tonnes. FAO's forecast for world cereal stocks by the close of seasons in 2022 stood at 824 million tonnes, up 2.2 million tonnes since November and only slightly lower than their opening levels.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -ING Groep NV reported higher-than-expected provisions in its fourth quarter earnings report on Thursday, as the largest Dutch bank braced for the impact of higher inflation on customers.
ING reported a 27% rise in fourth-quarter pretax profit to 1.33 billion euros ($1.50 billion), slightly below analyst forecasts of 1.47 billion euros, according to Refinitiv data. Pretax profit was 1.05 billion euros in the same period of 2020.
""The slight miss is driven by higher costs and provisions, partly offset by higher revenues,"" said analysts from Jefferies in a note on earnings.
Shares, which have nearly doubled over the past year, were down 4.0% at 12.97 euros at 0823 GMT.
Provisions for bad loans in the quarter increased to 356 million euros from 208 million euros, with most of the increase due to the expectation that rising inflation and energy costs could hurt mortgage customers' ability to pay.
While property values are currently rising in ING's core German and Dutch markets, and actual defaults have been limited, Van Rijswijk said the company thought it was prudent to take the provisions.
The value of commercial loan collateral is also tied to inflation and interest rates, CEO Stephen van Rijswijk said.
""Inflation we have now seen moving up quite steeply -- then there is a potential risk that the collateral value goes down, so in case then of a default at a client it also means that our recovery rate would go down,"" he said.
Van Rijswijk said positives in the quarter included higher lending volumes and strong fee growth.
Among key bank profitability measures, ING's net interest margin shrank slightly from a year earlier to 1.37% from 1.41%. The bank has been under pressure from low interest rates, although it softened the blow by charging negative rates on larger customer deposits.
Fee and commission income rose 20% to 925 million euros as the bank charged retail customers more for banking packages, for payments, and for investment products.

Customer loans climbed 4.8% or by 13.4 billion euros to 632 billion euros, with good growth seen among wholesale banking customers and more mortgage loans to German customers.

483,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 03:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia (NYSE:NOK) on Thursday restarted its quarterly dividend and initiated a share buyback programme after reporting fourth-quarter comparable operating earnings above markets estimates as the Finnish telecoms equipment maker kept costs in check.
The company also forecast annual revenue largely ahead of projections and set a long-term target for operating margins of at least 14%, replacing its earlier 2023 target of between 11% and 13%.
A slew of technology missteps in the early stages of 5G rollout pushed Nokia behind its rivals, prompting a change in management. Since Pekka Lundmark took over as CEO in 2020, he found ways to cut costs and increase spending on research.
""We have now largely caught up competition in 5G,"" Lundmark said in an interview. ""We have created a foundation for growth acceleration, the year of reset is behind us, now we are accelerating.""
While the ban of rival Huawei in some markets had helped Nokia to claw back market share, it faced a setback when long-time U.S. customer Verizon (NYSE:VZ) chose to give a multi-billion-dollar contract to Samsung (KS:005930).
That contract loss still hurt fourth-quarter revenue that fell 2% to 6.41 billion, missing expectations of 6.47 billion, a Refinitiv poll showed.
""We have established a new baseline in North America and we do see growth opportunities there,"" Lundmark said, adding the upcoming 5G auctions in countries such as India would present further growth avenues.
Nokia's fourth-quarter adjusted operating profit of 908 million euros beat the 822 million euros expected by analysts.
Lundmark said he was keeping options open when it came to the question of acquiring companies to strengthen its technology position just like rival Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), which has splurged billions of dollars in acquiring companies.
Nokia also proposed a dividend, suspended since 2019, of 8 euro cents per share for 2021, and start a share buyback scheme of 600 million euros.
Nokia predicted its 2022 revenue will amount to between 22.6 billion euros and 23.8 billion euros ($25.5 billion-$26.9 billion), up from 22.2 billion last year. Analysts on average expected revenue of 23.06 billion, a Refinitiv poll showed.
For 2021, the company reported revenue of 22.2 billion - a growth of 3% in constant currency.

""At least there was growth, which has not always been the case in the past few years,"" Lundmark said.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Polish zloty should lead gains among central European currencies over the next 12 months as it plays catch-up with its peers, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, although the start of U.S. Fed rate hikes will take some shine off the region.
Expectations of rising U.S. interest rates and a strengthening dollar should continue to drag on central Europe now the Federal Reserve has flagged a March interest rate rise.
But with policy tightening already underway in central Europe, currencies have started 2022 with gains, led by a hefty 3.9% rise in the Hungarian forint and 2.4% increase in the Czech crown, as of Tuesday's close.
The zloty, up only half a percent to begin the year, will appreciate with an expected 1.7% rise over Tuesday's close, firming to 4.495 to the euro in a year's time.
""Generally all the currencies should benefit from tightening of local monetary policy,"" said Krystian Jaworski, senior economist at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) in Warsaw.
""Still, the intensifying market expectations of tightening by the Fed and European Central Bank will limit the room for significant appreciation.""
The National Bank of Poland, battling inflation that is already at a more than two-decade high of 8.6%, has lifted its main rate by 215 basis points to 2.25% since October. More hikes are expected. 
Similarly, the Czech National Bank, the region's most aggressive in policy tightening amid the prices spike, meets on Thursday and analysts forecast a 75 basis point hike to the main rate, putting it above 4% for the first time in 20 years. 
But rates should soon peak and the poll saw the crown, which hit its highest since 2011 in January, easing 2.1% to 24.8 to the euro in the coming year, a similar forecast to a poll month ago.
Hungary's forint should reach stronger ground in the coming 12 months after short-term easing in the first quarter. Analysts see the forint at 353.50 to the euro in a year, a 0.5% rise.
""No matter how strong the (central bank's) push to bring down inflation, the market's focus could easily wander to the upcoming risk events, creating some short-term selling pressure,"" ING said, mentioning Budapest's disputes with the European Union and an upcoming April election.

In Romania, the leu, a laggard in the region due to budget and political uncertainties while its central bank has been less aggressive in policy tightening, was forecast to ease to 5.00 to the euro, 1.1% down from Tuesday's close.

If you were hoping for calm before Thursday's Bank of England and European Central Bank meetings, forget it.
U.S. stock futures are down sharply in early London trade -- Nasdaq futures are sliding 2% with tech stocks globally in the doldrums.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc's shares plunged more than late on Wednesday after posting weaker-than-expected forecasts. In Japan,  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) and Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) shares fell over 6%, while stock futures point to a weak open in Europe.
That's all before the BoE looks set to hike its key rate 25 basis points to 0.5% -- the threshold at which it has said it will start unwinding its 895 billion pound ($1.2 trillion) quantitative easing programme.
For some, markets are underestimating the risks of so called quantitative tightening, QT for short. Others note the BoE's ability to surprise, noting November when markets were positioned for a rate hike and the BoE left rates unchanged and then December, when markets expected no move and the BoE hiked.
The takeaway? The BoE's decision at 1200 GMT may not bring what we all expect. 
The ECB meanwhile is not expected to change policy on Thursday. But ECB President Christine Lagarde may have to acknowledge that inflation could stay high for longer than it had projected, a signal that may be taken by some as a hint at a faster exit from stimulus.
Data on Wednesday showed a 5.1% January inflation print, the highest ever for the euro zone.
Markets price 30 bps of tightening by year-end; the ECB insists a move in 2022 is unlikely. 
If Lagarde admits price pressures have been underestimated, rate-hike bets could be bought forward, triggering an unwanted tightening of financing conditions.
Meanwhile data out this morning showed that Turkey's annual inflation soared to near-50% and producer prices to more than 90%, heaping fresh pressure on the lira.
Oh yes, let the fun begin.

LONDON (Reuters) - Facing pressure to curb surging inflation, the Bank of England looks set to raise interest rates again on Thursday and signal further unwinding of its pandemic stimulus, including a gradual reversal of its huge bond-buying plan.
Twenty-nine of 45 economists polled by Reuters late last month said the BoE would raise Bank Rate to 0.5% from 0.25% at its February meeting, hot on the heels of December's rate hike, the first by a major central bank since the pandemic. [ECILT/GB]
It would mark the first back-to-back borrowing cost increases by the BoE since 2004, reflecting an urgent need to show it is on top of an inflationary surge.
Separately, British finance minister Rishi Sunak was expected to announce on Thursday measures to smooth a possible 50% jump in household energy bills.
The BoE forecast in December that inflation would peak at around 6% in April but price growth that month jumped by more than expected to 5.4%, its highest in almost 30 years.
The labour market has also tightened, something Governor Andrew Bailey says is key to the monetary policy outlook.
Data published on Thursday showed employers were offering higher pay deals in the face of staff shortages and rising inflation.
""Members are likely to disregard what looks set to be a temporary bump in the path of the economic recovery around the turn of the year due to the spread of the Omicron variant,"" said Investec chief economist Philip Shaw, predicting an unanimous 9-0 vote by the Monetary Policy Committee to raise rates.
The BoE's stance contrasts with the European Central Bank, which looks set to leave policy on hold on Thursday.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is signalling a first rate hike in March although officials spoke cautiously on Monday about what might follow.
Investors will be looking for signs in the BoE's new inflation forecasts whether it thinks investors are being too aggressive by betting on the Bank Rate reaching 1.5% by the end of 2022.
But Bailey may be wary about sending explicit messages after the BoE wrong-footed many investors last year.
Among MPC members, only Catherine Mann, Bailey and Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe have spoken publicly in 2022.
""After the BoE's communications fiasco late last year, it has decided to respond by saying less rather than more,"" said JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Allan Monks, cautioning that investors' conviction about a 25 basis point hike might be overdone.
The announcement is due at 1200 GMT. Bailey will lead a news conference half an hour later.
LITTLE QT
If rates do go up to 0.5%, it marks the point at which the BoE has said it will begin a process called quantitative tightening (QT) - or reducing its vast holdings of government bonds, bought to stimulate Britain's economy.
The BoE has said it will start by not reinvesting money from maturing gilts, possibly as soon as March when 25 billion pounds of bonds it owns are due to mature.
Bond investors want to know if the BoE intends to accelerate the QT process.
Last August, it said it would start to sell its gilts once Bank Rate hits at least 1%, depending on economic circumstances.
""Even though the market is actively pricing such a scenario, we continue to doubt that the hiking cycle will get that far,"" said Rabobank strategist Stefan Koopman, who warned the BoE might find itself raising rates just as the economy slows.
Tax hikes on workers, as well as rising energy and food bills, are set to intensify a cost-of-living squeeze.

A survey from insurance and pensions company Aegon (NYSE:AEG) showed 38% of Britons were worried that rising interest rates would hit their finances. An Ipsos MORI poll for the Evening Standard newspaper showed economic morale at a one-year low.

LONDON (Reuters) -With surging inflation and central bank policy occupying investors' minds, the traditional market playbook on how to react to military flare-ups has been thrown out of the window.
Unease over Russia's troop build-up near the Ukraine border contributed, alongside U.S. rate-hike jitters, to a 5% slide on Wall Street last month. Yet top-rated government bonds and gold, assets that typically rally when political upheaval or war threaten, failed to benefit. 
U.S. and German bonds - considered the safest assets of all - witnessed their worst month since early 2021, with yields surging 30 and 20 basis points respectively as inflation and the prospect of higher interest rates commanded the spotlight. Gold fell 2%.
It isn't often stocks and bonds fall at the same time. John Briggs, global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets, estimates this has happened in 35 months since 2000 - or roughly 14% of the time. 
The inverse correlation between equities and bonds has long been relied on by investors to safeguard returns in times of trouble, with a 60:40 portfolio split one traditional strategy.
Now though, Briggs says investors ""need to entertain the idea"" that markets could react differently when central banks are focused on responding to higher inflation.
""If we do see a further deterioration in the Ukraine situation, for investors looking for traditional safe havens, some of the old correlations may not hold."" 
Markets' muted reaction to Russian sabre-rattling - it denies it is planning to invade its neighbour - may not come as a surprise to those who note that recent risk events, from missile launches to attacks on Gulf oil facilities, have had only a fleeting impact on investment behaviour. 
What's different this time is that inflation, subdued for decades, is running hot in many countries. Conflict with Russia would further fan inflation fears by boosting oil and food prices.
John Flahive, head of fixed income investments at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Wealth Management, said recent market volatility had left his clients a ""bit unsettled"".
""Normally if you see an equity market that's down 10%, you'd see some flight to quality in your higher-quality fixed income securities and that's really not happening,"" he said.
""So you wake up at the end of January, and there really aren't many portions of your portfolio that have been insulating, and everything is red.""
A typical 60:40 portfolio was down 3.77% in January after a 2.34% rise in December, said Vincent Chaigneau, head of research at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments, although still up 5.3% from the end of January 2021. 
POLICYMAKER HEADACHE
For policymakers trying to exit pandemic-era stimulus and contain inflation, the military threat is an added complication.
The Federal Reserve will likely start raising rates in March, the Bank of England is tipped to hike for the second time in as many months on Thursday and record euro zone inflation could force the European Central Bank to reassess its view that price pressures are temporary.
One question is whether brewing political risks are simply flying too far below the radar for inflation-obsessed markets. But if the tried and tested bond hedge fails to deliver, what options do investors have?
One portfolio manager said clients are increasing exposure to investment grade corporate debt, seen as a stable source of returns.
Investors might also make a beeline for the dollar and other U.S. assets, which tend to outperform during periods of geopolitical tension.
Amundi Asset Management recommends investors stay neutral in terms of risk allocation considering constructive earnings revisions in many sectors, but be ready to reduce risk should the situation materially deteriorate. 
REPRICING 
If tensions escalate and markets reprice expectations for the growth outlook and monetary policy response, safe-haven bonds could yet get their allure back. 
Europe's reliance on Russian gas makes it particularly vulnerable. 
BofA analysts estimate that in an extreme scenario, Brent crude could rise roughly 30% from current levels and natural gas prices could jump 200%, lifting the bank's forecast for headline euro area inflation this year to 4% from 3% but cutting its current GDP forecast of 3.6% by 50 basis points, which would leave the ECB scant room to hike rates.

For Randy Kroszner, a former Fed Governor and now an economic professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Ukraine could prove a geopolitical test case for markets. 
""That's one of the wildcards that we certainly haven't had in recent years -- moving from a cold war to a hot war that could involve Russia and NATO,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury yield curve has been flattening over the last few months as the Federal Reserve prepares to hike rates, and some analysts are forecasting more extreme moves or even inversion. 
The shape of the yield curve is a key metric investors watch as it impacts other asset prices, feeds through to banks' returns and even predicts how the economy will fare. Here's a quick primer explaining what a steep, flat or inverted yield curve means and whether it will forecast the next U.S. recession. 
WHAT IS THE U.S. TREASURY YIELD CURVE? 
The U.S. Treasury finances federal government budget obligations by issuing various forms of debt. The $23 trillion Treasury market includes Treasury bills with maturities from one month out to one year, notes from two years to 10 years, as well as 20-and 30-year bonds.
The yield curve plots the yield of all Treasury securities.
WHAT SHOULD THE CURVE LOOK LIKE? 
Typically, the curve slopes upwards because investors expect more compensation for taking on the risk that rising inflation will lower the expected return from owning longer-dated bonds. That means a 10-year note typically yields more than a 2-year note because it has a longer duration. Yields move inversely to prices. 
A steepening curve typically signals expectations of stronger economic activity, higher inflation, and higher interest rates. A flattening curve can mean the opposite: investors expect rate hikes in the near term and have lost confidence in the economy's growth outlook.
WHY IS THE YIELD CURVE FLATTENING NOW? 
Yields of short-term U.S. government debt have been rising fast this year reflecting expectations of a series of rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, while longer-dated government bond yields have moved at a slower pace amid concerns that policy tightening may hurt the economy.
As a result, the shape of the Treasury yield curve has been generally flattening. A closely watched part of the curve, measuring the spread between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, shows the gap at roughly 60 basis points, nearly 20 points lower than where it ended 2021. That flattening steadied this week as investors viewed some Fed officials as being a bit less hawkish.
While rate increases can be a weapon against inflation, they can also slow economic growth by increasing the cost of borrowing for everything from mortgages to car loans.
Two-year U.S. Treasury yields, which track short-term interest-rate expectations, have risen to 1.16% from 0.73% at the end of last year - a 60% increase.
U.S. benchmark 10-year yields have gone up to about 1.8% from 1.5%, a 20% rise.
WHAT DOES AN INVERTED CURVE MEAN, AND WILL IT HAPPEN?
Some investors and strategists are starting to forecast a curve inversion could happen as soon as this year - an ominous sign.
The U.S. curve has inverted before each recession since 1955, with a recession following between six and 24 months later, according to a 2018 report by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. It offered a false signal just once in that time.
The last time the yield curve inverted was in 2019. The following year the United States entered a recession - albeit one caused by the global pandemic.
Strategists at  Standard Chartered  bank (LON:STAN) forecast the curve to be completely flat by mid-year and potentially invert by year-end. 
Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, has also warned about a possible curve inversion.
DOES THE WHOLE CURVE INVERT OR PARTS OF IT? 
Traders typically watch the shape of the curve determined by comparing two-year and 10-year Treasury notes, because a yield curve inversion on that spread has anticipated previous recessions. That is currently flattening but not yet close to inversion. 
But distortions can occur anywhere along the curve without inverting the entire curve.
On Friday, a less closely watched part of the curve inverted intraday, with the premium of U.S. Treasury 10-year notes over seven-year Treasuries going briefly into negative territory.
The 20-year/30-year spread has been negative since late October, though supply and demand technical factors may have contributed to that. 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE REAL WORLD? 
Aside from signals it may flash on the economy, the shape of the yield curve has ramifications for consumers and business. 

When short-term rates increase, U.S. banks tend to raise their benchmark rates for a wide range of consumer and commercial loans, including small business loans and credit cards, making borrowing more expensive for consumers. Mortgage rates also rise.
When the yield curve steepens, banks are able to borrow money at lower interest rates and lend at higher interest rates. Conversely, when the curve is flatter they find their margins squeezed, which may deter lending.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar's choppy start to the year has not dissuaded some investors from betting the U.S. currency will soon resume its march higher, lifted by a hawkish Federal Reserve and rising real yields. 
The U.S. dollar index is flat on the year, masking a volatile ride in which the greenback swung between gains and losses in January as investors recalibrated how aggressively the Fed will tighten monetary policy in coming months. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar is up about 5% over the past year.
Investors say where the dollar goes from here will be determined in part by real yields, or what a holder of U.S. government bonds expects to receive adjusted for inflation - which have eased in recent days after surging last month. 
Rising real yields tend to boost the dollar’s allure to investors and have been a source of support for the greenback in the past. Though they have come off recent highs in the last few days, some are betting real yields will continue rising in the months ahead if the Fed maintains its hawkish stance, dragging the dollar higher. 
""Since the pandemic, real rates have been driving the dollar ... that's evident today as well,"" said John Velis, FX and macro strategist at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK).
The yield on the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) recently stood at -0.66%, after touching a 19-month high of -0.539% on Jan. 26. Fed Funds futures currently price a total increase of 118 basis points by year-end. 
GRAPHIC: The real deal, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwpkrjaegvm/Pasted%20image%201643643093925.png A rising dollar has far-reaching implications for everything from corporate earnings to the fight against inflation. A stronger dollar allows American consumers to buy goods, services and resources from other countries at lower prices, but it can eat in to profits of American companies that export or rely on global markets for the bulk of their sales. 
Nearly two-thirds of the strategists polled by Reuters last month said interest rate differentials would dictate sentiment in major FX markets in the near term.
Most currencies will struggle to gain against the dollar in coming months, as monetary tightening expected from the Fed will provide the greenback enough impetus to extend its dominance well into 2022, strategists polled by Reuters said. 
Thanos Bardas, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, expects the yield on 10-year TIPS to reach 0% over time, from an average of -1% over the last 18 months of so.
""The dollar typically rallies versus other currencies during this adjustment,"" Bardas said. 
Bardas, like other investors, is also watching the difference between the yields in the United States and those in other major economies to get a clue on the dollar’s direction. 
On Wednesday, the gap in the U.S. and German 10-year government bond real yields stood at about 115 basis points in the dollar's favor, close to the widest it has been since March 2020. 
That yield advantage may shrink if the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan start accelerating their own efforts to tame inflation. 
Euro zone inflation is set to burn hotter throughout 2022 than expected a month ago, according to economists polled by Reuters in mid-January, which could pressure the European Central Bank to tighten policy once the Omicron wave of the pandemic passes. 
Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), meanwhile, believe the dollar will rise against the Japanese yen, helped by expectations that the Bank of Japan will be dovish compared with other central banks.
The greenback will likely struggle to make headway against other major currencies, however, as accelerating global growth forces other central banks to tighten monetary policy along with the Fed, they wrote in a report last week.
""Global growth outside of the U.S. could help those local currencies if you do continue to see reopening plans taking hold,"" said Chuck Tomes, portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management in Boston.

Still, Tomes, who has been guarding portfolios against a rise in the dollar since the second half of 2021, is not taking those hedges off just yet.
""U.S. real rates are still not massively attractive but they have been increasing and the expectation is that they will continue to get more attractive,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government may reduce by as much as 600 billion rupees its planned record market borrowing of 14.95 trillion rupees ($200 billion) for the next fiscal year, two government sources said. 
The sources said the latest bond switch conducted by the government with the central bank at the end of January was not factored into budget estimates released on Tuesday. 
The reduction could be announced before the end of March, the sources said requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
India's 10-year bond yield continued to rise on Wednesday, hitting a two-and-half year high, largely in reaction to the latest borrowing plan, which was over 40% higher than the borrowing slated for this year.
Markets had been expecting borrowing of 12-13 trillion rupees for 2022/23.
India switched nearly 1.2 trillion rupees of government bonds on Jan. 28 with 636.5 billion rupees worth of debt maturing in the next fiscal year.
""The switch has not been factored. It would lower the borrowing for the current year,"" one of the official said. 
A second official said the switch could lower the 2022/23 borrowing by as much as 500-600 billion rupees.
The officials also said that they expect RBI to intervene in the market to help smoothen the borrowing for 2022/23.
India's growth-focused budget for the upcoming fiscal year has fuelled worries among bond traders who fear the central bank may now be forced to act on the inflationary risks by raising interest rates, despite its dovish policy stance.

Traders will now look ahead at the upcoming monetary policy review to be held between Feb. 7-9 for further clues.

DUBAI/BEIRUT (Reuters) -Two years into an economic meltdown the World Bank says is one of the worst recorded, Lebanon's rulers have proposed a way to plug a huge hole in the financial system they were blamed for making: savers will foot most of the bill, not banks or the state.
The plan, seen by Reuters, seeks to revive the moribund banking system by making depositors cover more than half the $69 billion gap, which is three times the size of Lebanon's economy.
It includes converting a large portion of dollar deposits to Lebanese pounds at rates that wipe out much of their value.
The state, central bank and commercial banks will contribute $31 billion, or less than half.
Agreement on a plan of action is vital for securing an International Monetary Fund bailout and setting the nation on the road to recovery. The new plan needs cabinet approval.
Till now, disputes between politicians and banks about the size of losses and who should pay have stalled any agreement. This latest plan still needs to convince the IMF. But ordinary Lebanese, many driven into poverty, will have little or no say.
""It is the victim that has to bear most of the burden,"" said Toufic Gaspard, an economist who has advised the IMF and Lebanese finance ministry. ""Their logic is unacceptable by any standard of logic anywhere in the world.""
Savers have faced 'haircuts' in other crises around the world, although small depositors are usually protected.
Savers in Lebanon with less than $150,000 will have dollars preserved - amounting to about $25 billion - but, like other depositors, the money will be paid out over 15 years. They have already largely been frozen out of their accounts for two years.
Yet the scale of Lebanon's crisis, the worst since its 1975-1990 civil war, dwarfs most other global examples. Lebanese government debt was, by some estimates, an eyewatering 500% of gross domestic product in 2021, while the same sectarian leaders who ran the nation into trouble still wield influence now.
'LITTLE MONEY LEFT'
""There simply is very little money left. This is why accountability is so important. The political leadership is trying to flip the page, close this chapter, without anyone being held to account,"" said Mike Azar, an expert on the crisis.
The government, the central bank and the banking association did not respond to emailed requests for comment.
Under the plan, the bulk of dollar deposits of $104 billion - which banks no longer have enough hard currency to cover - will be converted to Lebanese pounds but at a range of exchange rates, with two of them well below current market levels.
Lebanon's pound has lost more than 90% of its value since the crisis erupted in 2019.
Of those deposits, $16 billion will lose 75% of their value and $35 billion will lose 40%.
""It is an effective nationalisation of deposits,"" said Nasser Saidi, a former economy minister and central bank vice governor, blaming the central bank for racking up ""massive balance sheet losses"" to defend an over-valued currency.
The Lebanese pound, which before the crisis was exchanged at 1,500 to the dollar, now trades around 20,000.
""If accepted by parliament, it would be the kiss of death for a near-zombie banking system and will doom Lebanon, its economy and people to prolonged misery and lost decades,"" he said of the latest plan.
ENTRENCHED ELITE
An earlier plan, drawn up in 2020, was torpedoed by banks, the central bank and ruling politicians over objections to the way losses were calculated and shared out. IMF talks collapsed.
The new plan aims to create an Asset Management Company (AMC) to invest deposits in projects such as rebuilding Beirut port - shattered by a huge blast in 2020 - and power stations in a country whose state power plants can't keep the lights on.
The AMC, to be owned by the state but managed independently, will issue asset-backed securities to pay back depositors, the plan says, aiming to ""generate value"".
""A top governance framework is needed to manage all those assets, with no corruption, and the politicians running this country are probably the worst qualified in the world to do this,"" said Talal F. Salman, a former finance ministry official.
But there is no sign of a shake-up in Lebanon's politics that would change the people in charge who are widely blamed for obstructing reforms sought by donors.
Lebanon's system of power-sharing among Muslim and Christian sects has entrenched the influence of a few individuals, families and groups for decades. Among the most powerful is Hezbollah, the heavily armed, Muslim Shi'ite group backed by Iran.
Under the plan, savings of the wealthiest depositors, amounting to $22 billion, would see $12 billion of deposits turned into Lebanese bank shares. They would also receive a $5 billion perpetual bond.
Banks would contribute $13 billion to plugging the hole, mainly by writing off shareholder capital.

Wealthy depositors could end up owning 72% of the capital in Lebanese banks, unless existing shareholders inject fresh cash.
""There is no dividend or management compensation clawback imposed on the banks and bank management, which is glaringly unfair to depositors,"" Azar said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan has no plan to modify its ultra-loose monetary policy as inflation remains distant from its 2% target, deputy governor Masazumi Wakatabe said, dousing speculation that creeping inflation could prompt it to tweak yield targets.
Wakatabe said in a speech on Thursday that consumer inflation may accelerate to around 1% in coming months and could speed up more than expected as more companies seek to pass on higher costs to households.
But the BOJ must maintain its massive stimulus programme as inflation expectations have yet to rise towards the bank's 2% target, he said.
""It would be premature to tighten monetary policy before inflation hits the BOJ's target, as doing so could cripple the economy's recovery,"" said Wakatabe, who is considered among the most dovish members of the BOJ's board.
""We have absolutely no plan to modify policy,"" he later told a news conference.
Some analysts expect consumer inflation to approach 2% in April and beyond, when the drag from cellphone fee cuts end and as rising global raw material costs trigger more price hikes.
Wakatabe said it won't be enough for inflation to briefly touch 2% for the BOJ to withdraw stimulus, adding that inflation must rise long enough to change public perceptions of future price moves and trigger wage hikes.
""It would be appropriate to tighten policy if wages and inflation expectations spiral higher, and trigger a second-round effect that pushes inflation above our target,"" Wakatabe said.
""In a country like Japan where medium- and long-term inflation expectations aren't anchored at 2%, the appropriate policy response would be to maintain easy monetary policy.""
Under yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ pledges to cap the 10-year bond yield around 0% via massive money printing to fire up inflation to its elusive 2% target.
Markets are rife with speculation that BOJ could shift its YCC target target from the current 10-year to the five-year bond yields as inflation creeps up, and prospects of steady U.S. rate hikes push up yields across the globe.
Japan's key 10-year JGB yield hit 0.185% on Monday, the highest level since the start of the BOJ's negative rate policy six years ago. It stood at 0.175% on Thursday.

Wakatabe said he saw no major problem with recent rises in long-term rates as the 10-year yield remains within the implicit 0.25% cap the BOJ set around its 0% target.
""As long as the 10-year yield is moving within the band set around the BOJ's target, it won't have a huge negative impact on the economy,"" he told the news conference.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's nominees to the Federal Reserve Board came out swinging against high inflation on Wednesday, saying rising prices pose a threat to economic growth and stopping that trend is a paramount task for the central bank.
""Our most important task is tackling inflation,"" Michigan State University economics professor Lisa Cook, one of three Fed nominees up for a confirmation hearing at the U.S. Senate on Thursday, said in her prepared remarks. 
The Fed must ""ensure that inflation declines to levels consistent with its goals,"" wrote nominee Philip Jefferson, dean of faculty at Davidson College, while former Fed governor Sarah Bloom Raskin said reducing inflation must be a ""top priority while we continue to sustain our economic recovery.""
The three Fed nominees had been widely seen as leaning dovish, in part because Cook's research focused on inequality and Jefferson's on poverty, suggesting that they might tolerate inflation for the sake of a stronger labor market. 
Their written testimony released Wednesday strongly countered that assumption. 
Consumer prices rose 7% last near -- more than twice the Fed's 2% goal -- cheapening American wages, eating into household budgets, and becoming an increasing political liability for Biden, whose popular standing has suffered as inflation has soared. 
Fed policymakers have signaled they will start raising interest rates next month, perhaps at a pace not seen in decades, as they scramble to cut short the upward price trend that threatens to undermine the recovery from the pandemic recession. The remarks from the nominees suggest they will join in those efforts once confirmed. 
FOLLOWING VOLCKER 
Still, Thursday's hearing, scheduled for 8:45 a.m. E.T., promises to be a heated one.
Democrats have praised the nominees, and Republicans have panned them, taking particular issue with Raskin and what they see as her intent to use her position as the Fed's vice chair of supervision to starve oil and gas companies of credit. The White House has stepped in to try to turn the tide. 
Raskin in her testimony said it is not the Fed's role to tell banks where to lend. 
Cook and Jefferson, both Black economists whose addition to the currently all-white Fed Board would make it the most racially diverse in the central bank's 108-year history, have received far less attention. 
But their monetary policy views could be consequential as the Fed joins its first real battle with inflation in decades. 
Cook in her testimony invoked Paul Volcker, the Fed chair who personified the central bank's battle with 1970s inflation, saying she would follow his example of political independence.
""High inflation is a grave threat to a long, sustained expansion, which we know raises the standard of living for all Americans and leads to broad-based, shared prosperity,"" Cook said. ""That is why I am committed to keeping inflation expectations well anchored.""
Jefferson also warned the inflation spike could lift inflation expectations. ""The Federal Reserve must remain attentive to this risk and ensure that inflation declines to levels consistent with its goals,"" he said. 

Nominees must win approval from a majority on the Democrat-controlled Senate Banking committee before their consideration by the closely divided full Senate. 
A tentative date for a vote on Biden's nominees, including the renomination of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the elevation of Fed Governor Lael Brainard to the post of Fed vice chair, has been set for Feb. 15.

ROME (Reuters) - Last weekend, for the first time in his gilded career, Mario Draghi missed out on a promotion.
He was the bookmakers' hot favourite to become president of Italy. He had signalled he wanted the prestigious post, with its seven-year term and considerable political clout.
But over eight rounds of balloting which eventually crowned outgoing President Sergio Mattarella for a second term, Draghi never got more than five votes from the 1,009 parliamentarians and regional delegates who took part in the election.
In interviews with more than a dozen Italian parliamentarians, many said the main obstacle for the premier was the fact that if he had changed jobs, his government would have automatically fallen, potentially triggering elections a year ahead of schedule.
Most lawmakers were anxious to avoid this because they would have lost their seats and pensions, said unaffiliated deputy Riccardo Magi.
The prime minister's office declined to comment on why Draghi had not won election.
Fausto Raciti, a deputy with the main centre-left Democratic Party (PD), said his group feared an election would yield victory for Giorgia Meloni's hard-right Brothers of Italy party, which is riding high in the polls.
""There was the mathematical certainty of early elections and Meloni premier. Nobody in the PD was willing to run that risk,"" Raciti said.
Meloni, whose party is not in the ruling coalition, had publicly backed Draghi for president, on the condition that elections were held immediately.
HIGH HURDLES
The fear of early elections was not the only problem.
The parliamentarians interviewed by Reuters said that Draghi’s bid also faced other high hurdles, which the prime minister never managed to overcome.
Claudio Borghi, a deputy from the rightist League party which is part of Draghi's coalition, was involved in the fraught negotiations to elect a new head of state, trying to persuade lawmakers to back a candidate from his own conservative camp.
""Some said no, some said they would think about it, but the message I got from most of them was that they would consider voting for anyone but Draghi,"" Borghi told Reuters, citing both concern over a snap election and unease over what he said was an ""autocratic"" approach to government from the former European Central Bank chief.
""If you want to be the ECB chief you have to negotiate with five or 10 people. To be president of the republic you have to convince 1,000 lawmakers. It's a different skill,"" Borghi said.
Draghi rode to Italy's rescue a year ago, coming out of retirement to become prime minister after one of Rome's frequent government collapses.
His 12 months in government have been absorbed mainly with tackling the COVID-19 emergency and adopting scores of measures pledged to the European Commission in return for some 200 billion euros ($226 billion) of EU pandemic recovery funds.
Like his predecessor in office, Draghi has often ruled by emergency decree, leaving parliament little scope to discuss and amend legislation. This sense of exclusion cost him support amongst the very group of people who choose the head of state, several of the lawmakers interviewed by Reuters said.
Draghi’s management style has also caused friction in the cabinet, a source in the ruling PD said, asking to remain anonymous. He consults widely, but then often decides abruptly, annoying some of his ministers, the source said. In the end, only a few members of his coalition team tried to fight his corner as the vote progressed.
Draghi carries rare clout on the international stage and is one of the most recognised figures in Italy. The idea of letting such a powerful figure take charge of the presidential palace for the next seven years weighed against him in a country where consensus politics predominates, some parliamentarians said.
""In Italian history, the country's strongest politician has never been elected president because the system of checks and balances has its own logic,"" said Ettore Rosato, a leading light in the centrist Italia Viva party.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED?
Draghi made his presidential ambitions clear at a news conference on Dec. 22 when he said his government had largely completed its agenda. ""The work can continue regardless of who is there,"" he said.
While he did not explicitly say he wanted to be president, he said he was “at the service of the institutions” — a clear reference to his willingness to take on the role, politicians and commentators agreed.
Draghi's move surprised some lawmakers because it broke with traditional Italian etiquette by which no-one is supposed to seek the presidency, but rather only accept it as an honour thrust upon them, said Sandro Ruotolo, a senator with a small leftist group.
""This ambition was a bit destabilising,"" former Prime Minister Mario Monti told La7 TV on Sunday.
Draghi's office declined to comment on Monti's remarks.
The disapproval grew when, almost as soon as voting started, Draghi began talks with party chiefs in what was widely seen as an attempt to secure their support.
These talks were confirmed to Reuters by three party sources and were widely reported in Italy's main newspapers. Draghi's office declined to comment.
""The December news conference was bad enough, but then receiving party leaders while we were voting for the president of the republic seemed to us in parliament like a rupture of the rules,"" said Ruotolo.
In the end, the leader of only one major coalition party, the PD's Enrico Letta, cautiously backed Draghi, while the three other main government groups - the League, Forza Italia and 5-Star Movement - all publicly disavowed his candidacy.

Mattarella, 80, had ruled out seeking a second term, but with votes increasing for him with each passing parliamentary ballot, Draghi intervened on Saturday morning and asked if he would accept a fresh mandate.
Mattarella agreed and later the same day was re-elected with the second highest number of votes in the history of the republic.

The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) jumped to 52.8 in January in seasonally adjusted terms from 51.9 in December, remaining above the 50-point mark that indicates expansion in activity for a 16th consecutive month. 
New export orders for South Korean manufactured goods returned to expansionary territory of 50.4 from 49.5 in December with improving demand from the United States, Europe and China, in a sign global trade will continue to recover from the pandemic.
Output volumes rose for the first time in four months in January, thanks to increased new orders.
""South Korean manufacturers entered 2022 with the strongest improvement in operating conditions for six months. The improved reading of the Manufacturing PMI came as firms reported a renewed rise in output and the sharpest improvement in new order inflows since July,"" said Usamah Bhatti, an economist at IHS Markit, in a note accompanying the data.
""That said, supply chain disruption continued to hold back a stronger recovery in activity and demand in the manufacturing sector.""
The survey said a stronger recovery was held back by sustained material shortages and the impact of the Omicron variant.

In a sign of supply chain disruption, suppliers' delivery times deteriorated for the 27th month in a row.
A sub-index on job growth showed employment expanded for a second successive month in January, with firms reporting that more orders encouraged them to hire additional staff.

The world's third-largest economy has seen COVID-19 cases surge in recent weeks, forcing the government to roll out tougher curbs across much of the country in response to a rise in hospital admissions driven by Omicron.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slumped to a seasonally adjusted 47.6 from the prior month's 52.1 and a 48.8 flash reading.
That marked the fastest decline in business activity since August, while outstanding business saw the sharpest rate of reduction in four months, the survey showed.
Service firms cut staffing levels at the fastest pace in 20 months and became less optimistic that activity would rise over the next year, with positive sentiment reaching a five-month low, the survey showed.
Input price growth for the sector stayed elevated, suggesting pressure on corporate profits from global raw material inflation remained.
The private sector as a whole also continued to see cost burdens increase.
""The weakness in the larger service sector contributed to a broad stagnation in private sector output in January,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.

""Total business activity dipped into contraction territory for the first time since September, despite a near eight-year high in manufacturing output growth.""
The composite PMI, which is calculated using both manufacturing and services, dropped to 49.9 from December's final of 52.5.

(Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers in New York passed a new congressional map on Wednesday that gives their party the advantage in 22 of the state's 26 districts, potentially reshaping the battle for control of the U.S. Congress ahead of November's midterm elections.
The plan, which passed largely along party lines in the Democratic-controlled state Senate and Assembly, could cut the state's Republican congressional delegation in half, offsetting Republican gains in states such as Texas and Georgia where the party muscled through its own partisan maps last year.
Democrats currently hold 19 of the state's 27 seats; New York is slated to lose one district due to slower population growth.
The map would ensure the eliminated seat is a Republican one while transforming three other Republican-leaning districts into Democratic-favored ones. Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, is expected to sign the map into law.
Democrats hold a narrow 222-212 edge in the U.S. House of Representatives, with one vacancy. If Republicans can win a majority in November, they would be in position to foil much of President Joe Biden's legislative agenda.
U.S. federal law requires states to redraw their congressional lines once a decade to account for population shifts. In most cases, lawmakers control the process, allowing them to engage in gerrymandering - the deliberate manipulation of district boundaries to favor one party over another.
Many national Democrats have attacked Republicans for gerrymandering. In January, congressional Democrats tried and failed to pass voting rights legislation that would, among other things, bar partisan redistricting, thanks to Republican opposition.
The New York map would not have been permitted under that bill, noted Michael Li, a lawyer and redistricting expert with the Brennan Center for Justice.
""It opens them up to charges of being hypocrites,"" he said of Democrats.

Lawmakers were able to pass their own plan after a bipartisan commission, approved by voters in 2014, failed to produce a consensus map, with Democratic and Republican members trading accusations of political gamesmanship.
Republicans could seek to challenge the map in court, as voters and civil rights groups have done in numerous other states.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar will reign supreme for at least another 3-6 months, a Reuters poll of strategists found, saying it will take a significant change in market expectations for Federal Reserve rate hikes to push it higher.
Indeed, while the dollar was not expected to make any significant headway from current levels, it was forecast to hold onto most of its impressive gains from 2021, according to the Jan. 31-Feb. 2 Reuters poll. 
Multi-decade high inflation in the United States and swathes of the rest of the world has prompted the Fed and other central banks to dial back some of the stimulus measures enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
That sudden change in policy expectations sent equity prices into a tailspin last month, with the benchmark S&P 500 index marking its worst start to the year since the financial crisis.
U.S. Treasuries have also taken a pasting, with yields rising by some measures at their fastest pace since 2009 in January as traders bet on a quicker pace of Fed tightening.
That is fertile ground for the dollar to consolidate its strong position. The dollar index rose nearly 7% in 2021, its best performance since 2015, but is up just 0.2% this year so far.
""Over the short term, we think the dollar is going to be more supported by the fact markets are still adjusting to this more hawkish U.S. rate profile. That's going to give the dollar some strength,"" said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe, the most accurate forecaster for major currencies in Reuters polls for 2021 according to Refinitiv Starmine. 
(Reuters poll graphic on FX majors forecasts: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/zjvqkawbovx/Reuters%20Poll-%20Dollar's%20dominance.png)
Over 75% of respondents to an additional question, 33 of 43, said the dollar's dominance would last at least another 3-6 months. Among those, 14 said that specific time period, 11 said 6-12 months and eight said more than a year.
Among the remaining 10, eight picked less than three months and only two said it was already over.
EURO GAINS
Asked how many additional basis points of Fed tightening need to be priced in for this year for the dollar to trade significantly higher, 24 analysts returned a median of 62.5 basis points. That was on top of the roughly 125 basis points currently priced in for the year.
Predictions ranged from 25 basis points to 200.
Fed officials played down the chance of a half point rate hike in March on Wednesday, knocking the dollar index off its recent 19-month high of 97.441. 
That broadly has cast doubts over whether the Fed could tighten policy to the extent financial markets were pricing in.
Federal funds futures imply U.S. interest rates will peak at just 1.75%-2.0% in the current cycle. That was lower than the 2.25%-2.50% economists predicted in a separate Reuters poll last month.
""I think there are warning signs out there about the medium term dollar outlook,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
""What really worries me is that flattening of the yield curve ... I think the market is saying the Fed is walking a very narrow path, and if it hikes too much this is going to be a very short interest rate hiking cycle and we could have potentially a hard landing on the other side.""
The euro was forecast to erase some of its losses for the year and gain over 1.5% over the next 12 months. Those gains would still fall short of recouping an almost 7% loss against the dollar last year.

The Japanese yen, which has benefited from the flare-up in geopolitical tensions and the ensuing flight to safety, was up 0.75% for the year but was expected to give up those gains and drift down 1.5% in a year.
""We're expecting the dollar to be resilient against low-yielding currencies where monetary policy is a lot slower to react,"" added Harvey from Monex Europe.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Joe Biden's pick to lead the Federal Reserve's regulatory work, plans to tell lawmakers she does not believe the role includes telling banks where they should be lending.
In prepared testimony posted by the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday ahead of her nomination hearing on Thursday, Raskin said the role of vice chair for supervision requires broad consultation inside and outside of the Fed on how best to ensure banks are managing their risks. 
But that job does not include telling banks where they should be lending, a rebuttal to accusations from Republicans and some industry groups that she might discourage banks from investing in fossil fuels in her capacity at the Fed.
""The role does not involve directing banks to make loans only to specific sectors, or to avoid making loans to particular sectors. And the role exists within the laws passed by Congress that govern the Federal Reserve and its responsibilities,"" her prepared testimony states.

Raskin, a former Fed governor and senior Treasury official under President Barack Obama, is widely expected to press for stricter scrutiny of banks than when Fed bank oversight was run by Randal Quarles, a Republican who left the Fed in December.
In her prepared testimony, Raskin said the 2008 financial crisis shows bank supervisors must be attentive to risks ""no matter where they come from,"" mentioning everything from cyberattacks to ""cataclysmic weather-related events"" as meriting scrutiny.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said on Wednesday there was uncertainty about how quickly inflation would come back down into the central bank's comfort zone, due to the unique nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Macklem, speaking to the Senate banking committee, also reiterated that interest rates need to rise to tackle inflation, which is currently at 4.8%, more than double the central bank's 2% target and well above its 1-3% control range. 
""There is some uncertainty about how quickly inflation will come down because we've never experienced a pandemic like this before,"" he said.
Macklem said the central bank expects inflation to peak around 5% in the coming months.
""We do expect inflation is going to remain uncomfortably high in the first half of this year, before coming down fairly quickly in the second half, as the pandemic recedes and things normalize,"" he added.
He noted there was ""obviously uncertainty"" on timing, saying it would take time for supply chains to work through bottlenecks and backlogs. On the flip side, price spikes could reverse and inflation could come down more quickly, he said.
Macklem also reiterated Canada's economy no longer needed help https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/hike-or-not-its-toss-up-ahead-bank-canada-rate-decision-2022-01-26/#:~:text=OTTAWA%2C%20Jan%2026%20(Reuters),of%20the%20COVID-19%20pandemic to deal with the effects of the pandemic and that interest rates will soon be on a rising path. 

""It will be a series of increases, not a single increase,"" he said, adding that the bank will keep a close eye on how those moves impact inflation and other aspects of the economy. 
Last week, the Bank of Canada left its benchmark interest rate on hold at 0.25%. Money markets expect a first hike on March 2 and at least five in total this year. [BOCWATCH]

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After an earlier nominee for a top U.S. banking regulation post was torpedoed, White House officials are determined not to let it happen again and have circled around President Joe Biden's nominees for three top Federal Reserve jobs.
The three nominees - former Fed Governor Sarah Bloom Raskin and economists Philip Jefferson of Davidson College in North Carolina and Lisa Cook of Michigan State University - face a Senate Banking Committee confirmation hearing on Thursday, but sparks are already flying. 
Senate Republicans and others opposed to the nominations -especially Raskin's - have unleashed a wave of criticism. They have targeted Raskin's nomination to become vice chair for supervision in large part because of her views on climate change. 
But, in contrast to the administration's tepid response to a similar onslaught against Saule Omarova over her nomination as comptroller of the currency - a campaign that resulted in her withdrawing her name - the Biden team is now doing daily battle to promote their nominees to the Fed board of governors.
""They're definitely more engaged on these nominees,"" said one Senate aide. ""This is an historic opportunity to really reshape the Federal Reserve, and the White House is taking it seriously.""
The effort, which one White House official said involves daily online meetings of nearly a dozen officials was launched to stay abreast of and respond quickly to attacks by Republicans and business interests on the candidates. 
They are also trying to stave off any opposition by Democrats, who ultimately helped unravel Omarova's nomination.
Biden's full slate of nominees includes Jerome Powell for another term as chair and Governor Lael Brainard as vice chair. Chosen to bring greater diversity to the Fed, the three candidates include two who are Black and two women. If all are confirmed, four of the Board's seven seats would be in the hands of women for the first time, including the first Black woman governor.
""Given this is a top priority, we have established a war room at the White House composed of various departments, meeting daily to push positive news on the nominees and the endorsements that continue to roll in in support of each of the nominees,"" the White House official said.
The effort, which includes nearly daily news releases highlighting support for the candidates, reflects the importance of the Federal Reserve in shaping U.S. economic and monetary policy and the large number of Fed nominees facing confirmation at once, the official said.
The stakes are high as the Fed gears up to raise interest rates to counter an unexpected spike in inflation, and the economy struggles with supply chain logjams and worker shortages. 

Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, said the White House's campaign to promote the Fed nominees was necessary. Cook's detractors have focused on her status as a Black woman and not given her credentials due weight while former President Donald Trump's nominees were not scrutinized as rigorously even though they were less qualified, he said.
""She is more than qualified,"" he said. ""We can't ignore the fact that this is the first time that a Black woman has been nominated to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in over 100 years ... We have a right to expect that she's going to be treated fairly.""

(Reuters) - In the summer of 2005, Philip Jefferson spent several weeks learning from fellow Swarthmore College professor Amy Vollmer how to genetically engineer bacteria to resist antibiotics, an unusual interlude for a tenured economics professor. 
He says his brief foray into her field gave him fresh ideas for teaching in his own discipline; years later, Vollmer says, he told her it was one of the best things he had ever done. 
Jefferson, now dean of faculty at Davidson College in North Carolina, is poised to again push boundaries after being picked by U.S President Joe Biden to join the Federal Reserve Board, which runs the central bank of the world's biggest economy. 
He and fellow nominees Michigan State University economist Lisa Cook and former Fed governor Sarah Bloom Raskin appear Thursday at the U.S. Senate Banking Committee for a confirmation hearing. If Cook and Jefferson are confirmed it would be the first time two governors who are Black would serve on the seven-member Fed Board at the same time, with Cook being the first non-white woman ever to hold the job.
Raskin, whose nomination as Fed vice chair of supervision would make her the Fed's top banking regulator, is almost certain to draw the lion's share of senators' questions. 
Her views on climate risk and banks' capital requirements - welcomed by some Democrats as likely signaling more restrictions for Wall Street and panned by Republicans for the same reason - will come under particular scrutiny. 
But investors are also keen to know exactly where the three nominees - none of whom responded to requests from Reuters for comment - stand on monetary policy, now at a crossroads as the Fed prepares to battle searing-hot inflation.
DOVES OR HAWKS?
Wall Street analysts expect the Fed to start tightening policy next month, raising interest rates faster than it has in decades and shrinking its balance sheet rapidly as well, as it unwinds the emergency measures it unleashed to limit the economic damage from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Many of those same analysts have also pegged all three Fed nominees as leaning ""dovish"" - that is, more concerned with supporting the full-employment side of the Fed's dual mandate than on fighting inflation, which often takes a toll on economic growth and employment. 
They point to Raskin's support for a go-slower approach on policy tightening in 2013, when she was on the Fed Board. They cite Jefferson's research focus on poverty and Cook's on the drag that inequality exerts on economic growth as evidence that they would tolerate higher inflation as the price for a stronger labor market. 
That said, it is far from clear how strongly any new Fed policymaker would push for easy policy with inflation running at its highest since 1982, eating into wage gains and making it harder for Americans - lower-income households in particular - to make ends meet. 
Indeed, Dartmouth College’s Andy Levin says the eye the nominees have trained on regular Americans suggests the opposite, at least for now. 
""It's bad for ordinary people if inflation stays at 5% or continues to go upward,"" he said. ""They are all going to be strong advocates of the dual mandate, but that doesn't mean being complacent about inflation.""
It is a theme also heard from Michelle Holder, president at Equitable Growth, a think tank largely focused on economic inequality. 
""Given the weightiness, the sheer importance that inflation possesses for most American families and individuals, the Fed simply has to make primary controlling inflation,"" she told Reuters. Though that doesn't mean the Fed can stop worrying about jobs, ""controlling inflation probably has to take precedence now.""
And it is one that Democrats, gearing up for what may be a heated hearing Thursday, are eager to emphasize. 
On Wednesday, Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown's office put out a memo saying Cook ""believes we need to put workers first in our economy by focusing on the Fed’s full employment mandate and lowering prices so paychecks go farther,"" and Jefferson would ""tackle the economic challenges faced by all the Americans who’ve been left behind in our economy.""
A 'THICK MIDDLE' AS ANCHOR
Moreover, with all three nominees joining a Fed that is remarkably united on the need to remove policy accommodation, it's unlikely even strongly held dovish views would budge that.
""At a very high level the mandate is fairly clear, so that 'thick middle' is not going to change and the perspectives are not going to change depending on who is sitting in the chairs,"" Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said in a January interview. 
Senator Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the Banking committee, has suggested the nominees are partisan, in part because of their attention to issues like racial inequality and climate change. 
But on some level, the nominees personify the Fed's own deepening research into the economic implications of such issues. 
Once inflation is better contained, Bostic said, ""you will see many of us lean back in to say we started 'lower for longer,' we started 'being patient,' now that we have inflation under control we are going to return to that kind of approach.""
Still, people who know the nominees say it would be a mistake to make too many assumptions about what their perspectives will be. 
Trevon Logan, an economics professor at Ohio State University, pointed to a research project with Cook that began as a ""bet"" on a new approach she was taking to mine census data.
""I began essentially doubting her, and ended up with egg on my face"" when it turned out to work, he said. ""I've been continuously struck by her creativity."" 
The idea that Jefferson would be a policy dove ""is probably not right,"" said Swarthmore economics professor Mark Kuperberg, who worked and lunched with Jefferson regularly for two decades. He said Jefferson as an economist ""is quite middle of the road."" 

John Caskey, another colleague in the Swarthmore economics department, declined to speculate on Jefferson's policy learnings, but pointed to the nominee's stint as a microbiologist those many years ago. ""He has an open mind,"" Caskey said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday advanced a multibillion-dollar bill aimed at increasing American competitiveness with China and boosting U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, teeing up the legislation for full approval by the chamber this week.
Democratic President Joe Biden's administration has been working to persuade Congress to approve the bill, which includes $52 billion to subsidize semiconductor manufacturing and research, as shortages of the key components used in autos and computers have been exacerbated by supply chain bottlenecks.
The Democratic-controlled House approved the rule for the ""America Competes Act"" by 219 to 203, largely along party lines. House aides said they expected a vote to pass the full measure on Friday, after considering a number of amendments.
The bill has several trade provisions and would also authorize $8 billion in U.S. contributions to the Green Climate Fund, established by the Paris Agreement to combat climate change, to help developing countries cope.
Republicans have proposed an amendment to strip that funding. Three Democrats want to boost it by $3 billion.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week said the 2,900-page bill would ""supercharge"" investment in chips, boost U.S. manufacturing and research and advance American leadership as it confronts a rising China.
House Republicans complained that Democrats did not include them in drafting the legislation. They harshly criticized the climate provisions and said they could be used to help Beijing. 
""Republicans are a strong 'no,'"" said Representative Michael McCaul, the top House Foreign Affairs Committee Republican.
Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush filed an amendment last week that would bar semiconductor companies receiving government subsidies from paying dividends or repurchasing company stock.
The Senate passed its own bill - the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act - by 68-32 in June. That legislation includes $52 billion to increase domestic semiconductor production and authorizes $190 billion for U.S. technology and research to compete with China.

The House bill authorizes $45 billion to strengthen supply chains and manufacturing of critical goods for health, communications and other sectors.
If the full House measure passes, the Senate and House will have to reconcile differences between their bills. The final version would go back to both chambers for full approval and then, should that legislation pass, to Biden for his signature.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Bank of Mexico board member Jonathan Heath said core inflation in Mexico should peak in the first quarter and then begin a ""not so fast"" downward trajectory, anticipating the bank could hike its key interest rate by 25 or 50 basis points next week.
Heath said in a podcast published on Wednesday by Mexican bank Banorte that inflation should conclude 2022 very close to 4% and converge ""much closer"" by mid-2023 to the 3% target of Banxico, as the Bank of Mexico is known.
Mexican headline inflation eased slightly to 7.13% in early January from the last half of December, still more than double the central bank's target rate of 3%, while core inflation, which strips out some volatile items, hit its highest level in over 20 years.
""This inflation bubble, I think we can properly name it pandemic inflation, arises precisely in the wake of the pandemic, which has caused all the disruptions in value chains globally,"" said Heath.
At its last monetary policy meeting in December, Banxico stepped up efforts to rein in surging inflation, raising the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 5.50%, its fifth consecutive meeting hiking rates.
""It's very clear to me that the debate for February, as the market itself and the analysts are saying, well I think it's clear that there will be a rate hike in February and the debate will be whether it will be 25 or 50 (basis points),"" said Heath.
The next meeting will take place on Feb. 10.
Heath noted that after February's monetary policy meeting future moves by Banxico would be contingent on any decision made by the U.S. Federal Reserve and to simply see how the hikes by the Fed come and go along with them, precisely at that same pace.
He said that from March onwards it would be difficult to maintain a ""rhythm of 50 basis points (hikes)"" because of an expected cycle of hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Heath said that a lack of private investment would likely keep economic growth depressed in 2022, adding that gross domestic product growth could be below 2%.
Mexico's economy contracted in the fourth quarter for a second straight quarter, putting it in a technical recession.
Some of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's policy decisions, especially in the key energy sector, have spooked investors.

Heath said disruptions in the global supply chain, the evolution of the pandemic and the impact of an outsourcing law hurt Mexico's economy in 2021, but added if ""these negative factors soften"" the economy could grow above 3% and close to 4% this year.
Lopez Obrador on Wednesday forecast 5% economic growth for 2022.

506,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 02:10PM ET</span>",,,,,,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. Treasuries yield curve inversion this time around may not be the perfect predictor of a recession, a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) strategist said on Wednesday, as the Federal Reserve's focus on reducing inflation could take priority over economic growth concerns.
Reflecting the U.S. central bank's plans to hike interest rates, short-term government bond yields have risen more than long ones this year, flattening the curve.
A curve inversion, particularly the one determined by comparing two-year and 10-year Treasury bonds, has in the past presaged recessions, as the market priced in expected rate cuts based on possible monetary policy actions that could damage the economy.
Credit Suisse trading strategist Jonathan Cohn said that part of the curve, which has flattened this year but is not close to inversion, is currently consistent with a roughly 25% probability of a recession in two years' time, but economic conditions this time could prevent the curve from presaging a slowdown.
""Contrary to the last several periods in which the curve inverted, the current economic backdrop leaves policymakers in a more precarious position, one in which the costs of underreacting to inflation may be significantly greater than overreacting,"" he said.
Pressure on long-dated yields, caused by several factors including excess savings, ""may foster an environment in which curve inversion may be more likely to be a 'false positive' recession signal and thus leave inversion as a less reliable recession indicator,"" he said.
Fed officials are monitoring the flattening of the curve but do not view its behaviour as an ""iron law"" that predicts economic outcomes, Chair Jerome Powell said last week.
Fed officials have also said they would mainly use a passive approach when shrinking their balance sheet, part of a plan to reverse years of buying bonds to support the economy.

That decision effectively rules out selling longer-dated U.S. Treasuries, but the Fed would still have ""ammo"" to steepen the curve, if needed, by reinvesting bond proceeds in shorter-dated debt rather than across the curve as it currently does, Cohn said.

Germany's MABB media watchdog and Commission for Licensing and Supervision (ZAK) of media institutions said on Wednesday that RT DE needed a licence that conformed with Germany's State Media Treaty and could not replace it with a different licence.
""This move deprives us of any choice but to embark on retaliatory measures against German media accredited in Russia, as well as against internet intermediaries that have voluntarily and groundlessly deleted accounts of the TV channel from their platforms,"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
RT said it will go to court over the German decision.
In December, YouTube had removed RT DE, saying it violated community standards, and the MABB media watchdog for Berlin and the state of Brandenburg ruled RT DE was not eligible to broadcast in Germany for licensing reasons.

The ban led to Eutelsat removing RT Deutsch from the list of channels broadcast from its satellites, though the broadcaster continued to stream content on its website.
RT DE, which had until the end of 2021 to respond to the proceedings, said on its website that it had a Serbian licence that allowed it to broadcast in Germany under a European convention on trans-frontier television.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic remains the biggest risk to the global economy, and is contributing to rising inflation in many countries, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said on Wednesday.
Georgieva urged redoubled efforts to boost vaccinations and beef up defenses against the coronavirus, saying such moves -- coupled with interest rate increases now being eyed or executed by central banks -- would help ease supply chain disruptions and combat inflation.
""Pandemic policy is economic policy,"" the IMF chief said. ""The biggest risk for the performance of the world economy remains this year COVID and the disruption it causes.""
The IMF chief conceded that inflation had turned out to be a ""more significant economic and social problem"" than expected, and said economists had underestimated the impact of both delayed consumption and climate shocks on food prices.
Georgieva noted that vaccination rates in 86 countries had not reached a target of vaccinating at least 40% of their populations in 2021, and vaccination rates were at just 5% in low-income countries, compared with 70% in rich countries.
""Why is this a problem? Because what we do is we retain a breeding ground for more and more and more COVID variants,"" she told an event hosted by the Washington Post.
The IMF last week cut its economic forecasts for the United States, China and the global economy, and said uncertainty about the pandemic, inflation, supply disruptions and U.S. monetary tightening posed further risks.
Georgieva said interruptions in global supply chains -- initially expected to be brought under control as early as the first half of 2022 -- were likely to continue because of COVID restrictions and other factors, including far higher demand for consumer goods such as computers and cars.
She warned that the dispute between Russia and Western countries over Ukraine was already driving energy prices higher, particularly in Europe, and complicated the already uncertain outlook for the global economy.
Georgieva's deputy, Gita Gopinath, last week said an escalated conflict between Russia and Ukraine would likely further increase energy costs and commodities prices for many countries, keeping headline inflation rates elevated for longer.
She said the IMF underestimated the impact of climate change on food prices. ""We have to recognize we are in a more shock-prone world, and we do have to expect these kind of shocks to be a factor in the future,"" Georgieva said.
Economists also underestimated the impact of stimulus funding in fueling ""more stronger consumer demand,"" she said.

Georgieva said the U.S. Federal Reserve was doing a good job communicating its plans to tighten monetary policy, and she expected it to sustain its well-calibrated and well-communicated approach to combat inflation while keeping the recovery going.
""If we reduce the risks of more variants and more lockdowns, we are helping supplies to come on time and we are helping the economy to recover faster,"" she said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Emerging markets investors are seeing a volatile start to the year, with a mix of good, some bad, but also some plain ugly developments to navigate.
THE GOOD
Lumped together in MSCI's 25-country EM equity index, emerging market stocks are outperforming developed market ones by a comfortable 3 percentage points so far this year. 
Versus the tech-heavy U.S. Nasdaq 100 it has been by an even greater 7 percentage points, although in actual terms the MSCIEF is still marginally below where it started the year.
(Graphic: Emerging market stocks outperform developed market stocks: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/mypmnjkwrvr/Pasted%20image%201643794489062.png)
One of the main drivers has been that Chinese stocks appear to have regained their footing after some record falls last year. 
Currencies like Brazil's real, Colombia's peso and in eastern Europe, the Czech crown and Hungarian forint have all shot up as their central banks hike interest rates. Ethiopia's bonds have surged as its civil war has eased, and even Argentina's debt has rallied in recent days after its government took a big step towards a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
""The new year is always an interesting time,"" said Kiran Nandra, Head of Emerging Equities Management at Pictet Asset Management. ""We often look at where do we have maximum fear, because that can provide the best opportunities.""
(Graphic: Chinese stocks make tentative recovery: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxoanempx/Pasted%20image%201643806581616.png)
THE BAD
A combination of rising global borrowing costs and concerns around Russia and Ukraine have seen the slowest start to a year for emerging market government debt issuance since 2016.
(Graphic: Slowest January for emerging market sovereign debt issuance since 2016: https://graphics.reuters.com/EMERGING-MARKETS/gkvlgjxrmpb/chart_eikon.jpg)
Figures compiled by J.P. Morgan this week showed that $17.9 billion of emerging market sovereign bonds were sold in January, more than 40% down on the record $32.2 billion raised last year when many governments looking to fill COVID spending gaps were getting all-time-low borrowing rates. [.JPMEGDR]
Those who invest in U.S. bank's widely-tracked EMBI global diversified EM hard currency debt index are down 2.75% for the year although much that is to do with the fact the big developed market debt like U.S. Treasuries have lost ground too. 
(Graphic: EM sovereign bond yields: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjvqkawwlvx/Pasted%20image%201643738218207.png) 
THE UGLY
This year's worst performances have come from Ukraine and Russia due to worries, repeatedly denied by Moscow, that Russia could invade its Western-backed neighbour like it did back in 2014.
Both countries' currencies are among the three worst performing in the world this year. No Russian company has be able come to the international bond markets so far this year.

""It is reasonable to assume that the level of fiscal support will be lower than what it is now. This is the logic of fiscal rules and makes sense when the recovery is in a more advanced stage,"" Donohoe said.
The European Union suspended its limits on government borrowing in 2020, 2021 and 2022 to help governments deal with the unprecedented shock of the COVID-19 pandemic that caused the deepest recession in Europe since World War Two.
But the EU plans to reinstate borrowing limits from 2023, although with modifications that will reflect the sharp rise in public debt caused by the pandemic as well as the need for huge annual investment to fight climate change.
Also, the pace of reducing fiscal support is likely differ from country to country next year. 

""Country-specific circumstances will be taken into account,"" Donohoe said. 
""We will want to avoid cliff-edge effects stemming from abrupt or excessive fiscal consolidation. We have learned since the previous crisis that debt sustainability is not served by stifling growth and investment,"" he said.

Euro zone inflation rose to a new record high of 5.1% year-on-year in December, defying expectations for a big drop and adding to already big doubts that price pressures are as benign and temporary as the European Central Bank still expects.
""The inflation upswing is affecting growth and the purchasing power of citizens' incomes. This is something finance ministers are naturally concerned about,"" Donohoe said.
""The narrative on inflation has also changed somewhat, as the factors that have been driving prices up, are taking longer to dissipate than was expected. We are talking primarily about energy prices, but also strong demand, supply bottlenecks and technical factors,"" he said.
Donohoe said he was confident the ECB, which wants to keep inflation at 2% over the medium term, would do all it can to curb price growth, but that it could not solve problems with supply, which were behind much of the price rises.
""There are, so far, no signs of significant second round effects stemming from wage increases, and inflation is expected to start decreasing this year and subsequently drop below the ECB's 2% target in 2023,"" he said.

He said governments were also taking or exploring measures against the negative impact of high energy prices, but rising tensions with Russia, which supplies 40% of EU gas were also a factor in the outlook for energy prices and headline inflation. 
""The geopolitical tensions of course also have to be taken into account in this context,"" Donohoe said.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) -Ethiopian Airlines flew passengers on a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX plane on Tuesday, but opinions are divided on its first flight using the model since a crash nearly three years ago forced regulators to ground the fleet globally. 
In March 2019 a flight to Nairobi crashed in a field six minutes after take-off from Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa killing all 157 passengers and crew. The accident followed another incident five months earlier, when the same model crashed in Indonesia, killing 189 people. 
The accidents exposed a problem with a system on the plane, and the model was grounded worldwide, costing Boeing some $20 billion and prompting court cases that exposed shortcomings with the certification process. 
Tuesday's demonstration flight had journalists, diplomats and officials on board and was initially scheduled to reach neighbouring Kenya but remained within Ethiopia due to poor weather, officials on board said. 
While airborne, acting Chief Executive Officer Esayas Woldemariam told reporters that commercial flights would resume after the demonstration.
""We made sure everything is in order, now we are doing...a demo flight so to speak. It is after this that we are availing it to commercial aviation,"" said Esayas. 
Some relatives of those killed in the Ethiopian Airlines crash were angered by the decision to resume flying the 737 MAX. 
""I will never fly in a MAX and certainly if I find myself booked into a MAX, I will have to cancel that flight,"" said Tom Kabau, a Kenyan lawyer who lost his 29-year-old brother George in the crash. 
A lawyer for victims of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accused the airline of having failed families on many fronts. 
""The families of those who lost loved ones in the crash... are extremely disappointed with the lack of leadership at the airlines that has failed them in many ways,"" Robert Clifford of Clifford Law Offices, said in a statement to Reuters. 
He added that the status of the airline's own investigation into the crash ""remains unknown"" after nearly three years. 
Ethiopian Airlines said in a statement on Jan. 22 that the decision to resume flights came ""after intense recertification"" by multiple regulatory bodies. 

Ethiopia is among the last countries to return the 737 MAX to service; it is already flying in the United States, Europe, China, Australia, Japan and Indonesia. 
""We have taken enough time to monitor the design modification work and the more than 20 months of rigorous rectification process ... our pilots, engineers, aircraft technicians, cabin crew are confident of the safety of the fleet,"" the airline's CEO Tewolde Gebremariam said in a December statement.

(Reuters) - Euro zone markets, where investors once snapped up scarce bonds at any price, may be at a turning point after demand at government debt sales fell last month versus a year ago.
The first such decline in January since 2015, it marks a shift in supply and demand dynamics for bonds as the European Central Bank prepares to scale back its pandemic bond-buying stimulus scheme.
For the first time since 2019, net debt supply will outstrip ECB buying, which according to UBS, will lead to the biggest annual net supply increase since 2015 when the central bank launched quantitative easing to ward off deflation.
Reuters analysis of the syndicated bond sales -- where debt is sold direct to end investors rather than at auction -- shows that six euros of demand chased every euro of issuance this January. 
That compares with a record eight euros a year ago. January is typically a heavy month for bond sales. 
""Investors are not necessarily stepping back altogether but they are scaling back,"" said Philip Brown, managing director, sovereign capital markets at Citi, which led deals for France, Ireland, Belgium and Cyprus. 
""Investors are generally a little bit more cautious at the moment than they have been at the start of recent years.""
Some issuers even paid slightly higher new issue premia -- the extra yield paid to entice buyers -- bankers managing the deals said. Yields were also cut less from starting levels compared to last year on some deals, data from lead managers and Refinitiv's IFR showed.
Cyprus's debt office acknowledged the shift away from ""an issuer's market"".
""We've seen it in the pricing demands of investors and the degree of flexibility they showed during the transaction.... We are seeing that they are becoming more price sensitive,"" an official said, asking not to be identified.

https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/znvnejkoypl/585WH-demand-falls-for-euro-zone-january-govt-bond-sales%20(1).png 
ECB SHIFT
Sovereign debt demand is still very high, at levels similar to January 2020, before the ECB pumped in unprecedented stimulus to combat COVID-19's impact on euro zone economies. 
But it's a change from a year ago when government debt sales garnered record-setting order books, often packed with inflated orders from hedge funds keen to get hold of bonds they could then sell on to the ECB at a profit. 
Such was the frenzy that many debt offices acted to weed out these outsized orders from their sales.
The moves seemed to work. Order books eventually shrank later in 2021. And in January, two bankers involved in the deals said they had noted smaller hedge fund orders as the ECB prepares to buy less bonds. 
""As the ECB has less influence on the market there's going to be less of that day trading,"" said Nick Sanders, portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB).
Perhaps more crucially, even some long-term investors are scaling back orders, bankers said. 
Bond markets have been saddled with losses over the last month, selling off in the face of surging inflation, upcoming U.S. rate hikes and ECB plans to cut bond purchases.
Record-high euro zone inflation may also force the central bank, which meets on Thursday, to reassess its view that price pressures are as temporary as it expects. 
Bankers said investors are receiving slightly larger bond allocations at sales than last year as demand eases. 
""The takeaway...is that there is less real money participation in new issue order books and that top-tier asset managers want to see a little more of a pricing concession to engage in new issues,"" Citi's Brown said.
Gareth Hill, fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, who participated in most January syndications, said that last year he would be routinely allocated 50-65% of the volume of bonds he had bid for. 
But this year, ""in the (deals) you've seen so far, we're getting allocations more in the high 70s to 80%,"" he said.
Greece illustrated the extent to which the ECB has propped up markets. It will be the only euro zone country whose bonds will be ineligible for ECB purchases after March, when pandemic stimulus ends. 
Its 10-year debt sale last month saw demand halve compared to its previous 10-year issuance in June, and its outstanding bonds sold off more sharply than usually seen on the day of issuance. 

Another banker who led debt sales, speaking on condition of anonymity, said previously ""issuers have been able to price whenever they want, wherever they want, in whatever size they want."" 
""We are now beginning to see there is a more balanced market"".

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A massive winter storm walloped the central United States with heavy snow, freezing rain and gusty winds on Wednesday, threatening to make travel virtually impossible and possibly knocking out power for millions of Americans. 
Winter and ice storm warnings and watches were in effect for a wide swathe of the United States that reached from Texas and Colorado up through the Midwest and into Northern New York until Friday morning, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. 
Much of the northern part of the region could get 1 foot (30 cm) of snow while southern spots may see a mixture of snow and freezing rain that will rapidly deteriorate travel conditions on Wednesday, the NWS said. Winds gusts as high as 40 miles (64 km) per hour were also forecast. 
""Expect power outages and tree damage due to the ice. Travel could be impossible. The hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening commute,"" the service said in its advisory for Memphis. 
More than 100 million people are under winter weather alerts that stretch from the Rockies to New England, CNN reported. 
Some 2,400 flights were canceled in the United States as of Wednesday morning, according to Flightaware.com. More than 400 flights alone were canceled to and from the two major airports in Chicago, where as much as a foot of snow was in the forecast for parts of the metro area. 
The storm also forced dozens of school districts in the region to cancel classes for at least Wednesday. 

Extremely cold air caused by Arctic high pressure that is forecast to descend over the Plains on Wednesday will send temperatures plummeting 15 to 25 degrees below average in some areas, the NWS added. 
The storm threat comes days after fierce winter weather engulfed the northeastern part of the United States, dropping more than 2 feet (60 cm) of snow on some areas and packing high winds, prompting thousands of flight cancellations and curtailing access to the roads in some states.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suspended its inspector general Carl Hoecker for seven days without pay in 2020, despite an independent government committee recommending that the agency consider firing him for ""serious misconduct,"" according to government records obtained by Reuters. 
    The SEC documents provide new details on how the agency responded after a government investigation, first reported by Reuters in December, concluded that Hoecker abused his authority by conducting a “remarkably biased and flawed” internal probe into allegations against two of his employees. Reuters obtained the SEC documents through a public records request.  
    The government investigation into Hoecker was led from 2017 to 2019 by the Integrity Committee, a federal panel that examines allegations of wrongdoing against inspectors general, after two whistleblowers alleged that he conducted a substandard investigation. Inspectors general are government watchdogs who guard against the misuse of taxpayer dollars. 
    The previously unreported documents show that the SEC, which received the Integrity Committee's report on Hoecker in 2019, also concluded wrongdoing by Hoecker. He failed ""to avoid the appearance of"" bias and exercised ""poor judgment when contacting a witness during an active investigation."" 
    The SEC concluded that Hoecker failed ""to report allegations of improper conduct pursuant to the SEC's policy of preventing harassment,"" according to the documents, which include Hoecker's time-sheets.  
    While the Integrity Committee recommended the SEC consider firing Hoecker, its Commissioners voted instead on May 8 to suspend him without pay from May 24-June 2, 2020, the records show. At the time, Hoecker earned nearly $277,000 a year. 
    Hoecker, who disputed the committee's findings, and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment about the disciplinary action. 
    In an email he sent to staff two days after Reuters' report in December, Hoecker wrote: “I strive to do the best job possible"" and added: ""As far as any willful or negligent inaccuracies and omissions in the article or the underlying...Integrity Committee report, I cannot comment.""
    The SEC declined to comment on its response to the Integrity Committee's report. A spokesperson for the SEC Office of Inspector General did not respond to requests for comment.
    Jay Clayton, SEC chair at the time of Hoecker’s disciplinary action, did not respond to requests for comment. 
    Three attorneys who specialize in disciplinary proceedings said a seven-day unpaid suspension appeared to be light given the committee's findings, and its recommendation that the SEC consider removing Hoecker. 
    ""It seems odd they'd let [him] off with a disciplinary action,"" said Debra D'Agostino, a founding partner at the Federal Practice Group in Washington. 
    Hoecker got a ""big break,"" said John Berry, an attorney specializing in disciplinary action defenses.

    The SEC can fire its inspector general provided two thirds of its sitting commissioners agree and it notifies Congress of its reason at least 30 days beforehand.
    In his email, Hoecker told staff: “I hope you still have confidence in me as your IG. I have been here for almost 9 years, and I hope to remain here well into (the) future.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Efforts to speed up the movement of goods around the world have yet to solve the supply chain bottlenecks caused by surging demand for retail goods and pandemic-related lockdowns, the latest shipping data shows.
Delays at U.S. major ports have been particularly severe, but knock-on effects have also been felt around the world.
This week's Lunar New Year holiday in China and across Asia is also expected to aggravate delays.
The journey time from China's northern Dalian port to the major European port of Antwerp rose to 88 days in January from 68 days in December because of a combination of congestion and waiting time. This compared with 65 days in January 2021, analysis from logistics platform project44 showed.
Transit time from Dalian to the eastern British port of Felixstowe, which has seen some of the biggest backlogs in Europe, reached 85 days in January from 81 in December, versus 65 days in January 2020.
A survey conducted in January by technology company Container xChange, which canvassed 500 freight industry respondents, found 66% of those polled expected Chinese New Year factory closures to further disrupt container shipping supply chains. 
Josh Brazil of project44 said it would take ""several years to return to pre-pandemic supply chain stability"".
He said new vessel build capacity would not come to the market until 2024, meaning there was ""no quick fix"".
""While Europe has experienced much less port congestion compared to major U.S. ports, the congestion in southern California causes schedule disruptions and capacity constraints that have global consequences,"" Brazil said. 
Delays at ports along the U.S. West Coast have also increased, with Oakland at over 10 days in January from around five in December, according to project44 data. Delays at Los Angeles stayed around six days in December and January. 

Ports have tried to extend working times to clear backlogs and companies have sought to shorten delivery routes and diversify goods suppliers to alleviate delays. 
Leading container group A.P. Moller-Maersk told its customers last month it was struggling to move goods around the world.

Investing.com -- For the last two years, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his team have been partying in Downing Street. However, it’s his voters who are going to feel the hangover.
But while the British press may prefer to dwell on the scandal about Downing Street breaching its own Covid rules, there is a real economic storm brewing that will be an even sterner test for the country. By May, it is safe to say, many voters – especially poorer ones – will be feeling nostalgic for the times when they only had to worry about a party here and there.
None of the looming issues are unique to Britain. It is only the public rage at the government’s hypocrisy and disingenuous maneuvering to escape the consequences of its actions that really distinguishes the country’s experience of the post-Covid hangover from elsewhere. And, as with other elements of the pandemic, what happens in Britain tends to happen elsewhere in Europe, with a certain time lag.
The first of those economic shocks is already here. Inflation is at 5.2%, its highest since 1992. As a consequence, the Bank of England has already raised its key rate once, by 15 basis points, in December, and is expected by many to raise it again at its meeting on Wednesday.
Interest rate hikes may not have quite the dramatic effect on the economy as they once did – too many homeowners now have fixed-rate mortgages for that. But they will still make credit – especially consumer credit – more expensive. This is important now that U.K. consumers, having run down their pandemic-era savings, are again borrowing in large amounts again – despite a six-month run of deteriorating consumer confidence.  
After the Bank of England, it will be the turn of the U.K. energy regulator Ofgem. On February 7th, it’s due to announce the new price cap on retail energy bills, which will come into force from April. Given the extraordinary combination of factors that have pushed wholesale market prices higher, this is likely to rise by as much as 50%, adding hundreds of pounds a year to the average household’s energy costs.
Ofgem had already raised its price cap by 12% in October.
Consumers at least tend to use less energy as spring arrives. However, there will be no avoiding a separate hit in April from the government’s planned tax increases.
National insurance contributions, a levy on earned income, are set to rise by 1.25 percentage points from April to fund a new and long-overdue scheme to provide social care for the elderly. Despite a revolt from the low-tax wing of the ruling Conservative Party, who point to better-than-expected government borrowing statistics in recent months, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Treasury chief Rishi Sunak wrote at the weekend that they are determined to push it through.
The tax on dividend income will also rise by 1.25 points to 33.75% for higher-rate taxpayers.
The above combination of factors would test the popularity of any government. In Britain, however, they come on top of damaging revelations about how Johnson and his team partied their way through the pandemic while tens of thousands mourned, sickened and stagnated alone. 
It may not matter to global markets which of Johnson’s many scandals ultimately bring him down. But it will be an interesting test case for Europeans to see what parts of Johnson’s program gets abandoned and what is kept as the Conservative Party scrambles to keep its 12-year grip on power.   "

Investing.com -- The world's largest oil exporters meet to decide production quotas for March. Whether they can live up to them is another matter. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) breathes some life back into tech stocks with strong earnings that set a high bar for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta later Wednesday. ADP reports its monthly private payrolls numbers, and the Eurozone's inflation problem is getting worse before it gets better. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 2nd February.
1. Alphabet smashes expectations
Google-parent Alphabet delivered a much-needed shot-in-the-arm to technology stocks after the close on Tuesday, reporting strong quarterly results which showed sustained high demand for advertising space on its search and YouTube platforms, as well as for its Cloud-hosting services.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 32% to $75.33 billion, while profit rose by a similar amount. However, revenue growth was the slowest in five quarters, suggesting that the unprecedented pandemic-era boom is fading, while the Cloud business continued to operate at a loss as the company spends heavily on new business.
The results nonetheless set a high bar for Facebook owner Meta when it reports after the close. Alphabet stock was up 10.2% in premarket, making up all of its January losses.
2. OPEC+ to meet; U.S. inventories due
The world’s largest oil exporters meet to set production quotas for March, and the meeting is likely to end in disappointment for those hoping for a faster rise in supply.
Analysts expect the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia to stick to their regular monthly increase of 400,000 barrels a day – albeit, the group has failed to meet even that target in recent months, leaving its collective output over half a million b/d below where it ought to be. Russia missed its output quota for the second straight month in January, analysis of data published on Tuesday suggests.
OPEC ministers will convene at 7 AM ET (1200 GMT) and take a common position into their meeting with non-OPEC producers at 8 AM ET. They should be finished by the time the U.S. releases weekly inventory numbers at 10:30 AM ET.
Crude futures were flat ahead of the meeting, still close to seven-year highs. U.S. crude futures were at $88.20 a barrel, while Brent was at $89.06 a barrel. 
3. Stocks set to open higher; earnings barrage continues 
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher later, as Alphabet’s earnings restore a bit of confidence in the outlook for tech – even though the dominant status (and the pricing power) that it commands in its core businesses aren’t something that really applies to most other stocks in the sector.
By 6:20 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 36 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.6% and NASDAQ 100 futures were up by a thumping 1.3%.
Other stocks likely to be in focus later include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which all also reported late on Tuesday – the former two disappointing with their guidance and the latter beating expectations. AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO), DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) and Humana (NYSE:HUM) all report later, along with Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX), Waste Management (NYSE:WM) and Emerson (NYSE:EMR). Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and T-Mobile lead the roster of late updates.
4. Eurozone inflation surprises with new record high
Inflation in the Eurozone rose surprisingly to a new all-time record high of 5.1%, as skyrocketing energy prices prevented the expected drop from materializing.
Money markets reacted by bringing forward their expectations of the European Central Bank’s first interest rate hike in 11 years to July, something that is still firmly at odds with ECB guidance, while the euro rose to its highest in a week at $1.1312.  The numbers follow data earlier this week showing that the Eurozone unemployment rate is also at a record low of 7.0%.
The benchmark 10-Year German bond yield rose to its highest since May 2019 on the news, at 0.05%.
5. ADP payrolls seen hit by Omicron
The U.S. labor market is in focus later, with ADP’s monthly assessment of private payrolls in January.
It may be harder than usual to distinguish noise from signal in this week’s data: the White House on Tuesday dropped a heavy hint that it expects a very weak number for payroll growth on Friday due to the impact of the wave of Omicron-variant Covid-19 during the month.
Analysts expect the ADP number to come in at 207,000, down from 807,000 in December.
Despite that, other data points continue to suggest the labor market remains tight. U.S. job openings rose again in January to close to their all-time high, according to the monthly JOLTS survey released on Tuesday."

Analysts at U.S. investment bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) calculated that $17.9 billion of EM sovereign bonds were sold last month, down about 40% from a record $32.2 billion issued last year when many EM governments looking to fill COVID spending gaps were able to borrow at all-time-low rates. [.JPMEGDR]
""Heightened rates and higher rates volatility remained the key hurdle for sovereigns looking to enter the market in January,"" JPMorgan's analysts said.
""A more hawkish FOMC last week raises the bar for new issuance even higher now,"" noting that Chile issued bonds immediately after the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting, ""which could suggest a greater sense of urgency to finance earlier in the year before rates rise further.""

Economists now expect the U.S. central bank, which tends to drive global borrowing costs, to raise its interest rates five times before the end of year. The last time it delivered five hikes within such a short window was August 2005 to June 2006 when they went up 7 times. 
The premium that international investors demand to buy EM debt rather than U.S. Treasuries has been rising since June. The average yield - a borrowing cost proxy - for developing countries to borrowing in their own currencies is also now almost 6% for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic erupted in early 2020, and mid-2019 excluding that. 
(Graphic: EM sovereign bond yields: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjvqkawwlvx/Pasted%20image%201643738218207.png)
Breaking down this year's issuance figures also shows that countries seen as having stronger finances and classed as 'investment grade' by credit rating agencies have sold the lion's share at $16.4 billion, whereas weaker high-yield or 'junk'-rated countries have sold just $1.5 billion worth. 
Turkey, which has been gripped by a currency crisis over the last six months, leads the pack in terms of expected issuance for the rest of the year at $11 billion, followed by China and Indonesia with $10 billion and $9 billion respectively. 
Oil-rich Saudi Arabia is also expected to sell $6.5 billion of debt while Kuwait, which saw its credit rating cut last week, is seen borrowing $6 billion.

Maturities in February include Turkey and Romania with $2 billion each, and Lithuania with $1.5 billion.

As those who lived through the late 1970s and early 1980s can attest, inflation can be a ""portfolio killer"" because it erodes purchasing power.
Inflation revved up to 7% in December compared to the year prior, the highest level in decades.
Even at 3% annual inflation, in 20 years you would need $181 to match what $100 buys today, according to the calculator at fintech site SmartAsset.
How does that change the money or asset mix you need for retirement?
""Many investors have never experienced inflation like we have seen the last few months, so it may be a good time to revisit your portfolio and confirm whether you still feel confident,"" said Naveen Malwal, an institutional portfolio manager at Boston-based financial giant Fidelity Investments.
After all, some asset classes tend to perform better during higher-inflation periods. Among 15 major asset classes in inflationary periods since 2000, the top performers included oil (41% return), followed by emerging markets stocks (18%), gold (16%), and cyclical stocks (16%), according to a  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) study.
On the flip side were a couple of bond categories. Emerging markets fixed income lagged with -8% return, while investment-grade fixed income returned -5%.
Economists generally agree that inflation will back off from current overheated levels. Over the next 10 years, they expect the Consumer Price Index to average a modest 2.55% annually, according to the Survey of Professional Forecasters from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
""Look at the things driving inflation: There is too much money chasing too few goods,"" said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
""There is money supply growth, there are transfer payments which increased savings, there is supply chain disruption. By the end of the year, we should see some easing, and all those things will help the inflation story.""
Which investment areas should benefit from rising prices, and which will not? Here is what the experts say:
ESCHEW CASH
During inflationary periods, the value of your cash holdings will erode over time, perhaps substantially so.
""Investors are sitting on way more cash than they should,"" Wren said.
With indexes like the Nasdaq touching correction territory, now may be a good time to start putting that cash to use, and accumulate harder assets that should hold up during periods of higher inflation.
TIPS ARE YOUR FRIENDS
Fixed income markets tend to get hit hard by inflation. A bond paying out a rock-bottom yield for an extended period is a poor option when prices and interest rates are rising.
One corner of the bond market has the answer: Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), whose principal increases with inflation and throws off interest twice a year at a fixed rate.
""That's one way to stay invested in the bond market, and they are literally designed to provide you inflation protection,"" Malwal said.
LOOK AT HISTORY
Investing has no guarantees, but past performance during inflationary periods can provide some clues.
""In higher-inflation environments, things like commodities do well,"" said Wells Fargo's Wren. ""So do mid-cap and small-cap stocks. The energy sector typically does well, and equity REITs (real estate investment trusts). I also think financials, industrials, and materials will all benefit.""
DO NOT OVERREACT
Just because inflation is uncomfortably high, do not expect that to last forever. Minor portfolio tweaks may be in order, but wholesale changes are probably a mistake.

Forecasters see inflation drifting down over 2022 as supply chain problems ease up, labor markets normalize, and COVID-related emergency cash infusions recede. 
""Most people agree we're headed lower. The question is how much lower and how long will it take to get there,” said Fidelity's Malwal. ""It could be closer to 3-4% by the end of the year.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's growth-focused budget for the upcoming fiscal year, on the back of record market borrowing, has fuelled worries among bond traders who fear the central bank may now be forced to act on the inflationary risks, despite its dovish policy stance.
Coupled with global crude oil prices at seven-year highs and expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively, traders fear the government's plans mean the Reserve Bank of India may need to act sooner rather than later.
India announced capital expenditure of 7.5 trillion rupees ($100 billion) for 2022/23, or 2.9% of gross domestic product, an increase of 35.4% from the last fiscal year.
The government is also set to borrow a record 14.95 trillion rupees, exceeding market expectations for a maximum of 12 trillion to 13 trillion rupees.
""We expect the RBI to focus on reining in inflation to 4% from current high levels through next year with domestic growth on a relatively better footing and assuming no surprises on the COVID-19 front,"" said Upasna Bharadwaj, an economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank.
India's central bank has held its key repo rate at a record low of 4% since May 2020, and assured markets it will continue to keep its policy stance accommodative until economic recovery is firmly entrenched. 
Consumer prices accelerated to a five-month high of 5.59% in December, however, close to the upper end of the central bank's mandated inflation band of 2% to 6%.
""The RBI should look to revise their accommodative stance as a countermeasure to the expansionary budget,"" said Sandeep Bagla, the chief economic officer at Trust Mutual Fund.
""The longer RBI waits to normalise, the more markets will lose the confidence in RBI's ability to control inflation and inflation expectations.""
Bhardwaj said a policy review due on Feb. 9 should undertake a one-shot hike of 40 bps in the reverse repo rate so as to restore normalcy and provide clarity.
""However, sentiment in the bond markets has weakened further post the budget and hence, RBI may prefer to postpone the decision to the April policy,."" she added.
Economists believe the benchmark bond yield, which has risen about 45 bps in 2022, after last year's rise of 55 bps, is likely to keep heading higher in the near term, in the absence of open market operations or liquidity-neutral operation twists.
""The budget definitely makes RBI's job tougher from the yield management perspective,"" said Yuvika Singhal, an economist with QuantEco Research. 
Economists polled before the budget had expected the repo rate to be raised 25 basis points in the June quarter and then go up by a total of 75 bps over the next fiscal.
The reverse repo rate was forecast to be raised at next week's policy review and increase by a total of 90 bps in FY23.
Six economists and market participants said they now expect an swifter pace and quantum of rate hikes as the RBI alone must tackle inflation.
""Across the yield curve, over the course of the year, we will expect bond yields to rise by 20 bps to 30 bps for now,""
said Arvind Chari, the chief investment officer at Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Advisers. 

""The RBI will also have to start hiking its policy rates and we would expect at least a 100 bps increase in rates in FY23.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Wednesday he ""cannot accept"" the view the central bank's ultra-loose monetary policy has led to regional lenders' deteriorating health.
""It's true Japan's low interest rate environment has had an impact on regional lenders through various channels,"" Kuroda told parliament.
""But Japan's economy has expanded moderately thanks in part to the BOJ's aggressive monetary easing"" and helped boost growth in areas the regional banks operate, he said.
Speaking in the same parliament session, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said mergers and consolidation are ""among options"" for regional lenders.
""But what's important is that any decision the lenders make would help regional economies,"" he said.
""Regional lenders play a very important role in their communities, including by supporting regional businesses. We need to keep that in mind in guiding policy,"" Kishida said.
The BOJ has been under fire from some lawmakers for the rising cost and diminishing return of its prolonged ultra-easy policy, which has failed to fire up inflation to its 2% target and narrowed the margin commercial banks earn from lending.

The hit from ultra-low rates has been particularly hard for regional banks, which are grappling with a dwindling population and an exodus of borrowers to bigger cities.
As part of efforts to ease the strain on regional lenders, the BOJ has put in place a scheme incentivising them to consolidate or streamline operations.

The move would be part of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's initiative to defend Japan's economic security mainly against China, such as by preventing leaks of sensitive technology and building more resilient supply chains.
In the proposal, the panel called for crafting legislation that allows the government to order companies to provide advance information when updating software or procuring new equipment, and vet purchases that could put Japan at risk of cyberattacks.
The regulation would target companies in industries critical to national security such as energy, water supply, information technology, finance and transportation, the proposal said.
""Due to rapid digitalisation in today's world, almost all areas of economic activity including those involving critical infrastructure are targets of cyberattacks,"" the panel said, in explaining the need for fresh legislation.
""It's important to ensure any regulation does not excessively restrict business activity,"" it said.
The proposal by the panel of academics will serve as a platform for legislation the government will submit to parliament later this month.
Advanced economies, including the United States and Japan, have faced several major cyberattacks recently including those with ties to Russia and China.
Japan is under pressure to follow in the footsteps of the United States in boosting counter-measures against cyberattacks and compete with Beijing's growing push to export sensitive technologies such as commercial drones and security cameras.

Aside from domestic efforts, Tokyo is coordinating with its allies to help Asia boost resilience against risks to economic security, Masato Kanda, vice finance minister for international affairs, told Reuters.
""Japan is working with the United States and Australia to support the creation of trustworthy communication infrastructure in Asia, mainly through funding aid via state-owned financial institutions,"" Kanda said.

President Joe Biden's administration is pushing to persuade Congress to approve the bill, which includes $52 billion to subsidize semiconductor manufacturing and research, as shortages of the key components used in autos and computers have exacerbated supply chain bottlenecks.
If the procedural vote succeeds in the narrowly Democratic-controlled House, the full chamber would aim to vote on the full bill on Friday.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week said the 2,900-page bill, called the ""America Competes"" act, would ""supercharge"" investment in chips and boost U.S. manufacturing and research capacity, as well as advancing U.S. competitiveness and leadership.

The Senate passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act last year, which includes $52 billion to increase U.S. semiconductor production and authorizes $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research to compete with China.
The House bill has key differences with the Senate version. It does not contain the $190 billion for technology and research, but does include $45 billion to support supply chain resilience and manufacturing of critical goods, industrial equipment and manufacturing technology.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -China has failed to meet its commitments under a two-year ""Phase 1"" trade deal that expired at the end of 2021, and discussions are continuing with Beijing on the matter, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi said on Tuesday.
""You know, it is really clear that the Chinese haven't met their commitment in Phase 1. That's something we're trying to address,"" Bianchi told a virtual forum hosted by the Washington International Trade Association.
In the deal signed by former President Donald Trump in January 2020, China pledged to increase purchases of U.S. farm and manufactured goods, energy and services by $200 billion above 2017 levels during 2020 and 2021.
Through November, China had met only about 60% of that goal, according to trade data https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-china-phase-one-tracker-chinas-purchases-us-goods compiled by Peterson Institute for International Economics senior fellow Chad Bown.
The deal prevented the escalation of a nearly three-year trade war between the world's two largest economies, but left in place tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of imports on both sides of the Pacific.
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in late January told lawmakers that China's purchases of U.S. farm goods fell short of the Phase 1 goal by about $13 billion.
The U.S. Census bureau is expected to release final 2021 trade data for goods and services on Feb. 8, which will provide specifics on the shortfall.
Chinese customs data http://english.customs.gov.cn/Statics/46bdb268-260d-46a1-adde-e3cebcaf6817.html showed the country's 2021 trade surplus with the United States surged 25% to $396.6 billion after declining for two straight years, with exports to the United States up 27% and imports of American goods rising 33%.
A spokesperson for China's Embassy in Washington said Beijing has worked to implement the Phase 1 agreement ""despite the impact of COVID-19, global recession and supply chain disruptions.""
""We hope the U.S. can create a sound atmosphere and conditions for expanded trade with China. The two trade teams are in normal communication,"" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
STABLE RELATIONSHIP
Bianchi, whose portfolio includes China and Asian trade matters, did not identify steps the Biden administration is taking to hold China to its Phase 1 commitments, which also include some increased Chinese market access for U.S. agriculture, biotechnology and financial services.
""It's not our goal to escalate here. But certainly we're looking at all the tools we have in our toolbox to make sure they're held accountable,"" Bianchi said, without providing details.
Bianchi, who served as an economic adviser in the Obama administration and took office in October, said the United States was trying to foster a ""stable relationship"" with China, but the two countries are at a ""difficult stage in the relationship.""
""To be super-candid, the conversations are not easy. They're very difficult. But you know, from my perspective, what's important is that we're having conversations and they will be unflinchingly honest,"" Bianchi said.
She said USTR was emphasizing that China's state aid to companies and non-market economic policies and practices are a ""serious threat to American economic interests.""

Bianchi said USTR was consulting closely with Congress on the Biden administration's planned Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to re-engage economically with the rest of Asia, and more details would be released in coming weeks.
The framework will not include improved market access for countries that sign up, Bianchi said, but said the United States will be seeking high-standard ""binding commitments"" from trading partners in negotiations on digital trade policies, labor rules, environmental standards and supply chain resilience.

530,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 06:35PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's bid to put his mark on the U.S. Federal Reserve faces a key test in two weeks time when the U.S. Senate Banking Committee votes on his renomination of Jerome Powell to be Fed chair and on a diverse slate of four other Fed nominees.
The tentative date for the action on all five nominees is Feb. 15, according to information from Committee chair Sherrod Brown's office on Tuesday. 
When they met to consider the renomination of Fed Chair Powell and the elevation of current Fed governor Lael Brainard to the post of Fed vice chair, banking panel members from both sides of the aisle signaled a measure of support. 
But the three other nominees, who appear before the banking committee on Thursday, face a less certain outcome in the closely divided Senate. 
Any failure to get his Fed picks approved would represent a setback for Biden, whose popularity has suffered as inflation has surged, and who has said he is counting on the Fed to bring soaring prices under control. 
In recent days a particularly intense battle has been building over Biden's choice for Fed vice chair of supervision, former Fed governor Sarah Raskin. As the Fed's top regulator, she is seen as likely to have a tighter hand on Wall Street than her Trump-appointed predecessor, Randal Quarles. 
Republicans, led by top Senate Banking committee Republican Pat Toomey, have raised objections to what they see as her hostility to oil and gas companies. Democrats praised what they see as justified concern with the risks that climate change poses to financial stability. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce weighed in with concerns about Raskin and her calls for federal regulators to transition financing away from the fossil fuel industry, although other business leaders gave their backing..
""We offer our support without reservation,"" executives of more than a dozen small banks wrote the committee Tuesday, of Raskin.
The partisan battle has also extended to the other nominees, who include Michigan State University's Lisa Cook and Davidson College's Philip Jefferson. 
""A breath of fresh air,"" UAW union President Ray Curry said of the two Black economist nominees in an email sent Monday by Brown's office. 

""Political activists,"" wrote conservative columnist George Will of Cook and Raskin in an opinion piece sent around Friday by Toomey's office. 
Cook, who has written extensively on the negative economic drag imposed by racial and gender inequality, would be the first non-white woman ever to hold the job of Fed governor. Jefferson, another economist whose recent work has focused on poverty, would be the fourth Black male to do so.

(Reuters) -St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard on Tuesday said he favors starting the turn to tighter U.S. monetary policy with successive rate increases at the Fed's March, May and June meetings, before assessing whether the pace of inflation requires more aggressive steps from there.
But he pushed back against the idea of kicking off the tightening cycle with a half-percentage point hike in March, noting that markets have on their own started to push up borrowing costs already, and said that how high the Fed will ultimately need to lift rates remains an ""open question.""
""The point of this is to get (monetary policy) better positioned right now and in coming months, and then we will be able to assess, at that point, whether we need to do more or not,"" during the second half of the year and into 2023, Bullard told Reuters in an interview on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) Spaces.
With investors currently anticipating five quarter point increases over the course of the year, Bullard said that ""is not too bad a bet...A lot is going to depend on how inflation develops during the year.""
He is not optimistic about how much inflation will fall without the Fed's intervention. Global factors remained tilted towards higher prices, and Bullard said he thinks the U.S. economy is going to continue to grow strongly - so strong in fact he expects the unemployment rate to fall below 3% by year's end. 
Though the upcoming jobs report for January may show some weakness because of the rise over the holidays in coronavirus cases, ""don't be fooled,"" Bullard said. ""This is quite the strong economy here and a very strong labor market.""
That would be the lowest unemployment rate since the early 1950s, and likely lead to ongoing wage pressures and sustained consumer spending that could keep prices rising.
TWO-YEAR MARK
As the Fed barrels toward the end of two years of near-zero interest rates, Bullard signaled that uncertainty is so high at this point the Fed may offer less guidance about the overall path of interest rates as it mulls data meeting by meeting. 
""We are going to be have to be more nimble, faster, better at reacting to inflation data and other developments as we go through this year,"" Bullard said. ""It’s going to be a more data-dependent environment.""
Still, Bullard - who for months has been cajoling his colleagues to take a more aggressive stance against soaring inflation - gave somewhat of a roadmap for what he expects on policy and the economy. 
On trimming the Fed's $9 trillion balance sheet, Bullard said he would like to get started in the second quarter and thinks ""that the runoff can be faster than it was last time around."" 
Raising rates and shrinking the balance sheet are both expected to raise borrowing costs and slow growth, putting downward pressure on what's now 40-year-high inflation. 

""We are cognizant of the inflation issue, we’re moving on the policy rate, but we’re also going to move on the balance sheet so we’re not that far from reaching neutral if you are willing to consider both of those,"" Bullard said, referring to the interest rate that would neither speed nor slow the economy. 
In Bullard's estimation that rate is between 1.75% and 2%, a bit below where many of his colleagues see it.

In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and first reported by Reuters, Bill Hagerty and Tom Cotton said they were ""disheartened"" by media reports suggesting her agency was blocking efforts to tighten export controls on U.S. technology destined for SMIC, which they say enjoys close ties to the Chinese military.
Tightening the controls ""would close an important loophole and prevent the (Chinese Communist Party) and (the People's Liberation Army) from using U.S. technology to advance its military modernization programs,"" the senators said in a letter dated Jan. 31, asking whether Raimondo supports added restrictions. 
When asked by Hagerty about the company in a hearing on Tuesday afternoon, Raimondo said she had not seen the letter and would get back to the Senator. 
""I share your deep, deep concern with doing everything we can to deny China our technologies,"" she said. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) did not respond to a request for comment.
The Trump administration placed SMIC on the U.S. Department of Commerce's trade blacklist in late 2020 over concerns that SMIC aids China's military.
Normally, U.S. suppliers are required to apply for a special license - which faces a tough standard of review - before shipping any U.S. items to a company on the blacklist. 
However, when the Trump administration added SMIC to the list, it only applied that tough standard of review to highly specialized chipmaking equipment destined for the Chinese firm, granting a ""case by case"" review process for other U.S. items.

In practice, that has meant license applications have gotten tied up in lengthy review processes https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-smic-exclusive/exclusive-amid-shortage-u-s-suppliers-to-chinese-chip-giant-smic-struggle-to-get-export-licenses-idUSKBN2AW18B as policymakers debate whether to approve them. It has also angered some China hawks, after documents showed suppliers to SMIC obtained billions' worth in licenses https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-huawei-tech-idCNL1N2RH2AC.
Reuters reported in December that the Biden administration has not decided https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-smic-idCNL1N2T203P whether to block more sales of U.S. chipmaking equipment to SMIC but raised the possibility of discussing it further with allies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said he sees the unemployment rate falling below 3% this year, a jobless rate the U.S. economy last saw in the early 1950s. 
""I think unemployment is going to go down below 3% this year,"" Bullard said on Tuesday in a Reuters interview. 
He noted that the unemployment rate dropped by 0.7 percentage points over the past two months alone to 3.9%. The jobless rate could continue to fall as companies scrounge for workers and several factors, including early retirements, limit the share of people who are working or looking for jobs, he said. 
Bullard said the labor market is strong, despite the weakness it could experience in the near term because of a surge in COVID-19 infections. 
""I think the upcoming jobs report will probably be not very good because of Omicron, but don't be fooled,"" Bullard said. ""This is quite the strong economy here and a very strong labor market.""

The last time the U.S. unemployment rate was below 3% was 1953, when it fell to as low as 2.5% - the lowest since the Labor Department began reporting it regularly in 1948.
Bullard said he supports raising interest rates in March to get monetary policy better positioned, but said future actions will depend on what happens with the economy and inflation.

The system, which is set to begin Tuesday night and last through Thursday, could dump 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) of snow over portions of the southern Rockies and central Plains, with record snowfall possible in the Midwest as well.
""While typical in terms of the time of year that you might expect something like this, potentially atypical in terms of some of the snowfall amounts we may see in parts of the Midwest,"" said Greg Carbin, the forecast operations branch chief for the NWS Weather Prediction Center. 
Snow could blanket Detroit in amounts not seen in years, Carbin added, while icy roads and bridges threatened to make travel ""nearly impossible."" Power outages are also possible.
A ""corridor of heavy ice accumulation"" will stretch from the Ohio River Valley down to Texas, according to the forecast.
Winter weather advisories, storm watches and warnings are in effect in many of the areas in the storm's path.
In Texas, where a deadly deep freeze last year crippled the state's electric grid, leaving millions without power in freezing temperatures, Governor Greg Abbott sought to reassure residents on Tuesday, saying the grid was prepared.
""We're all mindful of what happened last February in Texas,"" said Carbin, the NWS meteorologist. ""The event coming up is going to introduce a shot of cold air and it's a mixed winter precipitation at this time, it looks nothing like what we saw last February in terms of both intensity and duration.""

Extremely cold air caused by Arctic high pressure that is forecast to descend over the Plains on Wednesday will send temperatures plummeting 10 to 15 degrees below average in some areas, the NWS added. 
The storm threat comes days after fierce winter weather engulfed the northeastern part of the United States, dropping more than 2 feet (60 cm) of snow on some areas and packing high winds, prompting thousands of flight cancellations and curtailing access to the roads in some states.

(Reuters) - A record amount of more than half a trillion dollars of debt was raised in January by companies as issuers scrambled to take advantage of attractive funding conditions before global central banks led by the U.S. Federal Reserve begin a tightening cycle.
Including financial institutions, investment-grade companies raised $532 billion globally in January, the highest amount on record for the first month of the year, according to data from Refinitiv dating back to 2000, eclipsing the previous record at $530 billion last year. 
In the U.S., the most significant source of issuance, companies and financial institutions issued $153.5 billion in bonds respectively, the data showed, the highest since 2017. 
""The main driver is borrowing costs, which are very very low,"" said Winnie Cisar, global head of strategy at research firm CreditSights.
""With the Fed talking about tightening, rates markets moving higher I think issuers are very much trying to get ahead of whatever the next leg higher in yields is going to be.""
The issuance is a sign of confidence for the credit markets, which delivered their worst monthly losses since March 2020 in January.
The U.S. Federal Reserve signalled at the start of January that it may tighten monetary policy earlier than expected, which may also include shrinking its $8-trillion balance sheet. 
That has triggered a global sell-off in bond markets and risk assets with bond yields rising sharply as traders priced in nearly five rate hikes from the Fed over the remainder of 2022.
U.S. banks and financial institutions were a key driver of issuance, raising $104 billion in the U.S. in a record January. 
""We had expected to see a deceleration from financials not needing to raise as much as capital as last year but a lot of these issues are among the most savvy in the market in terms of navigating borrowing conditions,"" Cisar at CreditSights said. 
Despite a 40 bps yield rise on U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds in the U.S., according to BofA indexes, borrowing costs are still historically low, so companies can continue issuing cheap debt and bring down their overall funding costs. 
Companies in BofA's U.S. investment-grade corporate index could see borrowing costs rise another 80 basis points before they exceed the coupons they pay, according to Refinitiv Datastream.

In contrast were sub investment-grade companies, where after a record run in 2021, bond issuance more than halved compared to last January at $32 billion.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A recent steady rise in long-term interest rates is unlikely to make the Bank of Japan tweak its yield target as it can use other tools to moderate any unwelcome rise in borrowing costs, according to sources familiar with the central bank's thinking.
Markets are rife with speculation that BOJ could shift its yield curve control (YCC) target from the current 10-year to the five-year bond yields, as Japanese government bond (JGB) yields creep up in line with rising global interest rates.
But with the 10-year yield still below the BOJ's implicit 0.25% cap, policymakers see little need to intervene forcefully to push down yields, three sources told Reuters.
""The 10-year yield is still moving within the band the BOJ sets around its target,"" one of the sources said. ""Recent moves aren't something to fret too much about,"" another source said.
The benchmark 10-year JGB yield hit 0.185% on Monday, the highest level since the start of the BOJ's negative rate policy six years ago, despite repeated assurances by the BOJ it was in no rush to tighten monetary policy.
While the 10-year yield retreated to 0.175% on Tuesday, the yield curve steepened as super-long bond yields hit multi-year highs.
A steeper yield curve was precisely what the BOJ aimed for when it conducted a review of its policy framework last March to address the rising costs of prolonged easing.
As part of efforts to have market forces drive yields more, the BOJ clarified in the review it would allow the 10-year yield to move up and down 25 basis point each around its 0% target.
If yields rise too sharply, the BOJ can offer to buy unlimited amounts of bonds at a set price to defend the target.
""If necessary, the BOJ has plenty of tools to combat rising yields,"" a third source said.
For now, the BOJ prefers to use such market operation tools to fend off an unwelcome spike in yields instead of tweaking the YCC target, the sources said.
BOJ officials have not ruled out the idea of targeting shorter-dated yields. But Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said any such move would only become an option when conditions fall in place to debate an exit from the central bank's ultra-easy monetary policy.
In urging the BOJ to target shorter-dated JGB yields, the International Monetary Fund, too, stressed that ""now is not the time"" to do so.

""As other major central banks eye rate hikes, the BOJ will likely follow suit at some point,"" said former BOJ board member Takahide Kiuchi.
""But with so much uncertainty on the outlook, the BOJ will tread very carefully and take plenty of time before moving.""

Bianchi told a trade conference that USTR would have more to say on Kenya in coming weeks, but gave no details.
""We have been doing a lot of robust engagement with Kenya. We're exploring ways to deepen our trade and investment relationship there,"" she said. ""We'll have more to say on Kenya in the coming weeks, but we do want to keep a really deep engagement going.""
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai met virtually in December with Kenya’s trade minister, Betty Maina, and underscored the Biden administration's commitment to deepening the bilateral relationship.
The Biden administration in July had unveiled a new push to expand business ties between U.S. companies and Africa, with a focus on clean energy, health, agribusiness and transportation infrastructure on the continent.
The previous administration had launched talks with Nairobi on a bilateral free trade agreement, but those plans have been on ice until USTR completes a policy review.

539,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 11:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The White House is lowering expectations for this week’s U.S. jobs report, saying that brief absences of workers due to omicron could overstate the number of unemployed people for last month.
Several White House officials have teed up Friday’s report with warnings, saying that the week when surveys were taken for the January payroll numbers was the height of illness absences in the aftermath of the holidays.
Brian Deese, the director of President Joe Biden’s National Economic Council, said the numbers could be “confusing” as Covid illnesses are recorded as job losses.
“We expect that that will have an impact on the numbers,” Deese told MSNBC on Tuesday. “We never put too much weight on any individual month; this will particularly be true in this month, because of the likely effect of the short-term absences from omicron.”
Biden has repeatedly touted employment data as an indicator of a robust economic rebound, and highlighted the tumbling jobless rate to blunt criticisms about overheated inflation. Friday’s report may still show historically low unemployment, which is based on a separate survey from the one for payrolls and counts temporary, unpaid sick leave differently.
Preparing Ground
Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki have also delivered warnings that the official January jobs gain may be poor.
If a worker was out “and did not receive paid leave, they are counted as having lost their job,” Psaki said Monday. Nearly 9 million people missed work due to illness in January, when the data were being collected, she said. 
“So we just wanted to kind of prepare, you know, people to understand how the data is taken,” she said. “As a result, the month’s jobs report may show job losses in large part because workers were out sick from omicron.”
Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to rise by 150,000 for January -- the weakest reading since the end of 2020. The U.S. unemployment rate is seen remaining unchanged, at 3.9%, according to the median estimate of forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. inflation risks being pushed to a permanently higher level if the Federal Reserve does not get the current bout of price increases under control, Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said on Tuesday.
""The mostly pandemic-induced episodic price pressures could grind on long enough to fundamentally alter expectations,"" and drive actual inflation higher, Bostic said in an essay published by the Atlanta Fed. While expectations have not risen to critical levels yet he said there was ""real danger"" if businesses and households begin to act as if higher annual inflation was here to stay, and that warranted higher interest rates.

541,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 10:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in December while quits declined slightly, suggesting that labor demand held steady in the month despite a surge in Covid-19 infections and pandemic-related business disruptions.
The number of available positions rose to 10.9 million from an upwardly revised 10.8 million in November, the Labor Department’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, showed Tuesday. The figure exceeded all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
The quits rate was little changed at 2.9% from a record 3% in the prior month, pointing to a high degree of churn in the labor market. The level of quits edged down from an all-time high in November.
The data show that vacancies remained elevated in December despite temporary business closures at the end of the month due to the spreading omicron variant. While job openings could decline in January, economists expect the impact to be short-lived with employers looking to increase headcount as consumer demand strengthens in the coming months.
There were 1.7 jobs for every unemployed worker in December.
The JOLTS report comes ahead of Friday’s monthly employment report from the Labor Department, which is currently forecast to show the U.S. added 150,000 jobs in January, the weakest print since December 2020.
Food Services
Job openings rose in accommodation and food services, information and state and local government education in December, the JOLTS report showed. Vacancies fell in finance and insurance and in wholesale trade. 
Total hires decreased in December to 6.3 million, driven by professional and business services. The hires rate fell slightly to 4.2%, the first decline in four months. Layoffs and discharges were little changed at 1.2 million.
A separate report Tuesday from the Institute for Supply Management showed that the group’s employment index rose in January to a 10-month high, suggesting factories were having greater success beefing up payrolls.

""Right now, I think four 25-basis-point increases this year is appropriate,"" Harker said during an interview with Bloomberg TV. ""But there's a lot of risk here,"" including the risk that inflation is worse than expected, or that it eases faster than Fed officials expect, he said.
Policymakers say they plan to raise interest rates in March, and to start reducing the Fed's balance sheet later this year, as they work to remove the accommodation provided to stabilize markets and the economy during the pandemic. 
Asked whether he would support raising interest rates by half a percentage point in March, Harker said he would need to be convinced it was needed. 
""If inflation stays where it is right now and continues to start to come down, I don't see a 50-basis-point increase,"" said Harker, who votes for policy this year as an alternate for the Boston Fed. ""But if we see a spike, then I think we might have to act more aggressively."" 
He said he would like the Fed to start shrinking its bond holdings once interest rates are close to 1% or 1.25%, from today's near-zero levels.

""That reduction is going to be steeper and faster than the last time we tried it,"" Harker said. 
Fed officials said last week that they would like to shrink those holdings primarily by letting bonds run off the balance sheet as they mature. Harker said he would not commit to actively selling assets until he saw more analysis. ""This is something we're actively looking at right now,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) -British labour union Unite said on Tuesday that 87% of its members at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have voted in a non-binding ballot in favour of industrial action against proposed changes to pay packages.
The labour dispute comes at a time of big internal change at the watchdog while it also faces pressure from lawmakers to crack down on a surge in online financial scams.
""Unless a negotiated settlement is reached Unite can now proceed to a full industrial action ballot,"" Unite said in a statement.
The FCA, which employs around 4,000, said it has consulted with staff on proposals which would ensure the watchdog continues to provide ""one of the best, if not the best"" employment packages of any regulator or enforcement agency in Britain.
Most staff would receive base salary rises of at least 5% this year and 4% in 2023, and around 800 of the lowest paid staff would receive an average pay rise of 3,800 pounds ($5,128.48) this year, the FCA said in a statement.
The outcome of the FCA's consultation is due by March.
Sharon Graham (NYSE:GHM), Unite General Secretary, said FCA employees were telling the watchdog that the proposed changes were damaging and destroying any remaining goodwill the staff had.
The regulator is stopping discretionary bonuses for underperforming staff as it seeks to change internal culture, and FCA CEO Nikhil Rathi told parliament in December that some employees will end up being paid less this year.
Unite said the loss of such ""routine payments misleadingly labelled bonuses"" would cut overall pay by 10% to 12%.
The union said it would negotiate with the regulator through the ACAS voluntary arbitration scheme as soon as the watchdog agreed to this, otherwise a formal ballot for industrial action would be held.
It also said it could not disclose membership numbers among FCA staff while it was also in the process of a ballot on official recognition of the union at the authority.
Sky News reported on Monday that the FCA would name Richard Lloyd, who led British consumer group Which? for five years, as interim chairman. Lloyd will replace Charles Randell, who announced he would be stepping down a year early.
Rathi has revamped his executive team after an independent review said the watchdog botched the supervision of now collapsed investment company London Capital & Finance.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's government will step up spending to 39.45 trillion rupees ($529.7 billion) in the coming fiscal year to build public infrastructure and drive economic growth, it said on Tuesday, but it involves a wider fiscal deficit than targeted and record borrowing.
Asia's third-largest economy has been on the mend after the government lifted mobility measures in June to curb the spread of coronavirus, after contracting 6.6% in the previous fiscal year.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, presenting the annual budget to parliament, said total government spending in the 2022/23 fiscal year beginning in April will be 4.6% more than the current year. 
Trillions of rupees will be allocated to expressways, affordable housing and solar manufacturing to put growth on a firmer footing, she said. 
Growth is estimated to be 9.2% for 2021/2022, coming off a low base and slowing to 8 to 8.5% in the coming fiscal year, still the fastest among the world's major economies. 
GRAPHIC - India's Economic Grow in Modi's tenure
https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-BUDGET/INDIA/klvykmzowvg/chart.png 
The recovery from the pandemic has been swift but incomplete, officials say. Private consumption has been hampered by a lack of jobs, depleted household balance sheets and wider income inequalities.
Sitharaman said public investment must continue to take the lead and pump prime private investment and demand.
""The economy has shown strong resilience to come out of the effects of the pandemic with high growth. However, we need to sustain that level to make up for the setback of 2020/21,"" she said. 
She announced spending of 200 billion rupees ($2.68 billion) for a highway expansion programme and said 400 new trains would be manufactured over the next three years. 
The fiscal deficit for the current year would be 6.9% of GDP, slightly more than the 6.8% targeted earlier, Sitharaman said, drawing concern in the bond market. 
For the next fiscal year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is targeting a deficit of 6.4% of GDP, hoping to build on higher tax revenues and privatisation of state firms including a share sale of giant insurer Life Insurance Corporation.
“It’s a big bang budget, but depends on where one stands on the bang perimeter. The massive ramp-up of capital spending and focus on infrastructure cements the budget’s credentials as a firmly growth-oriented one,"" said Aurodeep Nandi, India Economist and Vice President at Nomura.

Gross borrowing for 2022/23 was raised 40% to 14.95 trillion rupees. Gross borrowing by the Modi government has more than doubled during the pandemic as New Delhi went on a spending spree to cushion the economy and provide relief to the poor.
The benchmark 10-year bond yield IN065432G=CC rose 15 basis points, posting its biggest single-day rise since May 11, 2020. It had earlier hit levels last seen in early July 2019. The rupee INR=IN closed 0.2% weaker at 74.79 to the dollar.

SLOWER PRIVATISATION, DIGITAL CURRENCY
The government sharply scaled back its plans to sell state-run companies after political criticism and market turmoil, expecting to raise 650 billion rupees from the privatisation programme next fiscal year, lower than the revised 780 billion target for the current fiscal year. 
Initially, it had announced it would raise 1.75 trillion rupees this fiscal year. After years of efforts the government succeeded in selling loss-making carrier Air India last month, but failed to move forward on other companies and banks identified for sale.
Sitharaman also said the central bank would introduce a digital currency in the next fiscal year using blockchain and other supporting technology.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's budget for fiscal 2022-23 gave a thrust to its technology sector, with the finance minister announcing a plan to auction 5G airwaves this year, and pushing for the design and wider local manufacturing of telecoms and electronics products.
The airwaves auction in India, the world's second-biggest wireless market with over a billion subscribers, will kick off a rollout of next-generation 5G telecoms services by end-March 2023, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told parliament as she presented the country's budget on Tuesday.
During a news briefing, Sitharaman declined to speculate on how much revenue the 5G auction would raise.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government will also offer incentives to encourage more design-led manufacturing to boost 5G in the country, Sitharaman said, adding that all of India's villages are likely to be connected by optical fiber for faster broadband services by 2025.
""The finance minister's announcement around 5G spectrum auction, 100% fiberisation with public-private partnership model will provide an impetus to build ubiquitous and reliable internet connectivity,"" said Nitin Bansal, the India managing director at Swedish telecoms gear maker Ericsson (BS:ERICAs).
""Design-led initiatives for 5G... will strengthen the 'Make in India' initiative, and contribute to making India a global manufacturing hub.""
India bailed out its cash-strapped telecoms sector last year with a slew of measures including a four-year moratorium on airwaves payments due to it and allowing mobile carriers to convert interest they owe New Delhi into equity.
That has helped telecoms firms free up cash to invest in growth and expansion, potentially making a 5G airwaves auction this year a hot bidding contest between the country's three main carriers - Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) Idea.
Jio, the telecoms venture of conglomerate Reliance Industries which counts global tech giants Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) among its backers, has previously said it will be the first carrier to launch 5G services in India.

On Tuesday, India also announced a plan to gradually raise import taxes on some components used in electronic products such as smartwatches and earphones to boost local assembly.
Modi's government has used import tax barriers and production-linked incentives to boost electronics manufacturing in India. That move has helped companies including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s key suppliers Foxconn and Wistron to widen local operations and turned India into the world's second-biggest smartphone maker.

Investing.com -- Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) release earnings, while the ISM puts out its monthly U.S. manufacturing survey.  Stocks are set to consolidate after a sharp rebound in response to a change of tone from the Federal Reserve. And oil prices ease after newswires report OPEC predicting that the global market will swing back into surplus this year. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 1st February. 
1.  New economy earnings, old economy earnings
Two updates from opposite ends of the investing spectrum lead the day’s earnings calendar, allowing a rough comparison of whether the old or new economy represents better value at the current levels.
Exxon Mobil reports before the open, and is expected to report a sharp improvement in cash flow due to resurgent oil and gas prices in the fourth quarter. More important, however, will be its guidance and what that says about the sustainability of a rally that has continued since the start of the year, taking crude prices to their highest since 2014.
After the close, Alphabet will report its fourth-quarter earnings. The owner of Google and one of the world’s biggest Cloud-hosting operations had a strong year in 2021 as advertisers paid up handsomely to reach an audience that was still largely home-bound. Analysts will be looking for any sign of that momentum flagging in line with consumer-focused macro indicators in the last two months.
2. The Fed’s slight change of focus
Two senior Federal Reserve officials pushed back against the spreading opinion that the central bank will raise interest rates by much more than it has guided for this year.
Kansas City Fed President Esther George and her San Francisco counterpart Mary Daly both pushed back against the notion of rapid-fire rate increases, albeit both remained committed to tightening policy.
George, a noted ‘hawk’ on inflation who holds one of the rotating votes on the Federal Open Market Committee this year, said that it would be better to run down the balance sheet more quickly, thus pushing up long-term rates and keeping the yield curve steep.
Daly, a non-voting member on the FOMC this year, was more overtly dovish, telling a Reuters event that tightening should be “gradual and not disruptive.”
3. Stocks set to open lower
The stock market’s strong end to January is struggling to translate into a bright start for February. After rebounding sharply on Monday in response to comments coming out of the Fed, the main indices are marked lower again in overnight trading.
By 6:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 42 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.3% and NASDAQ 100 futures were down 0.2%.
Companies likely to be in focus later include  Sony  (NYSE:SONY), whose $3.6 billion acquisition of Destiny publisher Bungie appears at first glance to be an underwhelming response to Microsoft’s deal for Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) last month. Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), also mooted as a possible takeover target in the current environment, reports earnings later, along with United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) before the open, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) after the close.
The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index heads the data calendar at 10 AM ET.
4. Tesla to recall over 50,000 cars due to crash risk
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is to recall over 53,000 cars due to suspected crash risks.
Newswires reported the National Highways Traffic Safety Administration as saying that the company’s “Full Self-Driving” software may allow vehicles to travel through an all-way stop intersection without first coming to a stop.
The company had to recall nearly half a million Model 3 and Model S cars at the end of last year to fix issues with rearview cameras and trunks that also contributed to crash risks. Tesla said at the time it wasn’t aware of any crashes caused by the risks that the NHTSA flagged.
5. Crude slips on OPEC forecasts; API due
Crude oil prices edged lower after newswires quoted sources close to OPEC as seeing the global market in surplus by over 1 million barrels a day this year.
The forecasts are among those due to be analysed by OPEC’s Joint Technical Committee meeting on Tuesday, ahead of the regular review of output quotas by OPEC and allies led by Russia later in the week. 
U.S. crude futures edged down 0.2% to $88.00 a barrel, while Brent crude fell 0.3% to $89.05 a barrel.

LONDON (Reuters) - Two thirds of people in Britain reported that their cost of living rose last month as inflation accelerates, even before a big rise in domestic electricity and gas tariffs in April, the country's statistics office said.
A third of those who reported their cost of living had gone up were cutting back on domestic fuel use, and just over half said they were spending less on non-essentials, the Office for National Statistics said.
A surge in global energy prices has pushed Britain's main inflation rate to a 30-year high of 5.4% - mirroring sharp rises in price growth in many other countries - and the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates for a second time in two months on Thursday.
Domestic fuel prices are expected to jump by a further 50% when a twice-yearly review of regulated tariffs takes effect in April, just as higher social security contributions are due to take a further chunk out of household budgets.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government is looking at ways to soften the increase in energy prices for people on lower incomes. The ONS said higher power costs were disproportionately hitting people on lower incomes. Its data showed the poorest 10% of households spent 7% of their disposable income on gas and electricity, compared with 2% for the richest 10% of households.

Of those who said their cost of living had gone up, 87% said food they bought was more expensive followed by 79% who said their gas or electricity bills were higher.
The ONS's findings were based on a survey of nearly 4,500 people conducted between Jan 6. and Jan. 16.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Ongoing disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic poses a risk to India's fiscal deficit target for 2022/23, a Moody's (NYSE:MCO) analyst said on Tuesday, after the government presented its federal budget to support economic growth.
India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman set a fiscal deficit target of 6.4% of GDP for the year ending March 2023. For the current year, she estimated a fiscal deficit of 6.9%, slightly above the 6.8% it had budgeted.
The wider-than-expected fiscal deficit demonstrates the risk from the pandemic, said Christian de Guzman, senior vice president, sovereign risk group, Moody's Investors Service, adding that the government had to spend more and miss some receipts from privatisation.
India's economy has rebounded from the depths of the pandemic but mobility restrictions to curb the spread of the virus have led to tens of thousands of job losses, hamstrung private investments and caused supply chain disruptions which have pushed up food and raw material costs.
""The message here is that the pandemic risks still do exert an overall risk of a wider-than-expected fiscal deficit for the next year,"" Guzman told Reuters.
Sitharaman unveiled a bigger budget of 39.45 trillion rupee ($529.7 billion) for the coming fiscal year, stepping up investment on highways and railways and announcing higher subsidies for affordable housing, amid public criticism over inadequate relief following the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020.
The government, however, retained its aim to bring down the fiscal deficit to 4.5% of GDP by 2025/26.
""There is still an overwhelming emphasis on capital expenditure to further growth momentum. There has been somewhat limited initiatives with regards to raising revenue,"" Guzman said, adding that there was ""some uncertainty"" with the medium-term deficit target.

A government report on Monday warned that growing risks of global inflation led by rising crude oil prices could hit the economy, while projecting growth of 8% to 8.5% next fiscal year compared with 9.2% in the current fiscal year and 6.6% contraction in the previous year.
Guzman said the budget announcements did not change the rating agency's stance on India. Moody's rates India at ""Baa3"" with a ""stable"" outlook.

(Reuters) - U.S. high yield bond exchange-traded funds saw record monthly outflows in January as investors ditched assets likely to be hit by an increase in market volatility and aggressive rate rises by the Federal Reserve.

(Graphic: Monthly flows into U.S. high yield bond ETFs: https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/znpnejzgxvl/chart.png)
""More than any other financial asset, high yield bonds are extremely sensitive to Fed policy, because they encompass both credit spreads and long dated yields. Both of which should deteriorate as the Fed tightens policy,"" said Julian Brigden, president at research firm Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, based in Colorado.
While the Fed has made clear it is on an accelerated path to withdrawing stimulus and raising rates as soon as March, some Wall Street analysts are bracing for the Fed to possibly raise rates seven times this year.
The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA U.S. High Yield Index, a commonly used benchmark for the junk bond market, has dropped nearly 3% in January, the biggest fall since March 2020's decline of 11.7%.
The index's option-adjusted spread, which measures how much premium riskier companies should pay compared with what the government pays, widened to 361 basis points at the end of last month, from 310 basis points a month earlier.
The iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF led with outflows of $3.5 billion in January, while SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF and Xtrackers USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF faced net sales worth $824 million and $707 million, respectively.
(Graphic: Top 10 outflows from U.S. high yield bond ETFs in Jan.: https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/lgvdwxlbbpo/chart.png)
Adam Coons, portfolio manager at Winthrop Capital Management based in Indiana, said the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF has a correlation of 90% to the S&P 500 during declining markets. The S&P 500 stock index lost 5.3% in January, its biggest monthly drop since the pandemic took hold in March 2020.
""If an investor expects the fixed income allocation to be the safety asset and sees their positions in the red at the same time stocks are selling off, this can create sticker shock,"" he said.
""As long as the VIX remains above 20 we believe high yield ETF flows will be challenged."" 
The CBOE Volatility index - the Wall Street fear gauge - hit a near 1-year high of 31.96 at the end of last month. 
Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates, said he liked the floating rate bank loan and senior loan investments combined with cash-like ETFs. 
""Our ultra short ETF,, is 70% invested in floating rate bonds with just 0.8 years of duration and an average quality rating of single A. So we like a combination of high grade and low grade floating rate bonds in here,"" he said.
However, some analysts believe that the high yield bonds look attractive now after their selloff in January, due to their cheaper valuations.

""History has proven that retail investors tend to sell at the bottom and buy at the top. We are witnessing that same phenomenon during this downturn,"" said Winthrop's Coons.
""We are buyers of non-levered high yield bond funds in face of this decline. In particular, we look for ETFs that are trading at a discount to their funds' NAV.""

A surge in COVID-19 cases has forced some parts maker to halt production, causing output disruptions and delivery delays at auto giants such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp.
Suzuki Motor Corp also said on Tuesday it would halt some operations at domestic plants due to parts shortages.
""Demand is firm, but supply constraints will likely weigh on new auto sales in February onward,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
The darkening outlook for output heightens uncertainty over Japan's economic recovery, which is already threatened by curbs imposed in some areas to combat the pandemic.
Japan's consumer confidence fell in January for a second month, a government survey showed on Monday, as the spread of Omicron dampened shoppers' mood.
Some analysts warn the economy could contract in the current quarter after an expected rebound in October-December growth.
""Depending on the impact of Omicron on corporate activity, there's a chance Japan could suffer negative growth,"" said Ryutaro Kono, chief Japan economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).

Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, also sees the chance of a January-March contraction.
""Auto output was initially expected to rebound and serve as a driver of Japan's recovery. In reality, the hit to auto output from supply constraints will likely drag on growth,"" he said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's prime minister faced up to criticism of his leadership on Tuesday, saying his government had been too optimistic about the impact of coronavirus vaccinations leading to disappointment and exhaustion when the Omicron variant hit.
Scott Morrison faces an approval rating falling to its lowest level in two years with an election due in four months and public confidence battered by widespread shortages of rapid antigen tests as Omicron cases surged past 1 million over the summer. 
In an address to the National Press Club in Canberra, Morrison said he would take the criticism that came with the leader's job.
""I haven't got everything right,"" he said.
Morrison said his focus had been on balancing health objectives with the economy, and Omicron had changed the rules, disrupting supply chains and causing a shortage of tests. 
In early January, Morrison had said his government was adopting a ""push through"" approach to the pandemic instead of returning to lockdowns.
""As we went into the summer we were too optimistic perhaps,"" he said, adding this had heightened the disappointment people felt when vaccinations did not stop Omicron's spread.
Responding to criticism that his government had not anticipated the need for more tests, Morrison said it had been the responsibility of the states, in Australia's federal system, to supply COVID tests through most of the pandemic.
He acknowledged public frustration and, in an election pitch, said the country needed a leader with experience to persevere. 
Australia's pandemic death rate was among the lowest in the world and it had a high vaccination rate despite a delayed rollout, he said.
Authorities reported 77 deaths on Tuesday, down from a record 98 hit last Friday, and just over 35,000 new cases.
Hospitalisations have remained steady at about 5,000 for the last few days after peaking at just under 5,400 a week ago. Throughout the pandemic, just over 3,800 people have died of COVID-19 in Australia.
Morrison highlighted the strength of the economy, with Australia maintaining a AAA credit rating, and said more people were in work than before the pandemic, with an unemployment rate of 4.2%.
The federal government will offer extra payments worth up to A$800 to staff of carehomes for the elderly, he announced, as more than 1,200 nursing homes deal with COVID-19 outbreaks that killed hundreds of people in January and led to staff shortages.
He also announced a A$2billion plan to boost manufacturing by commercializing research.
""We need to find and develop a new breed of researcher entrepreneurs in Australia,"" Morrison said.
The government will fund a A$2.2 billion plan to commercialize research, including A$1.6 billion for a programme for early-stage research that is vulnerable to higher levels of uncertainty about commercial returns.

The science agency CSIRO will get A$150 million to expand a venture capital programme backing start-ups. Another A$296 million will be allocated over the next decade to universities to fund 1,800 PhDs and 800 fellowships with an industry focus.
An election is due in May or earlier.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's central bank kept its cash rate at a record low of 0.1% on Tuesday and ended its A$275 billion ($194.40 billion) bond buying campaign as expected, but pushed back hard on market wagers for an early rate rise.
Wrapping up its February policy meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) emphasised that ceasing bond purchases did ""not imply"" a near-term increase in interest rates and the Board was still prepared to be patient.
""As the Board has stated previously, it will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3% target range,"" RBA Governor Philip Lowe said in a brief statement. ""While inflation has picked up, it is too early to conclude that it is sustainably within the target band.""
The dovish message saw the local dollar slip a touch to $0.7055, though markets still think the RBA is behind the curve on inflation. Lowe is now set to give a speech on policy on Wednesday and the bank will release a full set of economic forecasts on Friday. 
Most analysts had expected an end to bond buying as such quantitative easing was no longer required with unemployment falling to 13-year lows of 4.2% and core inflation surging to seven-year highs of 2.6%. [AU/INT] 
The latter was a major shock given the RBA had thought core inflation would not reach 2.5% until the end of next year.
As a result, Lowe said core inflation was now forecast to rise to around 3.25% in coming quarters, before easing to 2.75% over 2023. Unemployment was seen falling to below 4% later this year and to be around 3.75% at the end of next year.
Markets have long been wagering the RBA will ultimately blink on inflation and raise rates as early as May, with another four hikes to 1.25% priced in by December.
A May move would also be a political hot potato given a national election is likely to be called for that month.
New Zealand's central bank has already hiked twice in the face of global inflationary pressures, and the U.S. Federal Reserve has flagged its first tightening for March.
The RBA, however, is still prepared to wait for wages to pick up after years of sub par outcomes. Lowe wants to see annual wage growth reach 3% or more, up from the current 2.2% and a pace not seen since 2013.
That put the focus squarely on wage figures for the December quarter due out later this month.
""It is likely that we will require 2 to 3 quarterly prints that show strengthening wages growth before the RBA pulls the rate hike trigger,"" said Gareth Aird, head of Australian economics at CBA.
""We have pencilled in a first increase of 15 basis points in August, which would take the cash rate to 0.25%.""
A surge in coronavirus cases did hit consumer spending in January, but that followed a binge in the December quarter that points to considerable economic momentum.
The RBA still expected economic growth to run at a solid 4.5% this year, before slowing to 2% over 2023.

""The Omicron outbreak has affected the economy, but it has not derailed the economic recovery,"" Lowe concluded.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda said a weak yen has both merits and demerits for the economy due to the country's changing export patterns and increasing reliance on imports.
The remark underscores how a weak yen has become a tricky political issue for Japan's finance ministry, which has historically focused on preventing a strong currency from hurting the country's export sector.
On recent yen moves against the dollar, Kanda said the currency pair now appeared to be ""lacking a clear sense of direction"", having risen steadily last year.
""The yen's decline last year was said to be driven mostly by widening U.S.-Japanese interest rate differentials. The dollar was rising against most other currencies on the back of heightening U.S. inflation expectations,"" he told Reuters in an interview conducted on Monday.
""That has changed somewhat this year,"" as jitters over a resurgence in COVID-19 infections and the varying pace of recovery in each country induced risk-off sentiment, he said.
Kanda, the country's vice finance minister for international affairs, said the boost a weak yen gives to Japan's export volumes is now smaller than it used to be, as manufacturers target shipments to high-end, state-of-the-art products overseas rather than compete with price cuts.
A weak yen, however, still inflates the yen-denominated profits Japanese companies earn overseas, he said.
""The demerits of a weak yen are that it pushes up the import cost of energy and food, thereby increasing household burdens,"" he said, acknowledging growing domestic concerns about the potential side-effects of a weak currency.
""There are both positive and negative effects (on the economy) from a weak yen. It's hard to say which is bigger, because the pros and cons of a weak yen differ for each entity.""
ECONOMIC SECURITY
Kanda's comments highlight a shift in Tokyo's perception on currency moves away from one focusing on the boost a weak yen gives to the export-reliant economy, to one paying more attention to the potential disadvantages of yen declines.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has also said the hit to households from a weak yen may have become bigger due to Japan's rising reliance on raw material imports.
Kanda said imports play an increasingly important role in Japan's economy, making up 16% of gross domestic product (GDP) now, compared with just 9% two decades ago.
""We need to guide policy based on the understanding that the mechanism in which exchange-rate moves affect the economy has changed,"" he said.
But Kanda stressed that global energy and commodity inflation, rather than the weak yen, was mostly to blame for pushing up the cost of living for households.
In a sign China's growing presence is affecting Japan's economic policy, the government plans to submit a bill to parliament that allows it to screen foreign investment in key infrastructure.
Kanda said the finance ministry will ramp up efforts on this front, such as increasing staff overseeing economic security.

""Japan must promote investment from overseas, while dealing with investment that could undermine its national security,"" Kanda said.
""We will continue to review guidelines to adapt in a timely manner to a rapidly changing strategic and technological environment.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -A prominent Argentine lawmaker on Monday broke ranks with the country's ruling party on Monday, rejecting a $44.5 billion agreement struck in principle with the International Monetary Fund late last week, a sign of cracks in the ruling coalition.
Militant leftist Maximo Kirchner said he was resigning from his role as the ruling party bloc leader in the lower chamber. Kirchner is also the son of two former Argentine presidents and historical leaders of the Peronist party: Nestor Kirchner and Cristina Fernandez, who is also the current vice president.
""This decision stems from not agreeing with the strategy, and, least of all, the results achieved in the negotiation with the International Monetary Fund,"" he wrote in a public letter. 
Argentine President Alberto Fernandez said on Friday the country had reached an agreement after years of negotiations with the IMF to restructure loan payments on debt initially taken on during the administration of Mauricio Macri in 2018.
""Tomorrow we will be deciding who replaces (Kirchner),"" Fernandez said in an interview with local TV channel C5N. ""I'm convinced this is the best agreement we could have reached with the (IMF)."" 
The agreement, which still has details to iron out and needs approval from Congress and the IMF board, was a major breakthrough, but has caused tensions within the Peronist coalition over economic targets included in the deal.

The agreement would require Argentina to reduce its deficit to zero by 2025 and make big cuts to steep energy subsidies the government makes to keep rates low.
""I will remain in the bloc to ease the tasks of the President and his entourage,"" Kirchner wrote. ""It's best to step aside so that, (Fernandez) can pick somebody who believes in this program with the IMF.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The largest U.S. labor organization said Monday it strongly supported a U.S. House of Representatives bill designed to improve competition with China, boost U.S. semiconductor production and reform key trade provisions.
The AFL-CIO trade federation representing 12.5 million workers said in a letter to lawmakers the bill's $52 billion for chips is critical to ""addressing the current chip shortage that continues to adversely impact production in the automotive sector and elsewhere."" 
The U.S. House plans to take up the bill later this week. On Tuesday, the House Rules Committee is set to consider more than 500 proposed amendments to the bill including one from Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush that would bar semiconductor firms receiving government subsidies from paying dividends or repurchasing company stock.
On Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo will speak to House Democrats about the importance of the legislation, according to an invitation seen by Reuters.
The union said the bill ""will provide critical and overdue enhancements to America’s global competitive capabilities, support workers whose jobs are lost to trade, and protect and expand the tools to fight foreign unfair trade.""
The U.S Chamber of Commerce said it was pleased the House ""is now starting the process of considering its version of this legislation. House action is an essential step in producing a bill that can be signed into law.""
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on Friday that the House would vote on the 2,900-page bill, called the ""America Competes"" act. The bill authorizes $45 billion to support supply-chain resilience and manufacturing of critical goods and industrial equipment.
President Joe Biden's administration is pushing Congress to approve funding to subsidize chip production in the United States, as shortages of the component used in vehicles and computers have exacerbated supply-chain bottlenecks.
The Senate passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act last year, which includes $52 billion for chips and authorizes $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research to compete with China.
The House bill has some differences with the Senate version. If approved, leaders of both chambers will negotiate to resolve differences.

The AFL-CIO backed a new review process to protect supply chains ""by screening outbound investment and guarding against offshoring of critical capabilities to adversaries like China and Russia.""
The group added ""from semiconductors to pharmaceutical ingredients, it will provide a needed review mechanism to advance U.S. production and employment.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday rejected concerns that Sarah Bloom Raskin would be unable to maintain independence at the Federal Reserve given that her husband led impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump. 
Raskin, U.S. President Joe Biden's nominee as the Fed's vice chair for supervision, should be judged on her ""impeccable credentials"" and not her marriage to Representative Jamie Raskin, who served as the lead Democratic prosecutor for the unsuccessful 2021 impeachment trial, Psaki told reporters.
""I think she can stand on her own qualifications, not just because she's a woman, but because she's done a lot in her career,"" Psaki said. ""She has been said by many to be the most qualified person to be nominated to this role, which I think is probably more important than who she's married to."" 
Raskin, a former Fed governor and senior Treasury Department official who is strongly backed by progressive Democrats, has become a lightning rod for criticism from business groups and fiscal conservatives for her views on climate change.
Psaki told reporters Raskin had pledged her commitment to the independent role of the Federal Reserve and would work with her colleagues to mitigate a range of risks, if confirmed.
""Just like any nominee, she should be judged by qualifications,"" Psaki said. ""Her experience and her impeccable credentials were the determinant in her being nominated for this role, and I think it's a little questionable for anyone to raise otherwise.""
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce last week sent an unprecedented letter to lawmakers https://www.reuters.com/business/us-chamber-issues-rare-warning-fed-nominee-raskin-citing-oil-gas-views-2022-01-28 raising concerns about Raskin and her calls for federal regulators to transition financing away from the fossil fuel industry. 
On Monday, 24 members of the fiscally conservative State Financial Officers Foundation, representing 21 states, urged Biden to withdraw Raskin's nomination, warning that what they called her ""radical banking and economic views"" could shut oil and gas companies out of bank loans and send energy costs sharply higher.
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown last week said he met with Raskin and Biden's nominees for two other Fed jobs, and said there was no question that they were qualified.
Administration officials say Raskin's views on climate change are in line with public comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

But the top Republican on the panel, Pat Toomey, has blasted Raskin for what he called ""demonstrated hostility"" toward the oil and gas sector.
The committee, which must approve the Fed nominees before they are considered by the full Senate, will hold a confirmation hearing on Thursday for Raskin and two Black economists nominated for the board, Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson.

(Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers say they'll raise interest rates in March but spoke cautiously on Monday about what might follow, signaling a desire to keep options open in the face of an uncertain outlook for inflation and a pandemic still ongoing. 
In what sounded like a well-orchestrated chorus, four Fed officials said they felt it was time for the U.S. central bank to begin removing support from an economy that is growing strongly and where inflation is at its highest in four decades. 
Despite forecasts by Wall Street analysts that five, six or even seven interest-rate hikes will be needed this year, the four resisted laying out the kind of clear policy path that markets have come to expect from recent tightening cycles. 
""We definitely are poised for a March increase,"" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Reuters in a brief phone interview. ""But after that, I want to see what the data brings us ... let's get through Omicron, let's look at this and let's see.""
""I'd like us to be better positioned,"" Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin told CNBC. ""Better positioned is somewhere closer to neutral, certainly, than we are now and I think the pace of that just depends on the pace of inflation."" 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that he and fellow U.S. central bankers were ""of a mind"" to raise interest rates at their March 15-16 meeting as they begin to pare back support for the economy.
Policymakers are also expected to begin shrinking the central bank's nearly $9 trillion portfolio later this year, a balance sheet that doubled in size as the Fed purchased Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities to shore up markets and nurture the recovery from the economic ravages of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Officials say that the U.S. economy no longer needs the same level of support, and that they need to address the arrival of high inflation as demand outstrips supply. But their outlook for how quickly to remove that accommodation is clouded, because they cannot be sure how inflation will behave. 
""We know that goods supply chain issues are going to ease in time; that should bring prices down,"" Barkin said. But at the same time, ""we know there's pressure on the service side from rising wages,"" which will tend to drive prices up. 
Complicating the picture further, U.S. economic growth could slow at the start of this year - after it expanded last year at the fastest annual pace since 1984 - as fiscal support wanes and a surge in infections caused by the Omicron COVID-19 variant disrupts the labor market. 
""We are going to need to be thinking very carefully about how things are going, how the economy responds to our first moves,"" Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told Yahoo Finance. ""We are not set on any particular trajectory. The data will tell us what is happening."" 
Economic reports are mixed. Inflation expectations remained broadly anchored through the end of last year, while some of the most intense price pressures may have begun to ease.
But the labor market recovery likely slowed last month. Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. payrolls added a median of 153,000 jobs in January, the fewest in a year, and about 10% of those polled think the economy lost jobs over the month.

Kansas City Fed President Esther George said the uncertainty caused by the virus makes it difficult for Fed officials to provide the same kind of guidance it has offered in the past. 
""It is in no one's interest to try to upset the economy with unexpected adjustments,"" George said during an event organized by The Economic Club of Indiana. ""I do think the Federal Reserve is going to have to move deliberately in its decisions to begin to withdraw accommodation."" 
 
"
561,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 03:57PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. inflationary pressures should ease in 2022 due to weaker demand for goods, easing supply bottlenecks and a receding coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. Treasury's top economist said on Monday.
In a statement released alongside the Treasury's quarterly borrowing estimates, Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Ben Harris said he expects energy prices to stabilize in 2022, but geopolitical instability could push prices higher.
Harris said the course of the pandemic remains a primary downside risk to the U.S. economic outlook, along with supply chain disruptions, high energy prices and housing costs.
Future coronavirus variants ""may have worse symptoms or fatality rates or may be fully resistant to current vaccines and present a significant risk to the economic outlook. On the other hand, given the level of vaccinations and prior infection, the U.S. population may be nearing herd immunity.""
He also said that the pandemic continues to endanger the recovery of supply chains due to continued lockdowns in China and southeast Asia, which could keep goods prices elevated.
Potential future growth also depends on the recovery of the U.S. labor supply, which has been diminished by the pandemic, Harris said.
""If these losses in labor supply are permanently lost due to the pandemic, then potential economic growth has been shifted lower,"" he said.

But Harris noted that strong household balance sheets were a positive support for stronger GDP growth, as is investment in housing, energy production and commercial properties. State and local governments are also seeing a stronger-than-expected recovery in revenues, bolstered by last year's $350 billion in coronavirus aid funds, Harris said.
""At the start of 2022, key investment sectors are poised for strong growth, despite ongoing supply chain difficulties and the specter of new COVID variants,"" Harris added.

(Reuters) - How fast and far the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates once it begins doing so in March will depend on what happens with the economy and, more specifically, with inflation, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Monday. 
""I'd like the Fed to get better positioned, and I think we've got a good part of the year to get there,"" Barkin told CNBC in an interview. ""I think how fast we get there just depends on how the economy develops. ... I am just going to be looking to see how inflation develops through the year.""

563,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 03:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials said they want to avoiding unnecessarily disrupting the U.S. economy as they prepare to start raising interest rates, showing little stomach for an aggressive 50 basis-point move in March.
Chair Jerome Powell declared last week that officials were ready to raise rates at their next meeting to curb the strongest inflation in four decades. But he declined to give specific guidance on the policy path, apart from saying that support should be removed steadily and policy had to be nimble in responding to incoming economic data.
His reticence has opened the door to hiking at every meeting this year if needed. But Powell went out of his way to indicate that officials had not made up their minds and his colleagues on Monday echoed that caution.
“You always want to go gradually, in the economy. It is in no one’s interest to try to upset the economy with unexpected adjustments,” Kansas City Fed President Esther George told the Economic Club of Indiana. “But I do think the Federal Reserve is going to have to move deliberately in its decisions to begin to withdraw accommodation.” George, one of the central bank’s more hawkish officials, is a policy voter this year.
Investors have increased bets on the pace of increases since Powell spoke, shifting to roughly five this year versus the three that officials forecast in December. But Wall Street economists have split over how time the Fed will act, penciling in as many as seven hikes as well as the risk that officials lift rates by 50 basis points -- the first increase of that magnitude since 2000 -- to keep price pressures at bay.
San Francisco Fed chief Mary Daly, who has been one of the more dovish officials at the central bank, said rates could rise as early as March. But she denied the Fed was behind the curve and cited a number of risks facing the economy in addition to the ongoing pandemic, including headwinds as fiscal support fades.
“When you’re trying to get an economy from extraordinary support to one that’s going to just gradually put it on to a self-sustaining path, you have to be data-dependent,” she told Reuters Breakingviews in a live-streamed interview. “But you also have to be gradual and not disruptive.”
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“Our baseline is for the Fed to hike five times, each 25 basis points, this year, and balance-sheet runoff to begin in July. Our in-house rule for the Fed’s reaction function flags an upside risk for a 50 bps-hike in March followed by five 25 basis-point hikes in the rest of the year.”
-- Anna Wong, chief U.S. economist
Citing the Fed’s December forecasts, Daly noted that four increases this year -- if that is what transpires -- would lift rates to 1.25% and “that is quite a bit of tightening, but it is also quite a bit of accommodation.”
Officials have pivoted to tightening policy after acknowledging that price pressures have failed to fade as expected. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told Yahoo Finance that his outlook called for three increases in 2022 and he did not favor raising rates by 50 basis points in March.
“We’re not set on any particular trajectory. The data will tell us what is happening,” he said, adding that if month-on-month prices changes moderated from current high levels by the late spring or early summer, he might not need to adjust his rate forecast at all.
“I would adjust my policy to maybe not be as aggressive in terms of raising interest rates” if inflation decelerates more than expected, he added.

If they do rise that much, she said, ""we will have tightened a lot and we will still have considerable accommodation in the system.""
But, she added, ""I don't want to predetermine what that level should be, because I really do see the two-sided risks we're facing, and so I want to be data dependent ... We have to have our options open, right? And if more is needed, more will be done. If less is needed, less will be done, but we have to have our options open."" 
The Fed last week signaled its readiness to join its most serious battle with inflation in decades, beginning by raising interest rates at its next meeting, March 15-16, and signaling it could begin to trim its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet as soon as midyear. 
Consumer prices jumped 7% last year, more than double the Fed's 2% target. 
""No one's comfortable"" with such high inflation, Daly said, noting that price gains are broad-based and no longer confined largely to pandemic-hit sectors. 
Still, she said, ""we are not behind the curve, we are not behind the curve at all.""

Wages are rising, but there is no sign of that pushing up prices in a 1970s-style wage-price spiral, she said. The challenge for the Fed, Daly said, is to remove its ""extraordinary accommodation"" and allow the economy to stand on its own, without removing so much that it undercuts economic growth.
""Do we need to adjust the policy rate?"" Daly asked. ""Absolutely.""

(Reuters) - Data watched closely by the Federal Reserve showed inflation expectations remained broadly anchored through the end of last year, while an alternate measure of inflation showed the most intense price pressures may have begun to ease. 
At the same time, a Reuters poll of economists confirmed expectations of a weak January U.S. jobs report, with data to be released on Friday anticipated to show just 153,000 positions added in what would be the worst showing in a year. About 10% of those polled think the economy lost jobs over the month, which featured a record number of new COVID-19 infections from the highly transmissible Omicron variant.
That good-news-bad-news mix could well typify the nature of incoming economic data in the weeks ahead as policymakers gear up to start reversing the extraordinary accommodation they put in place two years ago to shield the economy from the economic fallout of the pandemic.
The U.S. central bank has all but said it will begin raising interest rates at its March 15-16 policy meeting to kick off a steady tightening of monetary policy meant to ensure inflation is brought under control. The pace of price increases has accelerated to multi-decade highs and at 5.8%, by the Fed's preferred measure, is nearly three times the central bank's 2% target. 
But data in the interim could influence how fast policymakers expect subsequent rate increases to be approved, and how firmly they are willing to lay out that path in their policy statement.
The start of the year may leave room for debate, with some economists forecasting little to no economic growth for the first few months of the year with job growth dampened by the ongoing Omicron-driven outbreak.
In an interview with Reuters Breakingviews, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said it was clear rates should rise, but that the Fed needed to look at a broad set of risks - including, for example, that support from federal spending will decline this year, and that overreacting could damage the recovery just as inflation is easing on its own. 
""Do we need to adjust the policy rate? Absolutely,"" Daly said. But ""you don't want to overreact and ratchet rates too quickly ... We are not trying to combat some viscous wage-price spiral. We are just recognizing the economy is getting itself to a self-sustaining level"" and does not need the Fed's help in the form of low market interest rates.
'EVERY OPTION' ON THE TABLE 
Inflation data to be released next week is expected to show consumer prices through January continued speeding ahead at an annual pace of more than 7% - a level more reminiscent of the high inflation era of the 1970s and early 1980s and enough to offset recent wage gains for many workers.
But the monthly pace of change is expected to ease, and other recent inflation data have pointed in that direction as well.
Along with actual pricing data, Fed officials pay close attention to measures of inflation expectations, or how households and businesses anticipate inflation will behave in the future. 
On Friday, the Fed updated an index that combines several measures of household and market expectations. It has risen this year, but was largely unchanged from the prior quarter even as inflation itself sped ahead - a sign the public had not lost faith in the Fed's ability to defend its 2% target even after a period of faster-than-anticipated price increases.

A separate Dallas Fed inflation measure that excludes items with the fastest and slowest price increases did increase slightly in December, from 2.9% to 3% on an annual basis, a sign that inflation was broadly affecting the economy.
But the month-to-month rate fell sharply, and the share of goods seeing the fastest price increases fell as well.

Still, the Fed has positioned itself to raise rates, and if inflation trends don't turn lower, central bank officials have insisted they will do what it takes, including raising rates at every meeting or in larger than the usual quarter-percentage-point increments.
For now ""every option is on the table for every meeting,"" Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told the Financial Times over the weekend. ""If the data say that things have evolved in a way that a 50-basis-point move is required or (would) be appropriate, then I'm going to lean into that . ... If moving in successive meetings makes sense, I'll be comfortable with that.""

(Reuters) -The Federal Reserve can move sooner to start reducing its bond holdings than in the past and aggressive action to shrink the U.S. central bank's portfolio could allow it to take a shallower path on interest rate increases, Kansas City Fed President Esther George said on Monday.
The Fed signaled last week that it is likely to start raising interest rates when it meets in March, and officials are expected to begin offloading more than $8 trillion in bond holdings later this year. George said both actions, which the Fed is taking to remove the extraordinary support provided during the pandemic, are connected. 
""What we do on the balance sheet is likely to affect the path of policy rates and vice versa,"" George said during an event organized by the Economic Club of Indiana. ""For example, if we took more aggressive action on lowering, pulling down that balance sheet, it might allow for fewer interest rate increases."" 
George said a different approach in which the central bank pairs a ""steep path"" for rate increases with more modest reductions to the balance sheet could lead to more financial risks. 

She said such a scenario where the Fed is raising short-term interest rates while maintaining a large balance sheet ""could flatten the yield curve."" That could, in turn, lead to ""reach-for-yield behavior from long-duration investors.""
""All in all, it could be appropriate to move earlier on the balance sheet relative to the last tightening cycle,"" George said.

567,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 10:38AM ET</span>",,,,,,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Inflation rose the most in 15 years in some of Latin America's largest economies last year, but credible monetary policies have kept long-term price increase expectations anchored, the International Monetary Fund said in a blog post on Monday.
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru saw prices increase by 8.3% in 2021, the largest increase in 15 years and higher than in other emerging markets, the IMF said.
Argentina, another large economy in the region, saw inflation rise over 50% last year.
Other than rising import and commodity prices, said the IMF, forex weakness and pent-up consumer demand, built-in increases that adjust with inflation have pushed prices even higher in some cases across Latam.
But in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, central banks have earned their credibility as policy rates rose last year between 1.25 percentage points and 7.25 percentage points. Policy tightening, alongside forward guidance, have helped keep inflation expectations anchored, the Fund said.
""Long-term inflation expectations remain relatively well-anchored, which reflects trust in monetary policy to bring inflation back to targets. However, short-term inflation expectations are elevated, suggesting the need for continued vigilance,"" said the IMF.
Tighter monetary policy in the United States, which typically increases pressure on Latam and other emerging markets, is another variable the region needs to take into account. 
""Policymakers could prepare for U.S. monetary policy tightening by extending public debt maturities, reducing fiscal rollover needs more generally, and limiting the buildup of currency mismatches on financial sector balance sheets where possible,"" the IMF said.
SOCIAL TENSIONS LINGER
Price pressures alongside a busy electoral calendar this year and a growth slowdown continue to keep social unrest as a high regional risk.
""The pandemic hit after a year of widespread social unrest in the region, which had built up during years of economic stagnation following the end of the commodity boom. With a heavy election calendar looming, social unrest remains a major risk and inequality will need to be addressed,"" the IMF said.
Brazil, Colombia and Costa Rica will elect presidents this year while referendums and local elections are expected in Chile, Uruguay, Mexico and Peru.
GROWTH SLOWDOWN
The IMF last week lowered its expectation for 2022 GDP growth in Latin America and the Caribbean by 0.6 percentage point to 2.4% for this year after an estimated 6.8% rebound in 2021.
The Fund cited slower growth in China and the United States, logistics bottlenecks and the emergence of the Omicron variant in its regional downgrade.

This has left the region facing what the Fund calls three major challenges: ensuring the sustainability of public finances, raising potential growth and doing it in a manner that promotes social cohesion and addresses social inequities.
""Addressing these challenges, which started even before the pandemic, will take time. Policymakers should start now to develop a comprehensive strategy for addressing them and building societal consensus around this strategy,"" the Fund said.

DUBAI (Reuters) -The United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Monday said it would introduce a federal corporate tax on business profits for the first time starting from June 1, 2023, although it kept the rate low, at 9 percent, to maintain its attractiveness for businesses.
The Gulf Arab oil exporter, a magnet for the globe's ultra-rich, has long benefited from its tax-free status to carve out a role as an international commercial, energy and tourism hub.
Much of this tax-free regime, including no personal income tax, remains. But the Finance Ministry said it was launching corporate tax to align with international efforts to combat tax avoidance, as well as to address challenges arising from the digitalisation of the global economy.
The new tax will be levied on all corporations and commercial activities in the country, except for the ""extraction of natural resources"" which will remain subject to taxation at the emirate level.
A ministry statement said the new regime implies a standard statutory tax rate of 9%, as well as a 0% rate for taxable profits up to 375,000 dirhams ($102,107.50) in order to support small businesses and startups. 
The ministry added that the move would pave the way for the introduction of a global minimum tax rate that would apply a different corporate tax rate to large multinationals that meet specific criteria.
It did not elaborate, but this appeared to be a reference to new rules agreed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in October and 136 countries including the UAE to ensure big companies pay a minimum tax rate of 15%.
The move to a tax of 9% chimes with the country's efforts to diversify budget revenues to reduce reliance on petroleum, for decades the mainstay of the economy.
""The UAE continues to make progress in diversifying its budget revenue away from oil, and a corporate tax fits into this strategy. The tax rate remains low by global standards,"" said Khatija Haque, chief economist at Emirates NBD.
""With the international tax treaty signed at the end of last year, many corporates may still have to pay a top-up tax in their country of residence. It is positive for the UAE to earn the tax on the business conducted and income sourced domestically,"" said Monica Malik, Chief Economist at Aby Dhabi Commercial Bank. 
In 2018, the UAE introduced value added tax on most goods and services at a standard rate of 5%. The UAE imposes a 20% tax on branches of foreign banks operating in the country, and on companies with concession agreements in the oil and gas sector of up to 55% at the emirate level.
Businesses in the UAE are exempted from paying taxes on capital gains and dividends received from shareholdings, the ministry said. 
The new programme left intact the exemption for individuals from income tax, capital gains tax on real estate and other investments, and other earnings that do not come from a business. 

The UAE corporate tax regime will continue to honour the corporate tax incentives currently being offered to free zone businesses that comply with all regulatory requirements and that do not conduct business with mainland UAE, the ministry said.

A hawkish stance by the Fed has pushed up short-term rates, flattening the closely followed yield curve on U.S. Treasuries.
Money managers and economists often view this shrinking of the gap between yields on shorter-term Treasuries and those maturing out years as a sign of worries over economic growth and uncertainty about monetary policy.
The spread between the yield on 10- and 2-year U.S. Treasury debt [US2US10=TWEB] tightened to early November lows on Monday after hawkish comments by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF)'s Steve Englander and John Davies, in the research note dated Friday, forecast four rate hikes from the Fed in a row, in March, May, June and July. That will mean pausing ahead of the U.S. midterm election ""will not look partisan,"" they said. 
Englander and Davies said they were raising their two-year yield forecast for the end of 2022 to 1.5% from 1.2% but said the market ""will increasingly question the resilience of growth during Q2 and beyond, leading to a completely flat 2Y/10Y curve by mid-year."" 
Federal Reserve officials are monitoring the flattening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, but don't view its behavior as an ""iron law"" that predicts economic outcomes, Chair Jerome Powell said last week.

Englander and Davies said that the flattening pressure may slow post July as they expect the Fed's hiking to pause.
""However, given Powell’s view that yield curve signals concerning slowdown/recession risks are not “iron clad”, we doubt that Fed messaging or actions can prevent the 2Y/10Y curve dipping into inverted territory by year-end,"" they said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than 1,400 U.S. flights were canceled on Sunday after the nation's northeast states were walloped a day earlier by a deadly winter storm that prompted several states to declare emergencies. 
The total number of flight cancellations within, into, or out of the United States was about 1,450 as of Sunday afternoon, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. Another 1,774 U.S.-related flights were delayed, the data showed.
LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City and Boston Logan International Airport were among the hardest hit by delays and cancellations. 
The fierce winter storm on Saturday dropped more than 2 feet (60 cm) of snow on some areas while packing high winds, prompting thousands of flight cancellations and leading governors in Rhode Island and other states to curtail access to the roads.
New York's Long Island town of Islip was the hardest hit statewide, Governor Kathy Hochul told WCBS-TV on Sunday. ""We're going to give them the golden snowball award for this week, this storm. They were at 24.7 inches,"" Hochul said.
""The storm moved out of our region last night, but we expect to be clearing more roads … and working with our utilities throughout the day today and tomorrow,"" Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito said at a Sunday morning briefing.
In neighboring Canada, the worst of the cold weather was over in Atlantic Canada, but many communities were dealing with residual blowing snow, rain, strong winds and storm surge on Sunday, according to the Weather Network channel.
The conditions on the Massachusetts island of Nantucket improved on Sunday after the powerful nor'easter flooded roads and caused a large power outage on Saturday, the local police department said. The water was deep enough for two high school students to row a canoe along a flooded street, according to a photo posted on social media. 

In Massachusetts, about 31,000 out of 2.6 million customers were without electricity as of early Sunday, according to the https://poweroutage.us website. Utility company Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) said most of its customers who were still without power will have it back by the end of the day on Monday.
The weather may have contributed to at least three deaths in New York alone, all on Long Island. One was an elderly woman who was found on Saturday in a hotel parking lot in Uniondale, New York, with her car window open, according to the Nassau County Police Department. Authorities also reported the deaths of two men, ages 53 and 75, who collapsed while shoveling snow at separate locations in the Long Island town of Syosset on Saturday.

Investing.com -- The dollar steadied as signs increased that the markets are comfortable with their adjustment to a new interest rate path in the U.S. Tensions with Russia continue to bubble as the Senate prepares broader sanctions. Oil prices continue to push higher amid concerns that OPEC+ can't keep up with rising global demand. And Italian assets rally as Mario Draghi prepares to serve a full term as Prime Minister. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 31st January. 
1. Markets steady as yield curve flattens
The dollar steadied and global markets were mixed as a wild January approached its conclusion, with a growing sense that the market has adjusted to new expectations for U.S. interest rates this year.
By 6:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 172 points, or 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.2%. However, Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.3%. In the bond market, 2-Year Treasury yields have stabilized around 1.20% after rising nearly half a percentage point since the start of the year. The 10-Year yield has retreated back to 1.79% from a high of 1.87% last week, suggesting that the market has regained some confidence that the Fed will keep inflation in check in the medium term.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS), after a report suggesting that the price of the Elliott/Vista-backed buyout for the remote access software stock is likely to be below Friday’s close, and U.K. cell carrier Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), which reportedly has a new activist shareholder to deal with in the form of Swedish-based Cevian.
L3Harris and, after the bell, NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) are both due to report earnings later.
2. Ukraine tensions bubble on
The weekend brought no sign of a meaningful de-escalation of the tensions around Russia and its plans for Ukraine.
The U.S. Senate is reportedly close to preparing sanctions that would further restrict Russian banks’ access to international markets and limit Russia’s ability to borrow in dollars. However, talk of the country’s banks being excluded from the SWIFT financial messaging system – which would restrict but not end Russian banks’ access to international capital markets – has again died down, amid concerns that it would also disrupt global energy markets.
The U.K., which has allowed Russian money to circulate freely through its financial system despite promising a crackdown after the invasion of Crimea in 2014, has also said it is preparing to tighten its regulations.
3. Carry on, Mario
Italian bonds and stocks rallied after news that 83 year-old Sergio Mattarella will continue for now as the country’s president, after a series of votes by parliamentarians last week failed to agree on any alternative candidate.
That means ex-European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will continue to head the government, possibly serving out a term that is set to last until elections next year. That in turn means that Italy is likely to stay on a relatively predictable economic and political path for this year, allowing it to receive tens of billions of euros in payments from the EU’s groundbreaking Next Generation program, which goes further than any previous mechanism for fiscal transfers between various parts of the bloc.
The spread between the German and Italian 10-year bonds, a touchstone for Eurozone financial stress, fell to its lowest in three weeks.
4 Eurozone GDP plods on; CPI peak may have passed
The Eurozone economy had an unspectacular fourth quarter, as supply chain woes in Germany offset what was a firmer-than-expected rebound in France, Italy and Spain.  Eurozone GDP rose 0.3% on the quarter, as expected, after Italy reported a better-than-expected 0.6% increase and Austria reported a painful 2.2% contraction due to an early and severe lockdown in December.
Arguably of more importance, preliminary consumer inflation numbers in Germany are expected to show their first clear decline as a VAT hike that took effect at the start of last year passes out of the calculations.  Spanish consumer prices fell 0.5% on the month, bringing the annual rate down to 6.0% from 6.5%.
5. Oil pushes higher on fears of OPEC+ impotence
Crude oil prices resumed their upward march ahead of a key meeting by the world’s largest exporters later in the week.
In addition to concerns about the stability of Russian energy exports in the event of war between Russia and Ukraine, analysts are also concerned by the seeming inability of OPEC and others to continue delivering on their stated policy of gradual output rises. The OPEC+ bloc is currently producing over 600,000 barrels a day less than it had foreseen when it embarked upon that course last year.
The United Arab Emirates, another major exporter, said earlier it had had to intercept yet another missile strike from Iran-backed rebels in Yemen overnight.
By 6:40 AM ET (1140 GMT), U.S. crude futures were up 0.6% at $87.30 a barrel, while Brent crude futures were up 0.6% at $89.03 a barrel."
573,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 06:35AM ET</span>",,,,,,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. public pension funds will likely have to switch to more aggressive investment strategies in the coming years to fill funding gaps despite assets held by sovereign investors having grown to record levels amid the 2021 equity market boom, a new report said. 
On average, the difference between assets and liabilities at U.S. public pension funds, known as the ""funded ratio,"" remains ""unsatisfactory"" at less than 75%, sovereign investor specialist Global SWF said in a report.
To boost returns, many will likely have to focus on alternative assets, including private equity and private credit, Diego Lopez at Global SWF told Reuters.
""Certain pockets of real assets including logistics properties and infrastructure may also benefit from increased interest, and hedge funds will continue to be an important part of US [public pension funds'] portfolios.""
Assets held by sovereign wealth and public pension funds globally rose to a record $31.9 trillion in 2021, thanks to rising U.S. stock and oil prices, and investments rose to their highest for several years, Global SWF said in a previous report.
For pension funds, that means they have more assets to cover future liabilities. 
For instance the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), which manages the largest U.S. public pension fund, grew its assets more than $92 billion in the fiscal year ending in June 2021, according to its 2020-21 financial report.
That growth boosted the funded ratio of its Public Employees' Retirement Fund to an estimated 80% at the end of June last year from 70% a year earlier. CalPERS declined to comment.

But the U.S. national average for funded ratios - calculated as a comparison between public pension funds' actuarial valuation of their assets and liabilities - remains below 75%, with a $1.3 trillion shortfall, Global SWF said.
""To make things worse, the working population is expected to decrease from 64% to 57% by the end of the 21st century,"" it said, which is likely to exacerbate that funding gap.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cyrus Vance Jr, whose 12 years as Manhattan district attorney was notable for a criminal probe into Donald Trump's business as well as high-profile sex crime cases, is joining the law firm Baker McKenzie as a partner.
Vance, 67, was named global chair of the firm's cybersecurity practice. He will also join the firm's North American litigation and government enforcement practice and its global compliance practice.
""Cybercrime is a huge issue"" in business, Vance said in an interview. ""If we work collectively to fight cybercrime, that will strengthen and provide greater protection for the community.""
A Democrat, Vance became district attorney in 2010 as the handpicked successor to Robert Morgenthau, who made that office, now with about 600 lawyers, among the country's most powerful in law enforcement.
As crime rates fell, Vance stopped prosecuting lower-level crimes, while starting cybercrime and antiquities trafficking units and using hundreds of millions of dollars forfeited by large banks to bolster law enforcement and make streets safer.
Vance suffered a setback in 2011 by dropping charges that former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn sexually assaulted a hotel housekeeper, after the accuser's credibility came into question.
But he successfully prosecuted Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein in 2020, winning a conviction for sexual assault and rape and a 23-year prison sentence.
Vance also had successes from probing whether Trump and his Trump Organization fraudulently manipulated real estate values to save on loans and taxes.
He obtained eight years of the former Republican president's tax returns, twice defeated his U.S. Supreme Court appeals, and last July brought tax fraud charges against Trump's company and its longtime chief financial officer.
Alvin Bragg, Vance's successor and also a Democrat, now oversees that probe.
Vance said he has not been in touch with Bragg, but before leaving office wanted to be sure his successor and the office had ""everything they needed.""

He said ""essential communications"" began in January to join Baker McKenzie, whose annual revenue is about $3.1 billion.
""Adding a prosecutor of Cy's stature is a huge addition,"" said Scott Brandman, managing partner of the New York office.

575,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 05:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve is set for its most aggressive liftoff period in decades -- just don’t look to 2015 for guidance on its path.
Chair Jerome Powell last week pointed to an economy in “a different situation” from the last interest-rate hiking cycle, highlighting a tighter labor market, the fastest inflation since the 1980s and stronger economic growth. 
The last time the central bank raised rates from zero in 2015, the economy was emerging slowly from the global financial crisis and a long recession marked by weak households. This time, the Fed is playing catchup amid decades-high inflation and a swift rebound in demand from the Covid-19 shock.
To tame prices, Powell and his colleagues are prepared to raise interest rates in March, the first of at least three hikes in 2022, according to Wall Street economists. Some see increases at each of the seven remaining meetings this year. Last week, the Fed said it’d be “nimble” and “move steadily,” versus at a “gradual” pace back in 2015.
“It’s night and day,” said Ryan Sweet, head of monetary policy research at Moody’s Analytics Inc. “The last time we were lifting off, the Fed was raising rates in anticipation that inflation was going to get back up to 2%. Now they’re raising rates in an environment where they’re trying to get inflation down to their target.”
In a press conference Wednesday, Powell said that the Federal Open Market Committee was “of a mind” to raise rates in March, and didn’t rule out hiking at every meeting to tame inflation. He also said the labor market was consistent with full employment, pointing to plentiful jobs and higher wages. 
Here’s a look at the three main factors Powell cited as a precursor to what is set to be the Fed’s most aggressive one-year hiking cycle in decades: 
Inflation
Inflation today is the hottest in nearly 40 years. Consumer prices have skyrocketed amid a confluence of supply-chain constraints -- driven by Covid lockdowns and quick reopenings globally -- and a dearth of manufacturing and delivery workers. Across the U.S., especially in smaller cities in the heartland, that means higher costs being passed down the supply chain for months ahead. 
The most recent figures point to escalating pressures. The personal consumption expenditures price gauge, which measures what Americans pay for goods and services, rose 5.8% in December from the prior year, the most since 1982.
Employment costs rose from the same month in 2021 by the most in two decades -- some economists fear that could propel a wage-price spiral in which employers raise prices even further to offset higher pay for workers.
“Back then, they were trying to get ahead of inflation and ahead of wages,” said Aneta Markowska, chief U.S. financial economist at Jefferies. “Now, they’re not ahead, they’re way behind.” 
Labor Market
The labor market is in better shape today by many historical standards. The employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers -- or the share of employed 25- to 54-year-olds out of that population -- rose to 79% in December, higher than the 2015 period. The unemployment rate is now down to 3.9%, versus 5% six years ago.
Job openings remain near a record and the share of people leaving their jobs for others matches the highest level ever, just some of the factors contributing to rising wages.
“We have a pretty tight labor market, we have labor shortages which are mostly pandemic related. That’s going to continue keeping upward pressure on wages,” Sweet said.
The Fed is counting on continued strength in the job market as policy makers raise rates. At the same time, the central bank’s view of full employment now includes an increased focus on minority groups, who still lag the general population: Black unemployment rose in December compared to a decline among White Americans.
Markets
The Fed is much more optimistic on economic growth this time around. According to the central bank’s latest projections, gross domestic product will expand at a 4% rate this year, more than double the longer-term estimated pace. In December 2015, the central bank called for GDP to rise 2.4% in the year ahead.
The upbeat view is supported by expectations for healthy consumer spending as households are flush with cash, thanks to a stock-market rally that’s helped add trillions of dollars to household wealth in the pandemic, as well as unprecedented government stimulus and record home valuations. The collapse of the housing market, of course, was at the root of the 2008 recession that preceded the 2015 tightening cycle.
The Treasury market also has a much different tone these days. Traders are currently pricing in an average annual inflation rate of nearly 2.9% from now through January 2027. In December 2015, it was 1.2%.
Credit risk gauges remain below pre-pandemic levels, indicating that investors see a path for the Fed to tighten without damaging corporate access to funding.

PATNA, India (Reuters) - Niranjan Kumar, the eldest son of a small farmer in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, was one of 12.5 million youngsters who applied for 35,000 jobs when the railways department started recruitment examinations more than a year ago.
The mathematics graduate, 28, and his dormitory mates did not even make it to a recently released shortlist despite preparing for years, a collective setback that triggered protests by a swelling army of unemployed youth in Bihar and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh last week.
Infuriated by what they called a bungled recruitment process, tens of thousands of students, including Kumar and his friends, blocked rail traffic, while others vandalised trains and some even burned down coaches of a stationary train that had no passengers in it at the time.
""The government is playing with our lives,"" Kumar told Reuters, sitting cross-legged on a friend's unmade bed in the congested Kashi Lodge in Bihar's capital Patna. ""They only want to privatise everything, they don't want to hire people themselves.""
India has long had an unemployment problem and prized government jobs always attract huge numbers of candidates. But the widespread anger that has erupted over the railways jobs poses a challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of crucial state elections in February and March, including in Uttar Pradesh.
Modi came to power in 2014 promising development that would create millions of jobs for the surging ranks of young, educated Indians. But national unemployment peaked at 23.5% in 2020 and has stubbornly remained well above 7% since, according to data from Mumbai-based the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), much higher than the global average.
As of last month, India had more than 52 million unemployed people looking for work, CMIE data shows. More worryingly, the figure does not include many jobless people in the country of 1.35 billion who have stopped seeking employment https://www.reuters.com/world/india/off-canada-indias-jobs-crisis-exasperates-its-youth-2022-01-25.
India's working age population - those between 15 and 64 - is estimated at 1 billion, only 403 million of whom are considered employed, CMIE data shows.
""Unemployment is a very deep crisis - it is the responsibility of the prime minister to resolve it,"" opposition party leader Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet this month. ""The country is asking for answers, stop making excuses!""
The labour and finance ministries did not respond to requests for comment.
Gopal Krishna Agarwal, a spokesman for Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, said the government was aware of the jobs situation and was trying to promote manufacturing by giving production-linked incentives to industries such as defence. He said Modi himself had directed authorities to fix the problems with the railways recruitment.
""We are not in denial, we are not saying unemployment is not a problem,"" he said. ""But we are working on finding long-term solutions.""
'ONLY WAY OUT'
In the latest incident, Kumar and the other unsuccessful candidates accuse the Indian Railways of mismanaging the recruitment process by shortlisting many people for multiple job roles. 
""Had they shortlisted one candidate for only one role, we would have made it too and who knows could have cleared the main exam later,"" Kumar said. 
""I have not paid my rent for a year and my father has told me he won't support me financially beyond this year,"" added Kumar, a bearded and balding man.
""My family has always had a difficult existence,"" he said. ""A government job for me is the only way out.""
Kashi Lodge has dozens of residents, mostly from poor rural families, who have been preparing for competitive exams for government jobs for at least five years. As Kumar spoke, a young man was bathing in his underwear on a small balcony, while others cooked lunch on stoves mounted on small gas cylinders placed by their beds. 
Another man in the lodge, Ajay Kumar Mishra, says he had been a big Modi devotee and cheered when he came to Patna to seek votes before the 2014 general election.
""We poured our heart out for him,"" said Mishra, thumping his chest as others crowded the narrow balcony by his room door. ""Now he will have to listen to the same youth who are hurting so much.""
""Does he want us to sell tea and pakodas (snacks)? Maybe that's what we will have to do eventually. Time is running out for us, we will soon be too old to apply for government jobs.""
Mishra says he has to find a job quickly because his father will retire as a university worker next year, and the burden of taking care of his family will soon fall on him.

""It's now or never for us,"" he said, books of current affairs and other topics strewn across another bed in his room and on its cement shelves, watched over by a picture of the Hindu goddess of learning, Saraswati.
""We have started a leader-less revolution in which everyone is a leader because everyone is affected,"" Mishra said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Record euro area inflation rates mean price pressures will top the agenda for European Central Bank policymakers meeting on Thursday.
No immediate policy action is expected since the ECB in December laid out plans https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/ecb-set-dial-back-stimulus-one-more-notch-2021-12-15 to wind up its 1.85 trillion euro ($2.09 trillion) pandemic stimulus scheme by end-March. 
But price pressures remain strong and markets want a sense of whether the ECB is getting closer to a more hawkish stance. Here are five questions on the radar for markets.
1. Will the ECB shift its language on inflation?
Possibly. The ECB has slowly changed its language already and may continue to do so.
ECB chief economist Philip Lane said last week the ECB would tighten policy https://www.reuters.com/article/ecb-policy-lane/ecb-would-respond-if-inflation-stayed-above-expectations-lane-idUKKBN2JZ13A if inflation was seen holding above its 2% target, but such a scenario appears less likely for now.
Euro area inflation hit 5% in December, the highest on record https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/euro-zone-inflation-hits-5-marking-another-record-high-2022-01-07, and is forecast to drop back below target in the fourth quarter.
But some officials view this projection as overly optimistic. January data out the day before the ECB meets could arm the hawks with fresh ammunition to push for a change in tone -- the December meeting minutes revealed deep divisions over inflation. GRAPHIC: When will euro zone inflation peak? https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/myvmnjmkkpr/ECBFEB1.PNG 
2. Could a more hawkish Fed force the ECB to speed up normalisation?
Not likely. Lagarde reckons the ECB does not need to act as boldly as the U.S. central bank given different economic conditions. Labour markets, for one thing, are much tighter in the United States.
""The euro area is not the U.S. and there are no signs of domestic overheating,"" said PGIM Fixed Income's chief European economist Katharine Neiss.
""But this is not a typical cycle, so there does need to be a degree of humility and the ECB needs to be alive to the potential that the recovery could be stronger than they judged.""
A flurry of U.S. rate hikes could complicate life https://www.reuters.com/business/nimble-fed-narrows-normalisation-window-timid-ecb-2022-01-27 for the ECB if the Fed completes its tightening cycle quicker than in the past, leaving the ECB with a shorter time to act. GRAPHIC: Benchmark bond yields are on the rise, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxoaynapx/ECBFEB3.PNG 
3. What does the ECB think of market pricing for rate hikes?
Lagarde may push back against market rate-hike bets, which are out of sync with the ECB's ultra-loose monetary policy stance. Higher lending rates in markets could prove problematic if they trigger tighter financial conditions for companies.
Money markets are pricing in a 10 basis-point rate rise by October.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) reckons https://www.reuters.com/article/ecb-rates-deutsche/ecb-to-hike-rates-by-25-basis-points-in-dec-22-deutsche-bank-idUKKBN2JY1TM the ECB will kick off with an aggressive 25 bps hike in December.
But the ECB has essentially ruled out lifting rates this year. It aims to reduce its asset buying gradually, but it has no plans for now to stop it altogether and it will not hike rates before it is done buying bonds. GRAPHIC: ECB on track to wind down PEPP by end-March, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/movanymlwpa/ECBFeb2Capture.PNG 
4. When does the ECB expect second-round effects from inflation to emerge?
With inflation higher for longer than anticipated and oil prices elevated, policymakers are watching out for whether this triggers higher wage demands, which in turn push up price inflation.
Policymakers stress they do not see wages responding significantly to inflation. Germany's government believes the economic recovery and higher inflation will likely lead to https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-economy-idUSKBN2K00ZF ""somewhat stronger wage growth"" this year.
""The case for higher wages is extremely good as we are seeing tighter labour markets in places like Germany and the Netherlands. The question is whether it will be a one off?"" said Piet Haines Christiansen, chief strategist, Danske Bank.
""Wages are the missing piece in the puzzle, and if we see inflation there, we will get a rate hike. And that might come as early as Spring next year."" GRAPHIC: Will wage pressures pick up in 2022? https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/mopanymqlva/ECBFEB4.PNG 
5. How does the changing response to the pandemic impact the macro picture?
The Omicron coronavirus variant has weighed on the economy, but with most countries avoiding full lockdowns, data suggests activity is holding up relatively well https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/easing-supply-bottlenecks-give-german-business-glimmer-hope-2022-01-25.

Lane has said the Omicron impact will be measured in weeks, not months.
For ECB watchers, signs that economic momentum is gaining pace means pressure to remove stimulus quickly could build. Uncertainties also cloud the outlook, such as how lofty oil prices and a China slowdown might derail growth.

LISBON (Reuters) - Defying all odds, Portugal's centre-left Socialists won an outright parliamentary majority in Sunday's snap general election, securing a strong new mandate for Prime Minister Antonio Costa, a champion of balanced public accounts.
The result, boosted by a higher than expected turnout despite the coronavirus pandemic, comes as a surprise after the Socialists had lost most of their advantage in recent opinion polls, and means Portugal will have a stable government to oversee the application of EU pandemic recovery funds.
The vote was called in November after Costa's hard-left former Communist and Left Bloc allies joined the right in striking down his minority government's budget. 
The two far left parties paid the price, losing more than a half of their seats, according to exit polls.
After last week's opinion polls Costa had himself acknowledged that Portuguese did not want to give him a full majority and said he was prepared to strike alliances with like-minded parties, which is no longer necessary.
""An absolute majority doesn't mean absolute power. It doesn't mean to govern alone. It's an increased responsibility and it means to govern with and for all Portuguese,"" Costa said in his victory speech.
Before the final results came in, Costa said the party had won 117 or 118 seats in the 230-seat parliament, up from 108 won in the 2019 election, and his supporters erupted in loud celebrations, singing old revolutionary anthem ""Grandola"" and waving flags.
Costa, who came to power in 2015 in the aftermath of a 2011-14 debt crisis, has presided over a period of steady economic growth that helped shrink the budget deficit and even eke out a small surplus in 2019, before the pandemic struck.
Still, Portugal remains western Europe's poorest country and relies on EU pandemic recovery funds.
Economist Filipe Garcia, head Informacao de Mercados Financeiros consultants in Porto, said investors would likely appreciate Costa's new strong mandate, given the government's record cutting of the budget deficit.
""Furthermore, the Socialists will not need to compromise (with other parties), which guarantees stability and a clear line of action. The biggest challenge will be to promote potential growth,"" he said.
The centre-right Social Democrats came a distant second at below 30% of the vote, according to provisional results, against the Socialists' around 42%.
The far-right Chega emerged as the third-largest parliamentary force making a big leap from just one seat in the previous legislature to at least 11.
A stable government would bode well for Portugal's access to a 16.6-billion-euro ($18.7 billion) package of EU pandemic recovery aid and its success in channelling funds into projects to boost economic growth.
With more than a tenth of Portugal's 10 million people estimated to be isolating due to COVID-19, the government had allowed infected people to leave isolation and cast ballots in person, and electoral officials donned protection suits in the afternoon to receive them.

Turnout was on track to beat 2019's record low 49% participation.
As in many European countries, infections have spiked, although vaccination has kept deaths and hospitalisations lower than in earlier waves.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Sunday it will help fund a new container yard for agricultural exports at California's Port of Oakland, as the government, ports and food companies scramble to ease costly shipping delays.
The multimillion-dollar project is set to open in March, and officials said it could be replicated elsewhere. 
Strong U.S. demand for goods from Asia during the pandemic has boosted imports, clogging West Coast ports. Some ocean vessels have left the United States carrying empty containers after making deliveries, rather than waiting to fill ships with American goods for export. 
Ships delivering cargo at ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, have also skipped Oakland, a major hub for agricultural exports, to return to Asia more quickly.
Oakland's export volume in 2021 declined 8% from the previous year, the port said, hurting shipments of products like nuts, dairy and produce.
""With the delays and disruptions that are occurring, market share is at risk,"" U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told Reuters.
The Port of Oakland will open a 25-acre acre ""pop-up site"" to provide space to prepare empty containers, the USDA said. The off-terminal site will move containers off chassis and store them for rapid pick up, the port said.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement that ""inland pop-up ports"" improved the flow of goods at the Port of Savannah and the government plans to work with other ports on similar ways to reduce congestion.
The USDA will pay 60% of the startup costs and partner with the Port of Oakland to partially cover a $125 per container reimbursement made to shippers, Vilsack said. The USDA estimated the project will cost about $5 million, and the port said the initial start-up will cost about $2 million. 
""This is for however long it takes to get us back to a place where we have some stability in the market and some stability in the supply chain,"" Vilsack said. 
Though U.S. farm exports reached a record in 2021, they could have been bigger without delays at ports, Vilsack said.
In the first nine months of 2021, shipping disruptions cost the U.S. dairy industry about $1.3 billion due to lost business and higher shipping and storage costs, said Jaime Castaneda, executive vice president of the U.S. Dairy Export Council and National Milk Producers Federation.
Some importers canceled orders because of delays, forcing U.S. producers to resell their goods at a discount, Castaneda said. 
Denver-based Leprino Foods, the world's biggest mozzarella cheese maker, had 99% of its export shipments canceled or re-booked at least once last year, up from 10% in a typical year, Chief Executive Mike Durkin said. 
Such delays contributed to a 57% surge in the company's supply-chain costs last year, Durkin said. Costs are expected to jump another 50% in 2022, with a third of the increase related to exports, he said.
To deal with port delays, Leprino Foods trucked dairy products normally exported from Oakland to Houston and other ports, Durkin said. It also sent whey products via air to a customer in Asia that needed them to keep operations running, he said.

Durkin and dairy groups are working with the USDA, ports and shipping companies to improve exports.
""We've got to get this somehow figured out,"" Durkin said. ""The challenge is huge.""

ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi is likely to have a hard time controlling his coalition, politicians and analysts warn, after relations within and among the ruling parties worsened over this week's election of a new head of state.
Outgoing 80-year-old President Sergio Mattarella was re-elected for a second term on Saturday, with party chiefs asking him to carry on after seven rounds of fruitless, often fraught voting in parliament to choose a successor.
With elections in the euro zone's third largest economy little over a year away, Draghi now has to lead his bruised government through a number of difficult challenges.
He is under pressure from the parties in his broad coalition to raise borrowing to curb the impact of higher energy costs on firms and households, and the parties are at loggerheads over a contentious reform of the pension system.
Italy has also pledged to Brussels it will adopt by the end of the year around 100 measures in return for some 200 billion euros ($223 billion) of pandemic recovery funds. The success of Italy's Recovery Plan is seen as crucial to the prospect of further EU joint borrowing in the future.
Meanwhile the coronavirus crisis shows little sign of abating, with Italy seeing hundreds of deaths every day. 
Draghi had wanted the role of president himself, but his bid was opposed by two large parties in the coalition and mustered little support among rank and file lawmakers.
Financial markets are likely to welcome the continuation of the status quo as a sign of stability but the week of turmoil has left deep scars.
""Mattarella's election belies the fact that most of Italy's political parties are in tatters,"" said Francesco Galietti, head of political risk consultancy Policy Sonar.
""We need to understand whether the key ingredient of Draghi's government - a broad, cross-partisan majority - will still be there in a few weeks, because if not, the situation will rapidly become untenable."" 
Draghi's coalition includes the main centre-left and centre- right parties as well as the right-wing League, the once anti-establishment 5-Star movement and several smaller parties.
The presidential election saw these groups bitterly divided, with the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) largely supporting Draghi's bid, and the League and 5-Star against it.
""Mattarella 2 - a misleading semblance of stability,"" was the title of a report on Saturday by advisory group Teneo.
INTERNAL SPLITS
Precisely how the turmoil plays out for Draghi remains to be seen. Some politicians say that with the parties sidetracked by internal strife Draghi's own role as commander of the coalition will actually be strengthened.
""I think the government comes out of all this stronger,"" PD leader Enrico Letta, a strong Draghi supporter, told reporters on Saturday. ""I think there will be less desire among each party to mark out its territory and dig its elbows into the others.""
This view was shared by Ettore Rosato, a leading light of the centrist Italia Viva party, who told Reuters Draghi could count on Mattarella's ongoing support and would be pleased the ruling parties had finally all voted for the same candidate.
However, the voting also revealed numerous internal splits within the parties and with jockeying for position ahead of the election already beginning, the early signs for stability are not promising. 
Many League lawmakers were unhappy with leader Matteo Salvini's frequent changes of candidate and his final decision to back Mattarella. 
The League's Industry Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti told reporters on Saturday he was considering resigning, before backtracking later in the day.
""The League's internal tensions will all be vented on the government,"" Giorgio Mule, a junior defence minister from Forza Italia told Reuters.
On the right of the political spectrum, the unity of a conservative alliance of parties was also shattered over the presidential election, with Salvini repeatedly making plain his anger towards traditional ally Forza Italia, a partner in Draghi's coalition.
Elsewhere, simmering tensions within the 5-Star Movement have come to a head, with Conte swapping accusations with internal rival Luigi Di Maio, who is foreign minister and a former 5-Star leader.
Veteran centrist politician Pier Ferdinando Casini, who was himself a front-runner for the role of president, said on Sunday that with political relations ""lacerated"" by the week of conflict there was no doubt that the government was weakened.

""I hope that the parties now redouble their support for Draghi, but seeing as I haven't just landed from the moon, and this is the last year before elections, I'm afraid that's not going to happen,"" he told Corriere della Sera daily.

Investing.com – The U.S. jobs report for January will be a key focus for markets this week as investors try to gauge how aggressively the Federal Reserve may act in its fight against inflation. Earnings are set to continue, with tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) set to report. Elevated market volatility looks set to continue and both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are meeting. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
The U.S. is to release the January nonfarm payrolls report on Friday with economists forecasting that the economy added 155,000 jobs, slowing from 199,000 in December as the Omicron variant hit.
Indications of continued strength in the labor market could add to bets on how aggressive the Fed may be in tightening monetary policy in its battle to combat high inflation.
The Fed flagged a March rate hike after its policy meeting last week and Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that officials may move even faster than the four rate hikes markets have already priced in for this year.
On Friday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the central bank could hike rates by as much as half a percentage point if warranted by economic data.
Goldman Sachs is forecasting that the Fed will hike rates five times this year, up from four previously, with a first hike expected in March, according to a note from its economists late on Friday.
Another large batch of earnings reports is due during the week, including from heavyweights Alphabet and Amazon, on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.
Tech stocks have come under pressure so far this year as investors have been more reluctant to pay hefty valuations for growth stocks amid rising yields as the Fed plans to tighten policy to tame inflation.
So far this earnings season investors have been focused on guidance, and the extent to which companies expect ongoing global supply challenges to affect their bottom line going forward.
Uneasy investors have punished companies such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) who delivered underwhelming results in recent weeks.
Other earnings of note this week include Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) and Merck (NYSE:MRK).
The steep slide in U.S. stocks in January has prompted some investors to begin looking at equity valuations to see whether now is a good time to snap up shares at bargain prices.
The S&P 500 has dropped over 9% so far in 2022, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq stands in correction territory after a nearly 15% fall.
Buying after pullbacks paid off for many investors over the last two years, when ample pandemic-era stimulus boosted stocks to a series of fresh record highs. But with as many as five Fed rate hikes on the cards this year investors are having to come to terms with a new reality.
The market's fall hadn’t been precipitous enough for Barclays strategists, who early last week declared in a note it was still ""too early to buy the dip.""
On the other hand, the strength of fourth-quarter earnings results, which continue to roll in with S&P 500 earnings season not yet at the halfway point, could bolster the case for investors looking to buy at a discount.
The BOE is expected to hike rates by another 0.25% at its upcoming policy meeting on Thursday, to curb inflation, which is running at its highest in thirty years.
In December the BOE became the world's first major central bank to hike rates since the onset of the pandemic and market watchers will be keen to hear what Governor Andrew Bailey has to say about the future path of interest rates.
The expected rate hike will also mean that the bank’s threshold to begin trimming its balance sheet will have been met and this could get underway as soon as March.
The Eurozone is to release data on fourth quarter GDP and January inflation figures ahead of Thursday’s ECB meeting. The GDP data is expected to show that economic growth slowed in the three months to December while inflation is expected to ease.
The ECB is diverging from the Fed and the BOE, with prospects for a rate hike remaining distant.
Market watchers are not expecting any changes to monetary policy from the ECB this week - instead ECB head Christine Lagarde is facing the challenge of communicating that policymakers are sticking to their hawkish stance on inflation while tamping down premature speculation on rate hikes.

582,"<span>Jan 30, 2022 04:50AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - A planned increase in British social security contributions from workers and employers will go ahead in April, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and finance minister Rishi Sunak said, despite calls to scrap the rise due to the strain on household budgets.
With surging inflation exacerbating a cost-of-living squeeze, the government has faced growing pressure, including from some of its own Conservative lawmakers, to delay or cancel a new health and social care levy that will see the rate of National Insurance rise by 1.25 percentage points.
Some British newspapers have speculated that Johnson, who faces a possible no confidence vote https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/london-police-move-to-limit-downing-stre-idUSKBN2K20L9 over social gatherings at Downing Street during COVID-19 lockdowns, might seek to shore up support by scrapping the rise.
Writing a joint article in the Sunday Times newspaper, Johnson and Sunak said: ""We must continue to be responsible now, as we deal with Covid aftershocks — and above all with the Covid backlogs in healthcare ... We must go ahead with the health and care levy.""
Britain racked up its biggest budget deficit since World War Two, equivalent to 15% of gross domestic product, in the 2020/21 financial year. 
The pair said that while they are ""tax-cutting Conservatives"" they need to be responsible with public finances.
""We believe people are the best judges of how to spend their money. We want to get through this phase and get on with our agenda,"" they wrote.
""With healthy finances we will continue to drive business confidence, and with record investment we will lay the foundations for a sustained, long-term, jobs-led recovery.""

British inflation in December was its highest in nearly 30 years at 5.4%, with rising energy costs adding to the pressure on household budgets.
Johnson and Sunak said they would continue to look at the best way to support people through the post-pandemic economic recovery and were considering the best medium and long-term plan to improve the security of Britain's energy supply.

Bostic stuck to his call for three quarter-point interest rate increases in 2022, with the first in March, but a more aggressive approach was possible if warranted by economic data, he told the newspaper on Friday.

""Every option is on the table for every meeting,"" Bostic told FT. ""If the data say that things have evolved in a way that a 50 basis point move is required or [would] be appropriate, then I'm going to lean into that . . . . If moving in successive meetings makes sense, I'll be comfortable with that.""
The Fed clearly telegraphed a March interest rate hike after its meeting last week. Fed funds futures, which track short-term rate expectations, are pricing nearly five rate increases of 25 basis points each this year, up from four expected hikes before that.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The northeastern United States was walloped by a fierce winter storm on Saturday that dropped more than two feet (60 cm) of snow on some areas while packing high winds, prompting thousands of flight cancellations and leading governors in Rhode Island and other states to curtail access to the roads.
Nearly 11 million people along the East Coast remained under blizzard warnings from the Nor'easter, according to the National Weather Service, including the Boston metropolitan area, which was forecast to be hit with up to 25 inches (64 cm) of snow. The storm blanketed a large swath of New England with snow. 
New York City experienced a heavy snowfall while Long Island, New York braced for up to two feet of snow. With the storm ongoing, some coastal areas of New Jersey also recorded 15 inches (38 cm).
Most Boston area residents heeded warnings to stay indoors as snow, whipped by wind gusts forecast by the National Weather Service to reach 43 miles (69 km) per hour, continued to fall in small, dense flakes on Saturday afternoon, challenging the hundreds of plows out making an effort to stay ahead of the storm.
""This is going to be a historic blizzard,"" Boston City Councilor Ruthzee Louijeune told Reuters. ""It's the power of the wind and the amount of snow that makes this one particularly dangerous.""
Several states declared emergencies in response to the storm, which formed in the Atlantic Ocean off the Carolinas and was forecast to continue depositing snow into Sunday morning as it moved north to Maine. 
Coastal areas across Massachusetts were being hit especially hard, including some flooding along the shoreline, as the center of the storm hovered just east of the Cape Cod resort area by Saturday mid-afternoon.
""Blizzard conditions are expected to remain possible into early Sunday morning from eastern Massachusetts to eastern Maine, with wind gusts potentially leading to scattered power outages,"" the National Weather Service said.
""It's high winds, heavy snow, blizzard conditions - all the elements of a classic Nor'easter,"" New York Governor Kathy Hochul said at a news briefing, warning of frigid temperatures overnight and the risk of power outages, which could prompt some residents to use their stoves or space heaters to stay warm. 
""This could be life-threatening,"" Hochul said.
Predicting up to two feet of snow in his state, Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee issued a statewide travel ban for all passenger cars and joined surrounding states in banning tractor-trailers from the roads. 
The storm prompted airlines to cancel nearly 6,000 flights through the weekend, Amtrak to halt its passenger rail service across much of the region, and the main commuter line for Long Island to suspend its operations for at least one full day.
So far power outages were limited in most of the impacted states with the exception of Massachusetts, where 123,000 out of 2.6 million customers were without electricity, according to PowerOutage.us.
Speaking with reporters at around noon (1700 GMT) on Saturday, Hochul said the storm had not progressed as quickly as forecast, pushing back the state's timetable for cleaning up. Hochul predicted that the most severely impacted counties - Nassau and Suffolk with 7 to 11 inches (18-28 cm) of snow - would get another 5 to 12 inches (13-30 cm) by 6 p.m.
The weather may have contributed to the death of an elderly woman who was found early on Saturday morning in a hotel parking lot in Uniondale with her car window open, according to an officer at the Nassau County Police Department in Long Island.
The storm hit nearly 44 years to the day after a monstrous blizzard crippled New England in 1978. Dumping more than 27 inches (70 cm) of snow on Boston, that storm killed dozens of people, trapped others in their homes and shut down major highways for a week.
To some people, the weather was an obstacle to be overcome or enjoyed. The Black Rose, an Irish pub in downtown Boston, kept its doors open and was filling up with patrons on Saturday afternoon.

And in New York City's borough of Brooklyn, Anson Call seized the opportunity to take his children sledding in what he considered far better conditions than the wetter snow storms of past years. 
""This is pleasant. Finally, it's snowing!"" Call said.

Economists have scrambled to update rate hike expectations since the Fed on Wednesday said it was likely to hike interest rates in March and reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases that month in what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell pledged will be a sustained battle to tame inflation.
At the conclusion of Wednesday’s meeting, Powell said a decision would be made in coming months on when to start shrinking the central bank's government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
Goldman economists David Mericle and Jan Hatzius said in the note they expect the Fed to hike rates in March and May and announce the start of its balance sheet reduction in June, then follow with hikes in July and September. They subsequently expect the Fed to return to a quarterly pace in the fourth quarter with one hike in December to end the year at 1.25-1.5%. 
The economists said they had revised up their inflation path expectation following data this week while in addition, ""Chair Powell’s comments earlier this week made it clear that the Fed leadership is open to a more aggressive pace of tightening."" 

Goldman said it continues to expect three hikes in 2023 and for the Fed to reach the same terminal rate of 2.5-2.75% in 2024.
Earlier in January, Goldman said it expected four hikes this year and for the process of balance sheet reduction to start as soon as July.

Embroiled in a currency crisis fuelled by the central bank's move to slash rates by 500 basis points since September as part of an economic model engineered by Erdogan, Turkey saw December inflation soar to its highest level in Erdogan's 19-year rule. 
A Reuters poll on Friday showed it is expected to hit a near 20-year high of 47% in January.

""You know of my battle with interest rates. We are lowering interest rates and we will lower them. Know that inflation will fall too then, it will fall more,"" Erdogan told supporters in the Black Sea province of Giresun.

Authorities in Venezuela had asked Interpol to locate and arrest Ramirez in 2018 and subsequently demanded his extradition from Italy in 2020 in connection with embezzlement charges.
Ramirez, who denies the corruption allegations, says President Nicolas Maduro's administration is seeking to smear him over his anti-government comments.
""The Italian Supreme Court has declared definitively inadmissible the extradition request,"" Ramirez's Italian lawyer Roberto De Vita told Reuters.
He said the court had backed a previous ruling that Ramirez could not be sent back to Venezuela because of human rights violations in the South American state.
Court rulings in Italy are initially delivered to those involved in the case and the verdict has not yet been published on the Supreme Court website.
Ramirez served for a decade as oil minister and president of state oil company PDVSA, which controls some of the largest crude reserves in the world.
Venezuela's Supreme Court said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in 2020 that Ramirez faced criminal charges including embezzlement and bid-rigging for oil contracts.

He was ousted from his post as Venezuela's U.N. envoy in 2017 after publicly criticizing Maduro and the status of the OPEC nation's oil industry. 
Ramirez had been a close confidant and remains an admirer of the late former president Hugo Chavez, Maduro's predecessor and mentor.

Thursday's EU challenge accuses China of discriminatory trade practices against Lithuania, saying they threatened the integrity of the single market.
""Australia has a substantial interest in the issues raised in the dispute brought by the European Union against China ... and will request to join these consultations,"" Trade Minister Dan Tehan said in a statement. 
China, which regards self-governed Taiwan as its own territory, has downgraded ties with Lithuania and pushed firms to sever links with the Baltic nation of 2.8 million people after it allowed Taiwan to open a de facto embassy in Vilnius. [L8N2U71GE]
Its strictures include a refusal to clear Lithuanian goods through Chinese customs, rejection of import applications from Lithuania and pressure on EU firms to remove Lithuanian content from supply chains when exporting to China. 
Relations between Australia and China, its top trade partner, soured after Canberra banned Huawei Technologies from its 5G broadband network in 2018, toughened laws against foreign political interference, and urged an independent investigation into the origins of COVID-19.
Beijing responded by freezing ministerial contacts and imposing tariffs on several Australian commodities, such as coal, beef, barley and wine.
Australia has filed two WTO complaints in the past 18 months over China's duties on imports of bottled wine and barley.
In a statement on Saturday, the foreign ministry said Australia ""welcomes"" an invitation from France to take part in a February meeting of Indo-Pacific foreign ministers.
""Australia greatly values cooperation with France and with Europe, including in the Indo-Pacific,"" it said in an e-mailed statement, without saying if Foreign Minister Marise Payne would attend. 

Australia's relations with France, which holds the rotating six-month presidency of the EU Council, have also soured after Canberra signed a security pact last year with Britain and the United States, dubbed AUKUS, scrapping a multi-billion-dollar submarine deal with France. 
The pact, widely viewed as an attempt to shore up regional military muscle in the face of China's growing presence, riled Beijing, but also caused fury in France.

In its latest update on Myanmar's economy, the World Bank projects growth of 1% in the year to September 2022, weighed down by the impacts of the pandemic and the military's overthrow of an elected administration on Feb 1, 2021. 
Myanmar's economy has tanked since the coup and the junta's crackdown on its opponents and ensuing backlash from armed groups has led to a retreat by foreign firms concerned about political risks, sanctions and damage to their reputation. 
The World Bank said there were substantial supply and demand issues, cashflow shortages for businesses and reduced credit access, while half of firms it surveyed reported difficulties last year due to a sharp depreciation of the kyat currency. 
""The near-term outlook will depend on the evolution of the pandemic and the effects of conflict, together with the degree to which foreign exchange and financial sector constraints persist, as well as disruptions to other key services including electricity, logistics and digital connectivity,"" the World Bank said in its January economic monitor. 
Myanmar's junta has blamed last year's economic crisis on foreign-backed ""sabotage"". 

The military government on Thursday said it had approved $3.8 billion in foreign investment since the coup, owing to what it called a return to stability and confidence in its economic potential.
The World Bank said events since the coup were likely to limit Myanmar's growth potential, with most indicators suggesting private investment had fallen markedly, while the cost of imports has risen and kyat-denominated revenues are worth less in foreign currency terms.

(Reuters) -The Biden administration plans to spare everyday Russians from the brunt of U.S. export controls if Russia invades Ukraine, https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-buildup-ukraine-border-includes-blood-wounded-us-officials-say-2022-01-28 and focus on targeting industrial sectors, a White House official said.
""Key people"" will also face ""massive sanctions,"" a top Commerce official said in a separate speech on Friday. 
The comments narrow the scope of potential curbs on imports to Russia that had previously been described as disrupting Russia's economy more broadly, hitting industrial sectors and consumer technologies like smartphones.
""We can't preview every action, but the intent there really is to have measures that we think will degrade Russia's industrial capabilities and industrial production capacity over time, not to go after individual, everyday Russian consumers,"" White House national security official Peter Harrell said in a virtual speech for the Massachusetts Export Center on Thursday that received little media coverage.
Harrell, who sits on the National Security Council, said the United States was prepared, immediately after an invasion of Ukraine, to impose ""crippling financial costs on major Russian financial institutions as well as to impose a range of quite sweeping export controls that will degrade Russian industrial capacity over the mid- and long term.""
Commerce Department official Thea Kendler, who spoke to the export gathering on Friday, said ""We are contemplating massive sanctions targeting key people and industries that were not on the table in 2014."" That year Russia invaded and annexed Crimea from Ukraine.
Three days ago President Joe Biden said he would consider personal sanctions https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-seeks-protect-europes-energy-supplies-if-russia-invades-ukraine-2022-01-25 on Russian President Vladimir Putin if he sent forces into Ukraine. 
Harrell said he hoped the hundreds of hours he and his colleagues had spent over the last couple of months developing measures would never see the light of day, but that they are prepared to impose the sweeping measures.
The two-fold strategy includes financial sanctions against major Russian financial institutions ""to trigger capital flight, to trigger inflation, to make the Russian central bank provide bailouts to its banks... so Putin feels costs on day one,"" Harrell said.
Export control measures would be announced as part of the package but would probably not have the same immediate impacts, and instead ""degrade Russia's ability to have industrial production in a couple of key sectors"".
Harrell did not detail the sectors, but other White House officials have mentioned aviation, maritime, robotics, artificial intelligence, quantum computing and defense.
A person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday the focus was on strategic sectors significant to Russian leadership. Asked about Russia's lucrative oil and gas sector, the person said nothing was off the table.
In a follow-up comment, White House spokesperson Emily Horne also said no options had been eliminated. 
""We and our allies have a full range of high-impact sanctions and export controls ready to go, both immediately after a Russian invasion and in waves to follow,” Horne said.
Harrell said he expected the European Union to join in the effort. ""Based on the discussions I've been having and, frankly, people way above me ... we are quite confident we will have a very high degree of alignment with Europe if Russia does invade Ukraine.""

Sources have said the U.S. also may apply a rule to stop companies abroad from shipping items like semiconductors made with U.S. technology to Russia, as it did to curb the global chip supply to China's Huawei, which it views as a threat.
The person familiar with the matter said on Thursday that U.S. officials are also having conversations with Taiwan and South Korea, where major manufacturers of chips are located, and countries in southeast Asia, where some packaging is done.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives will take up a bill next week aimed at increasing competitiveness with China and supporting the U.S. chip industry, including $52 billion to subsidize semiconductor manufacturing and research.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on Friday that the House would vote on the 2,900-page bill, called the ""America Competes"" act, saying it would ""make further strides in innovation, technology, and advanced manufacturing."" The bill also authorizes $45 billion to support supply-chain resilience and manufacturing of critical goods, industrial equipment, and manufacturing technology. 
President Joe Biden's administration is pushing Congress to approve funding to subsidize chip production in the United States, as shortages of the components used in autos and computers have increased supply chain bottlenecks.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Friday the bill would ""create thousands of jobs all over America. We need Congress to pass that bill in order to revitalize American manufacturing.""
The Senate passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act last year, which includes $52 billion to increase U.S. semiconductor production and authorizes $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research to compete with China.
The House bill has some differences with the Senate version. If it passes the House, leaders of both chambers will negotiate to resolve differences.
The House bill also includes a number of trade provisions and would impose additional sanctions on China for what the U.S. says are rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang region. China denies the allegations. The bill would also offer refugee status for qualifying people from Hong Kong, where Beijing has cracked down on pro-democracy activists.

Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in a statement China was ""firmly against the U.S. making an issue of China and taking it as an imaginary enemy."" The bill ""gravely interferes in China's domestic affairs and ""is 'Hinder China to Compete Act' rather than 'The America COMPETES Act.'"" 
The House bill also reauthorizes and revises Trade Adjustment Assistance programs, which help workers whose jobs or pay is hurt by imports, and reforms the Generalized System of Preferences, a preferential tariff system for imports.

""There is no question that these nominees are qualified,"" Brown, a Democrat, said in a statement issued Friday. ""In my meetings with them, they made clear that they understand how our economy works – and who makes it work.""
Brown, who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said he met with Sarah Bloom Raskin, who Biden nominated for Fed vice chair of supervision, as well as Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson, who were nominated to be Fed board governors. 
The statement comes after some Republicans and business groups voiced criticisms about the Fed picks, signaling they may face a tough confirmation process in the closely divided Senate. 
Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the Senate Banking committee, said Thursday he had concerns about the nominees, arguing they did not adequately reflect the nation’s geographic diversity, and taking particular aim at Raskin for her views on climate change risks.
And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Thursday sent a rare letter to lawmakers raising concerns about Raskin and her calls for federal regulators to transition financing away from the fossil fuel industry.
White House spokesperson Michael Gwin said Thursday that Raskin would bring unprecedented experience to the job and had won the support of economic experts across the political spectrum. 

Brown said Friday the three nominees are ""well established"" and respected in both the public and private sectors and would bring new perspectives on the ""economic issues that matter most to Americans’ lives, like raising wages, increasing job opportunities, and bringing down prices."" 
If Biden's choices were confirmed, they would make the seven-member Fed Board the most diverse, by race and gender, it has ever been. The three nominees will have a confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking committee next week on Feb. 3.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. carriers on Friday canceled thousands of flights through the weekend in anticipation of a winter storm forecast to bring high winds and heavy snow across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. 
The National Weather Service said in an advisory that the Nor'easter would result in dangerous blizzards and make travel ""nearly impossible."" Flight-tracking service FlightAware reported about 4,900 U.S. flights were canceled between Friday and Sunday. 
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said it would suspend operations at LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy airports in New York, Newark Liberty airport in New Jersey and Logan airport in Boston from Saturday through Sunday morning. 
The Atlanta-based carrier canceled 1,290 flights from Friday to Sunday. Customers who would have traveled then were allowed to reschedule to different flights without extra cost.
""Delta teams are focused on a safe and orderly restart of operations at these airports and others in the Northeast Sunday afternoon, depending on conditions,"" the company said in a statement.
Similarly, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) canceled about 1,160 flights as it expects ""significant"" impact from the storm on its Northeast operations, especially at Logan airport. Affected passengers can rebook flights without change fees.
New York-based JetBlue canceled about 500 flights through Sunday including half of its scheduled flights on Saturday.
United Airlines has cut 21% of its Saturday flights, according to FlightAware. 

The storm has added to the challenges facing the airline industry, which is trying to recover from turbulence caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant. An increase in COVID-19 infections among employees has left carriers short staffed, forcing them to cancel flights.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co on Thursday said about 5,000 employees, or roughly 10% of its workforce, had contracted the virus in the first three weeks of January. The company has canceled more than 5,600 flights thus far this month, which is estimated to cost it $50 million in revenue.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A powerful Nor'easter was forecast to hammer New England and the Middle Atlantic region this weekend with up to two feet of snow, bringing the potential for coastal flooding, power outages and significant travel woes. 
Airlines had already canceled more than 5,000 flights scheduled to depart between Friday and Sunday, according to the flight-tracking service FlightAware. A total of more than 8,500 flights were delayed.
The storm was developing as a low pressure system off the Southeast coast and was expected to gain in intensity as it moves up the East Coast, the National Weather Service said.
The NWS issued a blizzard warning for the Boston metropolitan area and its nearly 4.9 million residents on Friday. 
""Expect whiteout conditions and nearly impossible travel at times. The strong to damaging winds will lead to scattered power outages. Also, significant coastal impacts are possible, including coastal flooding and beach erosion,"" the weather service said in an advisory.
Forecasters said up to two feet (60 cm) of snow could fall across the region and wind gusts of 70 miles (112 km) per hour could be expected starting early on Saturday. Southeastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod and the island of Martha's Vineyard, were expected to get the highest snow totals. 
""We’re declaring a snow emergency starting tonight,"" Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said in a tweet. ""Residents are encouraged to stay home."" 
Winter storm advisories and warnings were also in effect from the Carolinas up through Maine, where snow was forecast to start falling Friday afternoon and expected to continue on Saturday. Wind gusts could reach 50 miles per hour. 
""It will make travel pretty much impossible,"" said Patrick O'Hara, an NWS meteorologist based in New Jersey. ""It is the first very big storm of the year.""
The storm was approaching nearly 44 years to the day when a monstrous blizzard crippled New England. Striking with little warning and dumping more than 27 inches of snow on Boston, the catastrophic 1978 storm killed dozens of people, trapped others in their homes and shut down major highways for a week. 
New York City, the nation's biggest metropolis, may see nine inches of snow, weather forecasters said. 
""As we head into the weekend, please closely follow local forecasts, stay off the roads, and avoid unnecessary travel,"" New York Governor Kathy Hochul said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Photographs posted on media showed shoppers crowded into grocery stores, picking shelves clean as they stocked up on essentials ahead of the storm. 
""I just spent over $100 for groceries ahead of this alleged “storm.” Snow girl, if you gon’ do it, do it big,"" Twitter user ChelsLynne17 posted on the social media platform. 
The weather service warned that blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility and strong winds could bring down tree branches and knock out power in parts of the region.
Libraries, churches, clinics and various retail stores in the region said they were closing on Saturday. 

""We will be closed tomorrow, Saturday the 29th, for the snow storm. Call us wimps, if you dare..."" said RiverRun Bookstore, a Portsmouth, New Hampshire, retailer, in a tweet. 
The storm system will push temperatures down. Highs will range from 15 to 25 degrees Fahrenheit below average across the eastern third of the United States on Saturday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign banks based in the European Union may have to hold more capital and liquidity under revisions to rules being considered by the bloc's member states, an EU document showed.
Officials in Brussels are looking to classify more foreign banks as subsidiaries rather than branches, a change which would require them to beef up their local balance sheets and come under direct EU supervision. The move would ensnare a large portion of lenders which opened branches in the EU after Britain left the bloc.
An EU document prepared for member states and seen by Reuters said adjustments could include an ""automatic trigger for subsidiarisation"", or ways to constrain the discretion that regulators have in deciding which branches must become a subsidiary.
The bloc's European Banking Authority https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Publications/Reports/2021/1015664/Report%20on%20third%20country%20branches.pdf (EBA) said in a June 2021 report that at the end of 2020 there were 106 third country branches (TCBs) across 17 member states holding 510.23 billion euros ($569.16 billion) in assets, with variations in how member states treat them.
This was up 14 branches and 120.5 billion euros in assets on the prior year, highlighting an increasing trend, linked to Brexit, in the use of branches to access the EU market, EBA said.
China has 18 branches, followed by Britain with 15, Iran 10, and the United States nine.
(European Banking Authority Third Country Branches Graphic, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkplgjwdkvb/European%20Banking%20Authority%20Graphic%20on%20Third%20Country%20Branches.PNG) 
Currently EU banking regulators decide on a case-by-case basis whether a foreign branch should become a subsidiary they would then directly supervise. A foreign branch's main regulator is its home watchdog.
""The consideration to call for an automatic trigger to subsidiarise will alarm firms,"" a banking industry official said.
Regulators currently review foreign branches with assets of 30 billion euros ($33.4 billion) or more to see if they are systemic enough to pose risks to financial stability. 
They can require the branch to restructure or hold extra capital if it wants to continue operating in the bloc.
Jeremy Kress, assistant law professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business in the United States, said stricter EU rules could also prompt the United States to review its rules for foreign bank branches, which he said continue to be a major regulatory loophole. 
""This could put subsidiarisation on the agenda in the United States,"" said Kress, who is a former Federal Reserve official.
(European Banking Authority Graphic on Assets of Third Country Branches, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdpzynqdovw/European%20Banking%20Authority%20Graphic%20on%20Assets%20of%20Third%20Country%20Branches.PNG) 
APPROPRIATE SCOPE
The decision to force branches to become subsidiaries has been a last resort, and some member states say the current system is too cumbersome.
""Scope of systemic importance assessment and of the eventual joint decision seem unclear and exhibit apparent inconsistencies,"" the document said.
Some states also want to lower the assets threshold that triggers a review of whether a branch should become a subsidiary, the document showed.
A combination of lower thresholds and an automatic trigger would give the European Central Bank, which supervises top lenders, more sway and make it harder for branches to avoid becoming subsidiaries.
Financial firms in Britain, now outside the bloc, can still serve EU customers who have approached them without prompting or marketing under a practice known as reverse solicitation.
The document says member states want to review the ""appropriate scope"" of reverse solicitation and make clearer when an activity should be conducted at least in a branch in the EU.
EU member states and the European Parliament have joint say on final approval on the revisions to banking rules.
The ECB is already conducting a ""desk mapping"" review to see whether new Brexit hubs of banks from London have sufficient senior staff and volume of activities to comply with licence requirements.

British regulators worry that if many bankers are forced to move from London to Brexit hubs, operations in Britain won't have enough senior staff.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio said on Friday that talk of a ""technical recession"" in the country doesn't take into account coronavirus-related economic volatility and global supply chain issues.
Mexico's economy, the second-largest in Latin America, likely shrank 0.2% in December compared with the same month a year earlier, a preliminary official estimate showed last week, stirring concerns the country may have slipped into a recession in the second half of 2021.
Meanwhile, a Reuters survey showed on Friday that Mexico's economy likely contracted in the last three months of 2021. That would mark a second straight quarter of negative growth, which constitutes a technical recession.
""We feel like talk of a technical recession doesn't really capture the economic dynamics we're seeing due to the effects of the pandemic and above all else because of the supply shocks the world is facing,"" Yorio said in a news conference.
Global supply bottlenecks, increased prices for raw materials, and higher costs for ground transportation and sea shipping are weighing on the economy, Yorio added.

Some analysts have said the economic stagnation and high inflation that Mexico was experiencing was a recipe for stagflation https://www.reuters.com/business/mexicans-chafe-over-struggling-economy-surging-inflation-2022-01-27.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -Argentina has struck an agreement in principle with the International Monetary Fund over a new $44.5 billion standby deal, both sides said on Friday, a major breakthrough in tense talks to restructure loans the country cannot repay.
The South American country has been locked in talks for over a year with the IMF over a new program to revamp debt outstanding from a failed $57 billion loan deal from 2018, the fund's largest ever. It faced a $700 million payment due Friday.
""We had an unpayable debt, which left us without a present and a future. Now we have a reasonable agreement that will allow us to grow and meet our obligations through growth,"" President Alberto Fernandez said in an address to the nation.
He said the agreement would not limit Argentina's economic plans or spending, which had been something of a red line for a country emerging from years of recession and the harsh impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The IMF said in a statement that its staff had reached an ""understanding"" with the government over key policies that would underpin the final deal, including the path toward fiscal consolidation, which had been a key sticking point in the talks.
""IMF staff and the Argentine authorities have reached an understanding on key policies as part of their ongoing discussions of an IMF-supported program,"" Luis Cubeddu, mission chief for Argentina, said in a statement.
""The agreed fiscal path would gradually and sustainably improve public finances and reduce monetary financing.""
The deal would allow for spending increases on infrastructure, science and technology, and would protect targeted social programs, the IMF said, while energy subsidies would be reduced ""in a progressive manner"".
The two sides will continue their work in the coming weeks towards reaching a staff-level agreement, the IMF added.
'JUST THE START'
Recent uncertainty over a deal has hammered Argentina's sovereign bonds, while anti-IMF rhetoric has risen in the grain-producing country, with some protesters on Thursday calling for the government to suspend repayments.
The country's sovereign bonds jumped an average 6% on Friday morning, while stock indices and the freely traded black-market peso all jumped on Friday morning after the news.
""It's far from a perfect deal, but it means the current government will be able to muddle through economically and investors can start to focus on political change in next year's (presidential) elections,"" said Ted Pincus at Switzerland-based fund Mangart Capital.
""The IMF seems to have capitulated to political pressure.""
Argentina's Economy Minister Martin Guzman said in a news conference that under the deal the country would target reducing its fiscal deficit to 0.9% by 2024 and gradually end central bank financing to the Treasury.
""We hope to reach our deficit objectives with real spending that does not stop the economic recovery and to be able to gradually strengthen tax collection,"" Guzman said.
He ruled out an abrupt exchange rate devaluation, said the country would seek to have positive real interest rates and bring down rampant inflation currently running at above 50% on an annual basis, which hurts savings and salaries.
Argentina and the IMF had been at loggerheads in talks over how quickly Argentina should reduce its fiscal deficit, with the country arguing it needed to be able to maintain spending to preserve the fragile economic growth recovery. 
Nikhil Sanghani, Latin America economist at Capital Economics, said that the deal -- after months of ""hardball"" tactics -- would bring ""some relief to international bondholders in the near term"", though many issues remained.
""This is just the start of a long journey to fix Argentina's macroeconomic imbalances, and there is still a lot that could go wrong over the coming years,"" he said in a note.

LONDON/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's breakthrough agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a $44.5 billion new deal should bolster domestic markets in the weeks ahead, investors and analysts said, though the longer-term outlook remains hazy.
The South American country said on Friday it had struck a deal with the IMF over a new standby program to replace a failed $57 billion loan from 2018, easing fears of a potential default as major payments come due this year.
That will likely bolster bond prices that had sunk into the 20-30 cents on the dollar range over the past year as the talks had dragged, bogged down by disagreements over the speed of fiscal consolidation.
""It gives them some breathing room for the next couple of years,"" said Peter Kisler, Trium Capital emerging market portfolio manager, who holds Argentine debt. Bonds could ""easily go up another 20% if there is a bit more optimism,"" he added.
""The agreement is not as detailed as we would have liked, so we don't see prices flying from here, but there was a real risk of a default to the IMF.""
Bonds were up some 3 cents on Friday after the government and the IMF announced the agreement, which still needs to be ironed out and approved by Congress and the IMF board.
Argentina was facing some $18 billion in payments due to the IMF this year which it said it could not pay after years of economic crises compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. It restructured over $100 billion in private debts in 2020.

'NO FISCAL EFFORT'
The deal ""relieves financing needs for the coming years and reduces uncertainty in Argentina's economy"" amid a tentative recovery over the past year, said Eugenio Mari, chief economist at research organization Fundacion Libertad y Progreso. 
Carlos de Sousa from Vontobel Asset Management forecast the deal clinched by the leftist government would be approved by Congress, where the conservative opposition will likely back it.
""I think the opposition will approve it as they don't want to be seen as the irresponsible ones that vote it down,"" he said. ""For 2022 and 2023 there is virtually no fiscal effort so Argentina basically got what it wanted.""
In a note, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Alberto Ramos said it remained to be seen how robust the plan would be and whether it would solve Argentina's economic issues.
""Overall, the macro-financial picture shows deep imbalances and widespread distortions rendering a gradual policy adjustment strategy inherently risky,"" he wrote.

An Argentine stock trader, who asked not to be named, said the market remained tense but the announcement did help give a bit more certainty. He was keen to see the fine print of the final deal and how it was carried out in practice.
""The announcement gives some breathing space to the market, but we have to be cautious and see how the agreement is implemented,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve plans to raise interest rates in March on the assumption the U.S. economy will largely steer clear of fallout from the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and keep growing at a healthy clip.
What if it doesn't?
With financial markets fast adapting to expectations of an ever-more aggressive Fed battle against inflation, year-end data showed weaker-than-anticipated results for some of the inflation measures the U.S. central bank watches closely, a reminder of how uncertain its ultimate policy path remains.
The numbers were still high, with the employment cost index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rising 4% on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter, the largest increase since 2001, and the personal consumption expenditures price index jumping 5.8% on a year-on-year basis in December, the biggest annual rise since 1982 and nearly triple the Fed's 2% inflation target.
But the pace of change from the previous periods fell, and even as investors and many analysts continued penciling in more and faster Fed rate increases this year, some added a footnote.
The slowdown in employment cost growth, for example, was a ""big step in the right direction"" for Fed officials who expect price trends to ease on their own, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Where Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other U.S. central bank officials have emphasized the risk that inflation may prove higher and require them to raise borrowing costs faster then expected, Shepherdson in recent forecasts sketched an opposing view: Of an economy that flatlines because of the coronavirus pandemic in the first three months of 2022, loses jobs in January and February, and produces inflation that is ""falling sharply"" by the second quarter, just as the Fed is presumably gearing up for its rate increases.
That scenario, out of step with investors who expect five rate hikes this year and some forecasters who have gone as high as seven, shows the degree of uncertainty still in play around where the economy is heading and how the Fed will respond.
'NO ROAD MAP'
An interest rate hike at the Fed's March 15-16 policy meeting is virtually assured at this point. But even the size of that increase is up in the air as some analysts expect the Fed, rather than the usual quarter-percentage-point rate hike, to opt for a larger half-percentage-point rise to tighten credit faster and demonstrate its seriousness in lowering inflation.
Much, however, rides on how the economy, inflation, financial markets and the virus behave in coming weeks. 
Major U.S. stock indexes were trading higher on Friday, punctuating a week of heavy losses. Earlier in the day, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that consumer spending fell in December, weakness that may have continued into January given the massive outbreak of new coronavirus cases. 
Consumer sentiment continued to decline at the start of the year, hitting the lowest point in a decade, according to the University of Michigan's closely watched gauge of American households' sentiment. Survey director Richard Curtin said the combination of Omicron, high inflation, and the steady dose of news about future Fed rate hikes could trigger a consumer backlash - a possible blow to economic growth on top of what's already coming through lowered government spending.
""The danger is that consumers may overreact to these tiny nudges,"" Curtin said.
That could help with inflation, at least some of which has been driven by strong demand for goods during the pandemic, but the Fed may be treading a fine line between what's needed to temper prices and what would be an overreach.
""Panic within the Fed's ranks has begun to set in. The challenge now is to tamp down inflation without allowing the flame on the overall economy to go out,"" wrote Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, a professional services firm. ""There is no road map for doing this after inflation has surged.""
Bond markets on Friday were showing some signs of caution. U.S. Treasury yields fell, and the gap between longer-term and shorter-term securities has narrowed - often taken as a loss of faith in future economic growth, falling inflation, or both.

Either way, said Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, it's a reason the U.S. central bank may not ultimately need to ""slam on the brakes"" with aggressive rate increases.
Despite the seemingly hawkish positioning of the Fed, Kashkari told NPR on Friday that the aim is not to restrict the recovery but ""let our foot off the accelerator just a little bit.""

(Reuters) - Stephen Bullock eight months ago gave up on the idea of buying raw materials and parts only shortly before they were needed on his assembly line.
Instead, he told his purchasing manager to ""just buy everything you can,"" and they could store the excess, said Bullock, chief executive of Power Curbers Companies, a maker of heavy equipment used to build concrete sidewalks and other infrastructure projects.
Roughly two years into a pandemic that has snarled supply chains across the globe, U.S. companies are scrambling not just to produce enough to feed current demand - but to also refill inventory shelves. That buildup was key to the fourth quarter’s hefty 6.9% annualized growth in gross domestic product, with inventory investment contributing 4.9 percentage points, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.
Spending shifted during the pandemic from services to goods, a boom that has strained supply chains and emptied warehouses. Excluding inventories, GDP grew at a more modest 1.9% rate in the latest period.
This boom in demand, coupled with shortages, has fueled a wave of inflation that increased at a pace last year not seen in nearly 40 years. This set the stage for the Federal Reserve to now look towards raising interest rates in March.
Bullock, whose company is based in Salisbury, North Carolina, said supply chain problems have continued to grow worse in recent months - not better.
Ditching the ""just-in-time"" inventory model in favor of building up supply to buffer stocks only made sense, he said, referring to a system that aims to buy parts and materials shortly before they're needed - to minimize the cost of holding supplies. Just-in-time has evolved into a standard worldwide in the era of globalized trade, one embraced across corporate America - until COVID-19's emergence upended it. Since the pandemic struck, many businesses found the system left them stranded when orders that normally took weeks suddenly took months to arrive.
Bullock's goal now is to snap up materials like steel whenever he can. ""We've had to get creative in where to put all of it,"" he added. ""We're using all the nooks and crannies to house those incoming items.""
Supply chain problems are weighing on the results of some companies. On Thursday, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.'s shares slid after the electric car maker said it would delay releasing new vehicles until next year because of supply chain breaks that it said could last through this year. Earlier in the week,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. reported a decline in quarterly revenue amid supply chain shortages.
Companies have grown creative to deal with the gaps in supplies.
Rockwell Automation Inc (NYSE:ROK). Chief Executive Blake Moret, said his company has increased amount of ""work in progress,"" in order to keep workers assembling goods as they wait for shipments of scarce computer chips. The chips are added just before the product is sent out the door.

Rockwell, which has benefited from a push to automate factories and warehouses during the pandemic, has ""slightly"" increased its inventory levels, said Moret, but not enough to have a meaningful impact on overall inventories.
The Milwaukee-based company on Thursday raised its earnings forecast for its fiscal year as it reported a 40% jump in orders in its first quarter, compared to a year ago. ""We're in the early phase of multi-year economic expansion,"" said Moret.

602,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 12:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A slew of U.S. inflation measures out Friday underscored the breadth of price pressures in the economy and reinforced the Federal Reserve’s recent urgency to begin raising interest rates.
The employment cost index, a measure cited by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in December as a key reason for the central bank’s pivot to a more aggressive stance on inflation, rose 4% in the year through December, the most in two decades. 
In another sign of mounting inflationary pressure, a separate Commerce Department report Friday showed the personal consumption expenditures price gauge, which the Fed uses for its inflation target, rose 5.8% from a year earlier, the most since 1982.
“Our view of continued upside risks to inflation into 2022 is reaffirmed by late-2021 data, with core PCE inflation continuing to climb and labor costs rising,”  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). economists Veronica Clark and Andrew Hollenhorst said in a note. 
The figures show a worsening inflationary environment and come just days after the Fed endorsed plans to raise interest rates in March. Powell also opened the door to more frequent and potentially larger hikes than anticipated, underscoring the challenge the Fed will face this year to keep the broad and sizable price increases from becoming entrenched.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
The ECI report “turns the chances of a 50-basis point rate hike in March from a remote possibility to something the FOMC will consider seriously. However, it will take additional inflationary shocks for a 50-basis point hike to become Bloomberg Economics’ central scenario.”
-- Anna Wong, economist

“There’s a risk that the high inflation we’re seeing will be prolonged, and there’s a risk that it will move even higher,” Powell said during a press conference Wednesday. “We have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes.”
Central bankers also closely watch long-term inflation expectations to ensure that they remain in line with their target. 
Another report Friday, from the University of Michigan, showed consumers expect inflation to rise 4.9% over the next year, matching the highest level since 2008. Over the next five to 10 years, Americans see prices rising at an annual rate of 3.1%, the highest since 2011. Even so, Fed officials for the most part have said those expectations haven’t been cause for concern. 
But for American families, the rapid price increases have eroded workers’ paychecks and driven up the costs of necessities. Real disposable personal income, or after-tax income adjusted for inflation, fell 0.2% last month, the fifth straight decline. 
The decades-high inflation has driven down President Joe Biden’s approval ratings and caused financial hardship for many families. 
The higher inflation experienced at the end of 2021 is expected to persist into the first quarter, but economists see price pressures easing as the year goes on. While the Fed’s monetary policy tools are one way of addressing inflation, relieving bottlenecks throughout global supply chains will also play a central role in curbing price pressures.
The persistence of recent inflationary pressures are “importantly related to the evolution of global supply factors such as production or shipping bottlenecks and input prices,” according to a blog post from economists at the New York Fed. “Their global nature and their source (that is, supply as opposed to demand) suggest that domestic monetary policy actions would have only a limited effect on these sources of inflationary pressures.”

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy likely contracted in the last three months of 2021, in what would mark a second straight quarter of negative growth and put Latin America's second-largest economy in a technical recession, a Reuters survey showed on Friday. Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to have shrunk in the fourth quarter by 0.3% from the previous three-month period in seasonally adjusted terms, according to the median forecast of a poll of 11 analysts.
The economy shrunk by 0.4% in the third quarter.
The poll forecast the economy expanded by 5.1% in 2021, after shrinking by 8.5% in the previous year in what was its worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The poll forecast GDP growth of 1.9% for 2022. Analysts cited various factors to explain a fourth-quarter drop, including the spillover effects from a contraction in the third quarter, the ongoing fallout from the pandemic, reduced consumption due to higher inflation, bottlenecks in global supply chains and domestic policy decisions that have impacted private investment. ""A heterogeneous and disorderly recovery was characteristic for all of 2021. In different sectors you saw contractions followed by growth and then followed by contractions,"" said Jesus Lopez, analyst at bank Banco Base.
Lopez said that performance will likely be repeated in the first quarter. In unadjusted terms, GDP is expected to have grown 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter, according to the survey. Mexico's national statistics agency is due on Monday to publish the preliminary estimate for fourth-quarter GDP. Final GDP data will be published on Feb. 25.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine's president wants weapons and loans at a time of problems with Moscow. But one thing he does not want from the West is more panic-inducing warnings that Russia is about to attack.
Western leaders like U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson have for weeks spoken about what they say is a credible and urgent threat of a new Russian invasion of Ukraine after Russia massed troops nearby. 
Moscow says it has no such intentions and can deploy and drill its own troops on its own territory as it sees fit. 
The warnings have taken their economic toll. Ukraine's hryvnia currency tumbled to its lowest level against the dollar since February 2015 while bonds fell into distress territory in January.
""Constant and extremely emotional messages in the media about how a big war is going to start tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow or the day after that create economic risks,"" said Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the president's chief of staff. 
""This speculative stuff puts pressure on investors, creditors and on ordinary people. And that worsens other economic indicators."" 
According to one source familiar with their conversation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in his latest call with Biden on Thursday downplayed the risk of a Russian attack and focused on Ukraine's economy instead. 
On Friday, Zelenskiy made clear he was frustrated with Biden's war talk. 
""I understand deeply what's going on in our state just as he (Biden) deeply understands what's going on in the United States,"" Zelenskiy said sharply.
""Do we have tanks in our streets? No. But if you're not here you get the sense from the media that there's a war on. We don't need this panic.""
He said it was important Biden got his information about the situation from himself rather than intermediaries. 
When Washington said earlier this month that the families of U.S. diplomats were being evacuated, prompting other countries to follow suit, Ukrainian officials publicly criticised the move as premature. 
That criticism, said one government source, was also designed to calm market jitters. 
""The extra billions we can spend on the army won't help if we lose balance and economic stability,"" Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov told parliament on Friday. 
One senior adviser to Zelenskiy told Reuters that what he called the borderline ""hysteria"" had squeezed Ukraine out of market borrowing, prompting Kyiv to call for a $5 billion aid package from friendly countries and institutions.
There is some sympathy in Washington about how Ukraine's leadership must calibrate its messaging. 
""On the one hand he wants assistance, but on the other hand he has to assure his people he has the situation under control. That's a tricky balance,"" said a White House official. 

Memories are still fresh in Ukraine of the economic pain suffered eight years ago when Russia seized Crimea and backed separatist uprisings in eastern Ukraine. 
Analysts say Ukraine's economy is more resilient now, but a senior official told Reuters that government ministers, the central bank and the president were holding meetings to assess the market situation.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank is set to deliver a third consecutive 150 basis point rate rise on Wednesday in a bid to minimize risks of further capital outflows as the U.S. Federal Reserve gears up to start tightening its own policy, a Reuters poll showed.
An expected rise in the Selic rate to 10.75% at the Feb. 2 policy meeting, signalled by the bank's rate-setting committee after its last hefty move in December, would total 875 basis points of cumulative tightening since March 2021.
Inflation, which is running hot nearly everywhere in the world, has roughly doubled in Brazil from a little over 5% when the central bank began raising rates to around 10% now.
All but two of 29 economists polled Jan. 24-28 forecast a 150 basis point rate hike at the Feb. 2 meeting. One said 125 basis points and another said 100.
However, rather than worry about the negative effect on a recessionary economy of such aggressive moves, Brazilian policymakers fear inflation could accelerate further if lift-off by the Fed rekindles a streak of losses for the real currency.
The Fed's recent switch to a hawkish stance - it has yet to raise its federal funds rate from a record low of 0-0.25% but is likely to do so in March has suddenly emerged as a top worry for Latin America's biggest economy.
That is on top of more rooted themes such as fiscal slippage and a presidential election in October.
""Risks related to domestic public accounts, political uncertainty and the prospect of an increase in international interest rates are adding upward pressure on Brazilian interest rates,"" Lucas Godoi, chief economist at GO Associados, said.
While Brazil's economy is in danger of sinking deeper into recession, the bank's chief Roberto Campos Neto says attacking inflation with a stricter policy stance is the best way to contribute to growth.
In a sign of further economic deterioration, the country unexpectedly posted negative foreign direct investment (FDI) of $3.9 billion in December, the worst monthly figure it has ever recorded.
So far, Campos Neto's monetary orthodoxy has given mixed results. Brazil's IPCA-15 consumer price index decelerated this month from previous readings but still rose at a faster pace than expected.

This is likely to incite more aggressiveness from the central bank, as the consensus view for the Selic's maximum level this year was raised by 25 basis points to 12.00% from 11.75% in a separate Reuters poll earlier this month.
""Above-expectations IPCA-15 decreases the space for any pace slowdown,"" Citi analysts wrote in a report. ""Secondly... the recent increase of commodities prices amid an undervalued exchange rate suggests that inflation would remain high.""

(Reuters) - The Fed will likely raise rates in March to tamp down on too-high inflation, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said on Friday, but its actions after that will depend on what emerges from the still ""muddy"" economic picture. 
""I'm comfortable raising rates a few times,"" Kashkari said, adding that inflation should come down even before the Fed raises rates as supply chains get fixed and fiscal support from last year isn't renewed. ""Is it conceivable we could move in the spring and then pause and see how the economy evolves? That's conceivable, I don't want to prejudge it."" At the same time, he said, ""I don't think at this time it would appropriate to use one of those loaded words like 'gradual' or 'deliberate,' because that would signal too much confidence about what's going to happen over the course of the year.""

Economists have scrambled to update rate hike expectations since the Fed on Wednesday said it was likely to hike interest rates in March and reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases that month in what its chief Jerome Powell pledged will be a sustained battle to tame inflation.
""The Fed has all but admitted that it is seriously behind the curve,"" the Bank of America economists said in a report, adding that the aggressive tightening ""should affect the economy with a lag, weighing on 2023 growth.""
Other banks have also increased their expectations on rate hikes. For example,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) expects five increases this year, TD Securities sees four, and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) forecasts as many as six.
Fed funds futures traders are pricing in almost five interest rate increases by year-end, with four likely by September. 
Bank of America raised its 2022 fourth quarter forecast on the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index to 3.0%, from 2.6%, saying that ""an even faster-than-expected drop in unemployment and longer-than-expected supply disruptions mean more inflation.""

It also cut its 2022 U.S. economic growth forecast to 3.6%, from 4.0%, noting that ""a combination of supply and demand factors points to weaker growth this year.""
Bank of America said it now expects a peak fed funds rate of 2.75% to 3.0%.

(Reuters) - Domestic monetary policy actions may do little to tame some of the inflation being driven by global supply chain pressures, researchers for the New York Federal Reserve said in a paper on Friday. 
Much of the persistently high inflation seen during the coronavirus pandemic, including in producer price and goods inflation, is highly linked to global supply chain disruptions, researchers said in a new blog post. 
""Their global nature and their source (that is, supply as opposed to demand) suggest that domestic monetary policy actions would have only a limited effect on these sources of inflationary pressures,"" the researchers wrote.
Inflationary pressures could ease if the supply chain bottlenecks and higher energy costs seen during the pandemic come down, researchers said, pointing to some of the unknowns policymakers will have to navigate as they work to keep higher inflation from becoming entrenched. 

U.S. central bank officials signaled this week that they are likely to raise interest rates starting in March to remove the extraordinary support provided during the pandemic. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell offered little guidance on the pace of future rate increases. That outlook may remain clouded as officials wait to see how inflation, the pandemic, and the overall economy react in coming months.
Friday's blog post incorporates a new index released earlier this month by the New York Fed, which found that global supply chain pressures are near historically high levels but may have peaked. The index, which is based on global shipping rates, air freight costs and other variables, dipped slightly in November and December.

609,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 10:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer sentiment deteriorated further in late January to the lowest in more than a decade as concerns over inflation and the omicron variant dimmed the economic outlook.
The University of Michigan’s final sentiment index dropped to 67.2, the lowest since November 2011, from 70.6 a month earlier, data released Friday showed. The figure was lower than forecast and down from a preliminary reading of 68.8.
A gauge of current conditions decreased to 72, the lowest since August 2011. The survey’s measure of future expectations fell to 64.1.
Consumers expect inflation to rise 4.9% over the next year, matching the highest level since 2008. They expect prices will rise at an annual rate of 3.1% over the next five to 10 years, the highest since 2011.
The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it’s ready to raise interest rates in March as a first step to help cool the fastest inflation in decades, which has eroded households’ purchasing power. A report earlier Friday showed consumer spending slowed last month while core prices rose at the fastest pace since 1983.
Three-quarters of Americans said inflation was the biggest problem for the economy with little partisan divide, the Michigan data showed. That may explain why half of all households believe the economy started the year in a weakened state, with only a third expecting it will improve in the year ahead.
At the same time, Democrats remain much more upbeat - about half of them see continued growth compared with only 15% of Republicans.
Economists predict the recent surge in Covid cases will weigh on economic growth this quarter as Americans delay their return to offices and reduce spending on in-person services such as travel and entertainment. Still, they remain generally upbeat about activity in subsequent periods amid expectations of an easing in inflationary pressures and supply-chain challenges.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's rich and poor alike are experiencing surges in inflation, official data showed on Friday, although soaring food and energy prices mean low-income households stand less chance of avoiding the hit from rising prices.
Consumer prices rose in annual terms by 5.4% last month, the highest rate in almost 30 years - making inflation a hot political topic. Some campaigners say the latest figure understates the true cost increases faced by the poorest families.
New figures published by the Office for National Statistics suggest both low- and high-income households face similar inflation to the headline rate - although the analysis was unable to take account of changed spending patterns during the pandemic or differences in the quality of food bought.
The ONS said low-income households experienced annual consumer price inflation of 5.3% in December, while high-income households faced inflation of 5.5%. The data showed there has been little to separate the two groups since 2014. 
GRAPHIC-UK inflation by income
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/zjvqkajeavx/Pasted%20image%201643375602087.png 
However, analysts said inflation for poorer Britons could overtake that of their richer peers this year.
""While the new ONS figures confirm that the average inflation rates experienced by different income groups are currently similar, they also highlight again how low income families experience inflation in a different way,"" said Jack Leslie, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank.
He said rising food prices and the prospect of a hike in Britain's household energy price cap in April would hurt the lowest-income families most, given they spend twice as much on food and domestic bills as a proportion of their income.
""These families should be the priority for the government's cost of living crisis response,"" Leslie said.
Easing the impact of April's higher energy bills for poorer households would cost at least 2.5 billion pounds ($3.4 billion), the think tank has calculated.
EXPENSIVE ESSENTIALS
A Reuters analysis of household spending data suggests that the inflation faced by low-income households is skewed towards essential spending on food and shelter, leaving them less able to adapt to increases in those prices.
In its latest report, the ONS said the slightly higher inflation rate for well-off households in December reflected their greater spending on transport. 
The surging price of petrol and new and used cars - which comprise a far greater share of spending for high-income households - have been the biggest drivers of inflation over the last year.
Restaurant meals have been another big driver of inflation for high-income households.
While better-off households can spend less on eating out and delay replacing cars during a cost-of-living crisis, the inflation data last week showed a deteriorating picture for basic food and shelter costs.
Food prices rose by 1.4% in December alone, the biggest rise for nine years. Prices of meat, vegetables and bread and cereals each jumped by more than 2% in month-on-month terms.
Actual rents - where spending is skewed heavily towards the lowest income households - hit 2% in annual terms in December, the biggest rise since 2016.
The ONS defined a high-income household as one with after-tax income that is in the top 20% but not the top 10%, and a low-income household as one with an income in the bottom 20% but not the bottom 10%, when adjusted for household size.
In recent weeks social campaigner and writer Jack Monroe has brought media attention to the way the ONS measures food prices.
She has argued that in attempting to capture a representative price for a given item - say a tin of baked beans - the ONS misses out big price moves in the cheapest tins which tend to be bought by the poorest households.
The ONS itself has acknowledged the limitations of its attempts to measure consumer prices, which is based on a basket of 700 types of goods and services from a wide range of suppliers, giving 180,000 pieces of price data each month.
It plans to use prices sent straight from supermarket checkouts - increasing the number of price data points to hundreds of millions - so it has inflation data on a wider range of goods within a particular category.

Friday's figures also reflect spending patterns for 2019, before the pandemic - something the ONS plans to rectify in new data in May.

(Reuters) - With inflation higher and lasting longer than expected, the Federal Reserve needs to take its foot off the monetary gas pedal ""a little bit"" to address imbalances between supply and demand, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said on Friday. 
""The way we bring that into balance is, we will tend to tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates,"" Kashkari told NPR News in his first public comments since the Fed met earlier this week and signaled it will begin to raise rates in March.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -The European Central Bank is looking into corporate governance issues surrounding the chief executive officer of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s fund business DWS, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
The ECB's move comes on top of separate investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as Germany's financial regulator BaFin into allegations that DWS overstated https://www.reuters.com/business/shares-dws-fall-53-early-frankfurt-trade-after-report-us-probe-2021-08-26 how it used sustainable investing criteria to manage investments. DWS has denied those allegations. 
DWS, Deutsche Bank and the ECB declined to comment on the ECB's enquiry.
Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung first reported the ECB's involvement on the topic. The ECB is the primary bank supervisor for Deutsche.
Deutsche Bank is itself conducting an internal investigation into DWS CEO Asoka Woehrmann's possible private email usage for business purposes and also an alleged money transfer to another individual, the Financial Times reported earlier this week, citing documents and people familiar with the matter.
Bankers with knowledge of the investigation said there is no indication of wrongdoing.
A spokesperson for Woehrmann at DWS declined to comment on Friday on the ECB or other investigations. 
During DWS's earnings call with analysts on Thursday, Woehrmann was asked if he wanted to address the allegations. 
Woehrmann said: ""I emphatically reject all these allegations and insinuations."" 
    ""I will not be intimidated,"" Woehrmann also said on the analyst call. He has in recent months received threatening letters https://www.reuters.com/business/ceo-deutsche-banks-dws-received-racist-threat-letter-dws-spokesperson-2022-01-25, including one with red crosshairs, white powder and a racial slur. 
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing, commenting on the bank's investigation, said on Thursday during the bank's results' news conference that Woehrmann had done a wonderful job. 
""Asoka Woehrmann has done a wonderful job, and for that I'm very, very grateful and for that reason I have no doubts,"" Sewing said during the news conference.
Manager Magazin on Friday reported that Woehrmann's alleged use of unauthorised communication platforms included Whatsapp. 
Manager Magazin said BaFin had received a whistleblower complaint about use of Whatsapp for official business purposes.
BaFin and DWS declined to comment on the Manager Magazin report.
DWS came under scrutiny by the SEC and BaFin after a former employee alleged that the company overstated how it used sustainable investing criteria to manage investments.

DWS shares have been hit by the SEC and BaFin investigations. The shares were 3.6 lower by 1214 GMT on Friday.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department is likely to keep cutting auction sizes when it gives its refunding estimates for the coming quarter next week, after ramping up issuance to pay for coronavirus-related spending.
With the Federal Reserve paring bond purchases and getting closer to shrinking its balance sheet, however, it may be the last time in a while that the government has such a luxury.
The Fed on Wednesday said it is likely to hike interest rates in March, and reaffirmed plans to that month end the asset purchases it put in place to stabilize financial markets and the economy during the pandemic. 
U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell pledged a sustained battle to tame inflation, which in addition to rate hikes is likely to include a more rapid reduction of its bond holdings than it has done before. Once that begins, the Treasury essentially needs to replace the bonds maturing from the Fed's portfolio with new issuance at roughly a one-for-one pace. 
But since the Fed gave few details on how and when it will reduce its $9 trillion bond portfolio, the Treasury is expected to continue reducing the amount of its quarterly bond sales. It ramped up debt auction sizes in 2020 and 2021.
“We don’t have much information to really change the issuance as of now, because we just don’t have much information on what the Fed’s going to be doing,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY). “For now, they probably continue to cut coupon issuance sizes and then re-evaluate at the May refunding.”
The Treasury on Monday afternoon will report on how much it expects to borrow next quarter and Wednesday morning will break down details on what that means for different maturities.
Seven-year notes and 20-year bonds are likely to continue to see the largest cuts, after increases in these auctions left the issues struggling with weak demand.
Seven-year note auction sizes, for example, have fallen to $53 billion, after running at $62 billion from January through October 2021. They are up from $32 billion at the beginning of 2020.
The U.S. government is overfunded as it faces a likely budget deficit of $1.35 trillion in fiscal year 2022, based on primary dealer estimates. That is down from $2.77 trillion in fiscal year 2021 and a record $3.13 trillion in fiscal 2020.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) expects the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio to decline 7 percentage points in 2022, after reaching the highest level since World War Two during the pandemic.
The Treasury is not expected to need to increase issuance of coupon-bearing debt this year, though any hastening of the Fed’s balance sheet reduction could change this outlook.
“Even under a fairly aggressive balance sheet runoff scenario, it doesn’t seem like Treasury will need to increase auctions anytime soon, and should still be set to cut them in February,” said Zachary Griffiths, a macro strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
The Fed said it will rely primarily on letting bond holdings run off the balance sheet, rather than selling bonds outright, which could be seen as a more aggressive tightening strategy. 
If necessary, the Treasury could increase issuance of Treasury bills, which would likely see strong demand as money market investors continue to struggle with a dearth of short-term, high-quality assets.

“There likely would be demand for absorbing more bill issuance if that were needed,” Griffiths said.
Demand for the Fed’s reverse repo facility, which is an indicator of excess liquidity, was at $1.58 trillion on Thursday. An increase in the supply of Treasury bills would likely reduce demand to lend to the Fed in the reverse repo facility.

Investing.com -- Stocks are set for a weak open despite support from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which posted a record quarter for sales. Economic bellwether  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), oil giant  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and others report quarterly earnings. The U.S. releases more data on inflation and wage costs. China's stocks finish at 16-month lows before the New Year holiday. The Eurozone economy was held back by its usual powerhouse, Germany, in the fourth quarter, and the world's second-largest battery maker has a wild market debut. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday 28th January.
1. Apple's record sales
Apple shrugged off supply chain constraints and Covid-related store closures in the final three months of 2021 to post record revenue and a 25% rise in earnings per share in its fiscal first quarter.
Sales of iPhones were up 9% rather than the 3% rise expected, while revenue from Mac sales rose 25% and revenue from services was up 24%. iPads were the weak spot, as the company diverted chips away from that segment to service demand for phones.
The company said revenue in the current quarter will also be up in year-on-year terms but was less confident about longer-term forecasting. Analysts responded positively to statements about the company’s investment in Metaverse-related projects. Apple noted that it already has some 14,000 augmented reality apps in its store.
2. PCE, ECI and spending data
Are you ready for the daily test of nerve from the data calendar?
Friday’s big numbers are the Personal Consumer Expenditures price index for December and the Employment Cost Index for the fourth quarter, both due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), which come on the back of GDP numbers that did nothing to allay fears of an aggressive tightening of monetary policy throughout the year.
The Employment Cost Index will be particularly important for what it says about wage inflation. The third-quarter rise of 1.3% was the largest since before the Great Financial Crisis. Analysts expect it to have eased only marginally to 1.2%.
The PCE prices index, meanwhile, is the Fed’s preferred indicator of inflation, rather than the CPI.
There are also data on personal income and spending due for December.
3. Stocks set for weak open; Caterpillar, Chevron earnings due
U.S. stocks are set to open mostly lower, with the sharp drop in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock on Thursday seemingly still weighing on sentiment despite support from Apple’s earnings. 
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were underperforming, falling 186 points, or 0.6%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 Futures were down 0.2%.
For the last two days, the S&P 500 has closed in the red despite being up more than 1.5% intraday. The last time that happened – and, indeed, the only time that has happened in recent history - was in October 2008, according to Steve Deppe, Chief Investment Officer at NDWM.
Aside from Apple and Tesla, stocks in focus on Friday will include Visa (NYSE:V) and luxury goods giant LVMH, which both reported strong earnings late on Thursday. Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) stock is going in the other direction after a weak growth forecast. Caterpillar, Chevron,  Charter Communications  (NASDAQ:CHTR) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) lead the daily roster of companies reporting.
In China meanwhile, benchmark stock indices finished at a 16-month low as the country prepared for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday.
4. Eurozone GDP mixed as Germany slips
The Eurozone economy was a mixed bag at the end of 2021, with the currency union’s largest economy, Germany, shrinking by 0.7% on the quarter, much worse than the 0.3% expected (although the numbers need to be taken with a pinch of salt, given that Germany routinely revises its economic data upwards).
The picture was more positive in France and Spain, both of which posted quarterly growth above expectations due to robust domestic demand.
Separately, the ECB released numbers showing that credit growth and money supply weakened in December. On the price front, Germany’s import price numbers suggested that inflationary pressures may be peaking, posting their smallest monthly rise in 15 months. The annual comparisons still look horrible though, up 24% on the year. Italy’s PPI hit 22.6% in December, leading to a sharp drop in business confidence in January.
5. LG Energy's wild debut
Shares in  LG Energy Solution  Ltd (KS:373220) had a wild ride on their market debut in South Korea, as the world’s second-biggest maker of lithium-ion batteries finally started trading.
The stock ended the day 15% below its IPO price, despite rising nearly 100% at the open. LGES supplies Tesla, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) with batteries for their electric vehicles, and is the world’s second-biggest battery maker by volume after China’s CATL.
Back in the world of conventional energy, oil prices stayed close to their seven-year highs posted earlier in the week, with no sign of a resolution to the crisis over Russia’s threats against Ukraine. By 6:30 AM E, U.S. crude futures were up 0.7% at $87.17 a barrel, while Brent crude was up 0.8% at $88.65 a barrel."

BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) -The German economy contracted over the last three months of 2021 while the French economy expanded, data published on Friday showed, pointing to contrasting fortunes for the euro zone's two largest economies during the pandemic.
Germany is often referred to as the European Union's economic engine, but restrictions introduced in the autumn to fight a fourth COVID-19 wave as well as supply chain disruptions translated into a contraction of 0.7% in the fourth quarter. 
The French economy, which saw an economic revival toward midyear as restrictions were largely lifted, kept growing in the same period, posting a 0.7% rise. This translated into a full-year expansion of 7%, the strongest since 1969.
The German economy expanded by 2.8% last year, exposing its vulnerability to supply chain bottlenecks hampering the manufacturing sector that forms its export-oriented backbone.
""The German economy went into hibernation at the turn of the year,"" Carsten Brzeski of ING wrote in a note. 
""New restrictions to tackle the fourth wave of the pandemic and the Omicron wave as well as higher energy prices dented private consumption. With this weak fourth quarter, the likelihood of Germany being in an outright recession at the turn of the year has increased.""
The preliminary data published by Germany's Statistics Office showed that private consumption fell significantly while government spending increased. The construction sector also contracted.
The government this month cut its economic growth forecast for 2022 to 3.6%. Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Friday he expected a slowdown to 2.3% in 2023.
Despite the French recovery, weak growth in Germany, Europe's largest economy, bodes ill for the euro zone.
Data published on Friday showed economic sentiment in the bloc deteriorated in January, pulled down mainly by a more downbeat sentiment in the industrial sector.
The German economy also faces headwinds from high energy prices, which have dampened private consumption.
An easing of raw material shortages should help the economy remain on a growth path but the pandemic and a possible military conflict between Russia and Ukraine are major risks, Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank Group said.

""A worsening of supply chain problems linked to a rapidly spreading Omicron wave in China and a military escalation on Ukraine's eastern border are among the risks,"" he wrote in a note.
Western powers fear that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could worsen an energy crunch in Europe should the Kremlin respond to sanctions by cutting gas supplies. Russia has denied it plans to invade.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve clearly telegraphed a March interest rate hike after its meeting this week but the pace of what follows may remain clouded as officials wait to see how inflation, the coronavirus pandemic, and the economy overall react in coming months.
In that environment, former Fed officials said, it may be hard - even unwise - for the Fed to tie itself to the sort of forward-looking promises employed in the past to communicate its plans, with words like ""gradual"" being used in Fed policy statements to relay expectations of hikes every quarter.
With so much unknown about where prices, the pandemic and the economy are heading, ""I don’t see how they can say they are going to be 'patient' or they are going to be 'gradual' or they are going to move 'deliberately' or whatever word you like because it is too easy to imagine outcomes where it is wrong almost right away,"" said William English, a professor at the Yale School of Management who ran the Fed's Monetary Affairs Division responsible for drafting policy statements. 
That may put further weight on the quarterly economic and policy projections officials will issue at their March 15-16 meeting, providing a window on how they think key economic variables are evolving. 
The projections have often been criticized as a font of misunderstanding - a collection of individual outlooks that can be misconstrued as a ""forecast"" or ""plan"" of the central bank itself, and which can be outdated almost as soon as they are published.
But in an environment where the Fed may want to hedge its official policy statement, they might provide the best sense of direction.
The Fed's public commitment to an all-in battle against inflation belies that the central bank is also involved in a sort of waiting game. Many policymakers still feel some, if not much, of the progress of lowering inflation from multi-decade highs will come from supply chain problems diminishing and an easing pandemic eventually allowing a more normal resumption of commerce and work.
On that hope they have rested projections that as of December still only foresaw modest and never restrictive interest rate increases.
It remains unclear when those positive developments will be felt in tempering headline consumer inflation that hit 7% in December, the highest since the 1980s. What Fed officials fear is that in the meantime inflation may become more embedded, begin to reshape psychology, and be that much tougher to dislodge. That risk has led them to prepare for more aggressive steps to clamp down on credit and consumption and stifle inflation through monetary measures.
'HIGHLY UNCERTAIN'
Given the stakes - higher and stickier inflation if they make one mistake, a potential recession if they make the other - officials don't want to go all in until they need to.
In the statement approving the March rate hike, ""they are not going to be willing to commit to anything because they want to be 'humble' and 'nimble,'"" said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist for Dreyfus and Mellon, quoting words Chair Jerome Powell has used to acknowledge that the Fed has been wrong in its forecasts through the pandemic, and may have to shift policy fast in response to events.
Absent guidance in the statement itself, ""the dot plot is going to be important,"" said Reinhart, a former Fed staffer who also served as head of monetary affairs and as an economist to the policysetting Federal Open Market Committee.
The dot plot charts officials' projections for the appropriate level of the Fed's target policy rate in coming years, issued at four of the central bank's eight meetings each year. In the next set out in March, central bankers will have to catch up with data and markets that have sped ahead, as they have through much of the pandemic. 
Among the reasons the Fed has shifted its stance so abruptly in recent months is that the outlook for ""transitory"" inflation that would mostly go away on its own, as the bumps of the pandemic reopening got smoothed away, proved out of step with price increases that persisted and broadened through the economy. 
Powell at his press conference hinted that a markup of inflation is likely coming in the next set of projections, saying that from his view the situation was ""slightly worse"" than in December when the last forecasts were issued.
That may well feed through to officials' outlook for rates. December's median forecast foresaw three increases this year of a quarter point each. If that shifts higher it could serve the same purpose as putting a word like ""gradual"" in the statement, without conveying the same sort of policy commitment.
Powell further said the Fed could be blindsided from either direction this year, by inflation that fails to fall as fast as anticipated and forces a more aggressive response, or by developments that bring inflation more into line and allow the Fed to do less of the work. 

""The path is highly uncertain,"" Powell said, enumerating reasons the Fed still feels inflation will slow on its own, but saying the Fed was ""committed to using our tools to make sure that high inflation...does not become entrenched. 
""We'll be asking this question all year long...Are things turning out as we expect?"" Powell said. If ""the economy slows more and inflation slows more than expected, we'll react to that. If, instead, we see inflation at a higher level or a more persistent level, then we'll react to that.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Persistently high inflation will haunt the world economy this year, according to a Reuters poll of economists who trimmed their global growth outlook on worries of slowing demand and the risk interest rates would rise faster than assumed so far.
This represents a sea change from just three months ago, when most economists were siding with central bankers in their then-prevalent view that a surge in inflation, driven in part by pandemic-related supply bottlenecks, would be transitory.
In the latest quarterly Reuters surveys of over 500 economists taken throughout January, economists raised their 2022 inflation forecasts for most of the 46 economies covered.
While price pressures are still expected to ease in 2023, the inflation outlook is much stickier than three months ago.
At the same time, economists downgraded their global growth forecasts. After expanding 5.8% last year, the world economy is expected to slow to 4.3% growth in 2022, down from 4.5% predicted in October, in part because of higher interest rates and costs of living. Growth is seen slowing further to 3.6% and 3.2% in 2023 and 2024, respectively.
Nearly 40% of those who answered an additional question singled out inflation as the top risk to the global economy this year, with nearly 35% picking coronavirus variants, and 22% worried about central banks moving too quickly. 
""The odds of an accident have risen and the likelihood of a soft landing in 2022 requires some favourable assumptions and a modicum of good luck,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) group chief economist David Folkerts-Landau said, noting high inflation, the persistence of supply chain strains and the pandemic, as well as international political tensions. 
GRAPHIC: Reuters Poll: Global inflation forecasts 2022, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/egpbklkmevq/Reuters%20Poll%20-%20Global%20inflation%20forecasts%202022.png This month's Reuters polls found 18 of 24 major central banks were expected to lift rates at least once this year, compared to 11 in the October poll.
The U.S. Federal Reserve https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/inflation-fighting-fed-likely-flag-march-interest-rate-hike-2022-01-26 on Wednesday signaled it would raise the benchmark federal funds rate from a record low of 0-0.25% in March after shuttering its bond purchase programme.
The Bank of England https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/inflation-risk-omicron-slowdown-boe-rate-move-balance-2021-12-16 was the first major central bank to raise rates since the pandemic started and is expected to act again, the Bank of Canada https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/timing-bank-canadas-rates-lift-off-knifes-edge-jan-26-hike-possible-2022-01-21 is also seen hiking soon.
In contrast, most economists expect the European Central Bank https://www.reuters.com/business/euro-zone-inflation-burn-hotter-ecb-rates-stay-ice-2022-01-19 and the Bank of Japan https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/japan-pm-kishidas-wage-policies-unlikely-support-economy-this-year-most-2022-01-14 to stay put at least until the end of next year.
While the tightening cycle is in early days in developed markets, many emerging market central banks, with a few notable exceptions like Brazil https://www.reuters.com/article/latam-economy-poll-idUSL1N2U00P3 and China https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/china-growth-seen-slowing-52-2022-modest-policy-easing-expected-2022-01-13, are waiting for the Fed's cue while grappling with the pandemic and their own economic challenges. 
GRAPHIC: Reuters Poll: Global growth outlook - January 2022, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/lgvdwxwlqpo/Reuters%20Poll%20-%20Global%20growth%20outlook.png ""Over the past three decades, developed market central banks led by the Fed have been inclined to see supply shocks boosting inflation as a drag on growth that should be cushioned,"" noted Joseph Lupton, global economist at J.P. Morgan.
However, with major central banks showing concern about bringing inflation expectations close to their targets, emerging economies face a similar challenge. 
""Pressure on emerging market central banks to act to anchor inflationary expectations is likely to intensify,"" Lupton said.
The growth outlook for over 60% of the 46 economies covered in the polls was either downgraded or left unchanged for 2022 and about 90% of respondents, 144 of 163, said there was a downside risk to their forecasts. 

While most countries saw cuts in growth forecasts for the fourth quarter and the current one, largely due to the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, they were expected to rebound next quarter.

The Federal Reserve is clearly out to tame inflation https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/inflation-fighting-fed-likely-flag-march-interest-rate-hike-2022-01-26 and reckons a ""historically tight"" labour market gives it plenty of room to raise rates without hurting jobs growth.
January jobs data out Friday will likely confirm that view.

In December, the BoE became the world's first major central bank to tighten policy and markets anticipate four 25 basis points rises by end-2022. Now investors are seeking guidance on how fast the bank expects to proceed.

A less favourable base of comparison as well as weak consumption and headwinds from flagging real estate investment will be key drags on growth this year, the IMF said in a report released Friday, after the 2021 Article IV consultation with China.
""China's recovery is well advanced, but it lacks balance and momentum has slowed,"" it said, citing COVID-19 outbreaks' effect on consumer spending and a property market downturn amid Beijing's efforts to deleverage the sector. 
The IMF forecasts the world's second-largest economy will grow 4.8% in 2022 and 5.2% in 2023, down from 8.1% growth last year.
Strong supportive measures from the People's Bank of China are expected in the coming months to stabilise a faltering economy. China saw a strong recovery from the pandemic-induced slump but growth slowed sharply in the second half of last year. 
The IMF report also noted a flurry of ""seemingly uncoordinated"" regulatory actions against technology firms and other sectors which is viewed in the market as ""undercutting the role of private enterprises,"" and urged greater transparency and predictability.
China last year launched a regulatory crackdown against tech giants, private education companies and other firms, targeting unfair competition and data governance.
Such reforms could help growth but can damage market sentiment which in turn could lower investment, said the IMF.
The IMF also called for measures to ensure fair competition between China's private firms and its state-owned enterprises (SOEs), warning that such reforms are needed to deal with slowing productivity growth.

Chinese authorities said that ""external decoupling pressures are adding critical headwinds to productivity growth which, in their view, necessitate an increased role of SOEs in strategic sectors,"" according to the report. 
Beijing has warned of the dangers of the ""decoupling"" of its economy with that of the United States amid increased tensions between the two countries.

After U.S. Q4 GDP came in at an annualised 6.9%, the highest since 1983, could Europe go one better? Yes and no. 
France just posted data showing the economy in 2021 expanded at the strongest rate in 52 years at 7%. Sweden too beat expectations at 6.4%. German growth meanwhile is expected at a more sedate 2.7%. 
The wait is on.
In any case, not much relief for the euro, which is heading for its biggest weekly loss against the dollar since last June, and could tumble below $1.11 for the first time since mid-2020. The promise of an aggressive Fed rate rise campaign and a slew of buoyant economic data have boosted the dollar index almost 2% so far this week. 
As usual, reasons for the U.S.-Europe split can be seen in ""real"" bond yields. After stripping out inflation effects, U.S. 10-year yields now stand at minus -0.5%, double end-2021 levels, while its German equivalent languishes around -1.8% .
While Wall Street ended with losses again on Thursday, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted record holiday-quarter sales, having skirted the supply chain problems that have bedevilled rivals. Shares jumped 5% after-hours, but with the world's biggest company down almost $400 billion from peak value, will more buyers emerge?
Aside from the European growth, markets will await core U.S. PCE, the Fed's favoured inflation gauge, to see if price growth is peaking. Expectations though are for a pick-up to 4.8%, which would be the highest reading since 1983.
As for stock markets, futures are again pointing north after a bounce across Asia. Here at least Europe appears more resilient, having managed to end firmer on Thursday. The pan-European STOXX index is down 3.5% this year (-9% at the S&P 500) while Britain's FTSE is actually in the green.

Long-discussed reforms such as property and inheritance taxes to tackle a wealth gap are expected to gain momentum after President Xi Jinping called for China to achieve so-called common prosperity.
In October, the top decision-making body of parliament said it would roll out a pilot real estate tax in some regions, but which regions would be involved and other details have not been disclosed.
The city's statistics bureau said measures would be introduced to boost common prosperity.
""We should prepare for implementation of real estate tax pilot in Xiamen so as to guard against major fluctuations in the city's real estate market,"" it said in a statement on its website.
Xiamen, on the southeast coast in Fujian province, is the first Chinese city to suggest preparatory work for the property tax, said Yan Yuejin, research director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institute. 
""The system and framework for the property tax must be explored and set up at an accelerated pace,"" said Yan.
""For ... the goal of common prosperity, this task is bound to actively advance.""
The idea of a levy on home owners first surfaced in 2003 but has failed to take off due to concern it would damage property demand and undermine prices, triggering a fiscal crisis for local governments dependent on land sales for income. 
Talk of a property tax is coming at a sensitive time, with the property market facing multiple headwinds in 2022 as home prices fall and property investment slumps.

Xiamen's property market is facing its own difficulties, including cautious land purchases by developers and continued low sales of commercial properties, according to the statement.
This week, Xiamen tightened regulatory supervision of funds managed by developers, requiring them to put all deposits collected from home buyers in escrow accounts, concerned funds might be diverted to meet other needs, in a capital-starved sector.

At this stage, however, it was premature to raise the BOJ's interest rate targets or take steps to steepen the yield curve, Kuroda told parliament.

China's central bank had last month cut RRR, or the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, releasing 1.2 trillion yuan ($188.77 billion) in long-term liquidity to bolster slowing economic growth amid persistent COVID-19 cases.
The average RRR for financial institutions stands at 8.4%, vice governor Liu Guoqiang said last week, adding that there was still room for the central bank to cut banks' RRR. 
Credit Suisse also raised its rating to 'overweight' on Chinese equities, from 'benchmark' earlier, with relative earnings revisions seen for the tech sector and wider market. 
""We can see that excess liquidity in China is starting to improve (M1 relative to nominal GDP) and Chinese equities tend to perform as this happens,"" Credit Suisse economist Andrew Garthwaite said in a note dated Thursday.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -DBS Group has agreed to pay S$956 million ($706.6 million) for  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s consumer business in Taiwan, making the Singapore lender the largest foreign bank in Taiwan by assets as it shores up regional acquisitions to power growth.
The deal is part of DBS Chief Executive Piyush Gupta's strategy of expanding Southeast Asia's largest bank in overseas markets, having bought an $814 million minority stake in a privately owned Chinese bank last year as well as distressed lender Lakshmi Vilas Bank in India.
The Taiwan transaction will help DBS better compete with bigger local rivals including CTBC Financial Holding Co Ltd and Cathay Financial Holding Co. Ltd. in the rapidly-growing market.
The transaction comes after Citi said it would exit retail operations in 10 markets in Asia as it refocuses on its more lucrative institutional and wealth management businesses. Citi is retaining its institutional business in Taiwan.
""Citi Consumer Taiwan is a highly attractive, high-returns business that is expected to contribute at least S$250 million annually in net profit to DBS after the COVID-19 recovery,"" Gupta told a news conference on Friday.
The performance of Citi's unit weakened in the past two years mainly because of a sharp drop in interest rates that impacted the sector.
""Frankly, given the outlook on rates that we have today, this is something that's going to come roaring right back. I wouldn't be surprised if this turns around even in the course of this calendar year,"" Gupta said.
DBS, which makes the majority of its profit from Singapore, will take on about 3,500 staff from Citi's Taiwanese business which has 2.7 million credit cards, 500,000 deposit and wealth customers and 45 branches.
ACCELERATE GROWTH
Gupta said the deal will accelerate DBS Taiwan's growth by more than 10 years in a market that is attractive for its wealth and technology sectors.
DBS will pay a premium of S$956 million for Citi's net assets and this will be adjusted when the deal is expected to close in mid-2023. DBS will also inject S$1.2 billion as capital.
Since Citi's Taiwan business had gross loans of S$11.3 billion and total deposits of S$15.1 billion, DBS is effectively not paying anything based for the net assets.
DBS said the acquisition, funded by its excess capital, will have no impact on its ability to pay dividends. DBS, which has a market value of nearly S$92 billion, reported a net profit of S$1.7 billion for the July to September quarter.
Citing sources, Reuters had reported late on Thursday that DBS would announce the purchase on Friday.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is DBS's financial adviser on the transaction.
Peter Babej, Citi's Asia Pacific CEO, said the transaction will enable Citi to make additional investments in strategic areas, including its institutional businesses in Taiwan, which remains a priority market for the firm.

Earlier this month, Citi sold its consumer business in four Southeast Asian markets to Singapore's United Overseas Bank (OTC:UOVEY) for about S$5 billion.

627,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 10:31PM ET</span>",,,,,,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output likely slid in December for the first time in three months due to lingering supply bottlenecks, a Reuters poll showed.
Meanwhile, retail sales were seen growing for the third straight month in December, thanks to low COVID-19 cases that encouraged shoppers until the Omicron variant drove up infections to a record high this month.
The world's third-largest economy likely rebounded solidly in the last quarter of 2021, but whether it can maintain momentum is becoming uncertain as a fresh wave of coronavirus outbreaks again disrupt supply chains and dampens demand.
Industrial output was forecast to have fallen 0.8% in December from the previous month, according to the poll of 19 economists.
That would mark the first decline in three months and follow strong 7.0% growth in November.
""Given the shortage in components like semiconductors, carmakers probably couldn't put in full efforts to make up earlier loss in production,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
Led by automakers, export-oriented manufacturers have recovered from supply constraints in July-September. But some analysts said the recovery was lukewarm.
Supply chain risks - from the unrelenting chip shortage to workforce disruptions because of COVID-19 infections - suggest there may be downside risks for production in January, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Retail sales were seen rising 2.7% in December from a year earlier, after growing 1.9% in November, as shoppers likely remained sanguine amid low coronavirus cases.
However, domestic COVID-19 cases began rising rapidly earlier this month, and the government have imposed curbs to limit face-to-face services in most areas.

The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry will release both industrial production and retail sales data on Jan. 31 at 8:50 a.m. (Jan. 30 at 2350 GMT).
The poll also showed Japan's unemployment rate likely stayed flat at 2.8% and the jobs-to-applicants ratio grew 0.01 point to 1.16 in December. Job figures will be released on Feb. 1 at 8:30 a.m. (Jan. 31 at 2330 GMT).

628,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 10:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Japan should keep its inflation-targeting stimulus rolling and consider shortening the maturity of its yield target to make its easing framework more sustainable, the International Monetary Fund said Friday, in comments that contrast with global moves to tighten policy. 
Given that Japan’s underlying inflation momentum remains weak at around 0.5% and is not currently projected to reach the BOJ’s 2% target, the central bank needs to keep its policy stance accommodative, said Ranil Salgado, Japan mission chief for IMF. 
In its latest Article IV report published earlier Friday, the IMF also said that if inflation remains weak, the BOJ’s first option should be to cut its policy rate. 
The fund’s recommendations that the BOJ keep pressing ahead with stimulus to spur inflation highlights Japan’s different circumstances as global central banks including the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England pivot toward tightening policy to stem accelerating price growth.
Inflation remains much weaker in Japan than its global peers as seen in Tokyo price data released earlier Friday. Core consumer prices in the capital edged up just 0.2% in January, an indication that national inflation will also slow for now.
Still, inflation is expected to jump in spring when sharply lower phone charges stop dragging on the consumer price index, fueling talk that the central bank might look to adjust policy later in the year. 
The uneven nature of price moves in Japan also means that sharp price increases in energy and daily necessities are squeezing household budgets and companies’ profitability, making inflation a potentially uncomfortable issue for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida ahead of elections in the summer.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda tried hard to cool the recent policy normalization speculation last week after the bank stood pat on policy while recognizing that price risks were no longer tilted downward. 
The fund mentioned the possible shortening of the maturity of the BOJ’s yield target as a move that could make the bank’s yield curve control more sustainable, rather than as a move on the path toward policy normalization. The fund has also recommended the targeting of a shorter maturity in previous reports.
The bank currently sets a target of around 0% for the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds.
In other recommendations, the IMF also said the central bank could increase a portion of bank reserves subject to the negative interest rate to strengthen its effect as a policy tool.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Thursday sent an unprecedented letter to lawmakers raising concerns about Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Joe Biden's nominee as the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision, and her calls for federal regulators to transition financing away from the fossil fuel industry.
The U.S. industry lobby group urged leaders of the Senate Banking Committee to question Raskin about those statements and her criticism of the Fed for allowing oil and gas companies to access emergency pandemic funds, among other issues.
Tom Quaadman, executive vice president of the Chamber's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, said the trade group had never before sent a public letter questioning a Fed nominee, but noted the group had stopped short of opposing her nomination outright, at least for now.
""If you have someone who is coming up for the lead position on safety and soundness regulations, and they actually want to cut off an industry from the banking system, that starts to raise questions,"" he told Reuters. 
Quaadman said Raskin's views would have ""ramifications"" for the U.S. and global economy, and the Chamber wanted to be sure that her policies were based on ""solid data and input and not political ideology.""
He said the Chamber, whose board includes big oil companies, would raise similar questions if a Republican nominee suggested excluding renewable energy companies from public funds.
White House spokesperson Michael Gwin said Raskin would bring unprecedented experience to the job and had won the support of economic experts across the political spectrum.
""Bloom Raskin believes firmly in the independent role of the Federal Reserve and will work in concert with Chair (Jerome) Powell and her colleagues to identify and mitigate a range of risks facing our financial system – including cyber and climate – within the Federal Reserve’s existing mandate,"" he said.
Raskin is ""firmly opposed to the Federal Reserve allocating credit by sector or choking off sectors from access to credit,"" a senior administration official told Reuters. ""She supports the existing policy framework on climate risks that has been articulated by Powell and (current Fed vice chair for supervision Randal) Quarles.""
The banking committee, which must approve the Fed nominees before they are considered by the full Senate, will scheduled a confirmation hearing for Raskin and two economists nominated for the board, Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson, on Feb. 3.
Senator Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the panel, also took aim at Raskin this week in a letter to Biden, saying the former Fed governor was ""unacceptable"" due to her ""demonstrated hostility"" toward the oil and gas sector.
The American Bankers Association on Jan. 14 congratulated Raskin, Cook and Jefferson on the nominations, saying they would bring ""a wide range of economic, regulatory and academic experience"" to the job.
Raskin, who also served as a senior Treasury official under former President Barack Obama, would replace Randal Quarles who was appointed the Fed's vice chair for supervision by Republican former President Donald Trump in 2017, if confirmed.

The bank supervision role is the most consequential of several vacancies on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors available to be filled by Biden. 
If confirmed, Raskin would drive policy on issues including climate change financial risks, community lending rules, and financial technology companies, and would likely to review several of Quarles' rule changes which spanned rules on banks' speculative investments, derivatives trading, liquidity and capital.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund urged Japan on Friday to scale back emergency pandemic support, and consider raising taxes on property and capital income once the economy's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic-induced doldrums is firmly in place.
While authorities must keep supporting households most hard hit by the COVID-19 crisis, they should continue scaling down pandemic-relief measures as the economy recovers, the IMF said.
""Looking ahead, given the large uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, fiscal policy should be nimble and flexible, adjusting the scale and the composition of support in response to epidemiological and economic developments,"" the IMF said after a routine monitoring of the economy, known as its Article 4 process.
Japan's economic recovery is likely to strengthen this year, though the balance of risks is tilted to the downside, it said.
Once the recovery is firmly in place, Japan must resume efforts to rein in its huge debt such as by cutting ballooning medical costs for a rapidly ageing population, it said.
Raising the consumption tax rate from the current 10%, as well as hiking property and capital income taxes, could also be among options, the IMF said.
""In the past there has been a lot of focus on the consumption tax,"" said Odd Per Brekk, deputy director of the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department.
""What is needed is a broader package of government spending and revenue measures"" that could include a consumption tax hike, he told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.
On monetary policy, the IMF urged the Bank of Japan to maintain its massive stimulus programme and stand ready to cut interest rates if inflation momentum remains weak. 
In its updated World Economic Outlook, the IMF projected Japan's economic growth would accelerate to 3.3% this year from last year's 1.6% increase thanks to the boost from government stimulus measures and easing global supply constraints.
While price momentum will pick up further on higher import costs and robust domestic demand, inflation will remain below the BOJ's 2% target in the medium term, the IMF said.
The market impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve's expected policy tightening was among risks to Japan's outlook, Ranil Salgado, the IMF's Japan mission chief, told a briefing on Friday.

""You'll likely to see wider interest rate differentials between the U.S. and Japan, which could put downward pressure on yen,"" Salgado said.
But heightened market volatility could have the reverse effect of pushing up the yen if investors hoard the currency as a safe haven against risk, he added. ""Those are risks, something to watch.""

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida wants to relax quarterly disclosure requirements for companies as part of his pledge to forge a ""new capitalism"", but implementation is expected to take years, complicating the outlook for one of his key promises.
Quarterly disclosures were made mandatory for firms in 2008 in a move to bring Japan's rules more in line with those of the United States, boosting the Tokyo market's appeal for overseas investors.
The report summary would lay out points that might need to be debated in more detail, setting the stage for a deeper discussion on the quarterly disclosure requirements at the panel, which is overseen by the Financial Services Agency (FSA).
""The revision of quarterly disclosures should be carefully discussed,"" Suzuki told reporters after a cabinet meeting.

""Under the new capitalism (plan) of the Kishida government, we think it's important for firms to emphasise long-term growth rather than short-term profitability and to manage benefits of not only shareholders but of various stakeholders, such as workers,"" Suzuki said.
The earliest the government can submit legislation to parliament to change the quarterly disclosure requirements will be in 2023, and the earliest date new rules can be applied is 2024, government officials told Reuters last October.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina is facing deadlines for nearly $1.1 billion in debt repayments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by Tuesday amid uncertainty over whether the South American country will pay and tense talks to revamp around $40 billion in loans.
The grains-producing country, which has been battling currency and debt crises for years, is due to pay back $730 million to the IMF on Friday and another $365 million on Tuesday though officials have not confirmed plans to pay.
""What is going to happen, we will know in the next few hours,"" presidential spokeswoman Gabriela Cerruti told a news conference on Thursday. She added: ""Argentina's government is willing to reach an agreement to pay in a sustainable manner.""
Cabinet Chief Juan Manzur said there was ""political decisiveness and eagerness to pay"" the IMF, according to official news outlet Telam. 
The IMF did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the looming payments.
Argentina's talks with the IMF to revamp a failed 2018 loan https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/argentinas-strategy-toward-imf-deal-hits-wall-doubt-2022-01-10 have stumbled in recent months over differences over how quickly the country should reduce its fiscal deficit as part of a medium-term economic plan.
That has hit sovereign bond prices, some of which have tumbled to below 30 cents on the dollar. More hard-left politicians within the ruling Peronist coalition have also started hardening their rhetoric against the IMF.
On Thursday, hundreds of people took to the streets of Buenos Aires to protest against the IMF. Many blame the organization for austerity measures that worsened a major economic crisis in 2001/02 which plunged scores of Argentines into poverty.
""What we are proposing is not only to stop paying the debt and break with the IMF, but to restructure the entire economy according to the needs of the majority,"" said Celeste Fierro as she marched in the city outside the central bank building.
Fierro, like others in the march, said the country should not pay back its IMF debts: ""We believe in ... breaking with the IMF and ignoring this debt, which is a scam.""
Vilma Ripol, another marcher, said the payments should be suspended and that Congress should investigate the debt to avoid a repeat of the 2001 economic crisis.

""It was a disaster in 2001 that took us years to recover and we had paid,"" she said. ""We kept paying and our society kept on going down. Enough already.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan should consider further steps to make its ultra-easy monetary policy more sustainable, such as steepening the yield curve by targeting a shorter maturity than the current 10-year yield, an International Monetary Fund executive said.
Such a move would be on top of steps the central bank took in March last year to mitigate the side-effects of prolonged easing, such as allowing 10-year yields to move more widely around its 0% target.
The BOJ must clearly communicate that the move would be aimed at enhancing the effect of its ultra-easy policy, not at withdrawing stimulus, said Odd Per Brekk, deputy director of the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department.
""Unlike in other advanced economies, we see inflation in Japan over the next few years moving in the 1% range, which is below the BOJ's target,"" he said.
""This means that the BOJ should continue its accommodative monetary policy stance,"" he told Reuters in an interview conducted on Thursday.
Under yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ guides short-term interest rates at -0.1% and the 10-year bond yield around 0% via huge asset buying to fire up inflation to its 2% target.
While low borrowing costs have helped companies, they have been criticised for crushing the margin financial institutions earn from lending and draining bond market liquidity
""We think YCC has been successful. It has worked well. But we have also seen some adverse side-effects on the financial sector,"" Brekk said.
Building on the steps taken in March, the BOJ could make its stimulus programme more effective by shifting the target to a shorter duration than the current 10-year yield, he said.
""Now is not the time to do this. It's something to consider if you need to strengthen policy or respond to shocks"" by ramping up stimulus, Brekk said.
While the recent rise in food and energy costs will prove temporary, Japan will see inflation momentum build up this year as consumption rebounds and allows companies to pass on some of the higher costs to households, he said.

But inflation will remain short of the BOJ's 2% goal in the medium term, requiring the bank to maintain current stimulus.
""To get inflation sustainably to the 2% target requires a broader policy strategy"" consisting not just of monetary stimulus but flexible fiscal policy and measures to boost Japan's potential growth, Brekk said.

6) AUSTRALIA
With the hottest consumer inflation since 2014 and strongest labour market since 2008, the Reserve Bank of Australia will face immense pressure at next week's meeting to abandon its dovish stance. 
It has already moved toward unwinding pandemic stimulus by ditching an ultra-low bond yield target and has opened the door for a 2023 rate hike, versus a previous forecast of 2024.
But while Governor Philip Lowe has said a 2022 rate hike is unlikely a Reuters poll of analysts forecast the RBA to hike rates in November and end QE next week.
7) SWEDEN 
Sweden has ended pandemic-era lending facilities but has pencilled in a rate hike only for late 2024.
Headline inflation in December was 4.1% versus the 2% target. The December surge was due mainly to electricity prices and overall price pressures remain modest, central bank Governor Stefan Ingves said earlier this month.

The European Central Bank is on a very different path to most peers.
It said last month it would end its 1.85 trillion euro pandemic emergency asset-buying scheme by end-March.
While inflation is at a record high 5%, the ECB expects inflation to retreat and says a rate rise this year is unlikely. However, it has promised copious support via its long-running Asset Purchase Programme and signalled a very gradual exit from years of ultra-easy policy.

9) JAPAN
The Bank of Japan has taken tentative steps to unwind stimulus, pledging to slow purchases of corporate bonds and commercial paper to pre-pandemic levels from April. 
This month, it raised inflation forecasts but quashed speculation it may soon signal a shift in its decade-old stimulus experiment, saying it was in no rush to change ultra-loose monetary policy.

The Swiss National Bank remains at the dovish end of the central bank spectrum, despite higher inflation and says its loose stance was appropriate. 
However, faced with a property boom, it told lenders this week to hold additional capital amounting to 2.5% of risk-weighted positions that are backed by residential real estate.

""In Amsterdam as in all other major cities around Europe, there's enormous growth in all these different companies that deliver your groceries within 10 minutes,"" said a spokesperson for city councillor Marieke van Doornick, who proposed the ban. 
However, ""with those companies there are also coming a growing number of complaints from the direct neighbourhood.""
The spokesperson cited noise and scooter traffic arriving and leaving buildings, and the appearance of the stores, which are used for delivery only and not open to the public - and often have darkened windows to signal that.
The spokesperson said the city aimed to agree rules over the coming year that would determine where dark stores are allowed.
As of Jan. 14, there were 31 such stores in operation, almost all of which opened during the COVID-19 pandemic, the spokesperson said, adding: ""There are probably more, it's going really fast.""
Flink, with 10 dark stores in Amsterdam, said the company had planned to open more and was disappointed by the decision.
""We have fantastic feedback from our customers,"" it said in a statement, adding that in addition to grocery delivery it also distributed products made by local businesses.
Berlin-based Gorillas said in a reaction that it had been in talks with the city council and was surprised and disappointed by the decision.
""In just a year of operations in Amsterdam, we have built meaningful relationships with local partners and customers and created hundreds of economic opportunities,"" it said. 

Turkey's Getir said the decision ""undeniably has a large impact on our employees and the large number of customers who use our service on a daily basis.""
It said it was still evaluating the decision and how to react.

In a research note, the investment bank's economists predicted the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio should decline 7 percentage points in 2022, after reaching the highest level since World War Two during the pandemic. Real growth will contribute about 6 percentage points and inflation a similar percentage, offset by interest expenses and primary deficit spending.
""Our expectation for fiscal spending in 2022 and 2023 are much more moderate, especially after the failure of the large-scale Build Back Better spending program to pass last year. For 2022, we expect a deficit of 4.1%, and 4.0% for 2023, closely in line with the pre-Covid decade average,"" the note said. 
The economists said interest rate levels and net interest expenses are more important in determining the state of public finances than debt-to-GDP. Interest rates are expected to stay relatively low even if the Federal Reserve tightening, expected to start in March, shifts them marginally higher.

The U.S. Commerce Department said Thursday that the economy notched its strongest growth in nearly four decades in 2021 after the government pumped trillions of dollars in COVID-19 relief. 
The economy grew 5.7% in 2021, the strongest since 1984, the government said in a report showing GDP increased at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, following the third quarter's 2.3% pace. Growth is 3.1% above its pre-pandemic level.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada's decision to delay a rate hike for five more weeks will add fuel to Canada's scorching housing market as buyers scramble to clinch deals before borrowing costs rise, realtors said.
The Bank of Canada held its overnight rate at a record low 0.25% on Wednesday, but warned multiple increases would be coming soon. The U.S. Federal Reserve separately also said it would start hiking soon.
""Any hint of interest rate increases, any hint that it's about to go up, makes people nervous,"" said Lisa Bednarski, a Toronto real estate agent. ""They want to buy before their buying power diminishes.""
Canada's housing market has been on tear throughout much of the pandemic, with prices up 39% nationwide from February 2020 to December 2021. In November and December alone, home prices jumped 4.5%, compared with a 3.7% gain in all of 2019. 
(Graphic: Canadian housing prices, https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-CENBANK/HOUSING2/zjpqkakagpx/chart.png) 
Forecasts are mixed for 2022, with the Royal Bank of Canada seeing home prices up 3% this year and brokerage Royal LePage forecasting a 10.5% gain.
While the early rush was mostly end users seeking out larger properties with space for offices, gyms and living, by mid-2021 investors had taken hold of the market, according to agents. A recent Bank of Canada study found investors now account for more than 20% of home purchases.
Supply, meanwhile, has reached historic lows, realtors say. 
With few options on the market, many end users are holding back - especially current owners who already have a foothold in the market, said real estate agent Peter Kiriazopoulos. 
Investors are another story.
""My investor clients - they're not too picky,"" said Kiriazopoulos, who sells in Toronto's suburbs. ""They just want to move so they can close at a lower interest rate.""
Right now, a typical Toronto area home may have 15 buyers putting in offers. A hike would have cut that by a third, said mortgage broker Ron Butler. Instead, all those bidders will be ready with their best offer for another five weeks, he said. 
""It is a little sprinkle of lighter fluid,"" said Butler. “In the psychology of the public, it’s a moment of relief.”
(Graphic: Canada's home price changes vs interest rates, https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-CENBANK/HOUSING/zgpomjmjrpd/chart.png) 
The Bank of Canada acknowledged low interest rates play a role in home-price escalation, along with increased investor interest, but suggested the solution was outside their policy mandate.
""The bank's view is that the most important thing that will restore balance to the housing market in Canada is an increase in supply,"" Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers (NYSE:ROG) told reporters on Wednesday. ""Supply has not kept pace with demand.""
But some economists disagree. Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics with Scotiabank, expects prices to surge again over the next few weeks until the Bank hikes, likely on March 2.

""The Bank of Canada seems to be dramatically downplaying the role of easy money as a contributor to hot housing markets,"" Holt said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Thursday threw out the convictions of two former  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) traders for rigging Libor, once among the world's most important financial benchmarks, and ordered acquittals for both men.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan found a lack of evidence that Matthew Connolly and Gavin Black caused Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) to make false Libor submissions.
Connolly, from Basking Ridge, New Jersey, had led Deutsche Bank's pool trading desk in New York, while Black worked on the bank's money market and derivatives desk in London.
Both were convicted of wire fraud and conspiracy in October 2018.
Connolly was sentenced https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutsche-bank-libor-crime/ex-deutsche-bank-traders-avoid-prison-time-for-libor-scheme-idUSKBN1X32EH to six months of home confinement and ordered to pay a $100,000 fine, while Black received nine months of home confinement and a $300,000 fine. Federal prosecutors had sought ""substantial"" prison time for both.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""We are elated that Matt Connolly has been fully exonerated in this contrived case,"" said Kenneth Breen, a partner at Paul Hastings.
Black's lawyer Seth Levine, a partner at Levine Lee, was ""deeply appreciative"" of the outcome. ""Mr. Black did his job, as he has lived his life, with honor and honesty,"" Levine said.
Before being phased out this month, Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, had underpinned hundreds of trillions of dollars of financial products including credit cards, mortgages and other loans. Libor had once been calculated based on submissions from 16 banks, including Deutsche Bank.
Prosecutors said Connolly directed subordinates to arrange false submissions consistent with his traders' interests, while Black encouraged false submissions to benefit his own derivative trading. The alleged conspiracy ran from 2004 to 2011.
Libor-rigging investigations resulted in about $9 billion of fines worldwide for banks, including $2.5 billion for Deutsche Bank https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutschebank-libor-settlement/deutsche-bank-fined-record-2-5-billion-over-rate-rigging-idUSKBN0NE12U20150423 in 2015.

Connolly and Black's trial was the second in the United States of traders accused of rigging Libor for their own benefit. The convictions in 2015 of two former London-based Rabobank traders were also thrown out https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-rabobank-libor/u-s-appeals-court-voids-libor-convictions-of-ex-rabobank-traders-idUKKBN1A41N9 on appeal.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Miguel Alejo does not know how inflation is measured or what makes a recession. But at the Mexico City food market where he has worked for over 40 years, he knows when business is struggling.
Like many colleagues working stalls in the open market in a middle-class neighborhood in the west of the city, the vegetable vendor complains bitterly of poor sales and increases in the price of goods he makes a living from.
""It's become very tough for us here,"" the 62-year-old said, as he sold broccoli, spinach and lettuce. ""We're not bringing in much because things really aren't selling like they used to.""
""The economy has really gone down,"" he added, describing December sales as ""dead"" and well below pre-pandemic levels.
Economic growth in the country of over 126 million people ground to a near standstill during the second half of 2021.
On Monday, the national statistics agency is due to publish a preliminary estimate for fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP). If the figure is negative, Mexico will likely have entered a technical recession.
Brokerage Monex reported recently that data suggested the economy had entered a ""recessionary dynamic"" as it clawed back ground after the pandemic led to a GDP contraction of 8.5% in 2020.
Some forecasters now believe the economy may not even have grown 5% last year, and an increasing number expect GDP to have gone backwards in the final quarter.
Jonathan Heath, a board member of Mexico's central bank, said last week that if there are no revisions to prior quarters, GDP could have shrunk 0.5% quarter-on-quarter.
GDP had gone negative even before the pandemic began, and worries are growing that the $1.3 trillion economy could be smaller when President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's six-year term ends than it was when he took office in December 2018.
U.S. economic growth in 2021 outpaced that of Mexico, where the tepid economy could encourage more people to migrate and try their luck in the United States.
STAGFLATION
Lopez Obrador has prioritized assisting Mexico's poorest, and analysts said his welfare schemes have helped offset the pandemic's impact at the lower end of the spectrum.
But he has also unsettled investors, accusing companies of conspiring with past governments to bilk taxpayers and trying to renegotiate their contracts. Gross fixed investment levels are about 16% lower than when he was elected in July 2018.
This month, Lopez Obrador said the worst of the pandemic has passed and the economy was on the right track. But plenty of Mexicans are not convinced.
""It makes me angry because it's not true, that's why (Lopez Obrador) needs to go out and be with the people so they realize how things really are, not just the statistics and the data that they give him,"" said Noemi Santiago, a 59-year-old Mexico City homemaker. ""The economy is very slow.""
Also, prices are rising fast. Headline inflation was 7.13% in the first half of January. The core index of inflation, which strips out some volatile items, surged above 6%, the highest in two decades.

""Everything is very expensive and there's hardly any profit margin,"" 59-year-old fruit vendor Felix Rodriguez said in the market. ""There isn't much money circulating, I don't exactly know why, but we're feeling it here.""
Gabriela Siller, an economist at Grupo Financiero BASE, said economic stagnation and high inflation was a recipe for a feared combination: stagflation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. banks will enjoy stronger growth this year from their ""bread-and-butter"" business of taking deposits and lending money as the U.S. economy expands and the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates for the first time in three years.
The Fed's move could bring an end to the low interest-rate environment which banks have faced for most of the past decade and, particularly, through the COVID-19 pandemic.
Net interest income, the difference between what banks earn from lending and pay out on deposits and other funds, declined during the pandemic due to interest rate cuts and a drop in borrowing. But this is about to change in 2022.
The Fed on Wednesday signaled it is likely to raise U.S. interest rates in March. Federal funds futures have priced in another three rate hikes later in the year. 
""Banks that, for the last ten years, were not able to enjoy a steady yield curve are going to get it,"" said Ken Leon, research director at CFRA Research, referring to the line that shows the interest rates buyers of government debt require to lend over increasing periods of time.
""It's likely to provide significant growth in net income interest revenues in 2022.""
Net interest income accounted for 60% of revenue in the fourth quarter for the median bank among the biggest two dozen in the United States, said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Jason Goldberg. That was the lowest proportion in six years and down from 66% three years ago, before the pandemic and subsequent Fed rate cuts.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) told analysts earlier this month that net interest income from its businesses beyond securities markets could increase to $50 billion in 2022 from $44.5 billion last year, a 12% increase.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said its net interest income could rise by 8%.
Some banks will benefit more than others depending on their ability to retain low-cost deposits and use them to lend and invest in higher-yielding securities. Banks with portfolios weighted toward floating-rate loans will benefit more.
""Some banks' balance sheets are just more rate sensitive,"" said Goldberg, who believes increases in net interest income will continue into 2023.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) executives were not as specific in their outlook when the bank reported earnings. But they said they expected the year to bring ""robust growth"" in net interest income, starting with ""a couple of hundred million"" dollars more in the first quarter on top of its $11.4 billion in the fourth quarter.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) executives said they would not provide estimates on net interest income until an ""Investor Day"" on March 2. Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason, however, said that the bank expects support for net interest income from higher global interest rates and from putting more of its cash into loans and securities.
Executives said the changing outlook for interest rates will make forecasting net interest income uncertain. But other factors also support an increase.
JPMorgan said changes in rates account for only about one-third of the increase it expects in net interest income. The bulk of the rise should come from loan growth, it said.
Wells Fargo said that higher rates account for almost two-thirds of the increase it expects with loan growth and balance sheet changes supplying the rest.
With or without higher rates from the Fed, net interest income will increase for large banks, analyst Ken Usdin of Jefferies said in a report.
Banks are expecting to lend more to businesses, particularly those who want to build inventories after losing sales to supply chain interruptions.

JPMorgan and Citigroup also said they expect more interest income from credit card users who resume incurring interest charges instead of paying down their balances as they have done in the pandemic.
So far, executives have said they do not expect more than modest hikes in deposit rates.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Strategists at the world's top investment banks scrambled to change their Federal Reserve rate calls on Thursday after policymakers emphasised at a policy meeting that it would tighten policy to clamp down on inflation.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it was likely to hike interest rates in March and reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases that month, surprising investors who had already braced for as many as four rate hikes until the end of the year. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategists now expect policymakers to raise interest rates at each meeting from March to June and then revert to a quarterly tightening cycle from September totaling five rate hikes this year. 
Analysts at Nomura, Japan's biggest brokerage and investment bank, said they expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike its benchmark rate by 50 basis points (bps) in March.
Analysts at TD Securities, meanwhile, said they now expect four rate increases of 25 basis points, rather than three. They are also looking for the Fed to begin reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet in May, compared to a previous forecast calling for the central bank to do so in September.
At the conclusion of Wednesday’s meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said a decision would be made in coming months on when to start shrinking the central bank's government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) expects as much as six 25 bps hikes in 2022 from four earlier, and expects the fed funds target range at 2.25-2.50% at end-2023, 25 bps higher than a previous forecast.
""Our new base case for six hikes this year poses challenges to our bullish outlook for US equities,"" the French bank's strategists said in a note. 
Powell did not rule out such a move when asked about it after Wednesday's Fed meeting. 
""He repeatedly appeared to differentiate the upcoming hiking cycle from the last time the Fed normalised its policy rate at a roughly quarterly pace,"" Nomura's analysts said in a note.
""We now expect a 50 bp rate hike at the March (Fed) meeting, followed by three consecutive 25 bp hikes in May, June and July,"" they said, adding that another 25 bp hike was expected in December. 
Fed funds futures, which track short-term rate expectations, are now pricing nearly five rate increases of 25 bps each this year, up from four expected hikes before Powell's news conference.

Some major investment banks like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and HSBC are sticking with their rate forecasts of four and three rate hikes respectively, betting the recent selloff in markets will lead to a tightening in financial conditions.
""The interplay of Fed policy, financial conditions, and the growth outlook could make it hard for the Fed to actually deliver consecutive hikes, even if they feel like a natural forecast along the way,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs said.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Swiss banks have criticised planned new measures designed to cool the country's red hot property market, saying the steps were unnecessary and would do nothing to slow rising house prices.
The government said on Wednesday that from October, lenders must increase their cushion against home lending risks, sounding the alarm over one of Europe's most expensive housing markets, where total mortgage lending has swollen to more than $1 trillion.
The plan was one of the first in Europe to cool housing markets that have been booming in recent years because of rock bottom interest rates.
The Swiss Banking Association (SBA), which represents around 300 banks in Switzerland including heavyweights UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), opposed the obligation for banks to hold more capital against home loans.
The change distorted competition because it applied only to banks and not pension funds and insurers, which are gaining an increased share of the mortgage market, the SBA said.
""Ultimately, we don't think it's either necessary or effective,"" said Oliver Buschan, a member of the SBA's executive board. ""People could simply go elsewhere for their loans.
""Changing the balance sheets of the banks is not going to cure the situation, if it needs curing,"" he told Reuters, adding that house prices were rising because of fundamental factors like a lack of space and population growth.
""We do not consider this a bubble,"" he said.
House prices have increased by more than 80% over the past 15 years, according to the Swiss National Bank. The median price for a house in Zurich has risen to 2.6 million Swiss francs ($2.79 million), while the explosion in lending has triggered fears about a damaging collapse if interest rates increased.
Switzerland experienced its last property bubble and collapse in the 1990s, when house prices plunged after rising strongly during the late 1980s.
The SBA cited the average loan to value in Switzerland as 60%.
""The whole market would have to collapse by 40% for there to be a problem with the collateralisation, and that is just not going to happen, given the fundamentals,"" Buschan said.
Credit Suisse's head of Real Estate Economics was also sceptical, saying the increased capital requirement would increase the costs only minimally for lenders and by a hardly noticeable amount for borrowers.
""It can neither eliminate nor significantly influence the causes of the strong price increases on the Swiss real estate market,"" said Fredy Hasenmaile. 
""Accordingly, I do not expect any weakening of the upward price trend on the Swiss real estate market as a result of the measure.""
Elsewhere in Europe, Germany's financial regulator wants to see banks hold a bigger crisis cushion to absorb losses, while France tightened mortgage standards last year to reduce lending.

Sweden's financial watchdog has ordered banks to hold more capital from September to protect them against future crises, citing the upswing in housing prices and household debts.

643,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 10:06AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes fell for a second straight month in December amid record low inventory.
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Thursday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, dropped 3.8% last month to 117.7. Pending home sales fell in all four regions.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts, which become sales after a month or two, dipping 0.2%. Pending home sales decreased 6.9% in December on a year-on-year basis.
""Pending home sales faded toward the end of 2021, as a diminished housing supply offered consumers very few options,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. 
An acute shortage of previously owned homes is hampering sales. Despite rising mortgage rates, which together with high home prices are reducing affordability, demand for housing is likely to remain strong this year.
""The market will likely endure a minor reduction in sales as mortgage rates continue to edge higher,"" said Yun.

A total of 6.12 million previously owned homes were sold in 2021, the most since 2006 and up 8.5% from 2020.

Data from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which works with the world's biggest and most powerful hedge funds, show that global hedge funds were off 3.1% in the first three weeks of January, according to a source with direct knowledge of the research. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. 
For U.S. based funds that pick stocks, the picture was bleaker with the average fund off 5.9%, according to the data which tracked returns in the first three weeks of the month and was released to clients on Tuesday.
But hedge funds still outperformed the broader stock market S&P 500 Index which was off 7.4% during the first three weeks.
Since then, market losses have grown, with the S&P now down 8.7%. Data from Hedge Fund Research show the HFRX Equity Hedge Index down 3.34% through the end of Tuesday.
Markets have been on edge awaiting more details on when the Fed will raise rates and how the Russia-Ukraine tensions will play out.
This year's turmoil comes after steady stock market gains last year when the S&P 500 index was fueled by advances in technology stocks and gained 27%.
""For a while investing in technology stocks was a great trade where you made easy profits,"" said Max Gokhman, chief investment officer at hedge fund Alpha TrAI. ""But now the Federal Reserve is pulling away the money and sending a clear messages that they won't be fueling the stock market boom anymore."" 
But investors caution that early losses could be wiped away by nimble hedge funds if they begin betting that some stocks will go down and carefully select ones they think will go up.

Billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman may be among the first to have pounced on a name that sold off dramatically when he said on Wednesday that he bought a stake in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) worth more than $1 billion after the stock was pummelled. His fund lost 13.8% through Jan. 25, but he has been known to make well-timed bets that boost year end returns. 
""Theoretically this year could be a stock pickers market,"" Gokhman said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A flurry of rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve will complicate life for the European Central Bank over the coming year, even if their policymakers appear unconcerned for now to be going their separate ways.
The Fed on Wednesday signalled a quick sequence of rate hikes to bring down inflation, accelerating its divergence from an ECB that continues to pledge copious stimulus this year and essentially rule out any hike until 2023.
Fundamentals back the ECB's stance. European inflation is lower, wage pressures are still muted and employment has yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels, all suggesting that high inflation, a function of soaring energy prices, will indeed pass, as now predicted.
The problem lies with the increased aggressiveness of the Fed's stance because ""nimble"" action, as outlined by Chair Jerome Powell, suggests the U.S. central bank is also going complete its tightening cycle quicker than in the past, leaving the ECB with a shorter time to act. 
""If the Fed finishes hiking in 2023, then history suggests they'll be thinking about cutting by 2024,"" Danske Bank Chief Strategist Piet Haines Christiansen said. 
""That leaves the ECB a very narrow window to act because I just can't see the ECB tightening while the Fed is on hold or preparing for an easing cycle."" 
While independent, the ECB has tended to follow the Fed with a small lag and the handful of rate hikes it has made out of sync with its U.S. counterpart, including moves in 2008 and 2011 moves, are now widely viewed as policy mistakes. 
Even under a hawkish scenario, the ECB's first hike would not come before the spring of 2023, which would leave it time for around two increases before the Fed finishes, analysts say. 
PAUSES AND ESCAPE CLAUSES
The ECB could move faster but, having missed its inflation target for a decade and carrying a legacy of misguided rate hikes, the ECB seems almost certain to err on the side of caution, particularly with a dovish majority on its rate-setting Governing Council.
Indeed, analysts only see timid moves with pauses and escape clauses, suggesting that the ECB will not only act with a big lag, its moves will also be more modest.
This represents such a big disconnect with the Fed that markets appear reluctant to place much faith in the ECB's rates outlook.
Despite an explicit statement by ECB chief Christine Lagarde that any move this year is ""very unlikely"", investors have priced in 20 basis points of hikes before 2023.
That leaves the bank with a tricky communications challenge for its Feb 3 policy meeting. 
To protect its credibility, Lagarde cannot even entertain the idea of a hike this year, but pushing back too hard would force her to tie her hands even more, a risky exercise given a stubbornly volatile and uncertain inflation environment.
""Through 2022, despite all the pressure they'll face from high inflation to politics, they'll keep on stressing the sequencing of their moves and by extension that pushes back the hike to next year,"" Pictet Wealth Management strategist Frederik Ducrozet said. 
The ECB's guidance now stipulates that rates will only go up ""shortly after"" the end of bond purchases that are currently set to run at least into the fourth quarter and in any case for as long as necessary.
""The problem is 2023, as markets will price in the end of bond buys by then, even when big supply will be coming from the likes of Italy,"" Ducrozet said. ""It's just difficult to see ECB normalisation without bond market volatility.""

That could in turn make the ECB hesitant, fearful that soaring debt costs could derail growth. 
If the ECB fails to seize the opportunity to normalise policy, rates will remain deep in negative territory, leaving it with little room for easing during the next downturn and adding weight to the criticism that ultra-easy policy has become the norm, not the exception.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Any tightening of western sanctions on an already stressed Russian domestic bond market would make borrowing more expensive for the government and cause significant short-term volatility, a deputy finance minister said. 
But a strong domestic investor base means the market, where a politically driven selloff has sent benchmark rouble yields to six-year highs, would weather tougher curbs, Timur Maksimov told Reuters in an interview, adding that the ministry's 2022 issuance plans remained on track.
Russia has massed around 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border while denying it plans to invade https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-urges-de-escalation-over-ukraine-offers-russia-diplomatic-path-2022-01-27. If it does, western countries have threatened new financial and economic sanctions.
Under existing sanctions, U.S. investors are banned from buying new OFZ bonds, and U.S. banks from buying sovereign Eurobonds directly from Russia.
U.S. officials have floated the possibility of extending the bans to cover secondary market trading of new issues of both instruments. 
On Tuesday, with 10-year yields at their highest since 2016, the finance ministry cancelled scheduled OFZ auctions for a second week running. 
Auctions will resume once the market ""normalises"", Maksimov said, adding that its current volatility was driven by politics rather than economics and ""such a situation cannot stay forever."" 
With a record-high current account surplus of $120 billion last year, enough gold and forex reserves to cover two years of imports or Russia's entire external debt, officials say the economy is in a good shape to withstand shocks. 
Maksimov said the market would ride out disruption caused if foreign investors sold all their OFZs, equivalent to just under a fifth of total holdings.
""It (new sanctions) will cause serious short-term volatility, but it will fundamentally change nothing. Because even if we wash 19% out of the portfolio, we still have 80% (held by domestic investors),"" he said.
The finance ministry still plans to raise 3.3 trillion roubles ($41.5 billion) in OFZ bonds this year, re-introducing bonds with floating-rate coupons in addition to its main fixed-coupon OFZs, he said. 
The ministry raised a record 5.3 trillion roubles in OFZ bonds in 2020, of which over 3 trillion was secured by 'floaters', which market players dominated by Russia's biggest banks favour. 
Last year, borrowing halved to 2.6 trillion roubles, with no 'floaters' issued.

When re-introduced, floating-rate bonds will not exceed 25% of the total OFZ stock in the medium term, Maksimov said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden said on Thursday 14.5 million Americans have signed up for health insurance since Nov. 1, attributing the progress to the passage of his pandemic relief package and the re-opening of an online health insurance marketplace last year.
The data includes more than 10 million who enrolled through a U.S government website HealthCare.gov during an open enrollment period, Biden said in a statement. He said the numbers were the ""highest ever produced"" during such an event.
The president also said one in seven uninsured Americans got covered between the end of 2020 and September 2021, with lower-income Americans gaining coverage at the highest rate, citing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

""This did not happen by accident,"" Biden said. He said his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan did more to lower costs and expand health care access for Americans than any action since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
Biden also said the opportunity to enroll for health insurance has been extended through Jan. 31 for Americans living in California, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington, DC — places with their own health insurance marketplaces.

Investing.com -- Global markets steady after initially falling in response to the Federal Reserve's press conference on Wednesday. U.S. fourth-quarter GDP and weekly jobless claims numbers are due, as the Covid-19 virus claims its biggest-ever daily death toll in the U.S. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) posts a record profit for 2021 but is delaying new product launches again. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings are out after the closing bell. And oil prices hit fresh seven-year highs as tensions continue to bubble over Ukraine. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 27th January.
1. Bond yields, dollar surge in response to Fed
The dollar and U.S. Treasury bond yields hit new highs for the year after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s hinted at Wednesday’s press conference that the central bank will tighten monetary policy more quickly this year than previously assumed.
Short-term interest rate futures now imply a 20% risk that the first rate hike – expected in March – will be 50 basis points rather than the usual 25.
Global markets steadied overnight after their initial shock. However, that steadiness will be tested by U.S. economic data at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), when fourth-quarter GDP numbers are due. Last week’s jobless claims numbers, meanwhile, will show whether the current wave of Omicron-wave Covid-19 is still weighing on the labor market. Data out on Wednesday showed a new record high of 2,100 U.S. deaths in a day from the disease.
2. Tesla posts record profit, but delays new product launches
Tesla posted a record profit of $5.5 billion last year, after a fourth quarter that came in around 10% above analysts’ forecasts.
Automotive gross margin, which measures the company’s underlying profit from making cars rather than booking emissions credits, rose to 29.3% from 25.6%, while its net margin was over 10%.
However, the market had priced that much in and focused instead on the news that the company has again postponed the launch of new models, CEO Elon Musk saying that it wouldn’t be able to reliably source components for them this year.
3. Stocks set to open mixed; Intel guidance disappoints 
U.S. stocks are set to open mixed later as the market recovers from Powell’s seemingly hawkish comments.
By 6:30 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 8 points, effectively flat, but S&P 500 futures were up 0.1% and NASDAQ 100 futures were up 0.3%.
Other stocks likely to be in focus later include Intel  (NASDAQ:INTC), whose disappointing profit guidance for the coming quarter overshadowed a modest beat for the last quarter of 2021, while software company SAP (NYSE:SAP) had the same problem in German trading, falling 6.1% to a nine-month low.
On the upside, chipmaker Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) is set to open higher after smashing expectations with its fourth-quarter numbers and – more importantly – getting regulatory approval in China for its deal to sell itself to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
4. Apple earnings set to rise over 12% 
It’s another heavy day for earnings ahead, with Apple set to report after the closing bell.
Analysts expect earnings in the key holiday quarter to have risen 12% from a year ago to $1.89, which would leave the stock trading at 31 times its trailing 12-month earnings, a stark reminder of how stretched valuations are even for mature, cash-generative technology companies.
Also reporting on Thursday are the two payments giants Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Altria (NYSE:MO), Northrop-Grumman, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and Dow.
5. Oil retreats from fresh 7-year highs as Ukraine tensions continue
Crude oil futures hit fresh seven-year highs, before retreating a little, as concerns over OPEC+ supply, while fears of further disruptions in the case of a Russian attack on Ukraine, continued to build in a significant geopolitical risk premium.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was quoted by newswires as saying that Russia had received “no positive response” from the U.S. in its written proposals on how to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine. However, Russian newswires also reported that Russian troops are set to leave Belarus after completing drills there, easing fears that they may use it as a springboard for an invasion of Ukraine from the north.
By 6:20 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 0.1% at $87.41 a barrel, while Brent futures, which hit $90 overnight, were up 0.1% at $88.82.",,,,,

(Reuters) -The watchword the last time Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell oversaw a rate-hiking cycle was ""gradual."" 
This time will be different.
""We are going to need to be, as I’ve mentioned, nimble about this. The economy is quite different this time,"" Powell said on Wednesday following the Fed's January policy-setting meeting at which it signaled its first interest rate hikes of the COVID-19 era would likely start in March. And from there on, it's pretty much anyone's guess.
""Powell put a kibosh on any type of 'measured/gradual' guidance, because the economic outlook is much too uncertain,"" Jefferies economists Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons wrote in a note titled: ""FOMC Signals A Guidance-Light Tightening Cycle."" 
For starters, inflation is far higher and the economy and labor markets are much stronger than when the Fed undertook its last set of rate rises in the previous decade, Powell said. 
Then, from December 2015 to 2018, the Fed never left less than three months between rate hikes, and never raised the target rate more than a quarter-of-a-percentage-point at a time. 
The policy path, Powell and other Fed policymakers promised repeatedly during that period, would be gradual. And once the Fed began shrinking its balance sheet to further tighten policy, two years after it began raising rates, it promised to do so at the pace that paint dries. 
Today, inflation is near a 40-year high and the unemployment rate, at 3.9%, is within touching distance of the Fed's goal of maximum employment. 
""As we work our way through this, meeting by meeting, we are aware that this a very different expansion...Those differences are likely to be reflected in the policy that we implement,"" said Powell, who used the word ""nimble"" at least three times. 
Powell didn't detail exactly what those differences would be, and in fact, asked directly if the Fed could be expected to raise rates in bigger intervals or was otherwise departing from its 'gradual' script, said policymakers hadn't yet broached those questions. 
""We will begin to address them as we move into the March meeting and meetings after that,"" he said. ""We fully appreciate that this is a different situation.""
In December Fed policymakers had signaled they could raise rates three times this year, but since then the inflation picture has, if anything, deteriorated, Powell said. 
On the possibility of more than four rate hikes this year, ""he didn’t say they wouldn’t,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, ""which indicates a flexibility to raise rates much more quickly (if necessary) than anyone was expecting.”
Others were more succinct, ""Today the Fed interest rate rocket left the hangar,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, U.S. chief economist at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings.
""No more Mr Nice Guy,"" wrote Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
Interest rate futures markets have bought fully into a faster trajectory, with the pricing there now reflecting better than even odds of five hikes of a quarter point each this year.
Powell repeatedly emphasized that the Fed's primary job now was to bring down inflation closer to its 2% goal. Improving, if far from fully fixed, supply chains would help, as would the lack of any new fiscal stimulus in the works. 

But rather than assuage concerns that the Fed might become quite aggressive as it seeks to tamp down inflation, Powell pointed to the different reality this time.
""What we need here is another long expansion...that's going to require price stability. That's going to require the Fed to tighten interest rate policy and do our part in getting inflation back down to our 2% goal,"" Powell said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China is counting on revived infrastructure spending to support its slowing economy, but controls over local government debt risks and falling investment returns could hamper the renewed push, policy insiders and economists said.
As pressure grows from a deepening property market slump and the country's strict zero-COVID policy, Chinese leaders are once again turning to infrastructure to drive growth, after a year when they focused on curbing debt and housing risks.
Stability trumps everything ahead of a key once-in-five-years Communist Party congress later this year, with policymakers looking to ward off a sharper slowdown in the world's second-largest economy that could undermine job creation.
At a meeting in December to chart the course for 2022, top leaders called for front loading infrastructure investment to help cushion the slowdown, which looks set to worsen in the first half. 
""We need to step up infrastructure investment and stabilize the property sector,"" Yao Jingyuan, an adviser to the cabinet, told Reuters. ""The downward pressure on the economy is big this year and the employment pressure is big."" 
This month, Premier Li Keqiang pledged faster investment in 102 key infrastructure projects, including in transportation, logistics and telecommunications as well as advanced manufacturing and high-tech, under the country's the 14th five-year plan (2021-25).
Local governments, meanwhile, have unveiled their own infrastructure projects, including in Shanghai and the provinces of Sichuan, Jiangsu，Zhejiang, Anhui and Hebei. 
However, any rush to launch such projects could reignite debt concerns, even as Beijing keeps checks on local government borrowing and requires sustainable investment returns.
In 2008-2009, a 4 trillion yuan ($629 billion) spending package largely shielded China's economy from the global financial crisis but saddled local governments and state firms with mountains of debt.
""We should try our best to reduce the side effects of economic stimulus policies,"" Yao said.
LOOKING TO NEW AREAS
China's fixed-asset investment grew 4.9% in 2021 from a year earlier, the second-weakest pace since 1996 when official data started. Growth was 2.9% in COVID-ravaged 2020.
Infrastructure investment rose just 0.4% in 2021, though analysts at HSBC predict it will expand 5% this year as Beijing looks to ease financing bottlenecks and focuses on new growth drivers.
With traditional projects like highways, railways and airports facing falling investment returns and reaching saturation point, China has been trying to expand new infrastructure focused on 5G, artificial intelligence, and data.
The finance ministry has already issued 1.46 trillion yuan in its 2022 advance quota for local government special bonds, on top of 1.2 trillion yuan in unspent bond funds from the fourth quarter of 2021 - part of the 2021 quota of 3.65 trillion yuan.
Vice Finance Minister Xu Hongcai said last month that the new quota will prioritise key projects and regions with lower debt burdens, while strictly controlling local governments’ hidden debt to fend off systemic risks.
But after decades of break-neck construction and credit-fuelled investment, new projects may offer less economic bang for the buck.
""The problem at the present is that we have enough money but don't have enough good projects,"" said a government adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
MOVING TO STABILIZE PROPERTY SECTOR
To revive construction, authorities have been trying to restore stability to the ailing property sector, marginally easing financing curbs for property developers and speeding up mortgage issuance for home buyers.
But few analysts expect a major turnaround in the sector soon, with HSBC forecasting zero to 2% growth in property investment this year.
A ramp-up in public housing developments could also be on the cards. Such spending was often deployed during past downturns.
Moreover, the central bank has started cutting interest rates and pumping more cash into the financial system to bring borrowing costs down, with further modest easing steps expected in coming months.
""We should not allow the property market to sink for a long time because it's related to many industries,"" Li Yang, former vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think tank, told a media briefing last week. 
China will be able to achieve economic growth of around 5.5% in 2022, an adviser to the cabinet said last week, a rosier prediction than markets expect.
The IMF this week forecast China's growth this year at 4.8%.
""We expect Beijing to significantly speed up investment in national infrastructure projects, though the size is unlikely to be sufficient to stabilize growth,"" Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a note. 

Lu said China should move to spur consumption by ramping up subsidies for households during the pandemic.

653,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 04:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union launched a challenge at the World Trade Organization on Thursday accusing China of discriminatory trade practices against Lithuania that it says threaten the integrity of the EU's single market.
China has downgraded diplomatic ties with Lithuania and pressured multinationals to sever links with the Baltic nation of 2.8 million people after it allowed Taiwan to open a de facto embassy in Vilnius.
China, which said the dispute was political rather than economic and labelled Lithuania's actions an attempt to ""hijack"" EU-Beijing relations, regards the self-governed island of Taiwan as its own territory.
The European Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, said in a statement that China's actions were harming exporters in Lithuania and elsewhere in the 27-nation bloc.
The curbs include a refusal to clear Lithuanian goods through Chinese customs, rejection of import applications from Lithuania and pressure on EU firms to remove Lithuanian content from supply chains when exporting to China, the Commission said.
It said China's customs statistics showed a 91% drop in trade from Lithuania to China in December as compared to the same month in 2020, with the most affected sectors being pharmaceuticals, lasers, electronics and food.
The EU executive said those actions appeared illegal under WTO rules and that attempts to resolve them bilaterally had failed.
""The EU is determined to act as one and act fast against measures...which threaten the integrity of our single market,"" EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said. Diplomatic efforts were also being pursued, he added.
China's foreign ministry said Beijing acted in accordance with WTO rules. 
WTO challenges start with a formal 60-day period of consultations between the parties. If they do not resolve the dispute, the EU can request that a WTO panel rule on the matter. The WTO typically take years to resolve disputes.
Dombrovskis told reporters the EU was trying to find an amicable solution during the consultation period.
The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry said it had produced ""strong evidence of systematic violations of international trade rules"" by China for the WTO challenge.
""Lithuania hopes China will agree to participate in the consultations with the EU and that they will be successful not only in resolving existing trade disruptions, but also in ensuring long-term sustainable solutions"", the ministry said in a statement.
Lithuanian officials are discussing whether to ask Taiwan to modify the Chinese translation of the name of its Representative Office, two sources told Reuters on Tuesday https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/lithuania-considers-modifying-taiwan-representation-name-defuse-row-with-china-2022-01-25.

Asked about this, Dombrovskis said: ""There can be diplomatic solutions, and also from the EU side we are facilitating and trying to resolve this dispute amicably.""
Taiwan said it had not received a name-change request.

China went to the WTO in 2012 to challenge anti-subsidy tariffs the United States imposed between 2008 and 2012, mainly during the term of U.S. President Barack Obama, on 22 Chinese products ranging from solar panels to steel wire.
The decade-long case involving alleged subsidies has centred on whether the United States could treat Chinese firms in which the government owns a majority stake as controlled by the state. 
The United States, which has argued that China benefits from easier treatment at the WTO while subsidising manufactured goods and dumping them on world markets, said the decision underscored the need to reform WTO rules that had been used to ""shield China’s non-market economic practices and undermine fair, market-oriented competition"".
""The deeply disappointing decision today by the WTO arbitrator reflects erroneous Appellate Body interpretations that damage the ability of WTO members to defend our workers and businesses from China’s trade-distorting subsidies,"" Adam Hodge, spokesperson for the U.S. Trade Representative's Office, said in a statement.
China had initially asked the three-person WTO panel to award it the right to impose tariffs on $2.4 billion of U.S. goods.
The actual award is dwarfed by U.S. tariffs on more than $300 billion of Chinese goods imposed by then-U.S. President Donald Trump, most of which are still in place. 
However, the ruling was another symbolic victory for Beijing at the Geneva-based trade body. In November 2019, the WTO awarded China https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-trade-us-wto-idUSKBN1XB4K0 the right to retaliatory tariffs of $3.58 billion after finding fault with the way Washington determined whether Chinese products are being dumped on the U.S. market.

""The ruling once again attested that the United States has long violated WTO rules, abused trade remedy measures and refused to fulfil its international obligations ordered by WTO or stipulated in WTO rules. This has seriously damaged the fair and just international trade environment,"" Gao Feng, spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce, said on Thursday. 
""China urges the U.S. to stop looking for excuses and immediately take action to correct its wrongdoings in trade remedy investigations against China,"" Gao told a news conference.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Atar Sandler arrived in Singapore in 2019, seizing the opportunity to live in a buzzing global city that is also a convenient base to jet off to more exotic locales nearby. 
But after two years of mask-wearing, socialising in small groups and travel restrictions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the Israeli human resources professional packed her bags for New York with her husband and children this month. 
""It's been like this for so long. And it doesn't feel like anything's going to change here,"" said Sandler. ""Life is very, very easy here. (But) is it worth it to live such a convenient life without being able to see family, friends, without being able to travel?""
Risk-averse Singapore is trying to balance its approach to living with COVID - aiming to protect people in the densely populated island from the disease while reopening its economy and borders to maintain its reputation as a hub for capital and talent. 
Companies and expatriate professionals have long been drawn to the business-friendly country, one of the safest places in the world with a high quality of living, political stability, a skilled workforce, ease of travel and low taxes. 
But COVID has prompted soul-searching among many relatively affluent expats in Singapore, where foreigners workers make up a fifth of the 5.5 million population. 
Some compare its strict COVID rules with more freedom back home or bemoan the inability to travel freely to visit family, while others joined the ""great resignation"" wave seen around the world.
For Sandler, it was ""devastating"" that giving birth to her daughter in the middle of the outbreak meant her family did not meet her second child for a year.
Singapore has continued to attract new investment and foreign talent during the pandemic, but a drop in foreigners sent its population down by the most since 1950 - 4.1% lower year-on-year as of June 2021.
That is mostly due to fewer numbers of lower-wage workers, typically employed in construction and marine services. 
But even the number of employment passholders, or professionals earning at least S$4,500 ($3,350) monthly, fell nearly 14% from 193,700 in December 2019 to 166,900 in June 2021. 
Expatriate life is, by nature, transient and many left because companies cut costs and jobs. As foreign workers departed, border restrictions meant businesses were unable to bring in replacements from overseas easily.
But for Filipina Nessa Santos, who worked in the city-state for a decade, and her British husband, the pandemic was the push they needed to move from Singapore, a tiny urban island with no hinterland, to the English countryside with their children.
""Even though our jobs were good, it was also very stressful and very demanding,"" said Santos. ""We didn't want that kind of lifestyle anymore."" 
And Chris Anderson, who moved to Singapore in 2019 from Hong Kong, has returned home to the United States to join a tech start-up. He was perturbed by rules last year that restricted foreigners from returning https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/expats-wait-anxiously-singapore-weighs-covid-19-reopening-2021-08-05 to the city-state despite being residents.
""You leave the country, you're not a priority to get back in... that's always at the back of your mind,"" Anderson said. 
TRICKLE FROM HONG KONG
Still, Singapore has been making it easier for travellers to enter and is looking more attractive to expatriates living in rival financial centre Hong Kong https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/hong-kongs-financial-sector-faces-talent-crunch-expats-head-exit-2022-01-23, which has far stiffer rules due to its zero-COVID strategy.
There has been a ""trickle"" of movement from Hong Kong https://www.ft.com/content/a2f645e8-d093-4d93-94fb-23f3cb690bd7 into Singapore, said Lee Quane, regional director at relocation firm ECA International. He expects expatriate outflows from Singapore to outpace inflows through 2022, citing tighter foreign worker policies and wariness over potential curbs https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-freeze-new-ticket-sales-quarantine-free-travel-2021-12-22 due to virus variants.
The net decline in the non-resident workforce slowed in 2021, with a small net gain in November, the manpower ministry said in a written response to parliamentary questions last week.
Barring unforeseen circumstances, the government, which has stressed the importance of staying open, expects ""to hold the course"" of calibrated easing in border restrictions.
""The government works hard to ensure that businesses and individuals continue to choose Singapore because of our openness, rule of law, and consistency in policies,"" it said. 

Companies continue to bring in key talent and receive approvals for work passes, according to Hsien-Hsien Lei, the CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore. ""Sure, things aren't perfect. But, Singapore, from a relative point of view is a great place to live and do business,"" said Lei.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it is likely to hike interest rates in March and reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases that month in what U.S. central bank chief Jerome Powell pledged will be a sustained battle to tame inflation.
""The committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting assuming that the conditions are appropriate for doing so,"" Powell said in a news conference, pinning down a policy statement from the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee that only said rates would rise ""soon.""
Subsequent interest rate increases and an eventual reduction in the Fed's asset holdings would follow as needed, Powell said, while officials monitor how quickly inflation falls from current multi-decade highs back to the central bank's 2% target.
Much was left undecided, he told reporters after the end of the Fed's latest two-day policy meeting, including the pace of subsequent rate hikes or how quickly officials will let its massive balance sheet decline.
But Powell was explicit on one key point: that with inflation high and for now apparently getting worse, the Fed this year plans to steadily clamp down on credit and end the extraordinary support it has provided to the U.S. economy during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Since the Fed's last policy meeting in December, Powell said, inflation ""has not gotten better. It has probably gotten a bit worse ... To the extent that situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to reflect that."" 
""This is going to be a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy we put in place to deal with the economic effects of the pandemic,"" he added.
(Graphic: How fast will the Fed go?, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/gkplgbrkjvb/chart.png) 
STOCKS FALL AGAIN
U.S. stocks, pummeled to start the year on worries about how fast the Fed may move to contain inflation, slid as Powell repeatedly emphasized the economy's underlying strength and inflation's persistence, and refused to rule out more aggressive tightening as needed. 
The S&P 500 index, at one point in the day up by more than 2%, sold off sharply through the course of Powell's news conference to close 0.15% lower. The Nasdaq Composite, which had taken a hard blow in this month's sell-off, ended the day little changed.
Yields on longer-dated Treasury securities, sensitive to the Fed's balance sheet policy, rose as Powell signaled that a decision would be made soon on when to start shrinking the central bank's more than $8 trillion portfolio of U.S. government bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The dollar surged 0.5% to its highest level in a month against a basket of key trading partners' currencies.
Powell was ""trying to balance the fear factor but at the same time he's talking about inflation might get worse, he's talking about the Fed might have to use more tools, he's talking about the balance sheet reduction,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist with Spartan Capital Securities in New York. ""The bottom line is his response is causing the market to fear the uncertainty.""
The extent of the Fed's policy pivot away from battling the economic fallout from the pandemic and towards an inflation fight will take more shape in coming weeks.
It will be contingent on how inflation itself behaves, and Powell said officials still hope much of the improvement will come as the aftershocks of the pandemic ease, perhaps allowing them to do less of the work through tighter monetary policy.
A myriad of risks remain, from a pandemic that is still underway to a potential Russia-Ukraine military conflict.
But Powell said policymakers at this point feel they have ""quite a bit of room to raise interest rates"" without threatening progress on jobs or slowing an economic recovery they want to keep underway. 
In a refrain that has become common, he noted ""the economy is quite different"" than when the Fed last began raising interest rates in 2015, with higher inflation, lower unemployment, and what Powell regards as enough momentum to make its way without the Fed's help.
In that shift to tighter policy the Fed moved at an initially glacial pace, with one quarter-percentage-point rate increase in 2015 and only an additional one in 2016. 
Investors are expecting much more this time, with pricing in federal funds future contracts anticipating four rate increases this year. The Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate is currently set at the near-zero level.
FOMC members also agreed at this week's meeting on a set of principles for ""significantly reducing"" the size of the Fed's asset holdings. Officials said they will shrink holdings ""primarily"" by limiting how much of the principal from maturing bonds the Fed would reinvest each month. That plan would start after the liftoff in interest rates, the central bank said, without yet setting a specific date, pace or final size.
Over time the Fed's balance sheet would not only be pared down, but shifted away from MBS and weighted towards U.S. Treasuries, ""thereby minimizing the effect of Federal Reserve holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy,"" the central bank said.
The Fed's statement, in moving ahead with a plan to tighten monetary policy, cited ""solid"" recent job gains that continued even as the outbreak of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus pushed daily case numbers to record levels. While the Fed has stopped trying to assess when inflation might ease, the statement said officials continue to expect improvements in global supply chains will ease the pace of price increases.

""Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation,"" the Fed said, with consumer prices increasing at a 7% annual rate, the highest level since the 1980s.
Policymakers did not release new economic and interest rate projections on Wednesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - London remains the top global financial centre, according to a study from its own financial district, but is outgunned by New York and Singapore in access to talent, while Paris is adding competition from the European Union.
The study from the City of London Corporation selected seven centres that feature in other research on financial hubs, such as Z/Yen, which consistently puts New York in the top spot and London second.
The study, which added Paris this year, looked at five areas like digital skills, regulation and talent. While London remains top overall from last year, New York is only slightly behind and closing the gap, followed by Singapore, Frankfurt, Paris, Hong Kong and Tokyo. 
(Graphic on, City of London Graphic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgvdwxmndpo/City%20of%20London%20Competitiveness%20Graphic.PNG) 
New York remains by far the biggest financial centre, while London lags Singapore in resilient business infrastructure, access to talent and skills, and a friendly regulatory and legal environment.
""UK policymakers need to guarantee that its businesses continue to enjoy unrivalled access to the best of global talent,"" the study said.
""Withdrawal from the EU, the end of freedom of movement and the introduction of a new immigration system have damaged perceptions of the UK as an attractive business environment for international talent in recent years.""
Total tax for UK-based financial services firms, in particular banks, is also relatively high, it said. The finance ministry is reviewing https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/britain-review-surcharge-bank-profits-2021-03-03 some of the taxes.

Britain's finance ministry has proposed that the Bank of England has a formal remit to ""facilitate"" London's competitiveness.
A year since Britain left the EU's orbit, leaving the financial sector largely cut off from the bloc, there are no signs of a ""Brexit dividend"" in looser regulation, though listing rules have been eased to help London catch up with New York in IPOs.

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it will rely primarily on letting bond holdings run off the balance sheet as they mature as it grapples with persistent inflation, rather than selling bonds outright, which analysts say reduces the chances of near-term asset sales.
""The Committee intends to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjusting the amounts reinvested of principal payments received from securities held in the System Open Market Account (SOMA),"" the Fed said in principles released at the end of the central bank's two-day policy-setting meeting.
Fed officials also said they expect they will begin reducing the central bank's balance sheet after they start raising interest rates.
The comments may reduce some market concerns that asset sales by the U.S. central bank could saturate the market and send bond yields sharply higher, at least in the short term.
It ""makes asset sales very unlikely in the first year,"" Jefferies economists Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons said in a note on Wednesday.
The Fed also said it intends to hold mainly Treasury securities in the longer run, reducing its footprint on other types of credit.
That could mean that the Fed lets its holdings of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) run off at a faster pace than Treasuries.

The Fed's nearly $9 trillion portfolio had doubled in size during the pandemic as the central bank snapped up Treasury bonds and MBS to support markets and the economy. Policymakers are now crafting a plan for reducing those holdings, but Fed officials will need to tread carefully as they shrink their holdings.
""The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments,"" the Fed said in a statement. 
 
"
660,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 06:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Jerome Powell made clear the Federal Reserve would act as needed to cool the hottest inflation in almost 40 years, endorsing interest-rate liftoff in March and opening the door to more frequent and potentially larger hikes than anticipated.
Stressing uncertainty on the economic outlook, including the risk that price pressures could fail to abate as forecast, the Fed chair told reporters on Wednesday that policy must be “nimble” to confront risks to its mandate for price stability and maximum employment. Investors took the comments to mean the Fed would be more aggressive in tightening than previously expected.
As Powell spoke during a 55-minute virtual press conference, stocks erased gains, bond yields surged and the dollar advanced. The S&P 500 index posted a back-to-back drop after rallying more than 2% earlier in the day, while the two-year Treasury yield had the largest one-day increase since March 2020.
“There’s a risk that the high inflation we’re seeing will be prolonged, there’s a risk that it will move even higher. We have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of those plausible outcomes,” Powell said, adding that officials were “of a mind” to raise rates in March. 
He spoke after the Federal Open Market Committee confirmed it would end its asset purchase program in early March and begin shrinking its bond holdings after rate increases commence.
The hawkish pivot, against a backdrop of turmoil in stocks, comes amid consumer inflation readings that have repeatedly surprised and hit 7% -- the most since the 1980s -- and a tight labor market that’s pushed unemployment down faster than anticipated to almost its pre-pandemic level.
“The implication was they would probably have to go a bit further and a bit faster than people were anticipating,” former New York Fed President Bill Dudley told Bloomberg Television. “I don’t think he committed to doing every meeting. I think what he committed to is ‘we’re probably going to end up doing quite a bit more than people had anticipated’.” Dudley is a senior adviser to Bloomberg Economics.
What Bloomberg Economists Say
“The hawkish tone of the statement and Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference suggests there’s upside risk to the four rate hikes priced in by financial markets ahead of the meeting. Bloomberg Economics forecast earlier this month the year will probably end with a total of five hikes, with an upside risk for six.”
-- Anna Wong, Yelena Shulyatyeva, Andrew Husby and Eliza Winger
A rate hike would be the central bank’s first since 2018, with many analysts forecasting a quarter-point increase in March to be followed by three more this year and additional moves beyond. Critics say the Fed has been too slow to act and is now behind the curve in tackling inflation, though key market gauges don’t back that view. 
Even some Fed officials have publicly discussed if they should raise rates more this year than forecast. In December their median estimate was for three hikes in 2022. Powell made a point of saying that the economic projections would be updated in March.
“The Fed is clearly looking through omicron and will not react to weak data for January and February,” Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). economists led by Ethan Harris said in a note. “Bottom line, the risks are skewed to more than four hikes this year.”
Futures indicated around 30 basis points of tightening at the March meeting, showing a quarter-point increase is fully priced and implying a one-in-five chance of a 50 basis point hike.
Officials held the target range for their benchmark policy rate unchanged at zero to 0.25% as expected. They also said they will conclude asset purchases on schedule, leaving them on track to end in “early March.”
The Fed’s balance sheet stands at nearly $8.9 trillion, more than double its size before officials began massive asset purchases at the onset of the pandemic to calm market panic.
In a separate statement outlining the principles it would apply to reducing its balance sheet, the Fed said that over the longer run, it intends to primarily hold Treasury securities. The Fed currently also holds mortgage-backed securities and the shift is aimed at minimizing its effect “on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy,” it said. 
Powell said the Fed will make decisions on the timing and pace of balance-sheet reduction at coming meetings.
Despite criticism that it has dragged its feet, the Fed is moving much quicker than it once expected to -- prompted by the failure of inflation to fade as anticipated amid robust demand, snarled supply chains and tightening labor markets. As recently as September, central bank officials were split on whether any rate hikes would be warranted in 2022.
The meeting is the last of Powell’s current term as Fed chair, which ends in early February. He’s been nominated to another four years at the helm by President Joe Biden and is expected to be confirmed by the Senate with bipartisan support.

The combined moves will complete a pivot away from the loose monetary policy that has defined the pandemic era and toward a more urgent fight against inflation. 
In a press conference Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials will discuss plans for reducing the central bank's nearly $9 trillion balance sheet at their next two meetings, adding he expects there to be a ""substantial"" amount of shrinkage in the Fed's bond holdings, which would reverse pandemic-era ""quantitative easing that stabilized financial markets and the U.S. economy. .

COMMENTS:
    PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK:
""Powell during the question session here is creating a bit of uncertainty, and I think that's why the market is reacting this way. He's talking about inflation might worsen, bottlenecks might get worse. What he's trying to do is prepare the market for a worsening situation and also trying to balance the fear factor. But it seems the responses are creating an atmosphere of uncertainty, which is a negative for the market.
    ""He's talking about the Fed might have to use more tools, he's talking about the balance sheet reduction now. The bottom line is his response is causing the market to fear the uncertainty factor.""
PETER CRAMER, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, SLC MANAGEMENT, REDMOND, WASHINGTON
“The Fed is a very slow-moving ship, by design monetary policy has lagged anywhere from nine to 18 months. The about-face we’ve had in terms of the market’s rate expectations the last three months has been warp speed in the context of Fed decision-making. Expectations coming into this meeting were way too hawkish. The pace of which the Fed operates is measured in years and maybe quarters, but not months.
“We’re going to see a much more measured pace of rate hikes. My interpretation of Powell is of a man who is not concerned about inflation running rampant, (but) one that acknowledges they had the transitory call wrong. Not in terms of its nature, but more in terms of duration.”
CHRIS ZACCARELLI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, INDEPENDENT ADVISOR ALLIANCE, CHARLOTTE, NC
“When reporters asked Powell if the Fed would consider raising rates at every meeting,  which would mean more than 4 times this year, he didn’t say they wouldn’t, which indicates a flexibility to raise rates much more quickly (if necessary) than anyone was expecting.”
“Reporters also asked Powell about “financial conditions” he said that he didn’t want to comment on that, which indicates the Fed isn’t worried that the stock market is down close to 10% in less than a month – and presumably wouldn’t change their approach if the market were to fall significantly further.”  
“This is validation of the concept that the strike price on the Fed put is now much lower, implying that  the Fed would allow the stock market to fall much farther before changing their current behavior.""
LEE FERRIDGE, MACRO STRATEGY HEAD NORTH AMERICA, STATE STREET GLOBAL MARKETS, BOSTON
“The market got way ahead of itself. The Fed is not going to hike 50 basis points in March. The statement gently pushed against that. This statement brought us back to what they’ve been saying. The fact they haven't confirmed the more hawkish view that the market was pricing in is why equities sighed a bit of relief.
“The second thing to take away from this is that quantitative tightening will happen. The idea of the balance sheet reduction as now mentioned in the statement puts us on the table for June.”
BRIAN JACOBSEN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ALLSPRING GLOBAL INVESTMENTS, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN
“If the Fed thinks the current bout of inflation is due to supply-demand imbalances, I’m not sure how they think what they do will help fix that. The Fed is just buying time until supply chains slowly heal. Inflation will then be drifting lower and the Fed can then take the credit.”
MICHAEL PEARCE, SENIOR US ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS, NEW YORK
""The Fed’s announcement that it will “soon be appropriate” to raise interest rates is a clear sign that a March rate hike is coming. The Fed’s plans to begin running down its balance sheet once rates begin to rise suggests an announcement on that could also come as soon as the next meeting, which would be slightly more hawkish than we expected.""
BETH ANN BOVINO, U.S. CHIEF ECONOMIST, S&P GLOBAL RATINGS
“Today the Fed interest rate rocket left the hangar and is headed to the launchpad with what we believe is a March liftoff scheduled - the first of at least three hikes this year. Only question may be how high it flies, how fast and how many are launched? We see 3 one-quarter hikes, but another could hit this year with 3 next and 2 in 2024.“
ELLEN HAZEN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, F.L.PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, WELLESLEY, MASSACHUSETTS 
“There are no surprises here, they are keeping rates where they are but clearly setting the stage to increase rates in March, that is what has been widely expected. As we look at the implied forecast the market is expecting four hikes this year, I don’t think that is going to change. The key question is when are they going to start talking about actually reducing the size of the balance sheet. It looks as through the taper is going to finish a couple of weeks ahead of schedule, that is not really big news either way but what Powell says in the press conference with respect to how quickly they might actually start to reduce the balance sheet will be very critical.”
“They really didn’t talk much about inflation, clearly Powell pivoted on inflation back in December when he said it was time to retire the word transitory and they did not address inflation directly in the statement so that will be key to watch in the press conference as well. If they had something specific to say on inflation they would have said it, and the fact they danced around it a little bit in that first paragraph means they are keeping their options open, perhaps because they still are not convinced that it will end up being sustained.” 
TOM DI GALOMA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SEAPORT GLOBAL HOLDINGS, NEW YORK
“I think it really was everything that the market was looking for. They will stop their purchasing program by mid-March, so I think it’s really everything that I was expecting. It should be interesting to see what the press conference will say, but it seems to me the Fed is recognizing that inflation’s a problem, it’s not transitory, and they’ve got to start the process of a liftoff here in rates…they are saying it will soon be appropriate to raise rates, so I don’t think there’s any mystery here.”
BRENT SCHUTTE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT COMPANY, MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN
“Anyone looking for a hawkish message or pivot didn’t get it. So that is giving the market some comfort that the plan that the market has adapted to and priced in is still in place.”
“I do believe the market was worried at least that there would be some sort of a more hawkish message that was delivered and so far that has not been the case, we will see what the press conference holds. Certainly it is kind of  along the plans of what they had outlined in the past and what the market has priced in already. So the market is taking, I think,  some solace in that and actually pushing just a bit higher.”
ALAN LANCZ, PRESIDENT, ALAN B. LANCZ & ASSOCIATES, TOLEDO, OHIO
    ""It was nothing as draconian as what some investors were worried about when (the Fed) last spoke. The market had taken a tumble, and that's why there's probably a sigh of relief. But as you read into it, they're still keeping it pretty open.""
RUSSELL PRICE, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES, TROY, MICHIGAN
    ""The statement still leaves a lot of questions to be answered particularly when it comes to the balance sheet roll off. There wasn't a whole lot of detail provided."" 
    ""The Fed provided some clarity on the prospect of rate hikes but not all the clarity markets were looking for. There's still some uncertainty when it comes to the balance sheet roll off. The market's glad to get a little more clarity given the uncertainty that accompanies transition periods like this."" 
    ""More details will come in the press meeting."" 
JUAN PEREZ, SENIOR FX TRADER, MONEX USA, WASHINGTON DC
    ""This decision by the Fed sounds like they are not convinced the time to hike will be in March necessarily as they are leaving open room for consideration of policy stance to adjust as needed.""

    ""Keeping the balance sheet the same until hikes begin means that they are indeed not taking all easing measures away quite yet. We thought there was chance of this to happen and it could bode poorly for the dollar in the sort-term.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Australia's central bank will end to its bond-buying programme on Tuesday, but is expected to wait till this November before it responds to higher inflation with its first interest rate rise in over a decade, a Reuters poll showed. 
The country's underlying inflation, which surged at its fastest annual pace since 2014 in the December quarter, suggests the recent rise in price pressures was not as benign and transitory as policymakers thought it would be.
While Governor Philip Lowe was suggesting as recently as last month that a rate tightening this year was unlikely, money markets began pricing in a rise in the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) record low 0.10% cash rate as soon as May, just two months after a widely-expected U.S. Federal Reserve hike in March.
Economists canvassed in a Reuters Jan 18-25 poll also brought forward their rate hike expectations for third month in a row. Most of the 34 respondents, however, expect the RBA to take more time, with a median forecast for a 15 basis-point move in November. Two economists expect a rate rise already in the second quarter, seven in the third quarter, 11 in the fourth quarter and 13 still see the central bank first pulling the trigger next year.
Economists were less divided on when the central bank will pull the plug on its bond-buying programme, with 17 out 22 of those who answered the question expecting an announcement at the next policy meeting on Feb. 1. Five others saw the central bank ending the programme launched in response to the coronavirus pandemic in May. 
""We expect them to end the QE programme, upgrade forecasts, acknowledge the inflation goal has been met and re-emphasise the focus on wages as a demand-side inflation signal,"" Chris Read, economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), said about next weeks meeting.
""While they won't explicitly guide to near-term rate hikes, they will acknowledge the possibility. Our forecast is for RBA liftoff in November 2022 - this (latest inflation) print raises the risk this could be a few months earlier.""
The last time the central bank raised rates was more than a decade ago, in Nov. 2010, when it lifted rates to 4.75%.
An expected hike this November would be followed by a 25 basis point increase in the first quarter of next year and another 25 basis points in the June quarter, taking the cash rate back to 0.75% where it was before the pandemic.
Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan, Australia & New Zealand economist at consultancy Capital Economics said in a note to clients inflation data made a good case for a rate rise as soon as in May, but a federal election made a hike then unlikely.

""The RBA hasn't changed its policy rate in an election month since it started to announce monthly policy decisions in 2008. And with wage growth set to remain below 3% for now, we expect the Bank to wait until August.""
The poll showed inflation would meet the RBA's target range of 2-3% from next quarter and through 2023 averaging at 2.5% this year and 2.3% in 2023, while the economy is forecast to grow 4.0% this year and 2.9% in 2023.

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is beginning to lay out the specifics of how it plans to cull the bond holdings amassed to bolster the U.S. economy during the pandemic, setting expectations that it will move sooner and faster than it has previously to help tame persistently high inflation. 
In new principles released on Wednesday following the central bank's two-day policy meeting, Fed officials said they would mainly use a passive approach when shrinking their balance sheet, but did not rule out more aggressive tactics.
""If the situation turns out to be different than we had thought, we're not going to stick with something that isn't working,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters after the meeting. 
Central bank leaders will have to tread carefully as they figure out how much they can realistically shrink their roughly $9 trillion portfolio, which roughly doubled in less than two years as the Fed snapped up Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to help lower borrowing costs and cushion the economy and markets from the coronavirus pandemic.
With unemployment back to near pre-pandemic levels and inflation running very high, Powell said the same amount of support is no longer needed. 
But it is unclear how small the balance sheet will get. As officials feel their way down to a smaller balance sheet, they will need to keep a close eye on markets, and the economy, to know if they've gone too far. 
(Graphic: A pullback to come?, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/TAPER/gdvzykoakpw/chart.png) 
SHRINK BY A 'SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT'
The last time officials tried to reduce their bond holdings, from the end of 2017 to autumn 2019, they only managed to shrink the balance sheet by about 15% or so before they ran into trouble. That was because the level of reserves, or deposits that banks hold with the Fed, got too low, which led to a spike in short-term borrowing costs in September 2019. 
(Graphic: Overnight borrowing rates, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/BALANCE-SHEET/znpnelrgxvl/chart.png) 
Powell said the Fed wants to shrink its holdings by a ""substantial amount"" and said officials will likely need to discuss the issue at its next two meetings before reaching final decisions on the timing and pace of the process. 
NEW TOOL COULD HELP
A new tool set up last year, known as the standing repo facility (SRF), can serve as a backstop for banks in need of cash and may help to prevent another surge in short-term rates. Financial firms could instead borrow from the facility if they are running low on reserves.
But analysts and economists say it will only work if banks feel they won't be criticized for turning to the Fed for the temporary cash loans. Bill Nelson, chief economist at the Bank Policy Institute and a former Fed economist, compared the new program to the discount window, the long-standing emergency lending outlet many banks are reluctant to use because they don't want to be viewed as being at risk. 
With the SRF in place, some firms should feel more comfortable holding Treasury securities with the understanding that ""if they needed to, they could convert them to cash,"" Nelson said. But that depends on the Fed making it clear that using the facility is a ""normal course of business,"" he said.   
EXTRA CASH 'SLOSHING' AROUND
Over the past year, financial firms have been dealing with too much cash - a trend that is evident in the high popularity of another Fed tool that lets firms park cash with the central bank overnight. Usage of the program, known as the reverse repo facility, has averaged $1.5 trillion a night over the past three months. 
That suggests the Fed can probably afford to reduce its balance sheet by at least that much before it starts to encounter scarcity issues, says Tiffany Wilding, a PIMCO economist and a former analyst at the New York Fed. ""There’s more money sloshing around in the system now than banks want,"" Wilding said. But usage of the reverse repo program may not go straight down as the Fed shrinks its holdings, said Nelson, so officials will need to move carefully. 
(Graphic: A relief valve for excess cash A relief valve for excess cash, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/CASH/jnvwegjlqvw/chart.png) 
WILL THE FED HAVE TO SELL BONDS OUTRIGHT?
The Fed said on Wednesday that it plans to ""primarily"" reduce its bond holdings by letting bonds roll off the balance sheet as they mature and adjusting the amount of proceeds that get reinvested. 
""We want that process to be orderly and predictable,"" Powell said. But he did not rule out the possibility that they could actively sell some of their assets, saying the Fed will adjust its approach if needed.
The Fed also said that it wants its balance sheet to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run. The central bank currently holds about $5.7 trillion in Treasury securities and $2.7 trillion in MBS. 
(Graphic: Maturing Treasury's at the Fed, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/BALANCESHEET/zdpxoqmjmvx/chart.png) 
HOW WILL THEY KNOW THEY'VE GONE TOO LOW? 
The balance sheet levels seen before the pandemic may not be a good gauge for how low holdings can get this time around. One factor is that ""banks' demand for reserves varies over time,"" Lorie Logan, an executive vice president in the Markets Group of the New York Fed, said earlier this month during an interview with the Macro Musings podcast. 

To figure out if reserves are falling too low, the Fed will keep an eye on money markets, Logan said. As she and other New York Fed officials explained in a recent blog post, the relationship between the effective federal funds rate (EFFR), or the Fed's main target rate, and the interest rate that the Fed pays on reserve balances (IORB) is important. 
The two rates trade further apart when reserves are abundant, as they were between 2013 and 2014. And the rates trade closer together when reserve balances are declining, as they were between 2017 and 2019.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog will publish requirements within a year for boosting ethnic diversity among employees in finance by using targets and not quotas, one of its advisers said on Wednesday.
The Financial Conduct Authority, Bank of England and finance ministry published a discussion paper last July setting out how diversity and inclusion could be improved in one of Britain's biggest economic sectors.
It suggested that senior managers could have their pay linked to progress in making workforces more diverse.
Georgina Philippou, senior adviser at the FCA, said there will be proposals for public consultation in the second quarter, with final requirements at the end of this year or start of 2023.
""We never say quotas, we talk about targets. To me quotas suggest numbers that have to be filled come what may, a box that needs to be ticked,"" Philippou told a City & Financial conference on diversity in financial services.
Targets tend to be more aspirational and take longer to fill, while quotas are mandatory.
A Women in Finance project to improve gender diversity is beginning to bear fruit, with Philippou hoping this experience with bring faster results in this year's push to improve ethnic and race diversity.
Britain's financial services minister John Glen urged financial firms to appoint a senior executive to be responsible for ethnic diversity and to set targets.
Britain's Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities has recommended that all employers voluntarily report pay gaps among ethnic groups.
Glen said there has been a testing exercise to understand the complexities of reporting such data and government was assessing the next steps.
""We will be very clear about what we want to do and why we want to do it, and how it will be implemented in a fair and reasonable way,"" Glen told the conference.
""The focus on data is really important. If you measure something, something gets done,"" Glen said.
Asked if the diversity push will end up with a 'zero sum game' - where one group's gain could be negated by another's loss - of ""white men missing out"", Diana Noble, who chaired the Bank of England's review on ethnic diversity and inclusion, said this reaction has to be faced.

There is a whole community at the BoE who have had less opportunity over the past 5-10 years, which needed redressing over the next few years through targets and not quotas, Noble said.
""You benefited, they are going to benefit for a bit... Personally, I think with difficult messaging like that, much better to be completely transparent and honest about what the issue is,"" Noble said.

The Fed signaled it is likely to raise U.S. interest rates in March and reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases that month as well.
At the news conference Powell also repeatedly emphasized the economy's underlying strength and inflation's persistence, and refused to rule out more aggressive tightening as needed.
“I do not think Fed Chair Powell could have been more hawkish during his press conference than if he raised rates today,” said Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings in New York.
Fed funds futures traders are now pricing for 4.4 hikes by December, after previously fully pricing for 4 increases. 

Powell ""underscored that this period is nothing like the end of the last expansion as inflation is much higher. He is implying that they will need to move faster than back then,” analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said on Wednesday in a report. “Bottom line, the risks are skewed to more than 4 hikes this year.”

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's central bank enacted its largest interest rate hike in 20 years on Wednesday, lifting the benchmark rate by a larger than expected 150 basis points to 5.5% as it seeks to rein in stubbornly high inflation.
The central bank's board members voted unanimously for the move, according to a post-meeting statement.
""The evolution of inflation continues to face significant risks and their possible materialization becomes especially relevant in a context where both the annual change in the CPI and its outlook are already high"", the central bank said.
Consumer prices in Chile jumped 7.2% in 2021, well above the central bank's target range of 2% to 4%.
The move, which topped forecasts for a hike to 5.25%, follows a rate increase in December to 4.0% from 2.75%, as the Andean country's economy rebounds strongly from the coronavirus pandemic and the government grapples with rising prices.
Central banks across the region have also been hiking rates to tame inflation. Brazil's central bank raised rates by 150 basis points in December and has signaled another such hike in February.

Mexico's central bank at its last meeting in December also stepped up its efforts to rein in surging inflation, raising its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%.

Investing.com – The Federal Reserve on Wednesday appeared to lay out the carpet for a March rate hike after saying it may ""soon"" begin to raise interest rates to bring red-hot inflation under control.
The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged within the 0% to 0.25% range, but signalled that liftoff in rates could begin soon after the end of the monthly purchases expected in March.
""With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,"" the Fed said in a statement. 
In December, the Fed said it would double the pace at which it tapers monthly bond purchases to $30 billion each month, with a view to end its quantitative easing program by early March. 
The policy statement was largely in line with market expectations, but in the press conference that followed Fed chairman Jerome Powell adopted a hakwish monetary policy stance, 
Powell said there was ""quite a bit of room to raise rates without hurting jobs,"" stoking expectations that the Fed's plan to tighten monetary policy measures, which have underpinned risk assets, may be more agressive than expected.  
The odds of a March rate hike have risen to about 93%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
The latest signalling from the Fed marks a hawkish shift in policy as Powell had previously downplayed how soon rate hikes would follow the end of the tapering.
Stubbornly high inflation has forced the Fed to rethink its monetary policy stance, and part ways with its narrative that price pressures were “transitory.” The Fed has flagged ""supply and demand imbalances"" as the key driver of elevated levels of inflation.
The improvement in the labor market has also served as another catalyst for the Fed to double up on efforts to combat inflation after the unemployment rate dropped under 4% to pre-pandemic levels.
Wall Street is betting that a potential rate hike in March will be followed up by a further three rates this year, leading to the start of the Fed reducing its balance sheet in the summer.
“We see the Fed delivering its first of four 25bp rate hikes this year at its March meeting, then announcing a more aggressive runoff of its balance sheet in July,” Morgan Stanley said in a note.
Powell was reluctant to go into detail about the Fed's plan to tighten the balance sheet but stressed that rake hikes would be active tool of monetary policy. 
""The federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting monetary policy, and that reducing our balance sheet will occur after the process of raising interest rates,"" Powell said in a press conference. The plan to reduce the balance sheet will ""occur over time in a predictable manner, primarily through adjustments to reinvestments so that securities roll off our balance sheet,"" he added.
Some market participants have raised concerns that reducing the balance sheet and rising rates at the same time may prove a difficult pill for the market to swallow. 
“I would personally like to see the Fed hike once and then use the balance sheet versus rate hikes … Doing both at the same time could be pretty difficult for markets,” John Luke Tyner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday."

“A lot of folks refer to this as just social spending,” Biden said at the event. “I see it this way: The Build Back Better plan lowers prices for families and gets people working. It creates the best educated workforce, hopefully in the world, and ensures we remain the most dynamic and productive economy in the world.” 
He was flanked by the chief executive officers of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and pension giant TIAA, among others. All of the companies in attendance support the Build Back Better legislation -- though not every part of it -- and came to the White House because they believe its benefits outweigh the costs, a White House official said.
While negotiations on Capitol Hill hit a dead end after West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin came out against the bill in December, the president said he will continue to fight for the plan. The White House says discussions have continued at a staff level despite the public blow-up last month.
Biden last week conceded the existing bill would have to be broken up into smaller parts to gain support from all 50 Democrats in the Senate. He didn’t specify which elements of the legislation he’ll focus on passing first.
“I’m confident we can get pieces --  big chunks of the Build Back Better law signed into law,” he said at a Jan. 19 news conference.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. chief executive officer Jim Farley said in an interview Tuesday, before participating in the White House meeting, that he would urge Biden to retain tax credits for electric vehicles included in the initial legislation.
“We are so far behind,” Farley said. EVs comprised only about 2% of U.S. car purchases in 2021, compared to nearlyad 20% in Europe, and China now buys half of all EVs produced in the world.  
“I’m very concerned about the country’s competitiveness if the country doesn’t do what other countries have done, which is put their foot on the scale of economics with incentives between $7,000 and $10,000 per vehicle,” Farley said. “That’s what it’s going to take.”

Setting out its 2022 debt forecasts and financing plans, the Treasury said it aims to sell more floating rate debt, amid an aggressive monetary tightening cycle that is increasing official borrowing costs and making the bonds more attractive for investors.
Those bonds are linked to the official Selic interest rate, set by the central bank, and the Treasury expects them to represent between 38% and 42% of the total stock of debt this year, an increase from 36.8% in 2021. 
Since last March, policymakers have raised the interest rate to 9.25% from 2% and have already signaled another 150 basis-point hike in February to combat double-digit inflation in Latin America's largest economy.
The Treasury acknowledged that its long-term goal is to prioritize fixed-rate bonds and inflation-linked bonds. Still it stated that the increase in Selic-linked securities in 2022 will allow it to manage public debt maturity better. 
It expects the average maturity of Brazil's debt profile this year to reach between 3.8 and 4.2 years from 3.8 years in 2021, and for the share of debt maturing over the next 12 months to be between 19% and 23%, compared with 21% last year.
""Especially in a context of greater debt stock and its maturities, it is understood that it is more important to prioritize the convergence of these refinancing risk indicators to more comfortable levels, even if this leads to temporary deviations in the debt composition,"" the Treasury said in a presentation.

In the long term, the government aims to reduce Selic-linked bonds to only 20% of the total stock.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada will soon starting hiking interest rates from record lows to combat inflation, Governor Tiff Macklem announced on Wednesday, saying the economy no longer needed help to deal with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Macklem spoke after the central bank surprised some analysts by leaving rates unchanged at 0.25%, even as it said economic slack had been fully absorbed and forecast inflation would be higher for longer. Rates have been at a record low since March 2020, when the bank slashed the cost of borrowing three times.
""The message is pretty clear. We're on a rising path,"" Macklem told reporters. 
""How far and how fast? Those are decisions we'll take at each meeting, depending on economic developments, depending on our outlook for inflation, and what we judge is needed to bring inflation back to target.""
He later said several increases would be needed, but the bank could take a few steps and then pause to assess progress. The next scheduled rate announcement is March 2.
(Graphic: Canada inflation and interest rates, https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-CENBANK/RATES/lgvdwjrgkpo/chart.png) 
""By being clear and deliberate, we are really trying to cut through the noise so that monetary policy is more of a source of confidence and it's not another source of uncertainty,"" Macklem said.
Still, the decision to hold may have been a ""policy misstep,"" considering the current inflation backdrop and surging home prices, said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis for Monex Europe and Monex Canada.
""Their decision to sit on the fence today may force them into a steeper hiking path later in the year,"" Harvey said.
But others saw no harm in waiting five more weeks to move, saying it would have been worse to raise rates without first removing the commitment to keep them at record lows until slack was absorbed.
""They don't compromise the credibility of the forward guidance for the next time they have to use it, because we know that there will be such a next time,"" said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Group.
After the decision, money markets were pricing in about a 90% chance the central bank would hike to 0.50% in March, with at least five increases in total this year. In recent days, the market had priced in as many as six increases. 
The Bank of Canada said inflation would remain close to 5% over the first half of 2022, before easing to about 3% by the end of the year. In October, the central bank said it expected inflation to return to around its 2% target by end-2022. 

Canada's inflation rate hit 4.8% in December, the highest level since September 1991 and the ninth month in a row it was above the Bank of Canada's 1%-3% control range. Inflation has not been this high for this long since the central bank set its in 1991. 
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% higher at 1.2593 to the greenback, or 79.41 U.S. cents after the rate decision, after giving back some of its earlier gains.

MIAMI (Reuters) - The United States should increase financing and aid to the Caribbean to help the region recover from the pandemic and cope with the growing impact of climate change, Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said in an interview. 
Countries in the region are facing unsustainable debt loads often equivalent to 100% of gross domestic product (GDP), Browne said, adding that many have been relying on loans from China due to favorable terms offered by Chinese banks.
""I feel that the U.S. ought to pay more attention to the Caribbean region in helping us to maintain our standard of living to avoid any mass movement of people,"" he said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.
""If people are unable to live in (Caribbean) countries, then clearly they'll end up on the shores of the United States as refugees.""
China has lent over $4 billion to Caribbean nations in the last 10 years, according to figures compiled by the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue, much of which has gone to finance infrastructure development.
The conditions of those loans are more favorable than even those provided by multilateral agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Browne said, adding that borrowing from Chinese banks should not be understood as a political statement.
The U.S. State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The Caribbean was disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the IMF, which last year said tourism-dependent countries in the region saw economies contract by 9.8% in 2020.
Many struggle to get aid because multilateral agencies tend to classify them as a middle- or high-income nations based on per-capita GDP measurements, which do not factor in the higher costs facing small island nations or their vulnerability to climate change.
Sustained U.S. support for changing those criteria would provide a significant boost for the Caribbean, Browne said.
""We expect the United States would use its influence in the multinational financial institutions to effect that change,"" Browne said, adding he had not seen evidence that this was happening.
The vast majority of some $336 million in U.S. aid to members of the Caribbean Community, or Caricom, goes to Haiti, with only around $70 million being distributed among 13 other countries, he said. The population of those countries is around 7.5 million.
""It's just miniscule,"" Browne said.
Antigua and Barbuda, a nation of two main islands and several smaller ones in the northeastern Caribbean, has, like other countries in the region, faced growing expenses associated with extreme weather events.

Hurricane Irma in 2017 ravaged Barbuda, leaving all buildings uninhabitable and forcing the evacuation of all residents for nearly 18 months. Reconstruction costs were in excess of $200 million.
Antigua and Barbuda bore most of those costs, but got only $169,000 in aid from the United States in 2019, Browne said.

(Reuters) - More than one-third of airline pilots are still not flying as the pandemic continues to take its toll on aviation globally, according to a new survey, though the situation has improved from a year earlier when the majority were grounded.
A poll of more than 1700 pilots by UK-based GOOSE Recruitment and industry publication FlightGlobal, released on Wednesday, found 62% globally were employed and currently flying, up from 43% a year earlier. 
The proportion of unemployed pilots fell from 30% to 20%, while 6% were on furlough, compared with 17% previously as air traffic began to bounce back from 2020 lows.
But in the Asia-Pacific region, the worst-hit globally by a drop in international travel due to tough border restrictions, the proportion of those unemployed rose from 23% to 25%. The region also had the lowest number that were employed flying at 53%.
""We have ... seen some expatriates return home from the region due to concerns over quarantine or being stuck for long periods away from friends and family,"" the report on the survey said.
Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY), a large expatriate employer in Asia, has lost hundreds of pilots through the closure of its Cathay Dragon regional arm as well as almost all of its overseas bases during the pandemic. 
Pilot attrition at Cathay has also been rising amid strict layover rules that leave crew members locked https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/locked-hotels-hong-kongs-covid-19-rules-take-mental-toll-cathay-pilots-2021-11-26 in hotels when they are not flying.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock markets, after enjoying their best three-year run in more than two decades, may soon have to cede the top spot.
With the Fed preparing to raise interest rates https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/inflation-fighting-fed-likely-flag-march-interest-rate-hike-2022-01-26 for the first time in almost four years, capital is starting to fan out of rate-sensitive U.S. shares into other parts of the world where markets are cheaper and potentially more resilient.
The S&P 500's near 10% drop so far this year has surpassed losses on most non-U.S. indexes and some reckon that recent investment outflows from the market, first in a month according to BofA, are only the beginning.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' analysis of eight Federal Reserve hiking cycles since 1975 appears to support that view.
The bank found European stocks outperformed U.S. peers by four percentage points on average over six months following the first Fed rate increase.
It also observed a clear rotation into so-called value sectors such as banks and commodities which are better represented in European and emerging market equity benchmarks. 
""What it means is get the heck out of the United States,"" said Mike Kelly, head of global multi-asset at PineBridge Investments. ""It's all about selling longer duration assets, so we are underexposed to U.S. equities.""
Longer-duration stocks, in a nutshell, are those whose prices are driven by expectations of future earnings potential and therefore fare well when interest rates are low. 
U.S. tech companies with their exorbitant valuations as measured by their price-earnings ratios (PE) are a prime example and they account for over a third of the S&P 500.
For years, those stocks were an investment magnet, benefiting from rock-bottom interest rates and recently the pandemic-time shift to working, shopping and dining from home. 
Of the $1 trillion which flowed into stocks last year, U.S.-dedicated funds took a third. They would also have received a lion's share of the near-$500 billion absorbed by global mandate funds, according to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Now Kelly says, markets are at an inflection point, away from when ""PE went higher and interest rates went lower"".
Given that five megacap firms accounted for a third of the S&P 500 performance last year, unloved U.S. sectors should also benefit from rotation. 
Martin Schulz, senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), said he went overweight international developed markets already last autumn, betting on a broad global economic recovery. ""The cyclicality of the European markets, the Japanese markets... we think are going to be the big beneficiaries of this near-term globalized upturn.""
CHEAP EUROPE
Almost $6 billion fled U.S. equities in the week to Jan. 19, while Europe and emerging market funds absorbed $2.7 billion and $5.2 billion respectively, according to BofA. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Graham (NYSE:GHM) Secker also cited internal data showing $5 billion outflows from U.S. exchange traded equity funds (ETFs), while those focused on U.S. domestic equities shed $8.5 billion. European stock ETFs gained $3.6 billion.
""We are detecting it qualitatively from investors around the globe, to shift a bit of weight from the U.S. to elsewhere,"" said Secker.
Monday's rout https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-volatile-markets-fed-uncertainty-add-to-u.s.-dip-buyers-risks rippled out globally, as European shares plunged 4% for their worst day since mid-2020 and emerging equities shed 2%. Yet they may be relatively better positioned to cope with tighter policy.
Europe trades at a 27% discount to Wall Street, compared to an average 15% discount before the previous three Fed cycles, Goldman Sachs estimates. And value shares overall are 50% cheaper than growth peers, double the discount seen before past rate rises. 
Europe is also delivering more positive economic data surprises and upward earnings revisions than the United States, Secker noted.

EMERGING MARKETS TOO 
All markets will feel it when central banks slow the flow of cash, and depending on what the Fed does, the net supply of cash https://www.reuters.com/business/central-banks-start-turning-off-cash-taps-2022-01-13 from the four big central banks may even shrink for the first time in years.
But this cycle differs in one respect from its last one; China https://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-rates/china-caps-weekly-policy-easing-blitz-with-fresh-rate-cuts-idUSKBN2JV06J, which hiked rates in 2018 alongside the United States, is now easing policy to support its economy.
Easier Chinese policy will benefit other emerging economies and export-focused Europe via trade and commodity prices and could spell a 10% upside for Asian shares in 2022, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) wrote. 

Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management in New Jersey, remains bullish U.S. stocks but reckons other markets may soon start to shine as well.
""Perhaps they will start to experience some of the growth that we have seen in U.S. markets over the last three years,"" he added.

Purchases rose 11.9% to an 811,000 annualized pace from a revised 725,000 a month earlier, government data showed Wednesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 760,000 rate.  
An increase in the number of completed homes over the last two months and prospects of higher interest rates this year as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy may have encouraged a pickup in contract signings. While potential buyers are still seeking more space as well as investment properties, prices remain high and builders continue to face some materials bottlenecks and labor constraints. 
Even so, a separate report from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed home-buying plans over the next six months rose to a record high.
The new-home sales report, produced by the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, showed the median sales price of a new home climbed 3.4% from a year earlier to $377,700.
For the full year, sales decreased to 762,000 from 822,000 in 2020, the report showed.
At the end of December, there were 403,000 new homes for sale, up slightly from a month earlier. At the current sales pace, it would take 6 months to exhaust the supply of new homes, compared with 3.8 months a year ago.
Of the homes sold last month, construction on 231,000 had yet to be started, the most since May. Already completed homes rose to a three-month high of 187,000.

The government predicts a national inflation rate (CPI) of 3.3% for 2022 after 3.1% in 2021 as higher energy costs and a scarcity of semiconductors and other intermediate products continue to push up overall prices, the ministry said.
""The federal government is closely monitoring the development of the inflation rate and the key factors driving prices, especially those linked to energy markets and supply chain disruptions,"" it said.
Presenting the report, Economy Minister Robert Habeck told reporters that Berlin expected inflation to ease next year to the European Central Bank's price stability target of around 2%.

The government also cut its economic growth forecast for 2022 to 3.6% from 4.1% seen in October, pointing to headwinds for the economy in the first quarter due to renewed restrictions in the coronavirus pandemic.
In the further course of the year, the government expects the economic recovery to pick up speed again as infection numbers are likely to fall in spring, allowing authorities to lift restrictions on hospitality and retail.
""Industry should also be able to expand its production noticeably again as soon as the supply bottlenecks gradually resolve over the course of the year,"" the ministry added.
The economic recovery and higher inflation will likely lead to ""somewhat stronger wage growth"" in 2022 after negotiated wage agreements last year https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/german-wages-barely-grew-2021-despite-skyrocketing-inflation-2021-12-16 turned out to be very moderate due to the economic slump in the pandemic, the ministry said.

But unions are unlikely to push through excessive wage demands that would exceed the kinds of pay hikes seen before the pandemic, the ministry said, adding: ""There are currently no signs of a wage price spiral.""
Central bankers are watching wage developments in the euro zone and Germany, its biggest economy, very closely. They are looking for any hints as to whether rising consumer prices lead to higher wages that could mark the start of a wage-price spiral and lead to higher inflation also in the medium term.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain must make a decision this week on whether to extradite tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch to the United States after he failed on Wednesday to have it delayed until the end of a multibillion-dollar lawsuit against him.
U.S. prosecutors want the 56-year-old to stand trial in the United States on 17 counts of fraud and conspiracy connected to the sale of Autonomy, the software company he founded and led, to Hewlett-Packard (HP (NYSE:HPQ)) in an $11 billion deal in 2011.
Lynch has tried to stop the extradition process until a decision in a London civil case brought by Hewlett-Packard is made public, something that is expected in the next few weeks.
Last year, a judge at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court ruled that Lynch could be extradited and sent the case to the Home Secretary Priti Patel. 
Patel obtained two extensions, but a request for a third, longer delay was refused. Lynch challenged that decision in London's High Court, but it was rejected on Wednesday.
The court's ruling means that Patel, who also wanted to wait until after the verdict was given in the civil trial, must now give her decision before midnight on Friday, according to the judgment.
Extradition lawyer Edward Grange, a partner at law firm Corker Binning, said the home secretary only had limited grounds upon which to refuse to order extradition.
""If extradition is ordered it is expected Lynch will apply for permission to appeal,"" he said. 
If Patel orders his extradition, Lynch would have 14 days to apply to the High Court for permission to appeal, he said.
In the meantime, a long-awaited judgement on the multibillion-dollar Autonomy civil case will finally be made public shortly, some two years after the trial ended.
Hewlett-Packard is suing Lynch along with his former finance chief Sushovan Hussain for more than $5 billion, alleging they inflated the value of the British data firm before selling it. Lynch and Hussain have denied the allegations.
HP bought Autonomy, whose software searches and sorts data, in 2011 but a year later it wrote down its value by $8.8 billion, saying it had uncovered serious accounting improprieties.

The U.S. software giant said Lynch was complicit in a series of fraudulent transactions to drive revenue growth at Autonomy.
During a hearing last week over Lynch's extradition challenge, London's High Court was told the result of that lawsuit should be publicised in the next two to three weeks.

Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve is expected to lay the groundwork for a March rate hike as it grapples with high inflation, setting aside concerns over the recent bout of market volatility. U.S. equities are attempting a cautious rebound, supported by an upbeat sales forecast from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are among some of the companies reporting quarterly earnings. Geopolitical tensions are underpinning oil prices ahead of U.S. inventory data and the Bank of Canada is considering its first hike rate since 2018. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 26th January.
The Fed isn’t expected to announce any policy changes at the conclusion of its two-day meeting later Wednesday but is expected to indicate that rate hikes will begin in March.
U.S. inflation has surged to a near four-decade high while the unemployment rate has fallen back to 3.9%, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell is facing a communication challenge with markets that have grown used to looser monetary policy.
Investors will be looking for clues on the timeline and pace of rate hikes and the central bank’s plans for trimming its almost $9 trillion balance sheet, another way of tightening monetary policy.
Powell will need to strike a balance in communicating the Fed’s intentions to keep the economic recovery on track while simultaneously taking measures to curb high inflation.
The announcement of the Fed’s policy decision will come at 2 PM EST (1900 GMT) and will be followed half an hour later by a press conference with Powell.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Hong Kong may not reopen until early 2024 because of its strict COVID-19 policies, which could trigger an exodus of foreign firms and staff and jeopardise the city's role as a financial hub, its European Chamber of Commerce said in a draft report.
The limited effectiveness of locally developed vaccines has forced mainland China to maintain tight restrictions on travel, the chamber said in the draft, which was reviewed by Reuters but has not been made public.
The European Chamber of Commerce declined to comment on the report.
The most likely scenario for Hong Kong would be that it would not reopen until China rolls out its mRNA vaccine across its 1.4 billion population, which could take until late 2023 or early 2024, it said.
In that case, the chamber said there was a risk of a ""cascade effect"" of firms leaving the Asian financial hub.
""We anticipate an exodus of foreigners, probably the largest that Hong Kong has ever seen, and one of the largest in absolute terms from any city in the region in recent history,"" it said.
While Hong Kong succeeded in keeping the virus under control for much of 2021, it has become one of the world’s most isolated places because of its travel restrictions and intermittent lockdowns that have accelerated a brain drain from the former British colony.
Hong Kong has seen a surge of infections this month, which authorities have struggled to control. Health authorities reported 107 new cases on Wednesday, the fourth consecutive day of triple digit infections.
Given the scenario, multinational firms would increasingly relocate China-focused teams to the mainland or shift their Asian regional teams to Singapore or Seoul, the chamber said.
Hong Kong could lose its appeal as an international business hub as well as its potential to contribute to China's economy.
The departure of international talent could also undermine the city's ""potential to maintain world class universities"", it said. 
FASTER VACCINES, SHORTER QUARANTINE
Unlike the mainland, Hong Kong depends on business travellers and imported goods. 
Its role as one of the world’s main transhipment and passenger hubs has been curtailed by tough flight restrictions, which mean very few people are allowed to land and hardly anyone is allowed to transit. 
In contrast, the rival financial hub of Singapore has eased its coronavirus curbs including border controls.
Only about 70% of people in Hong Kong have been double-vaccinated compared with 91% of Singapore's eligible population.
Most of Hong Kong's elderly people have not been vaccinated.
The chamber outlined other scenarios of ""average likelihood"" including the possibility of an uncontrolled outbreak in the mainland leading to Hong Kong sealing its boundary with China and reopening with the rest of the world.
Another scenario was an uncontrolled outbreak in Hong Kong, which would make any additional restrictions meaningless. This could cause up to 20,000 deaths among the elderly.

The chamber made recommendations to the government including accelerating vaccinations and shortening quarantine from 21 days to 7 to 14 days, which would please the international business community.
Foreign businesses should assume that Hong Kong would very likely be ""semi-closed for international travel in the coming 12-36 months"". Talent, and holding on to it, would be ""a precious commodity"", it said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Two years after Japan locked down its borders to block the coronavirus, some 150,000 foreign students still aren't able to enter the country, left in limbo by a policy that has disrupted lives and caused headaches for universities and businesses. 
The absence of the foreign students and researchers is being felt from big laboratories to small, private universities, highlighting the importance of overseas talent - and their tuition fees - as Japan grapples with a shrinking population.
While the policy to stop the virus has proved popular for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, some business leaders have warned about the economic impact, particularly as the labour market is tight. 
What is less clear is the longer-term hit on Japan's ""soft power"" - in particular its academic reputation around the world.
At research institute Riken, geneticist Piero Carninci says he sees the impact first-hand. Japan has a shortage of bioinformatic researchers critical for genomic studies but he has not been able to fill the gap with foreign talent over the past two years.
""My lab, for sure, is slowing down and our centre for this type of analysis. We are struggling,"" Carninci, a deputy director at Riken, whose prize-winning research in genetics has been cited in 60,000 papers.
""Internationalisation in science is definitely critical, because you don't have all the expertise in the same country.""
Many countries sealed borders to keep the coronavirus at bay.
The United States saw international student enrolment drop 43% in the fall of 2020 from the previous year, while some 80,000 immigrant worker visas expired unused last year.
But Japan stands out with the strictest borders among Group of Seven countries, effectively banning all new non-residents since March 2020. Only China, with its zero COVID-19 target, has been more closed off among major economies.
The stakes are high. A government-affiliated study showed Japan last year fell to 10th place globally in publication of noteworthy scientific papers, just behind India. Twenty years ago, it was number four.
'OWN-GOAL'
Nearly half of Japan's four-year private universities failed to fill all places for first-year students in 2021, up 15 percentage points from the previous year, according to an official at the Promotion and Mutual Aid Corporation for Private Schools of Japan, which represents private educators.
While the biggest reason was a drop-off in the number of Japanese students, the decline in foreign students was also felt, the official said.
More than 100 academics and international relations experts signed a letter asking Kishida to reopen borders last week. People shut out have protested outside Japanese embassies and an online petition calling for students and workers to be let in has more than 33,000 signatures. 
The government said last week it would make an exception and allow 87 state-sponsored students in.
""It's a giant own-goal for Japan after decades of masterful use of soft power,"" said Wesley Cheek, a sociologist who recently left Japan for a research post in Britain.
""People like me, who'd usually be applying for grants to continue our research in Japan, just have to take a pass for the foreseeable future.""
International students can work part-time in Japan and have traditionally provided a pool of what Japanese refer to as ""odd-job"" workers in places like convenience stores, in a country long wary of letting foreign workers in.
Even before the coronavirus, there were not enough foreign students to meet labour demand, said Yohei Shibasaki, an international hiring adviser to service and tech companies 
He estimated there were about 170,000 students from trade and language schools in Japan before the pandemic, most of whom worked part time.
Hiroshi Mikitani, chief executive of e-commerce group Rakuten, which hires foreign engineers, has said the curbs should be reconsidered as they were not practically effective and were ""only a minus for the economy"".
The plight of international students, some dreaming for years of study, can be heart-wrenching.
On social media and in interviews, they described paying tuition for classes they took online in the middle of the night, losing scholarships, and months of stress waiting for change. 
Some have exhausted savings. Some have given up and gone elsewhere.
Japan is no longer the main destination for study and research in East Asia, with more students now going to South Korea, said Davide Rossi, who runs an agency promoting study abroad.

Sujin Song, 20, a science major from South Korea, has lost her scholarship but tries to do lab work for her classes online. She was blocked again from entering Japan in November.
""I really liked Japan but now I feel betrayed,"" Song said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden has threatened to impose devastating sanctions on Russia if leader Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine, but some big companies and business groups are pushing the White House and lawmakers to be cautious. 
A trade group representing  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX),  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and other big U.S. corporations that do business in Russia is asking the White House to consider allowing companies to fulfill commitments and to weigh exempting products as it crafts any sanctions. At the same time, big energy companies are pushing Congress to limit their scope and time frame. 
The Biden administration and Congress need to ""get the details right in case they must follow through on the threat of sanctions,"" Jake Colvin, president of The National Foreign Trade Council, told Reuters Monday. 
""Those details should include consideration of safe harbors or wind-down periods to enable companies to fulfill existing contracts and obligations, as well as carve-outs for lifesaving medicines and other humanitarian considerations consistent with longstanding U.S. policy,"" Colvin said. 
Energy companies have also reached out directly to U.S. lawmakers to press for a ""cool down"" or ""wind down"" period so their assets are not seized if they are unable to fulfill business agreements in Russia, a congressional aide told Reuters. 
The American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. lobbying organization for oil and gas drillers, has discussed sanctions on Russia with congressional offices. ""Sanctions should be as targeted as possible in order to limit potential harm to the competitiveness of U.S. companies,"" an API spokesperson said. 
Export sanctions are typically phased in, giving companies time to wind down their existing business, or ensure delivery arrivals, said William Reinsch, a former senior U.S. Commerce Department official. 
But in this case, the sanctions are likely to be applied suddenly, in the middle of a crisis, making a ""wind down"" period more difficult to secure, he said.
The U.S. Treasury in the past has provided some mitigation measures on financial sanctions, such as granting licenses https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-formalizes-guidance-allowing-personal-remittances-flow-afghanistan-2021-12-10 protecting senders of humanitarian aid and personal remittance flows to Afghanistan despite sanctions against the ruling Taliban.
A U.S. Treasury official declined to comment on any such measures regarding potential sanctions against Russia, but added: ""We are prepared to deliver severe costs to the Russian economy while minimizing unwanted spillover."" 
CRIMEA SANCTIONS LEGACY 
Oil companies felt the aftermath of the U.S. sanctions on some of Russia's more expensive drilling operations for years after Putin invaded Crimea in 2014. 
The measures forced  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) out of Russia's Arctic and ended the company's collaboration with Russian state oil company Rosneft, with which it signed a $3.2 billion deal in 2011 to develop the region. 
Exxon's argued the sanctions, which slowed work on a major discovery in the Kara Sea above the Arctic Circle, unfairly penalized U.S. companies while allowing foreign companies to operate in the country, one of the world's largest oil producers. 
The 2014 sanctions hit the easiest targets in Russia's high-tech exploration oil and gas projects in the Arctic, Siberian shale and deep sea. 
New sanctions could be broader, but also tricky to pull off without damage to Western companies. 
One possible ""safe harbor"" measure could protect companies from legal liability for sanctions violations if certain conditions were met, said Reinsch, such as showing that a shipment went to the sanctioned country without permission, perhaps from a third country. 
Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment about any lobbying it is doing on the potential Russia sanctions.

A spokesman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest lobbying group for American business, declined to comment on the topic. 
U.S. goods and services trade with Russia totaled an estimated $34.9 billion in 2019, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's office.

President Xi Jinping has given Shenzhen greater autonomy for pursuing reforms, praising it for ""achieving miracles"" while on a visit two years ago to mark the establishment of the country's first economic zone in the southern city four decades earlier.
Shenzhen would become a ""model city for a strong socialist country,"" Xi said in October 2020.
The new guidelines from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) further spell out where the city should pursue reforms, across finance, data, medicine, education and elderly care.
The guidelines call on Shenzhen to develop standards for cross-border data transactions, with an eye to transfers between the Greater Bay Area, which includes Hong Kong and Macau. 
It also calls on the city to develop trading products related to yuan settlements, and an offshore trading platform, though details are not spelled out.
Shenzhen should also build an international platform for trading electronic components and integrated circuits, providing support on customs declarations and other logistical matters.

In a bid to attract more overseas talent, the city should look into relaxing restrictions on Chinese citizens opening foreign schools, the guidelines said.
Other points including developing a system for online sales of prescription drugs, the relaxation of restrictions on medicines, improving the approval process for stem cell therapy.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - China's Realme will enter Europe's high-end handset market next month with its priciest ever device, its CEO told Reuters, as it looks to expand beyond its budget offerings and sell 50% more smartphones globally this year.
The Shenzhen-based company is among several Chinese handset firms that have been making aggressive moves https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-mobile-huawei-competitors-idINKBN2830IC to seize global market share from Huawei Technologies, after stepped-up U.S. sanctions hobbled the former top smartphone maker's supply chains and forced it to retreat. 
Realme plans to start selling its premium GT 2 Pro phone across Europe in February for $700-$800, founder and CEO Sky Li said. 
This is almost double the 349 euros ($395) suggested price of the GT Master Edition it currently sells through Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and near the prices of other high-end phones from market leaders Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (KS:005930). 
""We think it's a very important, market, and a big market for high-end phones,"" Li said.
With the pandemic affecting economic conditions, demand for smartphones is sluggish and consumers are waiting longer to upgrade, but as the world's fastest growing smartphone company, Realme can buck that trend, Li added.
Counterpoint Research estimates Europe's smartphone market generated revenues of $80.65 billion in the first 11 months of 2021, of which high-end devices accounted for $55.56 billion.
""Almost all of the growth is driven by the high-end, which can be attributed mainly to the successful premium models of Apple and Samsung,"" Counterpoint senior analyst Yang Wang said.
Apple, whose prices for its iPhone 13 start at around $850, was Europe's best-selling manufacturer last quarter, followed by Samsung and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), whose phones are priced at around $900 and $700 respectively, according to Counterpoint.
Data from consultancy IDC shows the European market was comparable to the United States in the first three quarters of 2021 in terms of smartphone revenues, but lagged behind China.
'NO DISTRACTIONS'
Spun off from fellow Chinese smartphone maker Oppo in 2018, Realme was the world's sixth-biggest smartphone seller as of end-September, according to Counterpoint, with strong sales in India, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe. 
Realme, Oppo and other rivals Vivo and Oneplus trace their origins back to BBK Electronics, a Shenzhen-based conglomerate.
Li said he expects the G2 Pro phone to appeal to European customers because it is one of the first phones to launch with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)'s new flagship Snapdragon 8gen1 processor, which promises higher speed and power efficiency.
Realme sold 60 million handsets in 2021 globally and aims to sell 90 million this year and over 100 million in 2023, Li said. 
The company, like its peers, has been hit by semiconductor shortages over the last year, but Li said the constraints could ease by the second half of 2022.
While peers including Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi are making forays into processors and electric cars, Realme will stay focused on phones, ""with no other thoughts or distractions"", Li said.

""It's not easy to survive in an industry so full of experts, so we mustn't do things beyond our ability,"" he said.

BRUSSELS/GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. financial contributions to the World Health Organization (WHO) have fallen by 25% during the coronavirus pandemic, provisional data show, with Washington's future support to the United Nations agency under review.
The large drop in funding versus the previous two-year period arose from cuts decided by former U.S. President Donald Trump that reveal for the first time the scale of the Trump administration's retreat from the U.N. body. 
U.S. funds are set to go up again in the WHO's next two-year budget following new pledges in December including $280 million by President Joe Biden's administration. However, the Biden administration has also raised doubts about Washington's future support to the global organisation.
The U.N. agency did with over $200 million less from the United States in 2020 and 2021, according to provisional WHO data contained in a budget document reviewed by Reuters that has not yet been made public, though it managed to raise more funds from other donors which enabled an increase of its total budget.
Washington paid $672 million to the WHO for its latest two-year budget, down from $893 million in 2018-19, the provisional data showed. 
As a result, the United States is no longer the WHO's top donor, with Germany having replaced it gradually through transfers of more than a billion dollars over the last two years. 
Graphic: WHO funding - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/zdpxoqlqwvx/chart.png 
The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A WHO spokesperson did not immediately provide an official comment. 
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the third largest donor to the WHO, with $584 million in 2020-21, largely spent on a global programme to eradicate polio. The foundation did not immediately reply for a request for comment.
Over the past two years, U.S. funds went down mostly in 2020 - Trump's last full year in the White House - amid a sharp fall in so-called voluntary contributions. 
Funding doubled in 2021 when Biden took over, but the increase was not enough to fully restore the U.S. financing level compared to previous periods.
Trump cut funding and moved to withdraw the United States from the WHO, accusing it of being too close to China and having mismanaged the first phase of the pandemic - accusations that the WHO has denied.
The Biden administration brought Washington back into the WHO and vowed to restore funding but has also voiced doubts about the WHO's ability to tackle new challenges, including from China. 
INFLEXIBLE FUNDING
Part of the U.S. financial contributions were delayed by the WHO to next year. But even factoring this in, the fall in U.S. funds was still about 20%, WHO data show.
About one-third of U.S. funds were mandatory membership fees, which remained stable compared to past years at around $230 million per biennium. 
This is considered by the WHO the best funding because it allows higher flexibility in spending and permits the agency to channel the money to where it is most needed.
But the majority of funding went to areas selected by the U.S. government.
This is part of a wider trend, with the WHO having received in total just less than 20% of its funding in recent years from these mandatory contributions, without strings attached.
The WHO document showed that one of the areas underfunded as of Dec. 21 was country preparation for health emergencies, such as the current pandemic, which is only 73% funded.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reiterated on Tuesday that the current funding structure was restrictive.
""The problem is still whatever we have done is mainly an earmarked budget, so it's not really flexible enough,"" he told the WHO's Executive Board during a public debate, saying that the current financing model was unsustainable.
The United States is opposing a plan to raise mandatory fees, or assessed contributions, to 50% of the WHO's budget in coming years.
""The U.S. seeks to better understand the current funding mechanisms, efficiencies and decision-making before considering an increase in assessed contributions,"" U.S. health official Mara Burr told the WHO board on Tuesday, noting Washington supported efforts to address gaps in financing for preparedness.
By far the largest part of the WHO's funding comes from voluntary contributions from states or private donors who decide the sectors or even the projects where they should be used.

This is one factor that has led the Geneva-based agency to delay the use of some of the funds since they could not all immediately be devoted to fighting the pandemic.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Some Bank of Japan policymakers saw consumer inflation briefly accelerating towards their 2% target as price pressures build up on changing corporate price-setting behaviour, a summary of opinions at the bank's January meeting showed on Wednesday.
Many board members, however, stressed the need to maintain ultra-loose monetary policy to support a fragile economy facing fresh risks from a spike in Omicron coronavirus cases, the summary showed.
""There's a chance year-on-year growth in consumer inflation may briefly approach 2%. If that happens, what's important is to look at facts behind the rise and whether they're sustainable,"" one of the BOJ's nine board members was quoted as saying.
""Consumer inflation may temporarily reach levels of around 1.5% in the first half of 2022. Whether that momentum is sustained enough for inflation to stably approach the BOJ's 2% target would depend on wage and inflation expectations - or in sum the strength of demand,"" a second opinion said.
At the January meeting, the BOJ raised its price forecasts but said it was in no rush to change its ultra-loose policy with inflation still distant from its target.
Japan has not been immune to impact of global commodity inflation with wholesale prices rising at a record pace.
But decades of low inflation have made many Japanese firms cautious of raising prices for fear of scaring away consumers, and instead have absorbed costs by streamlining operations.
Some BOJ policymakers saw signs of change and pointed to an increasing number of firms passing on higher costs to consumers, the January meeting summary showed.
""Many companies are now having to drop their traditional view that prices will keep falling, and change the way they set prices,"" a third opinion showed.
Others, however, were sceptical that inflation will sustainably accelerate towards the BOJ's target. ""It will be difficult to achieve the BOJ's price target by the end of fiscal 2023,"" the summary quoted one board member as saying.

Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.5% in December from a year earlier, well below the BOJ's target but hovering around a nearly two-year high in a sign of broadening inflationary pressure from rising fuel and raw material costs.
Some analysts expect consumer inflation to approach 2% when a drag from cellphone fee cuts ends in April, piling pressure on policymakers to seek ways to push up wages to make up for households' rising cost of living.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. House of Representatives leaders on Tuesday unveiled a bill aimed at increasing U.S. competitiveness with China and supporting the U.S. chip industry, including $52 billion to subsidize semiconductor manufacturing and research.
President Joe Biden's administration is pushing to persuade Congress to approve funding to help boost chip production in the United States, as shortages of the key components used in autos and computers have exacerbated supply chain bottlenecks. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the 2,900-page bill, called the ""America Competes"" act, would ""supercharge"" investment in chips and boost U.S. manufacturing and research capacity, as well as advancing U.S. competitiveness and leadership.
The Senate passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act last year, which includes $52 billion to increase U.S. semiconductor production and authorizes $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research to compete with China.
The House bill has key differences with the Senate version. It does not contain the $190 billion for technology and research, but does include $45 billion to support supply chain resilience and manufacturing of critical goods, industrial equipment and manufacturing technology. 
Funding could be used to ""relocate a manufacturing facility out of countries of concern, including countries that pose a significant economic or national security threat to the United States,"" the House said. 
The government could use funds to establish stockpiles to provide ""reserves necessary to maintain the availability of critical goods during supply chain shocks.""
The House is expected to take up its version next week. If it passes leaders of both chambers will negotiate to resolve differences.
""We're in an all-out race for the jobs of the future and to protect our country's global technological edge,"" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said.
President Joe Biden said the House and Senate proposals represented the ""transformational investments in our industrial base and research and development"" that helped power U.S. global economic leadership in the 20th century.
The House bill also includes a number of trade provisions and would impose additional sanctions on China for its treatment of Uyghurs and offer refugee status for qualifying Hong Kongers. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment.
The bill also reauthorizes and revises Trade Adjustment Assistance programs, which help workers whose jobs or pay is hurt by imports, and reforms the Generalized System of Preferences, a preferential tariff system for imports.
In addition, it would create a government review led by the U.S. Trade Representative to potentially block certain outbound investments made by U.S. companies in China and some other countries.
Opposition from business groups led the Senate to scratch similar language last year. The absence of such a measure, intended as one safeguard to help prevent U.S. taxpayer funds supporting semiconductor and other critical technology industries from being rerouted to overseas competitors, was seen by some lawmakers as a serious flaw in the Senate bill.
The House bill would review ""offshoring of critical capacities and supply chains to foreign adversaries and non-market economies, like China and Russia.""

It would also authorize $3 billion to fund ""a domestic solar manufacturing supply chain"", supporting the construction of new solar manufacturing capacity.
The bill would also give the Commerce Department the ability to impose tariffs if a government provides subsidies to a company operating in a different country, aimed at addressing China's ""Belt and Road Initiative.""

(Reuters) - Signaling U.S. President Joe Biden's picks for the Federal Reserve may face a tough confirmation process in the closely divided Senate, Republican Senator Pat Toomey on Tuesday raised questions over whether they fairly represent the nation.
""I write to express my concerns with the significant lack of diversity in geography and professional experience in your recent slate of nominees to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,"" Toomey, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, told Biden in a letter made public by Toomey's office.

But by profession and region, Toomey said Tuesday: not so much.
All but one, Michigan State University's Cook, are from the Richmond Fed district, Toomey said in the letter. There are 12 Fed districts covering the country. And most, he said, are from academia.
Toomey reserved his sharpest comments for Raskin, saying she has ""demonstrated hostility"" toward the oil and gas sector, making her ""unacceptable."" 
The banking committee must approve Fed nominees before they are considered by the full Senate, and held confirmation hearings for Powell and Brainard earlier this month.
Toomey said at the time he planned to support Powell's renomination, but his and other Republicans' questioning of Brainard suggests an uphill battle for other nominees.
Toomey released the letter as Powell convened the first Fed policy setting meeting of the year, during which it is expected to begin to chart a path toward higher interest rates and a smaller balance sheet after two years of super-easy monetary policy to fight the pandemic recession.
DIVERSITY
Senators have historically accepted a wide range of interpretations of the Federal Reserve Act's requirement that no more than one Fed governor shall be ""selected from any one Federal Reserve district,"" says Fed historian Kaleb Nygaard, a sernior research associate at Yale's Financial Stability Program.
Some have had to reach back to birth or early childhood to establish a connection with a Fed district not already ""taken"" by a sitting governor. In 2011, Senator Richard Shelby, helped sink one Fed nominee, Nobel Prize laureate Peter Diamond, in part on the basis of his place of residence.

""It's completely appropriate for the Senate to ask and the White House to have to defend their picks based on geography,"" Nygaard said, referring to the governing law.
Senate Banking panel chair Sherrod Brown expects to hold confirmation hearings for the Board seats next month.

MILAN (Reuters) - A meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the heads of some of Italy's top companies to boost business ties between the two countries is set to go ahead on Wednesday despite rising tensions over Ukraine.
The meeting, originally scheduled for November, will be via a video link and feature top managers at firms like power company  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and lender UniCredit, according to sources who had seen the list.
""Italy is one of the leading exporters to Russia and the idea is to stimulate dialogue between the sides,"" one of the organisers said, confirming the event.
The meeting comes as Western leaders step up preparations for any Russian military action against Ukraine.
The United States and the European Union have threatened economic sanctions in case of any invasion by Moscow and Western leaders say unity is paramount, though differences have emerged over how best to respond.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has previously said the EU has little leverage with Russia over Ukraine, but needs to keep talking to Putin to calm tensions.
The meeting on Wednesday, involving 20 to 25 companies, was organised by the Italy-Russia chamber of commerce (CCIR) and the Italian-Russian business committee chaired by Marco Tronchetti Provera, head of tyre group Pirelli. 
In a statement on Jan. 17 announcing the meeting, CCIR president Vincenzo Trani warned of anti-Russian rhetoric at this particular moment. ""For us it is crucial the economic-business dialogue between Italy and Russia be stimulated.""
Other Italian companies participating in the meeting include Saipem, Maire Tecnimont, Barilla and Generali (MI:GASI), according to the sources, adding that many companies would be represented by their chairmen.
Energy group Eni was on the list but late on Tuesday a spokesman said ""Eni will not attend the meeting"". 
Energy is expected to be one of the top issues on the agenda at a time when surging natural gas prices have inflated energy bills for businesses and households. Russia supplies the EU with around a third of its gas. 

An escalated conflict between Russia and Ukraine would be likely to further increase energy costs for many countries.
Italy was Russia's fifth biggest trading partner in 2020. In the first nine months of last year, commerce between the two countries rose 44% on the year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House plans to host the chief executives of major U.S. companies including auto and tech sector firms on Wednesday to discuss President Joe Biden's signature $1.75 trillion Build Back Better legislation.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) CEO Mary Barra, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) CEO Jim Farley, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) co-CEO Marc Benioff, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) President Brad Smith, Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) CEO Josh Silverman, Siemens Corp CEO Barbara Humpton and Corning (NYSE:GLW) CEO Wendell Weeks are among those who will take part.
A White House official said Biden ""will meet with CEOs who support passing Build Back Better to discuss the ways his (BBB) agenda will make the U.S. economy more competitive, increase worker productivity and workforce participation, lower inflation over the long-term, and strengthen business growth.""
Biden made a push in December to win passage in Congress of the spending bill that would provide billions of dollars to tackle climate change and boost electric vehicles along with money for universal preschool, paid family leave and other social safety spending.
Biden on Tuesday touted GM's announcement of a new $7 billion investment in Michigan, adding 4,000 jobs and boosting electric vehicle and battery manufacturing.
Biden's proposal would increase the current $7,500 EV tax credit to up to $12,500 for union-made U.S. vehicles as well as creating a credit of up to $4,000 for used vehicles. The bill would also again make GM and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc eligible for tax credits after they hit the 200,000-vehicle cap on the existing $7,500 credit.
The $4,500 union EV credit has come under heavy criticism from foreign automakers like Toyota.
The bill also includes a 30% credit for commercial electric vehicles. Build Back Better would also allocate $3.5 billion for converting U.S. factories for production of electrified or fuel cell vehicles and revive incentives that could generate $3.7 billion for automotive communities by 2031.

Auto manufacturers could also benefit from $3 billion allocated to a Department of Energy Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program.
Biden wants 50% of new U.S. vehicles to be electric or plug-in electric hybrid by 2030.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An escalated conflict between Russia and Ukraine would likely further increase energy costs and commodities prices for many countries, keeping headline inflation rates elevated for longer, a top International Monetary Fund official said on Tuesday.
First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath told Reuters the situation now was far different than in 2014 when Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine, and energy prices fell quite sharply amid low demand and ample shale gas supplies.
""This time around ... if this conflict were to happen, you would see an increase in energy prices,"" Gopinath told Reuters in an interview, noting the current crisis was unfolding in winter and natural gas reserves were much lower in Europe.
Prices of other commodities exported by Russia were also rising, and could trigger a ""bigger, broad-based increase"" in commodities prices if the conflict ratcheted up, she told Reuters after the release of the global lender's updated World Economic Outlook.
Russia's economy contracted by 3.7% in 2015 due to falling oil prices and international sanctions imposed after the annexation of Crimea. The IMF currently estimates that Russia's economy will grow 2.8% in 2022, but that forecast does not include concerns about the conflict, Gopinath said.
Gopinath told a news conference earlier that an escalation of the conflict and potential Western sanctions on Russia would likely push oil and natural gas prices higher, driving energy costs higher for many countries in the world.
That meant headline inflation, already at extremely high levels across the globe, could stay ""much more elevated for longer,"" she said.
That in turn, she told Reuters, could prolong ""very high inflation numbers"" and raised the risk that they could get entrenched and start feeding into wage-price spirals.

Such a conflict would also have an impact on the Russian stock market and the Russian currency, the rouble, she said, adding that IMF officials still hoped for a peaceful resolution.
The IMF on Tuesday revised up its 2022 inflation forecasts for both advanced and developing economies, and said elevated price pressures were likely to persist longer than previously forecast, but said prices should subside in 2023 as growth in fuel and food prices moderated.

TOKYO (Reuters) -As Japan kicked off annual wage talks on Tuesday, policymakers sought to downplay the chance rising raw material prices could be stoking ""bad inflation"", where wages fail to gain enough to make up for the rising cost of living for households.
Under pressure from opposition lawmakers, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida blamed recent rising prices on global commodity inflation, stressing the need to boost wages and household incomes to achieve solid economic growth.
""It's desirable to create an environment in which companies can pass on rising costs and raise wages, so that increasing consumption spurs economic growth and inflation,"" Kishida told parliament on Tuesday.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda also stressed the need for wage hikes to accompany any pick-up in inflation.
""We remain vigilant to the risk prices may shoot up before wages begin to rise, or how (rising raw material costs) could hurt smaller firms. We must keep an eye out on these risks, while maintaining our current easy monetary policy,"" he said in the same parliament session.
The policymakers made the remarks as the major business lobby and unionists kicked off annual spring wages talks, due to be wrapped up in March.
Some local media and opposition lawmakers have warned Japan may be experiencing ""bad"" inflation - driven by higher input costs and a weak yen - instead of ""good"" inflation backed by strong demand and wage growth.
The premier said it was hard to draw a line on what constituted ""good"" or ""bad"" inflation, and declined to say when Japan could achieve the type of inflation considered desirable.
BOJ's Kuroda said he did not think Japan was experiencing an ""abnormally"" weak yen, countering the view the currency's decline was mainly to blame for the rising cost of living.
Wage growth holds the key to whether the central bank can sustainably push up inflation to its 2% target, and for Kishida to meet his pledge to stoke a virtuous cycle of growth and wealth distribution.
But there is uncertainty about whether companies will heed Kishida's requests to raise wages.
Japan's biggest business lobby Keidanren has resisted Kishida's calls for uniform wage hikes of 3% or more from companies that have been profitable.
In Tuesday's meeting kicking off talks with labour unions, Keidanren chairman Masakazu Tokura said companies must set wages reflecting their own situation as the fallout from COVID-19 makes profits uneven among sectors.
""Given the so-called 'K-shaped recovery' amid the prolonged pandemic in which gaps of corporate performance grow wider, it has become more important than last year for each company to respond in accordance with their own situation,"" Tokura said.

Japan has not been immune to the impact of global commodity inflation with wholesale prices rising at a record pace, prodding more firms to raise prices and already shifting public perception that decades of weak inflation will persist.
Core consumer inflation stood at 0.5% in December, well below the BOJ's 2% target, as cuts to cellphone fees offset some of the boost from rising electricity bills and food prices.

701,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 12:28PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- More than one-third of U.S. employers still plan to implement a vaccine mandate despite the Supreme Court’s rejection of a federal rule that would have required workers to get shots or periodic tests.
Thirty-five percent of companies polled by  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) Inc. last week said the court’s Jan. 13 ruling won’t derail their plans to require vaccinations, compared with just 4% that said they’re now dropping their mandate. A further 29% haven’t made a decision yet, while 12% said they’re now less likely to impose a requirement. 
The results illustrate the divisiveness of the issue within corporate boardrooms as employers weigh whether mandates could prompt anger and staff defections. Many companies, buffeted by soaring absenteeism caused by the omicron variant, have decided to go ahead with a vaccine requirement, and almost 40% of employers polled by Gartner agreed that a mandate could attract workers. Yet about one in four executives said it would do the opposite.
“What is more attractive -- to have a mandate or not?” Brian Kropp, Gartner’s chief of human resources research, said in an interview before the poll was conducted. “Most are not exactly sure what to do.”
Corporate strategies have varied.  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. was the first major company to halt its plans to implement a vaccine mandate after the Supreme Court ruling, while another industrial heavyweight, Honeywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON)., said it would stick to its vaccination policy. The Biden administration’s rule required employers with 100 or more workers to make them get vaccinated or be tested regularly, potentially at their own expense.
The Supreme Court’s decision to block the requirement was a victory for 26 business groups, led by the National Federation of Independent Business, and 27 Republican-led states. They sued to challenge the policy from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, saying it exceeded the workplace-safety agency’s authority.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The International Monetary Fund lowered its economic forecasts for the United States, China and the global economy on Tuesday, and said uncertainty about the pandemic, inflation, supply disruptions and U.S. monetary tightening posed further risks.
""We project global growth this year at 4.4%, 0.5 percentage point lower than previously forecast, mainly because of downgrades for the United States and China,"" Gita Gopinath, the IMF's No. 2 official, read from her blog https://blogs.imf.org/2022/01/25/a-disrupted-global-recovery.
The IMF said the rapid spread of the Omicron variant had led to renewed mobility restrictions in many countries and increased labor shortages, while supply disruptions were continuing to fuel inflation. Omicron was expected to weigh on economic activity in the first quarter, but ease up thereafter, given that it was associated with less severe illness, the IMF said.
Escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine could boost energy prices, keeping headline inflation at elevated levels for longer, Gopinath told reporters as the global lender updated its World Economic Outlook.
Global growth is expected to slow to 3.8% in 2023, a 0.2 percentage-point uptick from the previous forecast in October, the IMF said, adding the increase was largely mechanical after current drags on growth dissipate in the second half of 2022. 
Overall, the pandemic was now projected to result in cumulative economic losses of $13.8 trillion through 2024, compared to the previous forecast of $12.5 trillion, Gopinath, who previously served as the IMF's chief economist, said.
The IMF cut its forecast for U.S. growth by 1.2 percentage points given the failure of U.S. President Joe Biden to pass a massive social and climate spending package, earlier tightening of U.S. monetary policy and continued supply shortages.
The U.S. economy is now forecast to grow by 4% in 2022 after expanding 5.6% in 2021, with growth seen easing further to 2.6% in 2023, the IMF said.
""We are certainly living in very turbulent times,"" Gopinath said, adding that there was still a ""tremendous uncertainty"" about how much the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates and over what period of time, as well as rising geopolitical tensions around the world.
She said rising interest rates should address exuberance in financial markets and usher in ""a more orderly correction"" as long as the Fed communicated clearly about its policy.
The IMF downgraded China's forecast by 0.8 percentage point to 4.8% in 2022 after 8.1% growth in 2021, with growth to edge higher again to 5.2% in 2023.
Pandemic-induced disruptions related to China's zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy and protracted financial stress among property developers prompted the downgrade, the IMF said.
The IMF also cut its forecast for the Euro area by 0.4 percentage point to 3.9% in 2022, and said growth there would slow to 2.5% in 2023.
The IMF cut by 1.2 percentage points each its 2022 growth forecast for Brazil and Mexico, Latin America's largest economies. Brazil is now seen growing 0.3% this year and Mexico 2.8%, while the region is expected to grow 2.4%, 0.6 percentage point below the previous forecast.
India and Japan saw their forecasts upgraded somewhat.
The IMF cautioned that the emergence of new COVID-19 variants could prolong the pandemic and induce renewed economic disruptions, while supply chain disruptions, energy price volatility, and localized wage pressures posed further risks.
It revised up its 2022 inflation forecasts for both advanced and developing economies, and said elevated price pressures were likely to persist longer than previously forecast given ongoing supply chain disruptions and high energy prices.
It said inflation was expected to average 3.9% in advanced economies and 5.9% in emerging market and developing economies in 2022 before subsiding in 2023, aided by moderated growth in fuel and food prices over that period.
While economies were continuing to recover from the shock of the pandemic, the pace of the recoveries was diverging widely between rich and poorer countries, the IMF said. 
While advanced economies are projected to return to pre-pandemic trend this year, several emerging markets and developing economies face sizeable output losses, the IMF said.
Seventy million more people were living in extreme poverty after the pandemic, setting back the progress in poverty reduction by several years, Gopinath wrote in her blog.

The IMF said it was critical to ensure worldwide access to vaccines, tests, and treatments to reduce the risk of further dangerous COVID-19 variants, while many countries would need to raise interest rates to curb inflation pressures.
Gopinath noted that 60% of low-income countries were already in or at high risk of debt distress, and urged the Group of 20 to speed up debt restructuring processes and suspend debt service payments while the restructurings are being negotiated.

First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath told reporters that 60% of low-income countries were in or at high risk of debt distress, and would find it increasingly difficult to service their debts, and the G20 Common Framework needed to be revamped to deliver debt restructuring agreements more quickly.
""It has made some progress, but a lot more is needed to actually get it to deliver on its promise"" to help countries with unsustainable debt levels, she said.
She said several low-income countries are already paying almost 3% of their total economic output to service debt.
""And as interest rates go up that is going to go up further. So I think this is indeed a period where one has to be very careful about what's going on in terms of debt servicing abilities of countries.""
A G20 debt service suspension on official bilateral debt expired at the end of 2021, but progress has been slow on implementing a broader G20 debt restructuring framework for poor countries, with Chinese and private sector creditors showing reluctance to fully participate. 
World Bank President David Malpass warned of an increasing default risk https://www.reuters.com/article/world-bank-outlook-malpass/world-banks-malpass-says-poor-country-risks-grow-as-debt-relief-delayed-idUSL1N2TR18V for developing countries last week. He noted that the poorest countries face $35 billion in debt payments to official and private creditors, of which 40% is owed to China. 

Gopinath also said the IMF was shifting from the emergency financing provided to member countries in 2020 and 2021 to help them deal with the immediate pandemic health and economic crisis to more long-term, traditional financing programs.
""We will be increasingly doing the more traditional upper credit type lending programs which would have the conditionalities that come with helping countries solve difficult problems of their country -- the kind of imbalances that they need to address to be able to have sustainable growth and market access,"" Gopinath said.

(Reuters) -The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday lowered its 2022 economic growth forecasts for Latin America and its two largest economies, citing inflation, tighter monetary policy and a lower growth estimate for the United States as keys to the downgrades.
The IMF reduced its growth expectations for Mexico and Brazil by 1.2 percentage points each to 2.8% and 0.3% respectively, while the estimate for Latin America and the Caribbean was cut by 0.6 percentage point to 2.4%.
""The fight against inflation has prompted a strong monetary policy response, which will weigh on domestic demand,"" the IMF said of Brazil's economic outlook in an update to its World Economic Outlook.
First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath told a news briefing on Tuesday that another reason for the cut to Brazil's forecast is a moderation in the prices of its commodity exports, such as iron ore, which had been elevated last year.
The Fund's report said Mexico will also be somewhat affected by inflation and higher rates, compounded by an expected drop in output growth from the United States, its most important trading partner.
""The U.S. (economic growth) downgrade brings with it the prospect of weaker-than-expected external demand for Mexico in 2022,"" the IMF said.
Argentina is seen growing 3.0% this year, a 0.5 percentage point increase from the IMF's October estimates, and the 2.5% estimated growth in 2023 is also 0.5 percentage point higher.
The South American country and the IMF are in negotiations on a program to refinance some $41 billion that Argentina has said it cannot pay as scheduled.

""We are adopting a flexible and pragmatic approach and we hope we will make even more progress in the next days,"" Gopinath said.
For 2023, the IMF sees Latin America and the Caribbean growing at a 2.6% rate, with Brazil growing 1.6% and Mexico's expansion at 2.7%.

LONDON (Reuters) -The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for British economic growth this year due to disruption from the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, labour shortages and high energy prices, but raised its estimate for growth in 2023.
The IMF said it now expected British gross domestic product would expand by 4.7% in 2022 and by 2.3% in 2023, compared with its previous forecasts - made in October - of 5.0% and 1.9%.
The new forecasts came in a quarterly update of the IMF's World Economic Outlook https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WEO/2022/Update/January/English/text.ashx. The cut to Britain's expected growth rate in 2022 was the smallest among the Group of Seven (G7) large advanced economies, with the exception of Japan.
""In the United Kingdom, disruptions related to Omicron and supply constraints - particularly in labour and energy markets - mean that growth is revised down,"" the IMF said.
Most British households will face big increases in their domestic energy bills in April when regulated tariffs are due to rise by around 50% and broader consumer price inflation is on track to hit its highest in 30 years.
Anti-poverty campaigners have urged the government to expand the limited assistance given to poor households towards their energy bills - something that would cost between 2.5 billion and 7.3 billion pounds ($3.4-9.8 billion) depending on scope.
Asked about this at a news conference, IMF deputy managing director Gita Gopinath said more help would be beneficial but it needed to be focused on those most in need.
""Well-targeted support is important. This should be well-targeted support to highly vulnerable households who are having to face very high cost increases. That would be useful,"" she said.
Rising inflation also means the Bank of England is on course to raise interest rates next week for the second time in less than two months, after wrong-footing markets by holding off from a widely expected rate rise in November.

Gopinath said it was important for all central banks to communicate clearly and avoid unnecessary market volatility.
""Several central banks have already begun raising interest rates to get ahead of price pressures. It is key to communicate well the policy transition towards a tightening stance to ensure orderly market reaction,"" she said.

The International Monetary Fund cut its world economic growth forecast for 2022 as the Covid-19 pandemic enters its third year, citing weaker prospects for the U.S. and China along with persistent inflation.
The global economy will expand 4.4% this year, down from an estimate of 4.9% in October, the Washington-based IMF said in its World Economic Outlook on Tuesday. The fund forecast 3.8% growth for 2023, up from the prior projection, but cumulative expansion for the two years will still be 0.3 percentage point less than previously forecast. 
The U.S., the world’s largest economy, saw its forecast cut on the outlook for President Joe Biden’s spending agenda and China, the second-biggest, on challenges in real estate.
The world economy expanded 5.9% last year, the IMF estimated, the most in four decades of detailed data. That followed a 3.1% contraction in 2020 that was the worst peacetime decline in broader figures since the Great Depression.
Central banks that slashed interest rates to soften the economic decline caused by the pandemic face pressure to tighten policy to confront surging consumer prices, threatening to curtail the growth rebound. Governments also have less fiscal space for spending to address health needs and buoy their economies after piling up record debt. 
‘Be Ready’
“The last two years reaffirm that this crisis and the ongoing recovery is like no other,” Gita Gopinath, who became the fund’s No. 2 official this month after three years as its chief economist, wrote in a blog accompanying the report.
“Policy makers must vigilantly monitor a broad swath of incoming economic data, prepare for contingencies, and be ready to communicate and execute policy changes at short notice,” Gopinath said. “In parallel, bold, and effective international cooperation should ensure that this is the year the world escapes the grip of the pandemic.”
While the IMF sees the omicron variant weighing on growth in the first quarter, it expects the negative impact to fade starting in the second quarter, assuming that the global surge in infections abates and the virus doesn’t mutate into new variants that require more restrictions on mobility.
Supply-chain disruptions are spurring more broad-based inflation than anticipated, the IMF said, with the annual rate projected to average 3.9% in advanced economies this year, up from a prior 2.3% estimate, and 5.9% in emerging and developing nations. 
The IMF sees the faster pace for cost-of-living increases easing gradually later this year, assuming price expectations remain well anchored, as shipping bottlenecks ease and major economies respond with interest-rate increases.  
Advanced economies raising interest rates may create risks for financial stability and emerging-market and developing economies’ capital flows, currencies and fiscal positions after debt levels increased, the IMF said. International cooperation will be needed to preserve nations’ access to cash and facilitate orderly debt restructuring where needed, the fund said. 
IMF Projections: 
The projections assume that bad health outcomes from Covid-19 recede to low levels in most countries by the end of this year, vaccination rates improve and treatments become more available. Risks are tilted to the downside, with new variants threatening to extend the pandemic. 
Bringing the pandemic to an end depends on ending vaccine inequality, the IMF said. The fully vaccinated share of the population is about 70% for high-income countries but less than 4% for low-income nations. Eighty-six nations, accounting for 27% of the world’s population, fell short of the 40% vaccination level for the end of last year that the IMF estimates is needed to curb the pandemic.
The world also suffers from deep inequality in Covid-19 testing, with testing rates about 80 times higher in high-income nations than low-income countries.

Investing.com --It can be easy to lose sight of it, but whether the number of Russian soldiers that ends up permanently in Ukraine is zero, or 100,000, or anywhere in between, the big risk to the global economy this year remains China.
The world’s second-largest economy has to pick a difficult path between the twin risks of Covid-19 and a slow-motion real estate bust: deadening the economy with lockdowns on the one hand, while supporting it with easier monetary and prudential policy on the other.
A clear slowdown looks inevitable. As western governments withdraw their stimulus measures and reopen their economies, the dramatic shift in global demand since 2020 toward manufactured goods (mostly made in China) will reverse. The country notched 29.9% export growth last year, generating yet another record trade surplus. That is not sustainable.
China needs its global customers to take the strain off its manufacturing sector, not least because its zero-tolerance Covid-19 leaves perilously little margin for safety in the global supply chains it feeds. Reported case numbers are now falling, and the much-publicized lockdown in the city of Xi’an has now been lifted, but Omicron is so contagious that the upcoming Lunar New Year celebrations still carry an obvious risk of spreading it more broadly across the country. 
At the same time, the real estate sector that has been the other big driver of economic growth over recent years is also slowing. While the authorities have managed to avoid disorderly defaults in the sector, they have been less successful in creating the kind of conditions needed to ensure that fundamentally sound companies can still find credit. At 11.6%, outstanding loans to the economy are growing at their slowest annual rate in 20 years.
Markets cheered in December when a committee dominated by state-owned institutions took control of debt restructuring talks at Evergrande, the country’s largest and most indebted developer, thinking that clear political direction would accelerate the cleanup and quickly bring clarity back to the sector.
However, that hasn’t happened. Evergrande’s international creditors said last week they will start to enforce their rights against the company after being ignored by the company for weeks, complaining of a “lack of engagement and opaque decision-making…contrary to well established international standards in restructuring processes of this magnitude.”
A public letter from the creditors suggests that there will be little left over for them once Evergrande’s politically well-connected restructuring committee has hacked off the juiciest bits of the carcass. “Barely a few days pass without another news story or regulatory announcement disclosing yet further and hitherto undisclosed liabilities, pledges, asset sales and dispositions and/or government appropriations,” the creditors said.
Small wonder that international bond markets remain closed to Chinese developers. The lack of refinancing alternatives is generating a steady drip of default notices – Hong Kong-listed Yuzhou Properties (HK:1628) becoming the latest to say it will fail to meet its obligations.
The authorities are at least trying to compensate by making domestic financing conditions easier. The People’s Bank of China cut a suite of benchmark interest rates over the last week and talked up the possibility of doing more. It has the room to do so because inflation is falling, both for consumers and for manufacturers (in stark contrast to western economies). The yuan, meanwhile, is in rude health, reaching its highest in nearly four years.
Chinese markets may remain susceptible to other shocks, such as the regulators’ campaign against the country’s biggest Internet companies last year. But the authorities have succeeded in avoiding disaster, both with the pandemic and its property developers, in a way that many western nations haven’t. For companies and investors in Europe and the U.S. who depend on that stability continuing, that’s good news.",,,,,

Investing.com -- The selloff in  U.S. equities looks set to resume at the open, despite Monday's violent short squeeze. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) lead a cast of thousands reporting quarterly results and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to drop its planned acquisition of ARM. German business gets less gloomy and the Federal Reserve begins a two-day policy meeting. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 25th January.
1. U.S. stocks set to open lower again as rebound fades
Monday’s late rally may prove to have been nothing but a head fake. U.S. stock futures were clearly down again in the overnight session, after a violent short squeeze on Monday ran out of steam.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 127 points, or 0.4%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 1.3%. That more than wipes out the net gains from Monday’s session, although it’s nowhere near the intraday lows seen in the first couple of hours of trading.
The market’s big test later will come from the corporate earnings roster, which starts with Johnson & Johnson, General Electric,  American Express  (NYSE:AXP), Archer-Daniels-Midland and defense giants Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT).
However the real test of sentiment will come after the close, when Microsoft and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) have to justify their still-high valuations. Microsoft will likely be asked to elaborate on what it intends to do with its $68 billion purchase, Activision Blizzard  (NASDAQ:ATVI).
2. Fed meeting to start; Conference Board, Richmond Fed updates
The data calender, by contrast, is pretty light, with the most interesting updates coming from the housing sector. There’ll be the national house price data along with the S&P/Case-Shiller assessments of prices in November at 9 AM ET (1400 GMT).
In addition, there are the regular updates from Redbook Research at 8:55 AM ET and the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence survey at 10 AM ET, along with the Richmond Federal Reserve’s monthly business survey.
The day’s big macro event isn’t actually an event until Wednesday, of course. The Federal Reserve starts its two-day policy meeting later. It isn’t expected to change its monetary policy stance, but that won’t stop intense scrutiny of its forward guidance.
3. Nvidia ‘set to drop ARM takeover’
While Texas Instruments will give the big update from the chipmaking sector later, there are other developments already afoot.
Nvidia is reportedly preparing to drop its $40 billion deal to buy U.K.-based chip design company ARM from Softbank (OTC:SFTBY), having come to the conclusion that various regulators will kill it in any case.
Antitrust regulators in both the U.S. and China are against the deal, which also faces a national security review in the U.K.
Softbank is now preparing an IPO of ARM in due course, according to Bloomberg News.
4. German business confidence turns
Whisper it quietly, but German business is seeing signs of light at the end of the tunnel. Having fallen for the last five months, the Ifo Business Climate index inched up in January as companies reported a slight easing of supply bottlenecks.
The index rose to 95.7, defying expectations of stagnation at 94.7. While the ‘current conditions’ assessments deteriorated a little, there was a clear improvement in the ‘expectations’ component.
Shortages of chips led companies such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to report marked drops in sales last year, and data for new orders and industrial output in the final months of the year had disappointed. The Deutsche Bundesbank said yesterday that Europe’s largest economy probably shrank in the fourth quarter.
5. Oil edges higher as supply concerns trump market volatility
Crude oil prices edged higher, as the realities of supply scarcity outweighed concerns about broader volatility in risk assets.
By 6:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 0.6% at $83.77 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 0.7% at $86.00 a barrel.
The American Petroleum Institute reports its weekly U.S. inventory data at 4:30 PM as usual, with the market looking to see whether a three-week streak of builds in gasoline inventories will be broken."

(Reuters) - U.S. central bankers on Tuesday will open their first meeting of the year already in broad agreement that they need to raise interest rates soon, likely in March, to slow the economy.
They are likely not to hear a peep about it from the White House. 
The silence marks a sharp reversal for the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell. His four interest rate hikes in 2018 drew blistering criticism from President Donald Trump, who had just installed Powell atop the Fed and felt they undercut Trump's own efforts to bolster economic growth. Trump waged a public pressure campaign to stop them. 
President Joe Biden by contrast has endorsed what the Fed has signaled will be at least three interest rate hikes this year and a rapid shrinking of its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet to further raise borrowing costs. Last week Biden called Powell's retooling of policy ""appropriate"" and emphasized the decision to do so was up to the Fed. 
So why the difference? Contrasting presidential styles aside, it comes down to one thing: inflation. 
In Trump's four-year term consumer prices mostly rose around a 2% annual pace and never faster than 3%. In Biden's first year alone they shot up 7% as demand for everything from cars to hamburgers far outpaced the economy's ability to fulfill it. 
""Biden understands that the Fed's performance will influence the course of the economy and thus help to shape his and the Democrats' electoral fortunes,"" said George Washington University's Sarah Binder, author of a 2017 book on Fed governance.
PLUNGING APPROVAL
The higher prices are eating in to paychecks and outpacing strong wage growth as businesses try to woo workers after pandemic shutdowns and dislocations. 
They are also tanking Biden's approval ratings https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-approval-rating-drops-43-lowest-his-presidency-2022-01-20 and have generated comparisons to the 1970s, when President Gerald Ford tried to force businesses into holding the line on prices and his successor Jimmy Carter appointed an inflation hawk - Paul Volcker - to finally end the upward spiral.
So, far from fighting the Fed's pivot to tighter policy, Biden is in fact betting on it. 
If things go right, the Fed's raising rates from current near-zero levels will slow demand by making it more expensive to borrow and tempering spending impulses among consumers and businesses. 
Powell says the economy is strong enough https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-powell-idCNL1N2TR1FJ to handle it and in fact will not be able to grow at its full potential if inflation stays high for too long and gets entrenched in business and household psychology. 
He also hopes for help in areas he cannot control - supply chains and the pandemic. If supply chains get untangled, businesses can obtain needed parts and materials more easily, reducing upward price pressure. And if the pandemic eases, more workers who stayed out of the job market because of health concerns or childcare burdens may return, reducing upward wage pressure.
But in backing Powell, Biden also risks a potentially toxic mix - a Fed that is tightening policy just as government aid that bolstered demand last year drops off, and supply chains that remain tangled. Tensions on the Russian-Ukraine border could add to the uncertainty.
And that could mean a scenario where the Fed ends up tightening policy more than the economy can tolerate.
FED CREDIBILITY ON THE LINE
Biden, who renominated Powell for a second term starting next month, is betting that Powell will pull it off, raising rates fast enough keep inflation from getting entrenched but not so fast they bring economic growth to a standstill.
""If there's no 'soft landing,' a recession would put Biden in even greater electoral danger,"" Binder said.
Meanwhile Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen are trying to resurrect his stalled spending plans aimed at lowering the cost of childcare and enabling more working parents to rejoin the workforce, among other things. They also hope to fix failed supply chains blamed for driving prices higher.
Still, it is not clear that their efforts will pay off, and if the slow rate hikes the Fed has so far signaled will be enough to tamp down inflation.
""If the (Fed) wants to be a more active contributor to bringing down inflation - as opposed to playing a more limited role and mainly waiting for the effects of pandemic supply-demand imbalances and fiscal stimulus to fade - then it will need to do enough to tighten financial conditions materially,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economists wrote earlier this month. 
That, they wrote, could mean four or more rate hikes this year.
There will be two months more of inflation data before the Fed's March meeting, enough to show whether it is cooling on its own as policymakers repeatedly but wrongly forecast it would last year. 
If inflation continues to run hot, the Fed may not only need to do more rates hikes, but may need to deliver them earlier, wrote SGH Macro Advisors' Tim Duy. 

""This is especially the case given the growing political costs of inflation,"" said Duy, noting that the political risk is not just for the Biden administration, but also for the Powell Fed.
""Its credibility with the public and on Capitol Hill requires that it meet its mandate"" of 2% inflation on average, Duy wrote.

DUBAI (Reuters) -The World Bank blasted Lebanon's ruling class on Tuesday for ""orchestrating"" one of the world's worst national economic depressions due to their exploitative grip on resources. 
The global lender said the nation's elite https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-deputy-pm-talks-with-imf-focus-budget-banking-sector-exchange-rate-2022-01-24 were still abusing their position despite Lebanon suffering possibly one of the three biggest financial crashes globally since the 1850s.
""Lebanon's deliberate depression is orchestrated by the country's elite that has long captured the state and lived off its economic rents,"" the World Bank said in a press release attached to a report on the Lebanese economy https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/36862/LEM%20Economic%20Monitor%20Fall%202021.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y.
""It has come to threaten the country's long-term stability and social peace,"" the released added, echoing public sentiments that have prompted angry protests in recent years.
Fuelled by massive debt and the unsustainable way it was financed, the crisis has slashed Lebanon's gross domestic product (GDP) by 58.1% since 2019, plummeting to an estimated $21.8 billion in 2021, the World Bank said.
Already one of the most unequal countries, millions more have been pushed into poverty. The World Bank expected those below the poverty line to have risen by as much as 28 percentage points by the end of 2021, after an increase of 13 percentage points in 2020.
Government revenues collapsed by almost half in 2021 to reach 6.6% of GDP: the lowest ratio globally after Somalia and Yemen, the bank said.
Real GDP is estimated to have declined by 10.5% last year, according to the report, while gross debt is estimated to have reached 183% percent of GDP, a ratio only exceeded by Japan, Sudan and Greece.
'DELIBERATE DEPRESSION'
""Deliberate denial during deliberate depression is creating long-lasting scars on the economy and society,"" said Saroj Kumar Jha, the World Bank's regional director of the Mashreq.
""Over two years into the financial crisis, Lebanon has yet to identify, least of all embark upon, a credible path toward economic and financial recovery.""
While government finances improved in 2021, that was driven by a decline in spending even steeper than in revenues, the World Bank said.
It projects a fiscal deficit of 0.4% of GDP in 2021 from 3.3% of GDP last year, helped by a recovery in tourism. Arrivals leapt 101.2% in the first seven months of last year, though still impacted by the pandemic.
But a sudden halt to capital inflows and a large current account deficit was steadily eroding reserves, the World Bank said.
Lebanon began talks with the IMF on Monday, hoping to secure a bailout - something Beirut has failed to achieve since 2020, with no sign of long-delayed economic reforms sought by donors. 
""This elite commands the main economic resources, generating large rents and dividing the spoils of a dysfunctional state,"" the World Bank said.
Lebanon's politicians, former militia leaders and others from families wielding influence for generations over the Christian and Muslim communities often acknowledge corruption exists. But they generally deny individual responsibility and say they are doing their best to rescue the economy.
The crisis has caused massive losses in the financial system, estimated by the government in December at $69 billion.

""Worryingly, key public and private actors continue to resist recognition of these losses, perpetuating the zombie-like state of the economy,"" the World Bank said.
The nosediving exchange rate - the Lebanese pound has lost more than 90% of its value since 2019 - should have boosted exports. ""This did not happen,"" the World Bank said, hindered by pre-crisis economic fundamentals, global conditions and the institutional environment.

FRANKFURT/TOKYO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Today's central bankers have the unenviable task of weaning a pandemic-hit global economy off cheap money amid unprecedented sovereign debt levels and with asset prices inflated by years of stimulus and near-zero interest rates.
What's more, the risk of errors may be all the greater given that many of them have no experience of raising interest rates - and hardly any have ever had to do it in the face of inflation at multi-year highs and pushing way beyond target.
""Even in the old days, when inflation-fighting was every central banker's job, it proved extremely difficult to pull off a 'soft landing' that would bring inflation down without causing a recession,"" said Peter Ireland, an economics professor at Boston College.
Before the current price spikes brought on by surging energy costs, snags in global supply chains and a generalised demand-supply mismatch as the world economy emerges from last year's lockdowns, inflation had been on the back burner for years.
Factors ranging from technology, cheap Chinese exports, population aging and global recessions have all been cited as behind the fall from the double-digit heights of the 1980s to the 2% or less that most major economies had become used to.
While some of today's central bankers were around for a modest - and swiftly reversed - rate-hiking cycle in the second half of the last decade, some don't even have that to draw on.
None of the Bank of Japan's current nine-member board has ever instituted a hike. Even Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya was in a non-policy-making role for the last rate increase in 2007 to counter what proved a short-lived reprieve from deflation.
At the European Central Bank, Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot had been in office for less than two weeks when the ECB last raised interest rates in 2011. He is the only member of the current 25-head Governing Council to have tasted such action.
Some suggest the fact the two 2011 hikes - made on the eve of the euro zone debt crisis - have gone down in history as the ECB’s biggest policy error in two decades of existence could create a ""once bitten twice shy"" mentality.
""There is indeed a risk of a policy mistake of being too dovish for too long, partly because of institutional memory,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. 
""Even if these policymakers were not around, the institution will always remember the 2011 mistake or the 2008 hike,"" he said of a separate rate hike cycle on the eve of the global financial crisis which also had to be quickly reversed. 
Main Fed, ECB, BOJ rates https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxoqmlbpx/Pasted%20image%201643100080295.png 
MISGIVINGS
With the exception of Gov. Chris Waller, the Fed's current policymakers were in their present jobs for at least part of a rate hiking cycle that ran from late 2015 to the end of 2018.
But that round of rate increases was different in scale to the inflation wars fought by earlier Fed leaders, most famously Paul Volcker's move in 1980 to head off spiralling prices with a record 20% benchmark rate, albeit at the cost of deep recession. 
The most recent cycle was slow to get going – with a single quarter point rate increase in 2015 and no more until a year later – and stalled in 2019 with the short-term interest rate set in a range between 2.25-2.5%, low by historic standards.
Even then, there were misgivings. The current nominee to be vice chair, Gov. Lael Brainard, later saw the decision to raise rates from the zero lower bound as something that may have led to an ""unwarranted loss of opportunity for many Americans"".
With U.S. inflation now at multi-decade highs and more than twice the Fed's 2% target, some analysts predict they may end up doing something the bank has not done in more than two decades – raise rates by a half a percentage point in one go.
Even inflation hawks like Waller acknowledge that such a move - which at least for now is not in the cards - would be a shock to today's financial markets, used as they are to a low-inflation, low-interest rate combination.
POLITICAL MASTERS
Other central banks in G7 economies such as Britain and Canada also went through some policy-tightening towards the end of the 2010s and the Bank of England has already committed a fresh 15-basis point rise last month.
In the decade between the global financial crisis and the pandemic, the Bank of Canada took rates from 0.25% to 1.75% by March 2020; over the same period, Bank of England rates only got as high as 0.75%, a rise of barely 25 basis points.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey at one point in November felt compelled to state that ""we are in the price stability business"", in an attempt to quell market concerns his bank was reluctant to act.
Any hesitations among the current generation of central bankers about turning the screw on borrowing rates may be compounded by a newly pressing factor: the huge debt pile created by pandemic-era emergency stimulus programmes.
In 2020, the largest ever one-year surge since World War II put global debt at $226 trillion, with debt held by governments alone rising to a record 99% of global output.
At those levels, even a small move by central bankers to raise the cost of borrowing will be felt by national treasuries.

""It's not so much that they (the bankers) will be reluctant but that their political masters will start making noises quickly,"" Charles Goodhart, who served on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee between 1997 and 2000, told Reuters. 
""So if they become very unhappy, it tends to feed back to you, and of course they will become unhappy.""

712,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 05:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Jerome Powell’s first four years as Federal Reserve chair were defined by saving the U.S. economy from the historic challenge of the pandemic. His second term -- and his legacy -- will be about saving the economy from overheating.
Powell and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, who meet Tuesday and Wednesday, are wrestling with how to quell the highest inflation in a generation without stalling labor market gains. 
The risks of error in this quest for a soft landing are big: move too fast and the economy tips back into recession. Go too slow and inflation gets entrenched.
Powell’s emergency support of financial markets in 2020 as Covid-19 spread helped stage a solid recovery in 2021. His dexterity won backing from both parties and ultimately his nomination by President Joe Biden to a second term.
Now, “that legacy is being challenged” by inflation that’s too high and the Fed’s response which to some appears too slow, said Tim Duy, chief economist at SGH Macro Advisors. “It is going to be hard to glide path prices back to the 2% target” quickly without inducing a recession.
Officials are expected to signal a rate hike in March after their meeting ends Wednesday. But Powell may need to open the door to more increases this year than the three projected in their December forecasts. Some urge that Powell suggest that every meeting is live for a potential rate hike if warranted.
He will have to balance that message with the Fed’s commitment to a new framework that pledges to let the labor market to run hot in pursuit of broad-based and inclusive gains. There is also the issue of financial market fragility. The S&P 500 has slid more than 7% since the end of last year, in part because of nerves surrounding the Fed’s tightening.
Plus, U.S. central bankers are operating in a very different inflation climate than the last time they lifted interest rates from near zero, in December 2015. Back then, the Fed’s preferred inflation index rose by 0.2% over the prior 12 months, compared to 5.7% in the most recent reading.
As the Fed chair prepares for his first press conference of the year, critics see two pressing areas for more clarity: the pace of rate increases and the balance sheet.
One hitch in Fed communication is that officials talk a lot about their baseline projection. They don’t have a good way to describe their collective response to a rapidly evolving outlook, and they refresh their forecasts only once a quarter.
Right now, their baseline from December doesn’t look fully credible, says Anna Wong, chief U.S. economist for Bloomberg Economics.
“They have the unemployment rate falling to 3.5% this year, below their long-run sustainable rate, and staying there in the next two years, and yet inflation drifts down back down to 2.1% in 2024,” she said.
Meanwhile, they forecast their policy rate would rise to just above 2% -- not even reaching what they view as restrictive territory.
“Despite retiring the word ‘transitory’ that forecast still suggests that they think inflation is mostly supply driven and will go away on its own,” said Wong, who forecasts the Fed will have to raise the benchmark policy rate five times this year.
Some officials are starting to publicly second guess their December estimates.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard says that it might take four increases to slow down prices instead of three as he had thought. Governor Chris Waller argued three hikes was still his baseline forecast, but cautioned that four or even five moves in 2022 may be needed if inflation fails to abate as expected.
With the committee already shifting, Powell has a chance at his Wednesday press conference to open the door to a rate path with more than three increases this year.
He could even dislodge the idea that hikes only happen quarterly by suggesting that every meeting -- there are seven more scheduled in 2022 following this week’s gathering -- is potentially live for a move.
Investors have already priced in four increases for this year with the first in March. Some say they could do more, including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). who sees “a risk that the FOMC will want to take some tightening action at every meeting” until inflation is cooled.
Minutes from the December meeting showed a consensus among Fed officials on running off their balance sheet not long after rate liftoff. Powell said earlier this month that the committee wants to move “a little faster” and said more clarity is coming.
Officials say that shrinking their balance sheet will put some upward pressure on longer-term borrowing costs. That tightens financial conditions and works a bit like a conventional rate hike, though the exact impact is hard to judge.
The Fed chair might spell out how the tightening of financial conditions through balance sheet runoff meshes with rate increases -- one way perhaps to explain the moderate pace of tightening in their December outlook.
“There is a consensus that the committee wants to get a plan of quantitative tightening in the right place so it is part of the policy mix,” said Julia Coronado, partner at MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC. “There is less consensus around equivalency with rate hikes” or its impact on financial conditions, she added.
Fed Credibility
Powell has repeatedly said that policy makers need to be nimble as they adjust to an economy that’s responding in unexpected ways during the pandemic. That reflects some hard-won lessons over the last year.
Central bankers insisted for months that price surges would be temporary as demand shifted from goods to services and supply constraints eased. But consumer prices marched higher, reaching 7% last month -- the most in almost four decades. Even Biden is telling the central bank to start fighting inflation and normalize policy.
Some question if the Fed behind is the curve and whether Powell will adjust.
“They sure seemed to have dragged their feet in response to their inflation threat,” said Mark Spindel, chief investment officer at MBB Capital Partners. “Are they hard wired to move gradually?”

(Reuters) - The extra amount the world must spend each year to create a ""net-zero"" emissions economy is equivalent to half all profits currently generated by companies globally, consultancy group McKinsey estimated in a report on the energy transition.
It said its calculation was much higher than most other estimates by economists but stressed such investments could be lucrative and the long-term costs of not doing enough to tackle climate change would be greater.
""We find that the transition would be universal, significant, and front-loaded, with uneven effects on sectors, geographies, and communities, even as it creates growth opportunities,"" it concluded. 
Although time is running out, reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 would give the world a chance of capping temperature rises at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - avoiding the worst fall-out from climate change.
The report's main finding was that this would require spending on physical assets for energy and land-use systems of about $275 trillion, or $9.2 trillion per year on average - an annual increase of $3.5 trillion on current spending.
""The increase is approximately equivalent, in 2020, to half of global corporate profits, one-quarter of total tax revenue and 7 percent of household spending,"" it calculated.
The amount of cumulative spending would be equivalent to about 7.5% of world output from 2021-2050, far higher than the 2-3% of global output which climate economists polled by Reuters in 2021 estimated was needed each year. 
McKinsey put the difference down to the fact that it was including a broad view of spending by households, businesses, agriculture and forestry as well as some continued spend on high-emissions assets like fossil fuel–based vehicles.
""While these spending requirements are large and financing has yet to be established, many investments have favorable return profiles and should not be seen as merely costs,"" it added.
Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at New York University not involved with the report, welcomed its attempt to come up with a comprehensive view of the investments needed.
""Climate policy means massive investment, and a massive rejigging of market forces from the current high-carbon and low-efficiency path onto a low-carbon and high-efficiency one,"" said Wagner.
""We just spent trillions of dollars because of COVID relief. So, would it be feasible? Yes. Would it involve massive changes? Of course, that too. Where is the money coming from? Ratepayers, taxpayers or shareholders?""

The McKinsey report noted large uncertainties relating to how such a transition would play out and that some populations and sectors would be more exposed than others to disruption, notably poorer countries and those reliant on fossil fuels.
It added: ""The economic and social costs of a delayed or abrupt transition would raise the risk of asset-stranding, worker dislocations, and a backlash that delays the transition.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - German companies doing business in China are worried the Omicron coronavirus variant will trigger more strict lockdown measures from Beijing that could exacerbate supply chain problems, the DIHK Chamber of Commerce said on Tuesday.
""The Chinese strategy with targeted lockdowns has been very efficient so far,"" Jens Hildebrandt, DIHK's executive board member in China, told Reuters in an interview.
But the more contagious Omicron variant could challenge the zero-COVID approach by Chinese authorities, especially as more Chinese citizens will travel across the country due to the upcoming holiday season, Hildebrandt said.
""There will be a lot of travel despite warnings,"" he said.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday called on China to reassess its zero-COVID approach given the emergence of the highly contagious Omicron variant.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the strategy, which has included sealing off entire cities with millions of citizens, had increasingly proved to be a burden for the domestic and global economy.
""The criticism of the IMF is not entirely unjustified,"" Hildebrandt said.
But he added Beijing would probably stick to its zero-COVID strategy, in part because scientific studies suggested Chinese vaccines were not as effective against Omicron as mRNA vaccines from Western countries.
The DIHK's concerns were echoed by the BDI industry association.
""Should the Omicron variant also be transmitted more quickly and easily in China, this could again become a bottleneck for global supply chains and fuel a recession in certain sectors of German industry,"" BDI said in its ""Global Growth Outlook"" published on Monday.
With the Olympic Games starting in Beijing next week, thousands of foreigners would enter the country and increase the infection risk from Omicron, potentially leading to more strict lockdowns, BDI warned.

This could pose new challenges for producers and exporters as well as companies at the end of the supply chain, it said.
""The bottlenecks would probably also be accompanied by higher prices, which would continue to affect inflation,"" BDI said. ""The development of the coronavirus pandemic in China thus poses a risk for the recovery process of the German industry.""

PRAGUE/BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Czech foundry Benes a Lat has seen its energy bill double in the past year and its finance director is racing to get client contracts rewritten so it can pass on some of the burden.
The family firm's challenge is mirrored in thousands of companies across central Europe, big and small, which are grappling with soaring costs for everything from parts, materials and transport to energy and growing wage demands.
""We are an energy-consuming (firm), so it's had a huge impact,"" Benes a Lat's Chief Financial Officer Jan Lat said. 
""We are in negotiation with customers to get indexing (with energy prices) back into contracts to follow market prices. Clearly every buyer's first reaction is: It's your problem!""
Where companies are successful in sharing the pain, this feeds into consumer inflation and adds to a price spike in central Europe that has been stronger than elsewhere on the continent due to the region's consumer-driven recoveries and ultra-tight labour markets.
The extent to which companies are able to lift prices at the beginning of 2022 can help determine where inflation will peak and how much further the region's central banks need to tighten policy, analysts say. There is a growing risk that inflation will be stronger than some expect.
""Companies are trying to shift higher costs at least partially to customers, which will feed into inflation,"" said Michal Brozka, a Komercni Banka economist in Prague. 
Central European firms ended 2021 on a bullish note with business sentiment surveys improving, while consumer demand has stayed solid.
The region is facing the same inflationary pressures as others, but is also battling strong wage growth with unemployment rates among the lowest in the EU.
The Czech National Bank signalled this month inflation will be higher than previously expected, likely rising above 9% at the beginning of 2022 with a chance of going past 10%.
Policymakers have already raised interest rates significantly, unlike the European Central Bank which has sought to look past the price spike in the adjacent euro zone.
COSTS SURGING
Led by energy prices, soaring costs are being felt by goods producers across central Europe.
A survey by the Hungarian GKI Institute in December showed small- and medium-sized businesses expect on average a 15% rise in costs in 2022, partly due to a 20% hike in the minimum wage by the government before an April 3 election. 
A Czech Industry Confederation survey found one in five firms expected to raise prices by at least 10%, and 38% will raise prices by 5-10%.
Czech dairy group Madeta raised prices on its products by 10% or more this month. 
""We are trying to pass higher costs for energy, packaging materials and other inputs as much as we can into output prices. Unfortunately there is no other way,"" Madeta director Milan Teply said.
In Hungary, carmaker Suzuki is also passing some of its higher costs onto customers. ""We are doing our best to optimize our costs but we will be forced to build a part of this rise into prices,"" the company told Reuters.
LOOKING FOR THE PEAK
Capital Economics said last week that inflation is likely to remain high or fall back toward targets more slowly than expected in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.
Hungarian rate setters meet on Tuesday, and analysts expect the base rate to rise another 30 basis points to a nearly eight-year high of 2.7% to tackle inflation at a 14-year peak of 7.4%.
Analysts in a Reuters poll forecast average inflation this year climbing to 5.5%, the highest since 2012 and a full 65 basis points above forecasts from a month earlier.
The National Bank of Poland, battling inflation that is already at a more than two-decade high of 8.6%, has lifted its main rate by 215 basis points to 2.25% since October.
Grzegorz Maliszewski, chief economist at Bank Millennium in Warsaw, said companies can continue passing on higher input prices while consumer demand stays strong.
He added Poland's main interest rate could climb to 4% this year.
In the Czech Republic, producer prices grew last year at their fastest pace since 1995.
Markets are betting the country's central bank will hike its main rate, now at 3.75%, by another 50 basis points in February, following 300 basis points of rises between September and December. Some analysts think the rate could peak this year close to 5%. 

""...input cost increases are so broad... the pass-through to consumer prices is inevitable,"" said Jakub Seidler, chief economist with the Czech Banking Association. 
""(The pass-through) will be much higher than we have seen in previous years.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Major central banks in sub-Saharan Africa will leave interest rates unchanged in coming days, starting with Nigeria and Kenya, and followed by Ghana at the end of the month, a Reuters poll suggested on Tuesday.
In a survey carried out in the past week, median forecasts showed analysts expected the central banks of Nigeria and Kenya to keep rates on hold at 11.50% and 7.00% respectively. Ghana was seen leaving borrowing costs at 14.50% next week.
""In Nigeria, FX policy will be the main focus of the MPC meeting, amid recent oil price strength,"" Razia Khan of Standard Chartered said. 
""While we expect the Central Bank of Kenya to keep its policy rate on hold at 7.00%, with inflation risks increasing, policy normalisation will likely be a key focus at the press conference,"" Khan added.
Interest rates for these central banks have been relatively low since around 2015. However, Ghana and South Africa kicked off tightening last year, with the latter expected to hike rates again on Thursday to 4.00%. [ECILT/ZA]
Financial Derivatives wrote in a note that heightened inflationary pressures could force most central banks in Africa to adopt a contractionary monetary policy, following in the footsteps of some advanced economies.
Policymakers in the United States expect as many as three quarter-percentage-point rate increases this year, starting in March, with more likely in 2023 and 2024.
This development is expected to attract capital flows to the dollar, likely weakening local currencies and stoking inflation.
For that reason, not all respondents expected rates to stay on hold. 
Leeuwner Esterhuysen of Oxford Economics expects the Bank of Ghana to hike its policy rate by 100 basis points at the coming meeting as part of its ongoing attempt to re-anchor inflation expectations.
Esterhuysen said economic momentum garnered in the second half of 2021 was set to spill over into this year, supporting his expectation for a rate hike. 
""Also, Ghana would like to pre-empt the Fed's (expected) end-March rate hike in order to prevent significant capital outflows,"" Esterhuysen said.
The Reuters poll suggests rates will rise by end-September to 15.00%, 7.50% and 12.50% respectively in Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria.

Growth in Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria was expected to recover this year, with these economies set to expand 5.1%, 5.0% and 2.8% after a difficult 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's central bank tightened its monetary policy settings on Tuesday in its first out-of-cycle move in seven years, as global supply constraints and brisk economic demand elevate inflation pressures across the region.
The city-state's trade-dependent economy is highly susceptible to swings in global inflation and the central bank's sudden move comes as price pressures ring alarm bells for policymakers elsewhere in Asia.
Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC, said she expects the central bank to tighten again in April, describing Tuesday's move as only a ""slight tightening.""
""If they had announced a more aggressive tightening today, then that would have dampened expectations for April,"" she said.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which manages monetary policy through exchange rate settings, said it would slightly raise the rate of appreciation of its policy band.
The width of the band, known as the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate, or S$NEER, and the level at which it is centered will be unchanged.
The MAS, which typically holds scheduled policy reviews twice a year, once in April and then in October, last surprised with an off-cycle move in January 2015 when it eased its policy after a collapse in global oil prices.
Last year, many Asia-Pacific economies largely shrugged off inflationary threats that had rattled policymakers in Europe and the United States but that thinking now appears to be shifting.
Australia's core inflation flew to its fastest annual pace since 2014 in the December quarter, data showed on Tuesday, challenging the central bank's benign interest rate outlook.
In Japan, a country renowned for its stubbornly tepid price growth, policymakers have also acknowledged creeping inflation pressures.
Elsewhere, investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate in March with the central bank likely to step up its rhetoric against inflation at its meeting this week.
Singapore's policy move comes just a day after data showed core inflation in the city-state climbed in December by the fastest pace in nearly eight years.
""This move builds on the pre-emptive shift to an appreciating stance in October 2021 and is appropriate for ensuring medium-term price stability,"" the MAS said, referring to its tightening move late last year.
The central bank is due to review its stance in April, when it was widely expected by economists to tighten again.
The Singapore dollar strengthened to 1.3425 versus the U.S. dollar, its highest since October 2021.
'DOUBLE TIGHTENING'
Singapore's bellwether economy is expected to grow 3-5%, unchanged from earlier forecasts.
""2022 will be year of double tightening for Singapore - both fiscal and monetary levers will grind tighter,"" said OCBC's Ling.
The MAS expects Singapore's economic recovery, which has so far been led by the trade-related and services sectors, to extend to the domestic-oriented and travel-related sectors this year as COVID-19 restrictions are eased.
Singapore has vaccinated 88% of its 5.5 million people against COVID-19 and 55% have received booster shots.
The MAS forecasts core inflation to be 2.0–3.0% this year, from the 1.0–2.0% expected in October. Headline inflation is expected to be 2.5–3.5%, from the earlier forecast range of 1.5–2.5%.
""While core inflation is expected to moderate in the second half of the year from the elevated levels in the first half as supply constraints ease, the risks remain skewed to the upside,"" the MAS said.
Singapore will release its annual budget on Feb. 18, when the government is expected to announce the timing for an anticipated hike in goods and services tax.
The city-state's economy grew 7.2% in 2021, its fastest pace in over a decade, rebounding from a record 5.4% contraction in 2020. The government has spent more than S$100 billion over the last two years to cushion its economy from the impact of the pandemic.

Instead of interest rates, the MAS manages policy by letting the local dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed band.
It adjusts its policy via three levers: the slope, mid-point and width of the policy band.

RAJPURA, India (Reuters) - Srijan Upadhyay supplied fried snacks to small eateries and roadside stalls in the poor eastern Indian state of Bihar before COVID-19 lockdowns forced most of his customers to close down, many without paying what they owed him.
With his business crippled, the 31-year-old IT undergraduate this month travelled to Rajpura town in Punjab state to meet with consultants who promised him a work visa for Canada. He brought along his neighbour who also wants a Canadian visa because his commerce degree has not helped him get a job.
""There are not enough jobs for us here, and whenever government vacancies come up, we hear of cheating, leaking of test papers,"" Upadhyay said, waiting in the lounge of Blue Line consultants. ""I am sure we will get a job in Canada, whatever it is initially.""
India's unemployment is estimated to have exceeded the global rate in five of the last six years, data from Mumbai-based the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) and International Labour Organization show, due to an economic slowdown that was exacerbated by the pandemic.
Having peaked at 23.5% in April 2020, India's joblessness rate dropped to 7.9% last month, according to CMIE.
The rate in Canada fell to a multi-month-low of 5.9% in December, while the OECD group of mostly rich countries reported a sixth straight month of decline in October, with countries including the United States suffering labour shortages as economic activity picks up.

What's worse for India, its economic growth is producing fewer jobs than it used to, and as disheartened jobseekers instead take menial roles or look to move overseas, the country's already low rate of workforce participation - those aged 15 and above in work or looking for it - is falling.
""The situation is worse than what the unemployment rate shows,"" CMIE Managing Director Mahesh Vyas told Reuters. ""The unemployment rate only measures the proportion who do not find jobs of those who are actively seeking jobs. The problem is the proportion seeking jobs itself is shrinking."" 
Graphic: Labour participation rate (LPR)- https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-UNEMPLOYMENT/INDIA-UNEMPLOYMENT/jnvwejnnlvw/chart.png 
VOCAL FOR LOCAL
Critics say such hopelessness among India's youth is one of the biggest failures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who first came to power in 2014 with his as yet unfulfilled promise of creating millions of jobs.
It also risks India wasting its demographic advantage of having more than two-thirds of its 1.35 billion people of working age https://data.oecd.org/pop/working-age-population.htm.
The ministries of labour and finance did not respond to requests for comment. The labour ministry's career website had more than 13 million active jobseekers as of last month, with only 220,000 vacancies.
The ministry told parliament in December that ""employment generation coupled with improving employability is the priority of the government"", highlighting its focus on small businesses.
Modi's rivals are now trying to tap into the crisis ahead of elections in five states, including Punjab and most populous Uttar Pradesh, in February and March.
""Because of a lack of employment opportunities here, every kid looks at Canada. Parents hope to somehow send their kids to Canada,"" Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, whose Aam Admi Party is a front-runner in Punjab elections, told a recent public function there.
""I assure you, within five years they will start returning because we will create so many opportunities for them here.""
He did not explain, but party workers said their policies would attract job-creating businesses.
Punjab's neighbour Haryana, home to local offices of many global IT companies and an automobiles hub, has already ordered that most jobs there be reserved for locals. A political party in Punjab has promised something similar if voted to power.
""To an extent, if a particular sector is doing well, then some arrangements can be made to ensure that local youth get opportunities,"" said Amit Basole, head of the Centre for Sustainable Employment in Azim Premji University in Bengaluru.
""But if overall job creation is weak, then such policies do not solve the underlying problem. And they may also make things worse by reducing investment."" 
CMIE's Vyas said India needs more investment in labour-intensive industries and should bring more women into the labour force, like Bangladesh has done through its garments factories.
""NO ONE DELIVERS""
Between 2018 and 2021, India suffered its longest period of slowdown since 1991, with unemployment averaging 7.2%, CMIE data shows. Global unemployment averaged around 5.7% in that period.
The jobs shortage is particularly problematic for a country like India where annually 12 million people reach employment age. The economy has not grown fast enough to absorb so many people, economists say.
Also, the increase in workforce for every percent rise in gross domestic product has shrunk: the economy will have to grow at 10% to raise employment by 1%, said Basole of Azim Premji University.
In the 1970s and 1980s, when GDP growth was 3% to 4%, employment grew around 2%, Basole has found.
Back in Punjab, Blue Line counsellor Lovepreet said business was booming, with his agency handling some 40 clients a day.
""I have been doing this for four years,"" said the 27-year-old, who gave only one name. ""I am off to Canada myself, this year or next year. Politicians keep promising us government jobs, but no one delivers.""

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian bond market is coming to the view that expected multiple interest rate hikes in 2022 by the Bank of Canada, including one potentially this week, will bring price pressures under control, albeit at a cost of slower economic growth. 
This marks a shift in perception that is underscored by moves in the so-called inflation breakeven rate, a market measure of inflation expectations. The 10-year breakeven rate has dropped below 1.9% this month after touching 2.3% in November, its highest level by far in data going back to 2015.
In contrast, recent survey data https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/firms-see-increasing-labor-shortages-wage-pressures-bank-canada-survey-2022-01-17 from the Canadian central bank showed that expectations for price increases among consumers and businesses have climbed.
Lowering of inflation expectations give businesses greater confidence to pursue their growth plans.
""With the market pricing in an aggressive Bank of Canada tightening cycle, it implies that inflation is less likely to remain elevated in future years,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities. 
Money markets see a 65% chance that Canada's central bank will raise its benchmark interest rate, which currently sits at 0.25%, in a policy announcement on Wednesday despite uncertainty triggered by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. It would be the first rate hike https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/even-omicron-slams-canada-bets-january-rate-hike-rise-2022-01-18 since October 2018.
Investors expect six hikes in total this year, which would lift the policy rate to its pre-pandemic level of 1.75%. The expected number of increases is up from four in December and two more than markets expect from the Federal Reserve.
The urgency that the market sees for the BoC to start tightening comes as Canadian inflation, which hit a 30-year high of 4.8% in December, threatens to overshoot the central bank's 2% target for longer by feeding expectations for future price increases.
Signs of an overheated Canadian housing market could also concern the central bank after data for December showed the average selling price of a home was up nearly 18% from a year earlier.
'PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR'
But the potential for an easing in supply-chain disruptions later this year could reduce price pressures, say economists, while past increases in energy prices will fall out of the inflation calculation over time.
""Central banks in Canada and the United States are winning the psychological war, successfully convincing investors that they are serious about fighting inflation"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN).
Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said in December that slack in Canada's economy caused by the coronavirus pandemic has substantially diminished, a key sign the central bank would begin hiking rates soon. The Fed has also turned more hawkish.
Both central banks tend to raise rates in 25-basis-point increments but could move faster.
Some time after the first hike, the BoC is expected to begin quantitative tightening, or QT, reducing the amount of bonds on its balance sheet that were bought during the pandemic to support the economy.
The combination of QT and rate hikes could weigh on economic activity, particularly after Canadians increased borrowing during the pandemic.
Household credit market debt was C$2.6 trillion in the third quarter of 2021, or about 177% as a share of income, up 10% from the final quarter of 2019. 
But employment has climbed above its pre-pandemic level and people have accumulated an unprecedented amount of savings.

Economists estimate that the increase in savings over the pre-pandemic trend could be nearly C$300 billion, or about 20% of annual spending.
Tightening ""doesn't need to imply a painful economic period,"" Kelvin said. ""It means that the period of above-trend growth probably comes to an end in the next two years.""

723,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 05:20PM ET</span>",,,"(Reuters) - The Biden administration is readying a U.S. export rule used against Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei that could curb Russia's access to global electronics supplies if President Vladimir Putin decides to invade Ukraine.
While it is unclear how the rule could impact Russia, the restrictions hobbled Huawei's smartphone business. Last month, the company said it expected 2021 revenue to have declined nearly 30% and predicted continued challenges this year.
WHAT IS THE RESTRICTION?
The Foreign Direct Product Rule, as it is called, may be adapted to halt Russia’s ability to import smartphones, key aircraft and automobile components, Reuters reported last month. 
The administration is considering restricting chips and products with integrated circuits bound for Russia, a senior official said, imposing its authority over items made abroad if they are designed with U.S. software or technology, or produced using U.S. equipment.
WHAT EXPORTS TO RUSSIA COULD BE IMPACTED?
The restrictions could apply to critical industrial sectors like artificial intelligence, maritime, defense, and civil aviation, the official said, and could also be imposed more broadly, to include consumer electronics. 
The scope of the rule against Russia has not been set but White House National Security Council officials have warned executives from the Semiconductor Industry Association, a chip lobbying group, of possible unprecedented actions, as Reuters reported last week. 
It is unclear whether the rule could have the kind of devastating effect on Russia that it has had on Huawei. 
""A strict imposition of the Foreign Direct Product rule would significantly affect trade and output in Russia, though it’s hard to say by how much,"" said Jeffrey Schott, an expert on international trade policy and economic sanctions at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 
HOW DID IT IMPACT HUAWEI?
The Foreign Direct Product Rule now restricts both U.S. and non-U.S. companies from shipping items to Huawei that are the direct product of U.S. technology or software. Such shipments can only be made with a U.S. license. 
The rule was added to the curbs on Huawei after the telecommunications equipment maker was placed on an export control blacklist known as the ""entity list"" in 2019 and it did not stop the global flow of chips to the company. 

The initial listing affected U.S.-made goods and some limited items made abroad with U.S. technology but did not block overseas shipments to Huawei from companies such as Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker. 
So in 2020, the United States added the Foreign Direct Product Rule to expand its authority to stop shipments of foreign-produced items to Huawei. Companies like TSMC that use U.S. chipmaking equipment are required to obtain U.S. licenses before supplying Huawei and licenses for sophisticated chips are denied.

The official said the licenses, previously extended for a year at a time and set to expire on Wednesday, were being extended for only 90 days.
""These authorizations were extended for a shorter time period given the current situation with Russia; further extension will be informed by Russia’s behavior,"" the official said.

The United States has warned that Russia will face massive consequences if it invades Ukraine.
The licenses authorize certain activities involving the van maker and transactions necessary to divest or transfer debt, equity or other holdings in GAZ.
The Treasury imposed sanctions in 2018 against billionaire Oleg Deripaska and eight companies in which he is a large shareholder, including automaker Gaz, citing ""malign activities"" by Russia.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday accused conservative politicians of stoking fear that COVID-19 vaccine mandates for cross-border truck drivers are exacerbating supply chain disruptions and fueling inflation.
The United States imposed a mandate, meant to aid the fight against the fast spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus, on Jan. 22, while Canada's started on Jan. 15. The trucking industry has warned the measure will take thousands of drivers off the roads during what is already a dire labor shortage in the industry.
Alberta's conservative provincial leader, Jason Kenney, called for a pause of the mandate last week, and on Monday posted pictures on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) of empty shelves in supermarkets, calling for ""immediate action"" by both the U.S. and Canadian federal governments.
""This is turning into a crisis,"" Kenney wrote.
""I regret that the Conservative Party and conservative politicians are fear mongering to Canadians about the supply chain, but the reality is that vaccination is how we're going to get through this,"" Trudeau told reporters when asked about supply chain disruptions resulting from the policy.
Pierre Poilievre, finance critic for the main federal opposition Conservative Party, last week called the requirements a ""vaccine vendetta against our hardworking truckers"" that will drive up inflation and result in ""empty shelves"" at stores.
Trudeau has resisted industry pressure to delay the mandate, saying everyone should be vaccinated and Canada is aligned with the United States, its largest trading partner. More than two-thirds of the C$650 billion ($521 billion) in goods traded annually between Canada and the United States travels on roads.
Canada's inflation rate hit a 30-year high of 4.8% in December and economists said the vaccine mandate may contribute to keeping prices higher for longer. In the United States, inflation surged 7% on a year-on-year basis in December, the largest rise in nearly four decades.
Canadian Manufactures & Exporters President and Chief Executive Dennis Darby said he and other manufacturing lobbies spoke with Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne on Friday about problems caused by the vaccine mandate.
Manufacturers are already seeing delays and price increases, Darby said.
""Our supply chain in North America is a very, very efficient supply chain, but it's not very resilient,"" Darby said in an interview on Monday. ""It doesn't have a lot of slack.""

After the meeting with Champagne, Darby's group and some 30 other trade associations called for concrete action to tackle supply chain problems, including reversing the trucker inoculation mandate.
A convoy of truckers started off from Vancouver on Sunday on its way to protest the mandate in the capital city of Ottawa.

He’ll meet with a group of Cabinet secretaries and regulators the White House calls his “Competition Council” to promote the group’s progress on an executive order he signed in July to combat excessive business consolidation.
His administration has also worked with ports, truckers and labor unions to ease supply-chain bottlenecks that have contributed to rising prices, though the president’s top economic advisers concede the government can’t do much to influence the basic forces of supply and demand.
In-person participants for Monday’s meeting at the White House include Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Attorney General Merrick Garland, Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler and Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division Jonathan Kanter, according to a White House official.
Inflation emerged last year as Biden’s topmost economic and political concern, with rising prices for everyday needs  -- including energy, food, homes and cars -- weighing heavily on his approval ratings. His administration has struggled to respond, and spiraling prices are poised to help deliver control of one or both chambers of Congress to Republicans in November’s midterm elections. 
The White House official pointed to several accomplishments that stem from Biden’s July order, including a Department of Health and Human Services’ proposed rule that would require hearing aids be sold without a prescription. The agency estimates the rule will cut prices for the devices from thousands of dollars to hundreds. 
The health department is also implementing the No Surprises Act, signed into law by former President Donald Trump which requires hospitals as of Jan. 1 to more conveniently disclose their prices to consumers or face dramatically increased federal fines.
The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission announced last week that they are joining forces to modernize rules on mergers and prevent anticompetitive deals, and Justice is also examining guidelines for bank mergers
The Transportation Department has secured refunds for tens of thousands of travelers who weren’t able to get their money back during the pandemic, the official noted. It’s also working on regulations that would require airlines to refund fees for baggage that’s delayed or for services that aren’t successfully delivered, such as WiFi and seat selection. 
The executive order asked the Federal Trade Commission to consider regulating against what it described as “unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items.” The agency voted unanimously to step up its enforcement of repair restrictions and, in turn, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced modifications to their strict repair policies. 
The administration estimates more flexible policies mean Americans could save tens of millions of dollars on repairs and replacements, the official said.
Biden agencies are also working to block the merger of Aon (NYSE:AON) Plc and Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WTW) Plc, two of the three largest U.S. insurance brokers, and of two major North American railroads, Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co. and Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) Railway, the official noted.

727,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 12:16PM ET</span>",,,,,,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Developing countries are paying more to service their debt than at any other time in the past two decades, with a heavier burden on the horizon if the United States raises interest rates this year as expected, a leading debt campaigner said on Monday.
Many developing nations have been hit hard by the economic fallout from the global pandemic. And while wealthy creditor countries granted the poorest ones temporary relief through a Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), that programme is now expiring and governments must resume payments.
The warning from the UK-based Jubilee Debt Campaign echoed a call to action earlier this month from the World Bank, which said the pandemic-induced downturn had left around 60% of low-income countries in or at high risk of debt distress.
""The debt crisis continues to engulf lower income countries, with no end in sight unless there is urgent action on debt relief,"" Heidi Chow, Jubilee's Executive Director, said in a statement.
Data compiled by Jubilee showed that developing country debt payments increased 120% between 2010 and 2021, reaching their highest level since 2001. 
Average government external debt payments represented 14.3% of government revenue in 2021, more than double the 6.8% recorded in 2010. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve is due to meet this week and markets are pricing in four interest rate hikes for this year. 
Higher Fed rates will likely make borrowing more expensive for emerging market countries, which will need to price debt at a premium as safe haven baseline U.S. Treasuries become more attractive to investors. 
Globally, 54 countries are now in debt crisis, according to Jubilee, meaning debt payments are undermining the ability of governments to protect the basic economic and social rights of their citizens. 
Kenya and Malawi have entered debt crisis this year with another 14 countries at risk of both a public and private debt crisis, the group said. 
World Bank President David Malpass https://www.reuters.com/article/world-bank-outlook-malpass-idUSL1N2TR18V this month warned that slow progress on debt relief for developing countries increased risks for their economies and made sovereign defaults more likely. 
Last year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a special allocation of $650 billion worth special drawing rights https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-finance-imf-reserves-idUSKBN2F404Q - the Fund's unit of exchange backed by dollars, euros, yen, sterling and yuan. 
The measure aimed to boost global foreign exchange reserves amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Around $275 billion of the allocation are destined for emerging market and low-income countries. 
The IMF is also proposing a $50 billion Resilience and Sustainability Trust https://blogs.imf.org/2022/01/20/a-new-trust-to-help-countries-build-resilience-and-sustainability that will allow qualifying countries to borrow reallocated SDRs.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The Omicron-fuelled wave of COVID-19 infections has led wealthy countries to intensify their recruitment of nurses from poorer parts of the world, worsening dire staffing shortages in overstretched workforces there, the International Council of Nurses said.
Sickness, burnout and staff departures amid surging Omicron cases have driven absentee rates to levels not yet seen during the two-year pandemic, said Howard Catton, CEO of the Geneva-based group that represents 27 million nurses and 130 national organisations.
To plug the gap, Western countries have responded by hiring army personnel as well as volunteers and retirees but many have also stepped up international recruitment as part of a trend that is worsening health inequity, he continued.
""We have absolutely seen an increase in international recruitment to places like the UK, Germany, Canada and the United States,"" Catton said in a Reuters interview based on a report he co-authored on COVID-19 and the global nursing force.
""I really fear this 'quick fix solution' – it's a bit similar to what we've been seeing with PPE (personal protective equipment) and vaccines where rich countries have used their economic might to buy and to hoard - if they do that with the nursing workforce it will just make the inequity even worse.""
Even before the pandemic there was a global shortage of 6 million nurses, with nearly 90% of those shortages in low and lower-middle-income countries, according to ICN data.
Some of the recent recruits to rich countries have come from sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria, and parts of the Caribbean, Catton said, saying that nurses were often motivated by higher salaries and better terms than at home.
The ICN report said this process was also being facilitated by giving nurses preferred immigration status.
""The bottom line is that some people would look at this and say this is rich countries offloading the costs of educating new nurses and health workers,"" he said.

Even wealthy countries will struggle to cope with the ""mountains of backlog of unmet care"" when the pandemic winds down, Catton warned, calling for more investment and a ten-year plan to strengthen the workforce.
""We need a coordinated, collaborative, concerted global effort which is underpinned by serious investment, not just warm words and platitudes and applause,"" he said.

729,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 11:10AM ET</span>",,,,,,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve could resort to outright asset sales to reduce its balance sheet as part of plans to fight unabated inflation, a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst said in a report.
The Fed's balance sheet roughly doubled in size during the pandemic to nearly $9 trillion, as it snapped up bonds to help keep longer-term interest rates down to support the economy.
But this has led to rising inflation, excessive leverage, and high valuations in certain segments of the stock market.
Previous rounds of ""quantitative tightening"", a reversal of the Fed's bond-buying programme, were slow-going, but this time around the Fed may move more aggressively, Credit Suisse analyst Zoltan Pozsar said in a report late last week.
""Last time, QT was meant to be like 'watching paint dry' – slow and steady ... This time around, QT is more about scraping the paint off the wall – the fresco painted during the first two years of the pandemic is out of date"", he said.
The last time the Fed embarked on shrinking its balance, sheet in 2018, it did so by allowing a number of bonds to mature without the repaid principal being reinvested in new securities.
This time, ""outright asset sales, if inflation, exuberance, or a curve inversion so dictate, are not at all unlikely"", Pozsar said.
He added that liquidity will likely be drained from reserve balances in bank portfolios and from overnight reverse repurchase balances in money market funds.

Demand for the Fed’s reverse repo facility surged last year as financial firms struggled to find places to invest their excess cash.
Investors are focusing on a Fed policy meeting this week, and will be looking for clues on whether the U.S. central bank will speed up the end of its bond purchase program, and on when it is likely to begin reducing the size of its balance sheet.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worries over a more hawkish Federal Reserve are roiling asset markets around the globe, and this week's monetary policy meeting may offer insight into how aggressive the central bank intends to be. 
Investors expect the Fed to signal on Wednesday that it plans to raise rates in March, tightening monetary policy for the first time since it slashed borrowing costs to near-zero soon after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic nearly two years ago. Fed funds futures, which track short term rate expectations, have priced in a total of four rate increases this year, as the central bank fights to stem soaring inflation.
The Fed is also expected to give a final set of instructions on bringing its asset-purchase program to an end. That process began last November and at the current pace will come to a close in mid-March, around the time the first rate hike may occur.
What the Fed does after that point with its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet is a key concern, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell may shed more light on that outlook at his press conference on Wednesday after the two-day meeting's conclusion. 
US Treasury, TIPS yields and inflation expectations https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjmyeave/US.%20Treasury%20yield%20and%20inflation%20expectations.PNG 
Concerns that the Fed's ultra-easy monetary policies are coming to an end have slammed markets this month, wreaking havoc in the biggest technology and growth names as well so-called ""meme"" stocks that entered the spotlight almost exactly a year ago. 
The Nasdaq composite is down 14% year-to-date and just notched its worst weekly loss since March 2020, while yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note have climbed 30 basis points since late November amid a selloff in government bonds. Cryptocurrencies are among the more speculative assets that have taken a beating, with bitcoin losing 25% of its market capitalization this month. 
How long the turbulence continues depends in part on investors' view of how quickly the Fed will need to raise interest rates to battle inflation, which rose at its fastest pace in nearly four decades in December. 
""The Fed is definitely sensitive to the equity market, but I don't think it changes anything for the meeting,"" said Peter Cramer, head of insurance portfolio management at SLC Management in Seattle.
""If the sell-off leaks to the broader economy and starts to impact the energy, banking, consumer cyclical type names, then I think the Fed would question their path a little bit,"" he added.
If history is any indication, the central bank will likely try to avoid rattling markets further and raise rates in 25 basis-point increments. The Fed has not raised interest rates by more than 25 basis points in one policy move since May 2000, when it hiked by 50 basis points to 6.5%. 
""The Fed has conditioned the market to expect a gradualist approach to tightening, and may fear that moving faster than every three months might surprise the market in disruptive ways,"" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN).
That hasn't stopped some from calling for a 50-basis point move, however, arguing it would help the Fed more quickly stem inflation. 
The Fed ""should do 50 basis points because they made a policy error,"" said David Petrosinelli, managing director and senior trader at broker-dealer InspereX in New York. ""It will send a very powerful message that the Fed is serious about inflation."" 
U.S. Pershing Square Capital Management founder and chief executive officer Bill Ackman, in a series of comments on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), two weeks ago called for a 50-basis point increase at the March meeting to ""restore credibility."" 
Petrosinelli believes that is unlikely to happen because it will shock the market, a sentiment expressed as well two weeks ago by Fed Governor Christopher Waller, one of the more hawkish members of the Federal Open Market Committee.
Indeed, the probability of a 50-basis point interest rate increase stood at 5.2% early Monday.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), meanwhile, wrote there is a risk the Fed could ""take some tightening action at every meeting"" after March as long as the supply chain snarls that are helping boost inflation persist.
Aside from rate hikes, the Fed has other tools at its disposal, including ""quantitative tightening,"" or reducing its balance sheet. The Fed has indicated it may begin doing so some time this year. 
US Fed balance sheet and govt bond yields https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgvdwjyaypo/Fed%20balance%20sheet%20and%20bond%20yields.PNG 
SLC's Cramer said a balanced mix of rate hikes and quantitative tightening is less likely to agitate financial markets.

A balance sheet run-off of between $350 billion to $550 billion is roughly equivalent to a 25-basis point hike, he noted. 
Given that U.S. inflation comes from an imbalance on the supply side, Cramer said faster ""rate hikes can really choke off demand and I don't know if that's what the Fed wants to do here.""

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers expect their monthly spending to grow above pre-pandemic levels this year but people are becoming less likely to spend big on vacations and other non-essential items - a sign that more households may be more concerned about rising prices, according to a survey released Monday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
The survey showed that consumers expect to spend more on daily living expenses in the coming year. But it also showed that consumers are becoming less likely to spend large amounts of money on home repairs, vacations, appliances and other expensive purchases. 
""In contrast, households report a lower likelihood of making large purchases over the next four months, which points to the likely contribution of elevated inflation expectations,"" researchers wrote. 
U.S. consumer prices are rising https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-consumer-prices-increase-strongly-december-2022-01-12 at the fastest clip in nearly four decades because of snarled supply chains and other disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The elevated inflation is eating into wage increases and boosting expectations that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates as early as March and begin shrinking its balance sheet later this year.
Respondents said in December that they expect their monthly household spending to grow by a median of 4.6% over the next year, up from 4.2% in August. Spending on everyday essentials is expected to rise more substantially, by a median of 5.4% in the coming year. 

Consumers are becoming more conservative with their spending, the survey showed. Spending on non-essential items, including hobbies, vacations and other leisure activities, is now expected to rise more slowly in the next year, with a median 2.5% growth reported in December, compared to 2.6% in August.
The share of households who made large purchases in the previous four months dropped to 58.1% in December from 62.6% in August, but was still above the December 2020 level of 54.6%.

The IHS Markit flash December composite purchasing managers index slid 6.2 points to an 18-month low of 50.8, the group reported Monday. Readings above 50 indicate growth. The group’s gauge of services also plummeted to the lowest level since July 2020 as labor shortages and employee absences weighed on activity.
The manufacturing index suffered a more modest decline, yet the reading was the weakest since October 2020 as supply chains remained in disarray and hampered production.
“Output has been affected by omicron much more than demand, with robust growth of new business inflows hinting that growth will pick up again once restrictions are relaxed,” Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
Furthermore, while supply-chain constraints are lingering, the report showed they are gradually starting to ease, helping explain why the group’s measure of future output climbed to the highest in more than a year.
The composite index of materials prices also registered a sharp decline, indicating cost increases were less severe, yet still well above levels seen prior to 2021.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's central bank looks on course to raise interest rates next week for the second time in less than two months, reversing more of its COVID-19 pandemic stimulus, after inflation jumped to its highest in nearly 30 years.
Inflation has risen sharply across advanced economies, driven by higher energy prices and supply-chain difficulties. But the Bank of England has moved faster than other big central banks because of fears that costly energy and a tight labour market could see price pressures become entrenched.
Most economists polled by Reuters last week expect the BoE to raise rates to 0.5% on Feb. 3 from 0.25%. On Monday rate futures priced in an 87% chance of such a move.
""They need to do something in the short term to reinforce their credibility, anchor inflation expectations, and perhaps support sterling as well, to improve the inflation outlook,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultants Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The BoE has not raised rates at two consecutive Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meetings since June 2004. 
A hike would also set the BoE's 875 billion pounds ($1.18 trillion) of government bond holdings on a downward path as it ceases reinvestment of maturing gilts. 
Tombs brought forward his forecast for a BoE rate rise by a month after data last week showed consumer price inflation hit 5.4% in December, its highest since March 1992.
Inflation - which has overshot BoE forecasts over the past six months - is set to peak at more than 6% in April when regulated household energy bills rise by around 50% after the recent gas price surge.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said last week that inflation risked being more persistent than the BoE expected in November due to tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Futures markets showed natural gas prices staying higher for longer. 
He added that firms were considering raising prices and wages this year in a way that would cause inflation to be too slow to fall back to its 2% target.
""The objective for monetary policy now should be to lean against this 'strong-for-longer' scenario,"" Catherine Mann, an external member of the MPC, said on Friday.
The other seven MPC members have said nothing publicly on policy this year, and a February rate rise is not definite.
The BoE wrong-footed markets in November when it kept rates on hold, triggering the sharpest weekly fall in bond prices since 2009. Its new chief economist, Huw Pill, later said markets should not expect detailed guidance on policy action.
NEW FORECASTS
The BoE will publish new growth and inflation forecasts on Feb. 3, replacing November ones which were quickly left out of date by higher-than-expected inflation and the Omicron variant.
Economists also want a sense of how much further the BoE thinks rates might rise, and if it might need to take them above 'neutral' to a tightening level.
In November, the BoE downplayed market expectations that rates might reach 1% this year. Now markets expect rates to hit 0.75% - their pre-pandemic level - in May and 1.25% by November. 
Britain's wave of Omicron-related COVID-19 cases - which was surging when the BoE raised rates on Dec. 16 - is now less than half the peak of early January.
Economists reckon the financial damage has been mostly limited to sectors such as hospitality, leading to a roughly 0.5% hit to output over December and January. 
Gross domestic product returned to its pre-pandemic level for the first time in November.
The job market has performed more strongly than the BoE expected, with unemployment close to pre-pandemic levels although there are around 600,000 fewer people in employment, as some older workers dropped out of the workforce.
This, combined with record-high job vacancies, is fuelling the BoE's concern about labour market pressures. Mann spoke of a potential 'regime change' compared with the 2010s when wage growth was weak, even when inflation spiked above 5% due to an oil price surge in 2011.
""Even though the recovery has not been particularly stellar, it does seem we are starting to hit supply-side constraints a bit sooner than other countries,"" Pantheon's Tombs said.

Brexit-related frictions and low business investment since the 2016 referendum probably lay behind this, he added, and he doubted that workers' bargaining power had strengthened much.

(Reuters) - As the U.S. Federal Reserve pivots on monetary policy and flags it may raise interest rates as many as four times this year to tame inflation running at a 40-year high, the composition of the rate-setting committee changes for 2022, starting at this week's meeting.
Fed Board members always have a vote on the Federal Open Market Committee, and currently there are four, although President Joe Biden this month nominated https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-nominates-raskin-cook-jefferson-fed-board-2022-01-14 a three-person slate to fill the remaining governor vacancies. They must clear Senate confirmation first, so it is unclear how soon they might be seated, if at all.
The head of the New York Fed also has a permanent vote, while the other four slots rotate between the 11 other regional reserve bank presidents on a yearly basis, even though all policymakers discuss the economic outlook as a group. Here's who has a vote this year and their most recent comments on policy:
JEROME POWELL, CHAIR
Powell, renominated to the central bank's top post by Biden, told lawmakers at his confirmation hearing https://www.reuters.com/business/feds-powell-heads-hill-hearing-with-inflation-focus-2022-01-11 this month ""the economy no longer needs or wants the very highly accommodative policy that we've had"" as he flagged an indeterminate number of rate rises this year.
He also said he expects to move sooner and faster to reduce the central bank's balance sheet, now nearly $9 trillion, than previously.
""The economy is in a completely different place than it was when we ended asset purchases the last time,"" Powell said. ""The period of time between stopping purchases and beginning runoff will be shorter, and also the balance sheet is much bigger so the runoff can be faster.""
LAEL BRAINARD, GOVERNOR
Tapped by Biden to be Fed vice chair, Brainard at her confirmation hearing https://www.reuters.com/world/us/feds-most-important-task-is-control-inflation-brainard-says-2022-01-13 this month said battling inflation was the Fed's ""most important task"" as she gave the green light to starting rate rises at the central bank's March meeting after the scheduled end of its bond-buying program.
""The (Fed's policy-setting) committee has projected several hikes over the course of the year...Of course we will be in a position to do that I think as soon as our purchases are terminated, and we'll simply have to see what the data requires over the course of the year,"" Brainard said. 
She added the Fed will try to bring inflation down ""as quickly as we can but consistent with a sustained and strong recovery.""
MICHELLE BOWMAN, GOVERNOR
Bowman has not spoken on monetary policy since October, but in the past has sided with colleagues more in favor of tightening policy. That month she already flagged high inflation may last longer than expected and said she was ""very comfortable"" https://www.reuters.com/business/feds-bowman-very-comfortable-with-november-taper-sees-inflation-risks-2021-10-14 with beginning to reduce asset purchases in November.
CHRISTOPHER WALLER, GOVERNOR
Waller has been at the forefront in calling for a faster and more aggressive response to inflation and has said four or five rate hikes this year may be needed if inflation doesn't recede.
He backs a March rate liftoff and speedy reduction in the balance sheet. ""Inflation has stayed higher for longer than any of us thought it was going to,"" Waller said earlier this month https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-waller/feds-waller-says-course-of-inflation-this-year-to-dictate-rate-hikes-idUSS0N2RG00H. Once inflation gets down to 2.5% or so - which he expects by the end of this year - rapid rate hikes might no longer be needed, he added.
JOHN WILLIAMS, NEW YORK FED
It is ""sensible"" to begin raising interest rates this year with inflation high and the economy near maximum employment, Williams said earlier this month https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ny-feds-williams-says-completely-sensible-raise-interest-rates-2022-01-14.
""We are approaching a decision to get that process underway,"" he said. Williams added he thought the Fed would also reduce its balance sheet quicker than previously.
LORETTA MESTER, CLEVELAND FED
Mester, who tends to favor a slightly more aggressive policy path than some of her colleagues, backs a March liftoff if the economy holds up.
She also favors a speedier balance sheet rundown https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-mester/feds-mester-says-she-supports-reducing-balance-sheet-as-fast-as-feasible-idUSKBN2JM1OS and has not ruled out the idea actively selling assets. ""I would like to reduce it ... as fast as we can conditional on it not being disruptive to the financial markets."" 
JAMES BULLARD, ST. LOUIS FED
Now an anchor of the Fed's hawkish wing, Bullard recently upped the number of rate rises he sees this year. ""I actually now think we should maybe go to four hikes in 2022,"" he said https://www.reuters.com/business/feds-bullard-sees-four-us-rate-hikes-this-year-2022-01-12, starting in March.
The Fed's credibility is more at risk than at any time in his 30 years at the central bank, he said.
ESTHER GEORGE, KANSAS CITY FED
George has a record as a serial dissenter in favor of tighter policy in past rotations as a voter. She has not publicly backed a March rate liftoff but said earlier this month https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fed-should-run-down-balance-sheet-earlier-rather-than-later-george-2022-01-11 that the Fed's ""very accommodative"" stance of monetary policy was ""out of sync with the economic outlook.""
On the balance sheet, her preference would be ""to opt for running down the balance sheet earlier rather than later as we plot a path for removing monetary accommodation.""

PATRICK HARKER, PHILADELPHIA FED
Harker, who will vote as an alternate until a Boston Fed president is appointed, backs a rate hike in March https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/feds-harker-open-more-than-three-rate-hikes-2022-if-inflation-worsens-ft-2022-01-13, the first of at least three quarter-percentage-point increases he sees this year, with a balance sheet reduction beginning in late 2022 or early 2023.

Investing.com -- Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies lead risk assets lower as concerns about war in Ukraine trigger a broad selloff. That's stopping U.S. futures from making any real bounce despite last week's violent selloff. Oil edges lower as Iran says it's closing in on a deal to remove U.S. sanctions, while Unilever (NYSE:UL) stock soars on reports that the scourge of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Nelson Peltz, has taken a stake in it. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 24th January.
1. Bitcoin now down 50% from ATH
Cryptocurrencies continued their selloff, extending a self-reinforcing spiral of liquidations and loss of technical momentum.
The world’s biggest cryptocurrency fell another 6.7% to $33,569 as of 5:55 AM ET (1055 GMT) and is now down over 50% from the all-time high it posted only two months ago. Analysis by the Korean-based site CryptoQuant suggests that over 38% of all Bitcoin ever mined is now trading at a loss, compared to a peak ratio of 34% during the previous selloff in the middle of last year.
The developments come as the rising trend in interest rates puts sustained pressure on risk assets and on leveraged portfolios everywhere. More concretely, it follows fresh evidence of the world’s central banks clamping down on private digital currencies after the Russian Central Bank proposed an outright ban on mining and use of cryptocurrency.
2. Ukraine fears trigger broad selloff
The situation on the Russian-Ukrainian border also continues to punish risk assets. The U.S. and U.K. both instructed the families of their diplomats living in Ukraine to leave the country, suggesting that both countries still see an elevated near-term risk of a Russian invasion.
The New York Times and others reported that President Joe Biden is considering the dispatch of up to 50,000 combat troops to Ukraine, while the U.K. – whose government warned at the weekend of Russian intentions to instal a puppet government in the country after invading - has reportedly sent some 2,000 anti-tank launcher system to Ukraine.
Russia dismissed the U.K. allegations as baseless. On Friday, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had said the country has no intention of sending troops into Ukraine.  Russian assets came under heavy pressure nonetheless on Monday as a Kremlin spokesman warned that there was an extremely high risk of Kyiv launching military action against two Russian-backed breakaway statelets in eastern Ukraine: the ruble fell nearly 2% to a 14-month low against the dollar, while the benchmark RTS stock index fell 9.4%, also to a 14-month low. European stock markets fell by around 1%.
3. Stocks set to extend losses; Peltz lights a fire under Unilever
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower as the risk-off mood worsens in the light of developments in eastern Europe.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures had reversed early gains to be flat, although they were off their overnight lows. S&P 500 futures were still down 0.1%, however, and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.2%. The market had appeared ready for a bounce from oversold territory after its worst week in months. The Dow lost 4.6% last week, while the S&P 500 lost 5.7% and the NASDAQ Composite 7.6%.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Unilever, after news that activist investor Nelson Peltz has taken an unspecified stake in the company. Peltz had led a partially successful campaign for change at U.S. peer Procter & Gamble in recent years.  
The week in earnings starts relatively quietly with updates from Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) out early and from  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) after the close.
4. Omicron hits European services in January; Italy starts to push Draghi upstairs
The Eurozone economy stuttered in January as the wave of Omicron-variant of Covid-19 disrupted the service sector in both of the region’s two biggest economies.
IHS Markit’s composite purchasing managers’ index for the region fell by more than expected to 52.4, according to a preliminary reading, due largely to a slump in the French service sector. However, manufacturing in Germany and France performed better than expected amid signs that supply chain bottlenecks may be easing.
The Deutsche Bundesbank warned in its monthly report that the German economy probably contracted in the fourth quarter, however.
Elsewhere in the Eurozone, Italy starts its formal process for nominating a new President on Monday. The evidence so far suggests that former ECB President Mario Draghi will move upstairs from the Prime Minister’s office, allowing the normal rough and tumble of Italian politics to resume.  Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi withdrew his candidacy over the weekend, leaving no clear alternative to Draghi.
5. Oil falls on Iran, Abu Dhabi news
Oil prices weakened after Iranian negotiators said that they are closer to agreement on removing U.S.-led sanctions, removing an artificial constraint on global supply.
Reports suggest that that constraint has in any case weakened considerably over the last year, due to various maneuvers by Chinese buyers to get around the current measures.
Additionally, the United Arab Emirates reported that it shot down more long-range missiles aimed at the city of Abu Dhabi by Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen, something that eased fears of fresh disruptions to exports from one of OPEC’s more reliable suppliers.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 0.4% at $84.77 a barrel, while Brent crude was down 0.4% at $86.75 a barrel."
736,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 06:13AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's economy likely shrank in the fourth quarter as manufacturing remained constrained by supply bottlenecks and consumption dropped on renewed coronavirus fears, the Bundesbank said in a monthly report on Monday.
Growth in Europe's biggest economy stalled in the autumn as supply shortages and shipping bottlenecks held back its vast industrial sector, even as consumption held up relatively well. 
But household consumption also took a hit late in the year over fears about the Omicron variant, which forced businesses to bring back restrictions on activity.
""The adjustments in behaviour and the triggered containment measures in some cases had a significant impact on economic activity in the service sector, especially in December,"" the Bundesbank said.
""Germany's real gross domestic product is likely to have fallen slightly in the final quarter of 2021."" 
The outlook for the new year appears to be brighter, however, after strong factory output growth, helped by easing supply bottlenecks, pushed activity in manufacturing to a five-month high in January, separate data showed on Monday.

Inflation prospects, however, may take longer to improve, the Bundesbank said, warning that price growth could remain ""exceptionally high"" in early 2022 due to soaring energy costs and delivery bottlenecks. 
German inflation hit 5.7% in December and the Bundesbank sees it above the European Central Bank's 2% target at least through 2024.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While the Federal Reserve's paper on potentially adopting a central bank digital currency (CBDC) will advance debate in Washington, its decision to kick the issue to Congress means an official U.S. digital dollar is still several years away.
The U.S. central bank on Thursday released a much-anticipated paper on the pros and cons of adopting a digital dollar, a digital version of cash in your pocket, in which it refused to take a stance and said Congress should decide the matter.
Many CBDC enthusiasts saw the report as a key milestone in developing some form of digital dollar policy, but with lawmakers confused and divided on the issue -- even within their own parties -- analysts said they should not hold their breath.
""The paper ... is light on conclusions and reinforces our view that a Fed-backed CBDC is -- at best -- years away from launch,"" Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research for brokerage BTIG, wrote in a note. ""We are bearish on a legislative solution emerging.""
Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are run by private actors, a CBDC would be issued and backed by the central bank. It would differ from electronic transactions that happen through large commercial banks by giving consumers a direct claim to the central bank, similar to physical cash.
A digital dollar could transform the financial system, speeding up payments globally and giving consumers greater access to the financial system, the Fed said. But it cautioned that a poorly designed digital dollar could weaken banks, destabilize the financial system and create privacy issues. 
About 90 countries https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker, including China, are exploring or launching their own CBDCs, according to the Atlantic Council, sparking concern among some that the United States will cede the dominance of the global financial system if it does not digitize the dollar, currently the global reserve currency.
In an already fiercely divided political climate, reaching a consensus on this tangle of thorny issues ""seems like a long shot,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) chief economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note.
While some Republicans are eager for the Fed to embrace innovative technology, others have expressed concern over the central bank expanding its footprint and competing with private banks. 
""I'm genuinely undecided whether there is a legitimate need for a CBDC,"" Republican U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a leading digital currency proponent, tweeted following the Fed's report.
Some Democratic progressives like Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown support a digital dollar that would boost financial inclusion, but other Democrats have flagged concerns that a digital dollar could be used for illicit purposes. 
Brown, who would play a leading role in drawing up legislation in the thinly divided Senate, said on Thursday that the report was a ""a good first step,"" while some other lawmakers said they were looking forward to working on legislation.
But even if Congress was able to agree on and pass legislation this year, the rollout of a digital dollar would require a lengthy pilot and implementation phase. 
""Even if you start today, we're still going to be a couple of years away from this becoming a reality,"" said Jonathan McCollum, chair of federal government relations for Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, who has lobbied lawmakers to get started.

As lawmakers, regulators and the White House debate the issue, the private sector is likely to move ahead with products that may weaken the argument for a digital dollar, Ian Katz, managing director of Capital Alpha Partners, said in a note.
""If it finally happens years down the road, a Fed CBDC would be less of a world-changer than it would be now,"" he added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates until March, but officials' tougher language about inflation is already kicking in, with borrowing costs rising for everyone from homebuyers to the federal government and stock markets kicking off the year deep in the red.
The pace of that adjustment now poses an unexpectedly urgent question for U.S. central bank officials at their latest two-day policy meeting this week: Are financial markets tightening too fast for what the Fed intends in its inflation battle, or is the Fed the one underestimating what will ultimately be needed to slow the pace of price increases https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/zdpxoqkrkvx/index.html? 
In their most recent projections, issued in December, policymakers said they expected as many as three quarter-percentage-point rate increases this year, with more in the cards in 2023 and 2024. But those projections never raise the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate above the ""neutral"" level that would actually restrict the economy.
Yet inflation still falls, a best-of-all-worlds outcome some analysts see as unrealistic.
""The U.S. is facing the highest inflation since 1982 and there is compelling evidence that a good chunk of it will persist. The Fed has never responded this slowly ... and even today is signaling a benign hiking cycle,"" wrote Ethan Harris, the head of global research at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). ""The biggest near-term risk is right in front of us: that the Fed is seriously behind the curve and has to get serious."" 
That could mean as many as six quarter-percentage point rate increases this year, he said, and a fast push to a 3% federal funds rate from the current level near zero. That'd be the highest policy rate since the Fed started slashing borrowing costs at the start of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and enough, according to current estimates, to actually curb economic growth, employment and inflation.
In the Fed's current projections they merely do less to prop it up.
Fed officials won't update their formal outlook at the Jan. 25-26 policy meeting. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a news conference after the release of the policy statement on Wednesday to talk in more detail about the Fed's plans, the current view of the economy, and the recent resetting of rates and equity values. That has included a more than 7% decline in the S&P 500 index since Dec. 31.
'SHADOW' RATE HIKES
For a central bank that just a few months ago still promised open-ended support until the economy was fully healed from the coronavirus pandemic, the surge in U.S. inflation to a 40-year high kickstarted a high-stakes policy shift away from pandemic support. 
The COVID inflation surge The COVID inflation surge https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/akvezawxopr/chart.png 
A ""liftoff"" of interest rates has been flagged for March, years ahead of what was thought likely at the start of the health crisis. At the same time, the Fed is planning to shrink https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/BALANCESHEET/byprjmwezpe/index.html its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities - using a second lever to ratchet up the cost of credit.
How the two policy tools interact remains a topic of analysis and debate - as does the eventual influence on inflation, the variable the Fed ultimately is trying to control.
Even with three rate increases and a smaller balance sheet in the offing, investors so far are assuming the Fed will have to do more to bring price increases back into line with its 2% inflation target. Trading in futures contracts linked to the federal funds rate shows four rate increases expected this year, for example, and is edging towards five. 
Rising rates https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/RATES/zgpomaxjqpd/chart.png 
On the basis of comments from Fed officials and the sharp tone of the minutes from the central bank's Dec. 14-15 meeting, interest rates for home mortgages, corporate credit and U.S. Treasury debt are already rising as a result.
Indicators of overall financial conditions - showing how easy or hard it is for households and firms to borrow - have tightened slightly since the Fed began trimming its monthly bond purchases last fall and as the talk around inflation turned more urgent. An estimate of the ""shadow"" federal funds rate maintained by the Atlanta Fed shows that as of the end of 2021 changes in market interest rates already had produced the equivalent of a 0.6 percentage-point rate hike.
OMICRON DRAG
Still, overall financial conditions remain loose by historic standards. Even if that seems out of step with inflation, there are reasons for the Fed to be reluctant about change coming too fast. 
The pandemic continues. While some health officials expect the current outbreak driven by the Omicron variant to subside soon, for now it has slowed hiring and tamped down the economic recovery.
Some economists now predict the U.S. economy will end up having lost jobs in both January and February. That would leave the Fed with the tough choice of raising interest rates in March in the face of declining employment.
Even a temporary Omicron-related ""dip"" keeps alive concerns that the Fed this year will face not the best, but the worst of both worlds in the form of a slowing economy and inflation that needs even tougher medicine than officials have yet prepared to deliver.
In an interview this month ahead of the Fed's pre-meeting blackout period, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the depth of the dilemma turns in part on the degree to which inflation falls on its own, without the need of restrictive Fed policy to force it down through slower growth and slowed employment.
That could happen if, as some economists expect, the virus eases and more workers return to jobs - boosting the supply of goods and services and easing the pace of wage hikes - or if global supply disruptions subside.

There is, however, no guarantee.
Before the onset of the coronavirus, the Fed was struggling against dynamics that kept inflation perennially below its 2% target, and ""there is a narrative that says once we are past the pandemic those forces take over so you don't need as aggressive a policy posture,"" Bostic said. But ""none of us going into the pandemic contemplated that inflation would be as high as it is now. So the question really is how forcefully or fulsomely do we have to respond?""

If markets have it right, the Fed's Jan.25-26 meeting will be the last one before interest rates lift off. 
Roughly four rate hikes are priced for this year, starting in March, but the rates outlook aside, markets will listen for what the Fed says about its $8-plus trillion balance sheet.
December meeting minutes showed lengthy discussions about reducing bond holdings. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the balance sheet could be shrunk faster than in the past.
A Reuters poll predicts the Fed to start trimming its balance sheet by end-September, though some reckon it may happen sooner and faster than flagged. Hawkish signals could extend the selloff in Treasuries and tech shares.

Italy needs a new president and the complex process to replace outgoing Sergio Mattarella kicks off Monday, with Prime Minister Mario Draghi a frontrunner for the post. 
It could mean weeks of political instability for Italy. If Draghi gets the job, a new prime minister must be found and the multi-party coalition supporting his government could unravel. The same could happen if the parties fail to agree an alternative candidate. 
Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi pulled out of the race on Saturday.
And all this just as bond market angst grows about rising inflation and a more aggressive ECB response.

The Fed is not the only central bank to have underestimated inflation. Australian CPI data on Tuesday may well force Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe to capitulate on his long-held contention that rate hikes this year are ""extremely unlikely.""
Money markets have long doubted Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) scenario, and are pricing a first hike to a quarter percent as soon as May with at least three additional quarter-point increases by year-end.
Australia's jobless rate has plunged to its lowest since 2008 and some economists predict core inflation could jump to its highest since 2009, at 2.5%. At the very least, such a reading should seal an end to pandemic-time bond purchases at the Feb. 1 RBA meeting.

Considering the spread of Omicron, global business activity held up surprisingly well in December, purchasing managers indexes(PMI) showed. But when advance January PMIs emerge on Monday, focus will be on how cost pressures are shaping up.

Composite input prices slipped last month as factories' supply chain delays eased, but U.S. service sector input prices rose to the highest since 2009. In Europe they stayed near November's record high, and rose in China for the 18th straight month.
In countries where services contribute the lion's share of economic output, soaring costs add more uncertainty to the inflation outlook. GRAPHIC: Input costs, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgpdwjbyovo/Pasted%20image%201642626686730.png

The core inflation rate — the central bank's favoured price measure - rose to 2.1% in December on a year-on-year basis, the highest since July 2014 and topping economist forecasts. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a 1.7% increase.
Singapore's central bank tightened its monetary policy in October, delivering its first such move in three years, amid mounting cost pressures. Its next policy review is scheduled for April when it is widely expected by economists to tighten further. 
Monday's data showed headline inflation rose by 4%, a near nine-year high, beating economists' forecast of 3.75%. 
Steep increases in air fares and COVID-19 testing costs under Singapore's quarantine-free travel schemes were a major factor in December's price jump. 
There remains significant uncertainty surrounding the outlook for inflation in the near term, including from the costs of air travel and commodity prices such as food and oil, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said in a statement. 
""Given the recent stronger-than-projected inflation outturns, including the sharp uptick in air fares, MAS and MTI are reviewing the current forecast ranges for CPI-All Items inflation and MAS Core Inflation in 2022,"" they said.

The government had a previous forecast for 2022 headline prices to average 1.5–2.5% and core inflation to increase to 1-2%. For 2021, core inflation came in at 0.9% and headline prices rose to 2.3%.
Inflation is surging around the world as economies recover from the pandemic, creating demand as a time when bottlenecks in transportation are causing shortages in various commodities and goods.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The economies in the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council will grow at their fastest paces in several years, according to a Reuters poll of economists who cautioned the risk to that outlook was skewed to the downside.
Crude oil prices, a major driver for Gulf economies, climbed to their highest since 2014 on Wednesday, driven by escalating global political tensions involving major producers including United Arab Emirates and Russia, which could worsen already tight supplies.
That is bullish news for the six wealthy oil-exporting countries in the region.
The Jan. 11-19 poll of 25 economists forecast all six economies in the Gulf Cooperation Council would grow faster this year than was expected three months ago.
Saudi Arabia was predicted to top the list with growth of 5.7%, followed by Kuwait and UAE with 5.3% and 4.8% respectively.
Economic growth in Qatar, Oman and Bahrain was expected to average between 3%-4% for 2022. If realised, that would be the best these countries have witnessed in several years.
""Despite relatively tight fiscal policy, and some external headwinds, we expect the GCC economies to see faster growth in 2022 as they continue to build on the progress made last year,"" said Khatija Haque, head of research and chief economist at Emirates NBD.
""While the outlook for 2022 remains broadly constructive, there is still a high degree of uncertainty especially with regards to the evolution of the coronavirus pandemic.""
As the global economy deals with the prospect of persistent inflation, the region's price outlook was modest, but varied.
Inflation was expected to stay between 2.0% and 2.8% this year, with the lowest reading for the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Oman at 2.0% and the highest for Qatar at 2.8%.
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude oil exporter and the region's economic and political heavyweight, will see 5.7% economic growth this year. If realised, it would be the fastest growth since 2012 when oil averaged around $111 per barrel.
Apart from an upgrade to the median forecast from the October Reuters poll, the range of forecasts also showed higher highs and higher lows.
The UAE, a global trade hub and the GCC's second-biggest economy, was forecast to grow 4.8% this year, the fastest since 2015.
Dependency on energy prices has the attendant risk that any disruption in prices due to geopolitical tensions and a slowdown in the global economy could hurt the recovery.
Nine of 10 economists who answered an additional question said a decline in oil prices and new coronavirus variants were the biggest threats to GCC economic growth this year.
""The risk of oil price declines is still the biggest risk for the GCC region, while supply chain disruptions will continue to play a role and throw a wrench into global growth, but probably not so much for GCC economies,"" said Ralf Wiegert, MENA economics team head at IHS Markit. 
""GCC growth is very much centered on the upside already...oil supply and GDP growth in the GCC rests on the assumption of strong global demand for oil in 2022.""

Eight of ten respondents said risks to their growth forecasts were skewed more to the downside.

The funds raised would be used to help with the costs of fuel, food and lodgings, the gofundme page said. The convoy is expected to reach Ottawa on Jan. 29.
The trucking industry is vital to ensure smooth flow of goods since more than two-thirds of the C$650 billion ($521 billion) in goods traded annually between Canada and the United States travels on roads.

""We are of the view that we are at a major inflection point in terms of policy and we are likely to see some significant easing,"" said Jean Charles Sambor, head of emerging market fixed income at BNP Paribas Asset Management (BNPPAM) in London.
""We are involved in the sector and we are positive in the sector. We have built this position over the last couple of months.""
Sambor could only discuss the overall sector, not company-specific investments.
Chinese real estate sector assets came under a lot of pressure last year after stricter financing rules for property development set in 2020 met with a mountain of debt, effectively engineering a contraction. The outsized importance of China's real estate in the global economy sent shivers down many portfolio manager backs.
The CSI China Mainland Real Estate Index fell as much as 28% last year before closing down 15%, with stocks in China Evergrande, one of the biggest developers in the midst of a restructuring, down 89% in 2021. 
Graphic: China real estate sector stocks - https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-PROPERTY/STOCKS/lgpdwjyzbvo/chart.png 
Evergrande carries about $300 billion in liabilities including some $20 billion in international bonds. The foreign bonds, which traded above 90 cents in some cases last year, are now at default levels at under 20 cents on the dollar. 
""The property market had been under pressure because (the government) wanted to deleverage and to some extent they achieved that,"" Sambor said. ""Now China wants to make sure that the rest of the sector is not at risk.""
Some international investors expect state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to help smooth debt restructurings, but others worry that it could open the door for Beijing to use the limited returns to pay its local debts first.
Sambor said a sector restructuring cannot be led by the state because private sector involvement in the property market is very large.
""SOEs are a significant part of the market but are not dominating it so it is difficult for them to engineer an SOE-lead restructuring. You need to have strong participation from the private sector,"" he said.

Sambor said BNPPAM's view on the real estate sector is part of a wider bet on fixed income returns within emerging markets.
""We think it's going to be the year of the great normalization in Asia high yield, with a focus on China,"" Sambor said. ""Asian high yield, and China more specifically, will be a key driver of EM fixed income performance in 2022.""

748,"<span>Jan 23, 2022 05:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Looser monetary policy in China won’t be sufficient to stabilize the economy and a faster increase in government spending is needed, according to a former adviser to the central bank.
“Under the current economic situation, the role the PBOC can play is limited,” said Yu Yongding, a member of the monetary policy committee of the People’s Bank of China in the mid 2000s, adding that he would “emphasize the importance of fiscal policy.”
The central bank has taken a series of easing steps in recent weeks, cutting key interest rates for the first time in nearly two years and encouraging banks to accelerate lending. That is all part of an effort to boost the world’s second-largest economy after growth slowed sharply in recent months due to a real-estate downturn, weak investment, and sporadic outbreaks of the coronavirus.
The impact right now of any monetary easing is limited as credit demand is relatively weak, Yu said in an interview last week. The Ministry of Finance, which controls government spending, should take the lead in boosting the economy while the PBOC can support expansionary fiscal policy, he said.
Until there is a decisive shift in fiscal policy, “monetary policy loosening should be limited because its not very useful as it may create other problems,” such as excess credit flowing into less-productive sectors, such as real estate, Yu said.
China’s fiscal stance has been contractionary in 2021, with the government deficit falling by about 40% in the first 11 months of last year compared with the same period in 2020. In December, Beijing urged local governments to step up infrastructure spending, but questions remain about how they will finance such an effort as a downturn in the housing market is limiting their income from property sales.
Yu has been advocating more aggressive fiscal policy since Beijing’s crackdown on local government debt began to slow infrastructure investment from 2017. His view is echoed by other economists, such as Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd, who said that China’s key economic problems are supply-side constraints and insufficient demand, which won’t be solved by monetary policy alone.

Beijing has told local governments that they can begin issuing up to 1.46 trillion yuan ($230 billion) of “special” bonds used to fund infrastructure. But they won’t get permission to issue bonds beyond that amount until the national budget is approved in mid-March by China’s rubber-stamp legislature, the National People’s Congress. Bloomberg News reported that the 2022 quota for such bonds will be unchanged from last year.
Fiscal easing could be delayed until the end of the congress meeting, according to Yu. 
“Perhaps we have to wait, because usually only after the NPC does the new budget come out,” he said.

In a pre-released interview with German business daily Handelsblatt, Rehn said the future pace of normalization of the ECB's loose monetary policy depended on the economic data.
""Personally, I expect the economic data to remain relatively good despite being affected by the Omicron variant,"" Rehn said, adding he therefore viewed rate hikes in 2023 as a logical step, at least as long as there are no new economic shocks.
Rehn, who is also an ECB Governing Council member, pointed out that Germany's nuclear phase-out at the end of the year would increase dependence on natural gas imports from Russia and bring more volatility to energy markets.
""The decisions about energy policy in Germany affect price fluctuations and thus the uncertainty about inflation,"" Rehn said.
""For me, switching from coal to natural gas is not a green transition, and this transition phase will take a long time in Germany,"" he added.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi decided against running for president, he said in a statement on Saturday, removing an obstacle to cross-party negotiations ahead of the vote in parliament beginning on Jan. 24.
The nomination of Prime Minister Mario Draghi is seen as the most probable outcome, but it is still unclear whether the broad sweep of parties that support his coalition will endorse him for fear his departure could trigger an early national election.
Berlusconi said he wanted the former European Central Bank president to remain at the helm of the government until the natural end of the legislature, in 2023.
""I have decided to take another step on the road to national responsibility, asking those who proposed it to renounce indicating my name for the Presidency of the Republic,"" Berlusconi said.
The rightist coalition had asked Berlusconi to run for president, but his bid was unlikely to be successful due to difficulties in mustering the broad support traditionally needed among the more than 1,000 lawmakers and regional delegates involved.
Berlusconi is a highly divisive figure in Italy and the centre-left camp had already ruled out backing him. 
He was temporarily barred from public office after a conviction for tax fraud in 2013, and is still on trial in the latest of a series of instances for bribing witnesses in an underage prostitution case tied to his infamous ""Bunga Bunga"" sex parties of more than a decade ago.
The Italian president has many ceremonial duties, but is also responsible for resolving political crises, making it a key role in a country where governments survive just one year on average.
The winner of the secret parliamentary vote needs a two-thirds majority in any of the first three rounds of voting. An absolute majority is sufficient thereafter.
Neither the centre-right nor the centre-left bloc have enough votes to impose a candidate from their own camp, meaning some sort of compromise is needed to prevent prolonged stalemate.
""We will work with the leaders of the centre-right ... to agree on a name that can gather a broad consensus in Parliament,"" Berlusconi's statement said.

Berlusconi's rightist allies, Matteo Salvini's League and the Brothers of Italy, said they appreciated his decision.
In a statement, Salvini said the centre-right bloc was united and ready to make several ""high-profile"" proposals.

The ECB has long held the view that inflation will decline this year from its current record high, an expectation its President Christine Lagarde repeated on Friday.
Euro zone inflation hit 5% in December, more than twice the ECB's target, but the bank sees it back below 2% by the fourth quarter.
""It is not yet ruled out that that will happen. However, we also do not know whether inflation will stay at a higher level after all,"" Holzmann, who is governor of the Austrian National Bank, told Die Presse.
""Is inflation therefore a mountain or is it becoming a high plateau? There is a great deal of uncertainty about that because it also cannot be reproduced very well by our models,"" he told the Austrian newspaper.
Second-round effects like wage increases would be decisive, he added and, like Lagarde, he said that for now there was no sign of a price-wage spiral, but much would depend on wage negotiations this year.
""Fundamentally there is therefore the danger of a wage-price spiral. I believe, however, that labour and employer representatives are acting very rationally and thoughtfully here,"" Holzmann said.

As part of its asset purchases, the ECB can only hold up to 33% of a euro zone country's bond volume, and in some countries it is ""very close"" to that limit but not in Austria, he said.
There are other means by which those countries' bonds can still be bought, such as the European Union's NextGeneration recovery fund, which does not count towards the 33% figure, he added.

Investing.com -- It’s set to be a major week for markets, between the Federal Reserve meeting and an avalanche of big-name earnings. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to signal that the central bank is on course to deliver its first rate hike since 2018 in March, in a bid to tackle soaring inflation. Tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are due to report with investors looking to earnings results for reassurance after last week’s selloff, but market volatility looks set to continue for now. There is also data on U.S. fourth quarter GDP, while economic data out of the U.K. and the Eurozone will show the impact of the Omicron variant. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Investors are looking to the Fed for more clarity on the future path of interest rates after data last week showed U.S. inflation rising to near forty-year highs.
Jerome Powell is expected to indicate that the Fed will wind up its bond purchasing stimulus program on schedule at its March meeting and raise interest rates by a quarter point from current levels close to zero at the same meeting.
With markets already pricing in roughly four rate hikes this year investors will also be focusing on what the Fed says about its almost $9 trillion balance sheet.
Markets currently expect the Fed to start trimming the balance sheet later in the year as a way to tighten monetary policy. The minutes of the Fed’s December meeting indicated that officials held lengthy discussions about reducing bond holdings.
Any indications that the balance sheet could be shrunk faster than in the past could extend the selloff in Treasuries and tech shares.
Tech giants Microsoft, Apple and Tesla are among the big-name companies due to report in what will be a hectic week of earnings results, with investors looking to separate pandemic success stories from fundamentally strong companies.
FAANG darling Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) tumbled over 20% on Friday, weighing on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, after it forecast new subscriber growth in the first quarter would be less than half of analysts' predictions.
Microsoft, which reports Tuesday, is expected to report quarterly revenue of more than $50 billion for the first time, according to data compiled by FactSet.
Tesla and Apple, reporting Wednesday and Thursday respectively, are expected to post record profits according to FactSet.
Beyond tech, there are a host of other big companies reporting including 3M (NYSE:MMM), GE (NYSE:GE),  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC),  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP). Boeing (NYSE:BA), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) are also scheduled to report.
Markets look set to remain turbulent in the coming week with investors focused on the Fed and earnings.
In a continuation of the tech selloff that has pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory, Wall Street’s main indexes closed sharply lower on Friday. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted their largest weekly percentage declines since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.
Tech companies largely benefitted during the pandemic and saw their shares soar over the last two years.
But tech and growth stocks have been hard hit since the start of 2022 by a rapid rise in Treasury yields on the back of expectations that the Fed will hike interest rates aggressively to combat high inflation.
Higher rates can hurt tech companies with high valuations based on the prospect of future profits.
On Thursday the U.S. is to release advance data on fourth quarter gross domestic product with economists expecting annualized growth of 5.2%. Expectations have been pared back in recent weeks as rising coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant hit economic activity.
The economic calendar also features December data on personal income and spending. Economists expect personal spending to fall sharply given the steep decline already seen in retail sales last month.
There is also the weekly report on initial jobless claims which jumped to a three-month high last week.
Some economists are worried that the increase in jobless claims along with the sharp drop in December retail sales could be an indication that the economy is losing momentum, but this is unlikely to stop the Fed from hiking rates in March.
The Eurozone’s largest economy Germany is to release fourth quarter GDP data on Friday, along with France and Spain. The figures will show the impact of the Omicron variant on the economic recovery, ahead of GDP data for the bloc the following week.
The Eurozone is to release PMI figures on Monday which will show how economic activity fared this month.
The U.K. is also to release PMI data on Monday, and while service sector activity slowed sharply in December amid the Omicron surge, other data since then has indicated that economic activity has begun to rebound. The data is expected to show a slight uptick from December and for now, the Bank of England still appears to be on track for another rate hike in February.

The Colorado Fire, which has been active since Friday, was 5% contained, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said.
A 20-mile stretch of State Highway 1, a scenic north-south route on the Pacific Coast, was closed from near the beach town of Carmel-by-the-Sea to Andrew Molera State Park. 
About 400 people in Monterey County were evacuated from 1,100 structures, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross said, citing county reports.
Four people and a pet stayed overnight at a shelter in a local school, the Red Cross said.
California has long had an active wildfire season, but in recent years, fueled at least in part by climate change, it has grown longer and more punishing.
Last year, the wildfire season started unusually early amid an ongoing drought and low reservoir levels, Cal Fire said. In January 2021 alone, the state battled 297 fires on 1,171 acres, the office said.
The Colorado Fire is the only fire listed on Cal Fire's incident list so far in 2022. 

This year, California is also grappling with the Santa Ana winds. A high wind warning was in effect for the area, with possible gusts of up to 70 miles per hour (112.65 kph), according to the National Weather Service.
But winds had improved and were forecast to remain light throughout the weekend, the Red Cross said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese school teacher Sara Wissam and her husband were comfortably off before a run on the local currency decimated the value of their salaries and dragged them towards poverty.
The plight of the Beirut couple is common across Lebanon's middle class, which has been forced to make once unthinkable choices by the worsening economic crisis: cutting back on food, cancelling trips or applying to emigrate for good.
""It used to be that our income lasted a month,"" the mother of three told Reuters.
""Now it's not enough for one trip to the supermarket to buy essentials,"" said Wissam, describing how she rarely buys meat, has cut back on cheese and chooses even the smallest treats for her young kids carefully.
Ayman Hadad, a 28-year-old university graduate who found a job in a shop, earns the equivalent of $125 a month and wants to join friends who have emigrated. He has applied to go to Canada. ""Enough of Lebanon. We lost hope,"" he said.
Lebanon's descent into financial ruin began in 2019, the result of a poorly managed spending binge that pushed up debt, political paralysis as rival factions squabbled and foreign lenders' reluctance to bail the country out unless it reformed.
The World Bank ranks the crisis as among the most severe globally since the mid-19th century, devastating a country once seen as a wealthy and liberal outpost in the Middle East before civil war broke out from 1975 to 1990.
About 80% of the population of 6.5 million are considered poor; in September, more than half of families had at least one child who skipped a meal https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/children-skipping-meals-majority-families-lebanon-unicef-says-2021-11-23, UNICEF said, compared with just over a third in April.
The currency has lost more than 90% of its value and banks have locked savers out of accounts. By some estimates, state debt reached 495% of gross domestic product in 2021, far above levels that crippled some European states a decade ago.
Adding to people's frustration is the government's failure so far to tackle the problems.
Caretaker administrations have led Lebanon for much of the last three years, and since the cabinet quit after a devastating Beirut port blast in 2020, politicians have been fighting over who should lead an investigation into who was to blame.
Meanwhile people see signs of social and economic collapse. The state telecom firm shut the Internet in parts of Beirut for lack of fuel in recent days and an armed man took hostages at a bank demanding access to his trapped savings.
'FRIDGE EMPTY'
Lebanon's national power grid was creaking before the crisis, with rolling cuts across the country. Now, a bankrupt government can barely run its power plants and homes often receive only an hour of state electricity a day.
Yola al-Musan, who manages a supermarket in Beirut, uses electricity from a shared neighbourhood generator to keep the lights on at home.
When the national grid does fire up, Musan races to switch on the washing machine as only then does she have a strong enough current.
For school teacher Wissam, putting enough food on the table for her family has become tough, even though she and her husband both have steady jobs.
Before the crisis, Wissam and her husband's combined salary was 3 million Lebanese pounds a month, which at the exchange rate at the time of 1,500 to the dollar was around $2,000.
Now their combined earnings are worth the equivalent of $140, even after Wissam's modest wage hike. The currency has plummeted to 25,000 to the dollar, sending the price of imported goods and local products soaring.
""Lebanon's leaders amuse themselves insulting each other and accusing each other of corruption. In fact, they are all corrupt and thieves,"" she said, echoing widespread public and international criticism of how the crisis has been handled.
Politicians, some former militia leaders and others from families who wielded influence for generations over the nation's Christian and Muslim communities, acknowledge corruption exists but deny they are responsible and say they are doing their best to rescue the economy.
But a lengthy and continuing dispute over who should preside over the port blast inquiry has contributed to delays in talks with the International Monetary Fund, seen as vital to unlocking overseas support led by France.
Once-reliable Gulf donors such as Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia already stepped back years ago, voicing anger at Iran's rising influence in Lebanon through Hezbollah, a group supported by Tehran which has a heavily armed militia.
Najib Mikati, the billionaire prime minister whose post is held by a Sunni under the sectarian political system, has tried to mend Gulf ties. Hezbollah, in turn, stepped up criticism of Gulf states and hosted conferences for domestic opponents of the monarchies.

Meanwhile, the cabinet is expected to hold its first meeting https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/lebanon-draft-budget-applies-range-fx-rates-official-source-says-2022-01-21 in more than three months on Monday to discuss a draft budget it hopes will ease financial pressures and quell public anger.
""If each one of them donated a small amount of their wealth to the poor, there would be no poor in Lebanon,"" said Shadi Ali Hamoud, 39, after returning home to his family from work in a restaurant kitchen. ""Look at the fridge, it's empty.""

755,"<span>Jan 23, 2022 03:25AM ET</span>","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon is suffering an economic meltdown that began in 2019 when the financial system collapsed under colossal state debts and the unsustainable way they were funded, while politicians have yet to come up with a rescue plan.
Just how bad is the situation?
- Gross domestic product has plunged to an estimated $20.5 billion in 2021 from about $55 billion in 2018, the kind of contraction usually associated with wars, the World Bank says, ranking the collapse as one of the worst globally since the mid-19th century.
- The Lebanese pound has lost more than 90% of its value, driving up the cost of almost everything in a country reliant on imports, and demolishing purchasing power. A soldier's monthly wage, once the equivalent of $900, is now worth about $50.
- Poverty rates are sky-rocketing in the population of about 6.5 million, with around 80% of people classed as poor, the U.N. agency ESCWA says. The situation is worsening. In September, more than half of families had at least one child who skipped a meal, UNICEF has said, compared with just over a third in April.
- The financial system has suffered eyewatering losses, including about $44 billion at the central bank related to failed efforts to prop up the currency, according to 2020 government figures, a level that is roughly twice the size of economic output. Overall losses, including anticipated sovereign debt write-downs, are even bigger.
- Lebanon's banks are paralysed. Savers have been frozen out of U.S. dollar accounts. Withdrawals in local currency apply exchange rates that erase up to 80% of the value. During an October visit to Beirut, U.S. official Victoria Nuland said the Lebanese people deserved to know where their money had gone.
- Reliant on imported fuel, Lebanon is facing an energy crunch. Even before the crisis, power supplies were in short supply, including in the capital. Now households are lucky to receive more than an hour or so a day. Fuel prices have soared. A ride in a shared taxi, a popular form of transport, cost 2,000 pounds before the crisis but now costs about 30,000 pounds.
- Lebanese are emigrating in the most significant exodus since the 1975-90 civil war, which pitted Lebanon's Christian and Muslim communities against each other and among themselves. Believing their savings are lost, many Lebanese have no plans to return this time as they start over again.

- Among those leaving are doctors. The World Health Organization has said most hospitals are operating at 50% capacity with around 40% of doctors, mostly specialists, permanently emigrating or working part-time abroad.
- Officials and the media talk of Lebanon becoming a ""failed state"". Michel Aoun, the Christian president, warned in December that the state was ""falling apart"". Lebanon's top Sunni cleric said after unrest over fuel shortages in August that the country risked complete collapse unless there was action.

(Reuters) - Lebanon is grappling with a deep economic crisis after successive governments piled up debt following the 1975-1990 civil war with little to show for their spending binge.
Banks, central to the service-oriented economy, are paralysed. Savers have been locked out of dollar accounts or told that funds they can access are now worth a fraction of their original value. The currency has crashed, driving a swathe of the population into poverty.
WHERE DID IT GO WRONG?
Lebanon's financial collapse since 2019 is a story of how a vision for rebuilding a nation once known as the Switzerland of the Middle East was derailed by mismanagement as a sectarian elite borrowed with few restraints.
Downtown Beirut, levelled in the civil war, rose up, with skyscrapers built by international architects and swanky shopping malls filled with designer boutiques that took payment in dollars or Lebanese pounds.
But Lebanon had little else to show for a debt mountain equivalent at the time to 150% of national output, one of the world's highest burdens. Its electricity plants can't deliver 24-hour power and Lebanon's only reliable export is its human capital.
HOW DID IT BORROW SO MUCH?
Some economists have described Lebanon's financial system as a nationally regulated Ponzi scheme, where new money is borrowed to pay existing creditors. It works until fresh money runs out. But how did the nation of about 6.5 million people get there?
After the civil war, Lebanon balanced its books with tourism receipts, foreign aid, earnings from its financial industry and the largesse of Gulf Arab states, which bankrolled the state by bolstering central bank reserves.
One of its most reliable sources of dollars was remittances from the millions of Lebanese who went abroad to find work. Even in the 2008 global financial crash, they sent cash home.
But remittances started slowing from 2011 as Lebanon's sectarian squabbling led to more political sclerosis and much of the Middle East, including neighbouring Syria, descended into chaos.
Sunni Muslim Gulf states, once reliable supporters, started turning away because of the rising influence in Lebanon of Iran, via Hezbollah, a heavily armed Lebanese Shi'ite group whose political power has grown.
The budget deficit rocketed and the balance of payments sank deeper into the red, as transfers failed to match imports of everything from staple foods to flashy cars.
That was until 2016, when banks began offering remarkable interest rates for new deposits of dollars - an officially accepted currency in the dollarised economy - and even more extraordinary rates for Lebanese pound deposits.
Elsewhere in the world savers earned tiny returns.
Given the Lebanese pound had been pegged to the dollar at 1,500 for over two decades and could be freely exchanged at a bank or by a supermarket cashier, what was there to lose?
Dollars flowed again and banks could keep funding the spending.
HOW COULD BANKS OFFER SUCH HIGH RETURNS?
Lebanon was still politically dysfunctional and rivalries had left it without a president for most of 2016.
But the central bank, Banque du Liban, led by former Merrill Lynch banker Riad Salameh since 1993, introduced ""financial engineering"", a range of mechanisms that amounted to offering banks lavish returns for new dollars. It was a tactic bankers say might have been appropriate if it was followed swiftly by reforms - but not if, as was the case, not enough happened.
Improved dollar flows showed up in climbing foreign reserves. What was less obvious - and is now a point of contention - was a rise in liabilities. By some accounts, the central bank's assets are more than wiped out by what it owes, so it may be sitting on big losses.
Meanwhile, the cost of servicing Lebanon's debt surged to about a third or more of budget spending.
WHAT TRIGGERED THE COLLAPSE?
When the state needed to rein in spending, politicians splurged on a public sector pay rise before the 2018 election. And the government's failure to deliver reforms meant foreign donors held back billions of dollars in aid they had pledged.
The final spark for unrest came in October 2019 with a plan to tax WhatsApp calls. With a big diaspora and Lebanon's low tax regime skewed in favour of the rich, slapping a fee on the way many Lebanese kept in touch was disastrous.
Mass protests, driven by a disenchanted youth demanding wholesale change, erupted against a political elite, including ageing militia leaders who thrived while others struggled.
Foreign exchange inflows dried up and dollars exited Lebanon. Banks no longer had enough dollars to pay depositors queuing outside, so they shut their doors. The government also defaulted on its foreign debt.
The currency collapsed, sliding from 1,500 to the dollar before the crisis, to a street rate of about 23,000 in late January 2022, after hitting 34,000 earlier in the month.
Compounding problems, an explosion in August 2020 at Beirut port killed 215 people and caused billions of dollars of damage.
After a rapid economic contraction, government debt by some estimates was 495% of gross domestic product in 2021 - far more than levels that crippled some European states a decade ago.
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

France has been leading international efforts to push Lebanon to tackle corruption and implement reforms demanded by donors. A new government was formed in late 2021, promising to revive talks with the International Monetary Fund. It has yet to implement any significant reform policies.
Crucially, politicians and bankers need to agree on the scale of the vast losses and on what went wrong, so Lebanon can shift direction and stop living beyond its means.

The Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a weekend report to clients that they currently expect interest-rate hikes in March, June, September and December and for the central bank to announce the start of a reduction in its balance sheet in July.
But they said inflation pressures mean that the “risks are tilted somewhat to the upside of our baseline,” and there is a chance officials will act “at every meeting until the inflation picture changes.” 
“This raises the possibility of an additional hike or an earlier balance sheet announcement in May, and of more than four hikes this year,” the economists said. “We could imagine a number of potential triggers for a shift to rate hikes at consecutive meetings.”
Chair Jerome Powell and colleagues meet this week amid expectations they will signal a willingness to lift rates from near zero in March.
Among potential spurs for even tighter policy would be a further increase in long-term inflation expectations or another surprise on inflation, the Goldman Sachs economists said. 
They noted they had already been made more concerned about the inflation outlook by the arrival of the omicron variant and continued strength in wage growth.

758,"<span>Jan 22, 2022 11:35AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Saturday that his Social Democrats (SPD) were pushing ahead with their election promise to raise the national minimum wage to 12 euros an hour, as it was important to show respect for low-paid workers.
Social Democrat Labour Minister Hubertus Heil presented a draft law on Friday proposing to increase the wage floor from the current 9.82 euros from October onwards.
""For me, raising the minimum wage to 12 euros is one of our most important legislative projects and it's a matter of showing respect for the achievements of employees. I'm glad it's on its way now!,"" Scholz said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The labour ministry estimates that more than 6 million people across the country will benefit from the measure and that the increase will cost employers some 1.6 billion euros in October-December.
Heil told Reuters on Friday that he expected the change to benefit especially employees in eastern Germany and women working in the care sector and other services where wages are traditionally very low.
The labour ministry sent around its proposal to the other departments on Friday, with the Social Democrats expecting their junior coalition partners Free Democrats and Greens to back the bill as agreed in coalition talks last year.
The cabinet is likely to pass the draft law in February and parliament is expected to adopt the higher minimum wage before the summer break.
Employers associations have said the increase by more than 20% was too high and warned they could challenge the measure in court. Scholz and Heil both have pushed back against assertions that a higher minimum wage could lead to job cuts.

German companies are already suffering acute labour shortages in many sectors of the economy, so higher wages are also seen as a way to attract more foreign workers.
The Bundesbank central bank has warned that the government's plan could push wages up across the board and increase overall price pressures at a time of already high inflation in Europe's largest economy.

An IMF spokesperson also told Reuters on Saturday that a team will start virtual talks with Lebanese authorities next week.
The Lebanese government has said it hopes to reach an initial agreement with the fund for financial support between January and February. Lebanon is in the grip of an unprecedented financial crisis and an IMF deal is widely seen as the only way for it to secure aid.
The fund said in December it was assessing a $69 billion figure announced by Lebanese officials for losses in the country's financial sector. 
Disagreements in Lebanon over the size of the losses and how they should be distributed torpedoed IMF talks in 2020. The central bank, banks and political elite rejected figures set out in a government plan that was endorsed by the IMF at the time.
Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati said in September that the financial recovery plan to be drawn up by his cabinet will include a fair distribution of losses suffered by the financial system, but the cabinet hasn't convened since October.
It will convene again on Monday to discuss the 2022 budget, but no clear details have been released about the recovery plan. 

The Lebanese financial system collapsed in 2019 because of decades of corruption and waste in the state and the unsustainable way it was financed. The trigger was slowing inflows of hard currency into the banking system, which lent heavily to the government.
Several reforms the IMF would likely seek, including cutting subsidies and unifying the numerous exchange rates in Lebanon's chaotic cash economy, are already becoming realities as hard currency dries up, political sources say.

According to the bank, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's plan to tighten state control of the electricity market could trigger sovereign debt rating downgrades from Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Standard & Poor's. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm raised concerns about the risks to investors from the energy market initiative during talks with Mexican officials this week. 
The JP Morgan report, dated Thursday, stressed that the energy bill was likely to pass at some point this year, even if in watered-down form. The opposition PRI party could support the legislation, potentially fragmenting the opposition to Lopez Obrador.
The bill's approval could enable Lopez Obrador to increase the strength of the presidency and undercut the roles of independent institutions and regulators, JP Morgan economist Gabriel Lozano wrote in the report.
In addition to the bill's passage, Lopez Obrador is likely to get a boost from gubernatorial victories for his Morena party as well as his own expected win in a recall referendum scheduled for April 10, Lozano said. 

Against this backdrop, he expects the Mexico Central Bank to boost interest rates to 7.25% this year and to 8% in 2023 from the current 5.5% level.
“If there are some doubts on whether Banxico (Mexico Central Bank) should follow the Fed throughout 2023 or not, this year’s political events will probably dictate the extent of the coupling, ” the bank said.

(Reuters) - Several U.S. House members from President Joe Biden's Democratic Party are threatening to block a renewed push for his Build Back Better spending bill if it does not include the expansion of a federal deduction for taxes paid to states and local entities. 
Expanding the deduction, known as SALT for State and Local Taxes, has been a demand of lawmakers in higher-tax states such as California, New Jersey and New York, especially in suburbs where Democrats seek to retain control in Nov. 8 elections.
""We support the president’s agenda, and if there are any efforts that include a change in the tax code, then a SALT fix must be part of it. No SALT, no deal,"" members Tom Suozzi of New York and Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer, both of New Jersey, said in a joint statement late on Thursday. 
The SALT deduction, part of the U.S. income tax code from its inception more than a century ago, was restricted to $10,000 in a 2017 Republican tax law. 
The cap disproportionately affects homeowners in higher home-value states that lean toward the Democratic Party, like New Jersey, where the average homeowner pays roughly $9,000 in local property taxes. 
Asked about the House lawmakers' demand, a Biden White House official said: ""We are in touch with a wide range of lawmakers regarding the president’s economic growth plan for the middle class, and weighed in about SALT late last year, but we won’t negotiate in public."" 
The ""SALT caucus"" has more than 30 members in the House of Representatives who want to expand the deduction, including some Republicans, congressional aides say. 
Their demand adds to the challenges the White House faces as it tries to salvage https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-white-house-hopes-save-bidens-spending-bill-2022-01-18 some of Biden's $1.7 trillion spending package and push it through with slim congressional majorities.
As the White House tries to downsize that bill, it may need to jettison hundreds of billions of dollars in social programs, but preserve SALT, a tax deduction that some in the party call a giveaway to the rich.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can only afford three defections because Democrats narrowly control a majority in the 435-member House. 
The House passed a version of Biden’s social-spending bill that increased the cap to $80,000, despite objections from some progressives that it largely benefits higher-income households. The bill died in the 100-member Senate for lack of majority Democratic support.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday rebranded the Biden administration's economic agenda as ""modern supply-side economics,"" using a Reagan-era phrase favored by Republicans to assert that Democrats' spending plans will boost the U.S. economy's productive capacity.
Yellen said in a speech to the World Economic Forum that rather than tax cuts and deregulation, her modernized version seeks to increase labor supply and improve infrastructure, education and research to boost potential U.S. growth and ease inflationary pressures.
""Our new approach is far more promising than the old supply- side economics, which I see as having been a failed strategy for increasing growth,"" Yellen said. ""Significant tax cuts on capital have not achieved their promised gains. And deregulation has a similarly poor track record in general and with respect to environmental policies — especially so with respect to curbing CO2 emissions.""
Yellen did not announce any policy shifts as she introduced the concept, which suggests it may be a new tactic to persuade Americans and moderate Democrats in Congress to support the ""Build Back Better"" social spending and climate investment plan, which stalled in December.
The new nomenclature emphasizes the administration's efforts to expand the U.S. workforce - a sentiment echoed by President Joe Biden in a speech to mayors on Friday - and increase productivity, forces that could help quell inflationary pressures while supporting a stronger growth rate.
The administration is trying to blunt the political fallout from high inflation that hit 7% last month amid labor, housing and goods shortages, the biggest annual increase in nearly 40 years, and counter claims that further spending would fuel further inflation.
A DIFFERENT SUPPLY SIDE
Yellen's vision of ""supply-side economics"" would differ greatly from the ""Reaganomics"" version that burst into the mainstream in the 1980s with the election of Ronald Reagan as president.
Then, lower taxes and lighter regulation were touted as the fuel that would make U.S. businesses more competitive and profitable, unleashing capital investment that would ""trickle down"" to the wider economy, fueling growth and hiring.
At the same time, Republicans argued, the tax cuts would ""pay for themselves"" through turbocharged growth - a phenomenon that has never come to pass.
Yellen argued that the ""supply"" needs of the economy center around the availability of labor, which has been constrained by the pandemic and in the view of Democrats by the absence of policies around things like child and elder care that could allow more people to join the workforce. 
Yellen identified two years of universal early childhood education and an expanded earned income tax credit as ""core"" components of the Build Back Better plan going forward.

She added that Republican-passed tax cuts in 2017, rather than encourage investment in the United States, have perpetuated the 'perverse corporate tax incentives' that have encouraged companies to shift productive capacity overseas as countries compete on taxes. The deal for a global 15% corporate minimum tax, which depends on passage of Build Back Better for implementation, would end this ""race to the bottom"" she said.
""Modern supply-side economics seeks to spur economic growth by both boosting labor supply and raising productivity, while reducing inequality and environmental damage,"" Yellen said. ""Essentially, we aren’t just focused on achieving a high topline growth number that is unsustainable — we are instead aiming for growth that is inclusive and green.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's government will veto 3.1 billion reais ($568 million) in discretionary expenditures and congressional appropriations in the 2022 budget to allow those funds to be spent on the public payroll, two Ministry of Economy sources said on Friday.
The government had wanted to veto up to 9 billion reais but decided that would be politically difficult in an election year since Congress has already approved the budget bill.
President Jair Bolsonaro has until today to sign the bill.
The electoral fund, which will support this year's election campaigns, will be kept at 4.9 billion reais, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
Two of the sources said room for salary readjustments of public servants would be maintained at 1.7 billion reais as approved by Congress.
This reserve for wage increases was in the spotlight this week when civil servants began a partial strike demanding higher salaries.
Last year, Bolsonaro said only civil servants working for the security services would get pay raises, which triggered protests from other public sector employees.

Bolsonaro, who will seek re-election in October has yet to decide which employees will get raises.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden called on U.S. mayors on Friday to use more of their state and local COVID-19 aid funds to boost worker training and pay child care workers, moves that could increase the supply of workers and reduce income inequality. 
Biden said in remarks to the United States Conference of Mayors to use American Rescue Plan resources to ""build for a better future around the people who make communities run.""
""Use your funds to cover child care costs, or temporary paid leave to help certain workers dealing with Omicron,"" Biden said. ""Build pathways to better jobs, through union-based apprenticeships, on-the-job training. To give people in every ZIP code a chance to deal for themselves.""
The call comes as Biden's administration is shifting the way it promotes its economic agenda, casting its ""Build Back Better"" social and climate spending plan as a way to boost the economy's productive capacity, by increasing available labor and productivity -- blunting criticism from Republicans that it would increase inflationary pressures.
Earlier on Friday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen branded the new approach https://www.reuters.com/business/yellen-rebrands-biden-economic-agenda-modern-supply-side-economics-2022-01-21 ""modern supply side economics,"" twisting around a phrase normally associated with the Reagan-era tax cuts and reduced regulation favored by Republicans.
The Biden administration is facing pressure to control inflation, which soared by 7% last year, the biggest annual increase in nearly 40 years https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-consumer-prices-increase-strongly-december-2022-01-12 as demand for goods and housing outstripped supply, a phenomenon which economists attribute partly to a lack of qualified workers.
Biden said his spending legislation would increase labor supply by cutting child care costs, allowing women to return to the workforce.
""This bill would reduce inflationary pressures on the economy -- not increase it, reduce it,"" Biden said.

Cities have wide-ranging ability to use money from the $350 billion State and Local Fiscal Relief Fund, which was approved in last year's American Rescue Plan COVID-19 aid legislation.
The Treasury Department earlier this month issued final rules for the program that allow greater flexibility for use of the funds on programs such as early childhood education, child care and affordable housing.

Lithuanian businesses reported being unable to export or import into China after allowing self-ruled Taiwan, which China views as part of its territory, to open a representation office last year.
China has pressed multinationals to sever ties with Lithuania or face exclusion from its market, a harsh move that has dragged companies into a political dispute and placed Beijing on a collision course with the European Union. 
Lithuania was promissed by European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager the state support for the businesses would be reviewed as soon as possible, the economy ministry said in a statement on Friday.

In addition to the fund, which can loan companies up to 10 million euros, Lithuania wants to allow the affected businesses to access the upcoming 200 million euros loan fund which is being set up to fight the effects of COVID-19 pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday said two years of universal early childhood education and an expanded income tax credit were critical components of the $1.7 trillion Build Back Better plan that is still being negotiated with Congress.
U.S. President Joe Biden this week said he needs to break up the signature legislation, passing a large chunk now and other measures later in the year, after running into opposition from fellow Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema.
Biden on Wednesday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-says-he-will-look-pass-build-back-better-elements-piecemeal-2022-01-19 cited strong support for the bill's $555 billion in climate change spending and noted that Manchin supported early childhood education, but conceded that plans to fund two years of free community college and a child tax credit would likely be dropped to ensure passage.
Yellen said final details were still being worked out with lawmakers, but singled out as ""core"" Biden's proposals to provide two years of universal pre-kindergarten, expand elder care, cap childcare expenditures for most families at 7% of their income, and expand the Earned-Income Tax Credit.
Those measures would bolster economic security for households and boost economic growth, while incentivizing lower-income workers to seek employment, Yellen told an event hosted by the World Economic Forum, omitting any mention of the expanded child tax credit payments favored by progressive and moderate Democrats, but opposed by Manchin.
The child tax credit is a credit for having dependent children younger than age 17. The Earned-Income Credit (EIC) is a credit for certain lower-income taxpayers, with or without children.
Yellen's remarks at a virtual event hosted by the World Economic Forum revealed the emerging framework for a slimmed-down version https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-white-house-hopes-save-bidens-spending-bill-2022-01-18 of Biden's initial Build Back Better plan.
She said the social spending would help reverse the ongoing decline in U.S. labor force participation, which has been dragged lower by early retirements and some younger and middle-aged workers staying out.
Biden made a big push in December to win passage in Congress of the spending bill, with higher taxes on big companies and wealthy Americans slated to cover the cost.
But the bill's progress was stymied when Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia, pulled his support in December after citing concerns about the deficit and inflation.

With all 50 Republicans in the 100-seat Senate opposed to the spending bill, the White House has to win over Manchin and any other Democratic holdouts. If it succeeds, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris could cast a tie-breaking vote.
Manchin indicated earlier this month that he supported $555 billion in climate spending, including production tax credits for solar and wind industries, which are seen as vital to ensure the United States reaches its 2030 emissions reduction goals.

While acknowledging that price rises represent “a valid policy concern,” Yellen said on Friday that “it’s important to note that professional forecasters think that inflation will substantially abate next year.” She made the remarks in a speech delivered by video to the World Economic Forum’s Virtual Davos Agenda.
She also called the U.S. labor market “exceptionally strong” and called forecasts for 3.3% growth in 2022 a “stunning economic and policy achievement.”
The Treasury secretary’s remarks contrast with widespread public sentiment in the U.S. that the economy is on the wrong track, amid worries that high inflation will continue to erode the buying power of households.
While growth and employment has bounced back strongly from the collapse in early 2020 at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, inflation has roared to an almost 40-year peak.
Public Dissatisfaction
Consumer prices rose 7% in 2021, their biggest 12-month jump since 1982, driven by supply constraints connected to the pandemic and government stimulus meant to support families and businesses through the economic fallout.
President Joe Biden has seen his approval ratings tumble amid public dissatisfaction with the state of the economy. A recent CBS News poll showed his rating for handling the economy was at 38%, with two-thirds of Americans thinking the president isn’t focused enough on the burden of inflation. Meantime, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index in November hit the lowest in almost a decade.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) -Chile's leftist President-elect Gabriel Boric unveiled his Cabinet on Friday, throwing markets and investors a bone by picking current central bank head Mario Marcel to be the Andean country's finance minister.
Boric also named Izkia Siches, a prominent doctor and part of his campaign team, as the interior minister and his deputy, as well as lawmaker Marcela Hernando for the key role of mining minister, where copper and lithium development will be in focus.
The balanced make-up of the incoming government suggests Boric, a 35-year-old lawmaker and former student protest leader, may look to push gradual reforms rather than abrupt changes some had feared in the world's top copper producing nation.
""Naming Mario Marcel as finance minister is a very good sign of economic stability, seen positively by markets,"" said Miguel Angel Lopez, a public affairs professor at the University of Chile, adding it was a mix of coalition allies and technocrats.
""It's all linked to a much more centrist, more pragmatic shift in terms of what Boric wants to do in his government.""
The new government, which will take office on March 11, was made up of members of parties across the political spectrum, reflecting a fragmented and diverse Congress. Women will lead more than half of the ministries.
Boric pledged during the election campaign to enact major reforms to Chile's market-led economic model, rattling investors, though he has moderated his tone since, boosting Chile's markets and currency.
The peso currency strengthened early on Friday to under 800 per dollar for the first time since November. A select index of Chilean equities also rose more than 2%.
'GREAT REFORMS'
Boric during the campaign pledged to ""bury"" Chile's market-orientated model, which has driven growth in the South American country in recent decades but has also deepened inequality, triggering months of social protests at the end of 2019.
He has promised to reform the private pension and health systems and raise taxes to finance greater social spending.
""This Cabinet's mission is to lay the foundations for the great reforms that we have proposed in our program,"" Boric said after unveiling his ministers, adding that it would look to drive economic growth while cutting out ""structural inequalities.""
""We are talking about sustainable growth accompanied by a fair redistribution of wealth,"" he said.
Chile, a global front-runner in the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines, ended last year as the world's best-performing economy, buoyed by large state spending and several rounds of private pensions withdrawals to ease the impact of the pandemic.
Boric will, however, have to contend with signs of an overheating economy and inflation, as well as a fragmented Congress, which analysts say will force him to seek consensus with more centrist sectors.
""One of Boric's biggest challenges will be cooling down the economy and retaining popular support,"" Oxford Economics said in a report, adding that the young leader would face pressure to increase social spending while meeting tighter budget targets.

(Reuters) - The world's biggest central banks, moving in tandem at the height of the pandemic, are set to tighten policy at vastly different speeds, likely increasing economic and market volatility this year, top policymakers said on Friday.
Central banks unleashed unprecedented stimulus in recent years to prop up growth but excessive cash has now pushed inflation to multi-decade highs around much of the world, raising fears that policymakers are falling behind the curve. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to lead the way, hiking rates possibly as soon as next week, while the Bank of Japan, sitting at the other end of the spectrum, is likely to keep policy exceptionally loose for years to come. 
“The issue here is that what the Fed does, has implications for the U.S., it has implications for other countries, especially those that have high levels of dollar denominated debt,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said. 
""That could throw cold water on what for some countries is already a weak recovery,"" she told a World Economic Forum panel, adding that countries with high dollar debt should refinance now. 
Indeed, expectations for quicker Fed action have already pushed up borrowing costs across the world and the yield for 10-year German bonds briefly moved into positive territory this week for the first since early 2019. 
Georgieva said containing the pandemic and boosting vaccination rates was imperative to address the widening gap between rich and poor countries, and to secure future growth for all. ""The world must spend the billions necessary to contain COVID in order to gain trillions in output,"" she said.
The problem with inflation is that its rates now vastly differ around the world, leading to varying degree of social and political tension as the price of everyday consumer goods from food to fuels, soar.
U.S. inflation is now at 7.0%, the highest rate since 1982, and looks to be stubborn, leading to policymakers there giving up on the idea that the spike is transitory. Meanwhile, in the euro zone, price growth is at 5.0% but seen back below 2% by the end of the year while in Japan, the rate is just 0.6%.
VARYING SPEEDS
The big difference is that the U.S. recovery is well advanced, leading to the sort of wage surge and labour market stress others are not yet experiencing.
""When I look at the labour market, we are not experiencing anything like the great resignation and our employment participation numbers are getting close to the pre-pandemic level,"" European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told the online panel. 
""If only those two factors, if you look at them carefully, are clearly indicating that we are not moving at the same speed and we are unlikely to experience the same kind of inflation increases that the U.S. market has faced,"" she added.
Still, the ECB has also started moving away from its exceptionally easy policy and plans to continue cutting asset purchases throughout the year, Lagarde added. 

Meanwhile Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said his bank is not even contemplating a move in that direction just yet.
""We're not afraid of inflation because inflation (in Japan) is so low,"" Kuroda said. “Unlike in the U.S. or Europe, we have to continue our extremely accommodative, easy monetary policy for the time being.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada will raise interest rates earlier than was thought a month ago, with only a slim majority of economists polled by Reuters expecting it to wait until the second quarter and a handful now expecting a hike on Jan. 26.
Just one month ago, analysts predicted the first hike would come in the third quarter. But persistently high Canadian inflation , which accelerated to a 30-year peak in December, prompted some economists to bring forward their expectations.
Other major central banks, including the Federal Reserve and Bank of England , are expected to raise rates in the coming months to tackle multi-decade-high inflation despite an expected near-term hit to growth from restrictions related to the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Median forecasts in the Jan. 14-21 poll of 31 economists said the BoC would raise its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 0.75% next quarter and end the year with the rate at 1.00%. That compares with an end-year prediction of 0.75% in a December poll.
In the latest survey, taken mostly after the recent inflation release, nearly one-quarter of respondents, seven of 31, expected a rate hike next week when the Canadian central bank is set to publish updated quarterly economic forecasts.
Economists were nearly evenly split about a rate hike in the first quarter.
Financial market traders are pricing in an 85% probability of a lift-off in rates at the Jan. 26 meeting, with at least five increases in borrowing costs this year.

""I do think the risk around our forecast for three hikes is tilted to the upside ... But I think the market has probably gone a bit far in pricing more than five hikes,"" said Josh Nye, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
""The BoC will want to raise rates a bit more gradually than that and we'll start to see some of these headline (inflation) rates coming down as soon as January as some of the earlier base effects come out of the year-over-year calculations.""
All 15 respondents to an extra question said the risk was that BoC rate rises would come faster than they predicted. Three more rate rises were forecast for 2023, likely in line with expectations for the U.S. central bank, taking the Canadian central bank's key rate to 1.75%. 
""Various (Fed) members have called for three or four rate hikes in the U.S. this year,"" said Christian Lawrence, senior strategist at Rabobank. 
""And while the BoC is not at the mercy of Fed policy, in a follow-the-leader manner, a more hawkish Fed does reverberate across other central banks, particularly one that sits so close and whose economy is inextricably linked.""

Canada's inflation rate was expected to average 4.5% this quarter and 4.1% in the next, easing off December's 4.8% reading. But those forecasts are sharply higher than the 3.7% and 3.1% predicted three months ago.
Inflation was expected to cool but will still be just above the BoC's 2.0% target throughout next year.
In the near term, pandemic restrictions likely led to a sharp slowdown in growth to just 1.5% this quarter, seasonally adjusted and annualized, from an expected 5.3% in the October-December period in 2021.
But economic growth was set to snap back sharply to 6.0% and 4.7% in the next two quarters.

Nearly two-thirds of respondents to an additional question, nine of 14, said the Omicron variant would have a milder impact on the economy compared with the Delta variant.

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -The provincial government leading China Evergrande Group's restructuring wants to separate the company's offshore assets and sell them to pay off foreign debt, a media report said on Friday, in a boost to foreign lenders' hopes of recouping funds. 
Financial intelligence provider REDD said on Friday the provincial government in Guangdong, where Evergrande is based, aimed to release a framework debt restructuring plan by March that could also wipe out the 60% stake of the group's chairman.
Citing two sources briefed on the matter, REDD said the provincial government was proposing that state-led investors should buy Evergrande <3333,HK> assets and that proceeds from the sale of foreign assets should be used to pay offshore debt. 
While investors have been expecting state-led organisations to help smooth the restructuring, some have been concerned that Beijing would use proceeds from any asset sales to prioritise paying off onshore debt. 
The provincial government has finalised the framework document and submitted it to China's cabinet for discussions late this week, REDD said, adding a detailed restructuring proposal would be released by October. 
The provincial government, cabinet and Evergrande did not respond to requests for comment outside regular business hours. 
Evergrande is the world's most-indebted property company with more than $300 billion in liabilities, including nearly $20 billion of international bonds all deemed to be in default after a run of missed payments late last year. 
Evergrande's April 2023 U.S. dollar bond jumped to 17.762 cents on the dollar after the REDD report, data by Duration Finance showed, up from 12.227 overnight. Its shares closed down 0.6%, before the report was published. 
The REDD report also said Evergrande Chairman Hui Ka Yan's 59.78% stake in the company could be wiped out after completion of the restructuring because the developer is ""significantly insolvent."" 
Earlier on Friday, the developer said in a filing it was hiring more financial and legal advisers - China International Capital Corp Ltd, BOCI Asia Ltd and Zhong Lun Law Firm - to follow up with demands from creditors. 
That came a day after an offshore creditor group, represented by law firm Kirkland & Ellis and investment bank Moelis (NYSE:MC), said it was ready to take ""enforcement actions"" to defend members' rights after what it said was Evergrande's lack of engagement.
Evergrande has asked offshore bondholders to disclose holdings, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Friday. The developer is seeking replies by mid-next week to identify investors for communications, to aid debt restructuring. 
SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT
Stocks and bonds of Chinese property developers have gained this week on hopes a slew of recent government measures would help the sector's liquidity and reverse a slump in construction, a key economic growth driver.
In another sign of improving sentiment, Country Garden, China's biggest property developer by sales, said it would issue HK$3.9 billion of convertible bonds to refinance debt that will become due within one year. 
The bonds, due July 2026 and which could be sold back to the company in January 2024, carry 4.95% interest and have an initial conversion price of HK$8.10 per share. At full conversion, the shares would represent 2% of enlarged capital.
The new issue followed a report that the developer failed to attract demand for a potential $300 million convertible bond last Wednesday. IFR reported Country Garden tested the waters for a three-year deal which would carry a yield-to-maturity of 4.75% and a conversion premium of 25%.
Shares of Country Garden dropped nearly 3% to HK$6.76, while its January 2023 international bond rose to 97.825 from 92.787 overnight.
BUYING TIME
Evergrande's financial crisis has roiled other Chinese property developers over the past half year and exacerbated a funding squeeze in the sector.
Rating agency Fitch downgraded China Aoyuan Group to ""restricted default"" on Friday after the firm said it planned not to make principal and interest payments for all its offshore debt.
Beijing stepped up efforts to prop up a slowing economy with a raft of key rate cuts this week.

Policymakers are also drafting nationwide rules to make it easier for developers to access funds from sales still held in escrow accounts, which would improve their short-term liquidity and buy time to repay debt, Reuters reported on Wednesday.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China will be able to achieve economic growth of around 5.5% in 2022, an adviser to the government's cabinet said on Friday, making a rosier prediction than markets expect as recent data have pointed to slowing momentum.
The world's second-largest economy cooled over the course of last year and faces multiple headwinds as a property downturn hurts investment and China's efforts to contain local cases of the highly contagious Omicron variant of COVID-19 weigh on consumption.
That has prompted policymakers to roll out an array of support measures, including Friday's cut by the central bank in the rate on standing lending facility (SLF) loans by 10 basis points, a day after it cut benchmark lending rates.
Friday's comments by Zhu Guangyao, a former vice finance minister, are more optimistic than those from private economists. 
A Reuters poll of analysts published on Jan. 13 forecast China’s economy would grow 5.2% in 2022.
The government will unveil a growth target for 2022 at the opening of the annual parliament meeting in early March.
""I’m confident that China's economic growth will be around 5.5% in 2022,"" Zhu told a media briefing, adding that the potential economic growth rate was estimated at 5-6%.
Li Yang, former vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think tank, said China has policy space to support the economy.
China was restrained on monetary policy and fiscal policy in 2021, leaving some space for this year, Li said during the same event on Friday hosted by China's State Council Information Office.
On Thursday, Premier Li Keqiang said China will take more ""practical and concrete measures"" to boost effective demand and stabilise market expectations, state media reported.
China's cabinet has pledged to speed the issuance of local government special bonds to boost investment, while the finance ministry has issued 1.46 trillion yuan ($230.26 billion)in the 2022 advance quota for local special bonds.
STABILITY KEY
Chinese policymakers, however, have ruled out ""flood-like"" stimulus for fear of reigniting debt and property risks.
China's economy expanded 8.1% in 2021, the fastest in a decade due partly to the low base from 2020 when COVID-19 jolted the economy, comfortably beating an official target of ""above 6%"".
Last year, Chinese policymakers focused on curbing property and debt risks, exacerbating the slowdown, but have eased back somewhat so as not to fuel job losses ahead of a key Communist Party Congress late this year.
Zhu also said that expected interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve could have a big market impact, Zhu said, and said that the United States should strengthen its policy coordination with emerging economies, including China.
""We hope the United States could change the idea that ‘the dollar is our currency, but your problem’, and truly strengthen its policy coordination with other countries, especially developing countries and emerging market countries,"" Zhu said.
Li said the expected Fed tightening could trigger capital outflows from developing countries, with some already feeling the pressure.
The impact on China's economy will be contained by its controls on capital flows and a managed-float yuan exchange rate, Li added.

Economists polled by Reuters expect the Fed to raise its key interest rate three times this year, tightening policy at a much faster pace than thought a month ago to tame persistently high inflation.

The introduction of checks on some goods since neighbouring Britain left the European Union's trading orbit at the end of 2020 led to a sharp fall in trade between it and EU-member Ireland and an increase in shipping routes from Ireland to mainland Europe.
The volume of accompanied freight on the main routes between Dublin and Britain fell by 21% to 703,000 while the 259,000 units on direct routes to continental Europe represented a three-fold increase, figures from Ireland's largest port showed.
""The landbridge has gone. It hasn't re-emerged. I thought it would but it hasn't and there's nothing to suggest it is going to in my mind because the British have yet to introduce import controls. I don't see the landbridge recovering,"" Dublin Port Chief Executive Eamonn O'Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY) told the Irish Times.
A spokesman for the port confirmed that the quote was accurate.

For decades, the landbridge offered offered the swiftest, most reliable route to mainland Europe. It involved a short sea crossing between Dublin and Holyhead in Wales and then a hop between Dover (NYSE:DOV) and Calais in France.
The second largest port of Rosslare in the southeast has also benefitted from the move towards direct European routes, while more Irish goods are being shipped to Britain via Northern Ireland as there are no checks in the British-run region.

Investing.com -- Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s profit warning issues the clearest challenge yet to growth stock valuations, while Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) and wind turbine maker Siemens Energy also fall heavily on disappointing news flow. Russia and the U.S. hold last-ditch talks to avert war in Ukraine but hopes to avert conflict are low. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is planning to build another $20 billion chip factory, this time in Ohio. And oil prices slip from seven-year highs on concerns about a Covid-driven soft patch for the economy. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 21st January.
1. Netflix struggles to grow; Peloton hits the brakes
Netflix stock lost nearly one-fifth of its value after forecasting a sharp slowdown in subscriber growth in the current quarter. The stock is set to open at its lowest since April 2020, having effectively unwound almost all the gains it posted since the start of the pandemic.
Netflix is hardly the first technology stock to fall out of bed in the last few months. However, it is by some distance the biggest and highest-profile company to do so. While investors may have dismissed the problems of other ech darlings as being down to company-specific issues, Netflix’s inability to sustain the narrative of unending growth that has driven its stock market gains for the last decade is more likely to have implications for its peers.
Netflix wasn’t the only big bet on future trends to turn south overnight. Peloton stock – another early winner from the pandemic – tumbled after reports that it’s cutting production of its bikes and treadmills due to slumping demand, while Siemens Energy (DE:ENR1n), which owns one of the world’s biggest wind turbine businesses, fell 13% after warning that it was struggling to pass on higher costs to customers.
2. Blinken, Lavrov go through the motions
U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is holding talks in Geneva, Switzerland, with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in an attempt to avert war in Ukraine.
The talks are reportedly scheduled to last only 90 minutes and a press conference is scheduled for 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), which gives the two sides little time to achieve anything substantial.
Ukraine is a sovereign state and a member of the United Nations. Russia, which already invaded it in 2014, annexing part of its territory and establishing breakaway republics in its east, has repeatedly that the mere possibility of it choosing to join NATO in the future is justification for a pre-emptive military invasion on its part. NATO has not offered Ukraine a path to membership.
French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are also holding talks on Ukraine today. The two countries’ vulnerability to economic pressure from Russian energy supplies has effectively prevented any unified western response, as it did in 2014.
3. Stocks set to open lower again; Nasdaq in correction territory
U.S. stocks are set to open lower again, with Netflix’s profit warning and developments at Peloton dealing a fresh blow to belief that the market can sustain what is still a historically high valuation.
By 6:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.8%. The Dow is set for a decline of over 3% this week, while the Nasdaq Composite is now firmly in correction territory, having declined over 10% from its November peak.
Stocks reporting earnings later include oilfield services giant Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), railroad operator Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) and IHS Markit (NYSE:INFO).  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) will also be in focus after its quarterly earnings late on Thursday came and went without any further negative shocks. 
4. Intel 'to build new chip plant in Ohio'
The semiconductor cycle continues to turn. With signs that demand is set to outstrip supply for longer than thought, Intel has committed to building a new $20 billion chip factory in Ohio, according to Time magazine and others.
It’s the latest multi-billion dollar capacity expansion to be announced by the world’s major chipmakers. Samsung (KS:005930) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) have, like Intel, also committed to large-scale investments over the coming years.
Intel stock, whose modest performance over the last two years has left it less vulnerable to valuation-driven sell-offs, fell 0.4% in premarket trading.
5. Oil slips as gasoline inventories continue to mount                               
Crude oil prices slid on concerns that the latest wave of Covid-19 will hold world demand back in the short term, allowing the restoration of some depleted inventories around the world.
U.S. gasoline inventories rose by over 5 million barrels for the third week in a row last week, although the rise was the smallest in those three weeks. Those numbers coincided with data showing jobless claims surged to a three-month high as the hospitality and travel sectors were hit by a sudden shift in customer behavior.
By 6:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 1.8% at $83.98 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 1.7% at $86.87 a barrel. Baker Hughes’ rig count and the CFTC’s positioning data round off the week later."
777,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 06:13AM ET</span>",,,,,,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's central bank said on Friday it has cut interest rates on another key monetary policy tool, capping off a week of easing measures that underscore official concern about a darkening outlook for the world's second-largest economy.
In a response to Reuters questions, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it had trimmed rates on its standing lending facility (SLF) loans by 10 basis points (bps) effective Jan. 17.
Under the SLF programme, financial institutions can obtain temporary liquidity from the central bank. 
The bank said it had lowered the overnight SLF rate to 2.95% from 3.05%, the 7-day rate to 3.10% from 3.20%, and the 1-month rate to 3.45% from 3.55%.
Reuters had earlier reported, citing three sources with direct knowledge of the matter, that the bank planned to cut SLF rates following a series of reductions in China's key interest rates, as Beijing eases monetary policy to shore up cooling activity. 
The economy grew 4% in the fourth quarter - the slowest rate in one-and-half years - weighed down by a deepening property market slump and weak consumption amid sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks.
Analysts expect more easing measures in China in coming months, even as other major global central banks begin tightening policy and withdrawing unprecedented amounts of liquidity pumped into their economies to cushion the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
China will appropriately step up policy support for the economy as it faces new downward pressure, Premier Li Keqiang was quoted by state media as saying.
But Li, in remarks made on Thursday, reiterated that the government will not resort to ""flood-like"" stimulus.
""We see that the monetary policy easing cycle is only at the start. We're expecting more cuts,"" said Paula Chan, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment. She said she expects China's benchmark 10-year yield to test a low of 2.5%.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Chinese government bonds stood at 2.705% on Friday evening. Earlier in the day, China's 2-year yield touched its lowest level since June 2020, and was last at 2.16%.
On Thursday, China trimmed loan prime rates (LPRs), the benchmark rates for mortgages and other types of loans. On Monday, the PBOC surprised markets by cutting the borrowing costs of its medium-term loans for the first time since April 2020, and also lowered a short-term lending rate.
Nomura analysts, however, believe the economic boost from rate cuts so far will be quite limited, as they have been too small to have a material impact.

The SLF was created by the PBOC in 2013 to meet the temporary liquidity needs of financial institutions, and its interest rates are determined by monetary policy direction and other money market rates in China.
Chinese banks can borrow SLF loans from the PBOC using qualified bonds and other credit assets as collateral.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will appropriately step up policy support for the economy as it faces new downward pressure, Premier Li Keqiang was quoted by state media as saying.

779,"<span>Jan 21, 2022 05:00AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Europe is moving fast to exit the emergency coronavirus measures that have disrupted all aspects of life for the past two years, a recognition that the measures have been largely futile against the omicron variant.
Ireland is set to announce it’s dropping most pandemic restrictions on Friday, days after England outlined its own dramatic move to scrap rules forcing people to wear face masks in shops and ending mandatory isolation for positive cases. 
France is also relaxing curbs even after reporting a record number of cases -- almost 470,000 -- in one day earlier this week.
The various announcements mark a growing sign that the road back to normal, or something resembling it, is well under way in Europe. But they also reflect the fact that omicron appears practically unstoppable, with the EU reporting more than 2.3 million cases on Thursday alone. 
With omicron symptoms milder than the earlier delta variant and hospitalization rates in check, governments are struggling to justify imposing curbs on people and businesses. Some have already started talking about treating Covid-19 as an endemic, rather than a pandemic, as they move toward “living with the virus” policies.
The rollout of vaccines is key to that push. While inoculations haven’t been able to halt omicron infections, studies show they limit the chance of developing severe symptoms. European authorities have repeatedly pointed out that unvaccinated people make up the majority of intensive-care admissions from the virus. 
In the effort to get as many people vaccinated as possible, Austria is pushing the hardest by making shots mandatory. On Thursday, lawmakers passed a law to enact the policy, which will include fines as high as 3,600 euro ($4,100). 
In Ireland, government medical advisers proposed ending early closing times for bars and restaurants and dropping the need for vaccine passes to access indoor facilities such as gyms, local media including broadcaster RTE reported. Mask wearing, passes for international travel and self isolation for symptomatic people are likely to be the only rules that will remain in place. 
France will lift the obligation to work from home at least three days a week, remove a requirement to wear a mask outdoors and scrap attendance limits for sports arenas and cultural venues.
Still, some health experts, including the World Health Organization, have warned against complacency, saying the virus could mutate again and people should continue to try to protect themselves from infection. 
Germany looks likely to stick with its rules, when Chancellor Olaf Scholz meets with state leaders on Monday to discuss the pandemic. 
Stephan Weil, the premier of the state of Lower Saxony, said the country should stick with its current measures, but doesn’t need stiffer controls despite soaring infections.
“We still need protective measures but we don’t need to return to total lockdown as the situation has changed, he said on ARD television on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England will press ahead with its tightening cycle next month as red-hot inflation runs well ahead of target and the economic threat from the Omicron coronavirus variant should prove milder than previous mutations, a Reuters poll found.
Britain's central bank became last month the first major rate-setter to increase interest rates since the coronavirus pandemic began, surprising markets and many economists who had expected a delay.
The central bank said at the time it had to act, even as the Omicron variant swept Britain, because it saw warning signs in underlying inflation pressures.
Inflation, reported on Wednesday at a near 30-year high in December, will peak next quarter before starting to decline in the third quarter and won't reach the BoE's 2% target until the second quarter of next year, the poll found, adding pressure on the central bank to act.
Median inflation forecasts for this quarter and next jumped to 5.2% and 5.5% in the latest poll, which was released on Friday, from 4.7% and 4.6% in the one released in December.
""Inflation has surprised higher, again, and that's only likely to increase the temptation for Bank of England policymakers to hike rates for a second consecutive meeting this February,"" said James Smith at ING. 
(Graphic, Reuters Poll: UK inflation and interest rate outlook: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/lgvdwjzalpo/UK%20inflation%20and%20interest%20rate.PNG)  
Markets are pricing in around an 85% chance of an increase in the BoE's main interest rate to 0.50% next month.
British consumers face the added headache of an estimated 50% increase in energy costs in April alongside an increase in social security contributions.
Almost 65% of respondents in the Jan. 17-20 poll expected a 25-basis-point rate increase from 0.25% when the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee meets on Feb. 3 while the proportion expecting a rise to 0.50% by the end of March was more than 75%.
Median forecasts showed the BoE hiking its main interest rate by another 25 basis points in the third quarter - a quarter earlier than predicted last month - but it will then wait until early next year before raising it again, to 1.00%, also earlier than previously expected.
When asked how high that rate would go in the current cycle, the median response was 1.50%, still an historically low level. 
Also priming for action, the Federal Reserve https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-raise-rates-three-times-this-year-tame-unruly-inflation-2022-01-20 will raise interest rates three times this year, another Reuters poll found.
OMICRON
Britain's economy surpassed its pre-pandemic size https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-economy-finally-bigger-than-before-pandemic-november-2022-01-14 in November, official data showed last week, although some of that momentum was probably lost as people stayed home ahead of the holiday season to ensure they were healthy for Christmas celebrations.
Shopper numbers https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/uk-shopper-footfall-central-london-drops-30-versus-last-week-2021-12-24 in central London on Christmas Eve were 30.3% lower than on the previous Friday, according to data from Springboard. 
Economic growth was expected to have slowed to 0.6% this quarter after expanding by 1.0% at the end of 2021, the poll found. It will then grow 0.9% next quarter before slowing to 0.7% and 0.6% in the following two quarters.
GDP growth for 2022 was pegged at 4.5%, the median of 66 economists showed, and in 2023 it was put at 2.2%. That follows an expected 7.0% expansion last year. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who faces growing calls to step down over a series of scandals, took a light touch approach in dealing with Omicron, stopping short of imposing the strict measures during previous waves. On Wednesday he announced the end of most COVID-19 limitations.
So when asked what impact the Omicron variant would have on the economy compared to the Delta variant, all but three of 24 respondents to an additional question said it would be milder or much milder. 
(Graphic, Reuters Poll: UK economic outlook: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/akpezewxbvr/Omicron.png)  
""As we head into the spring I imagine confidence will be supported by the fact COVID-19 cases will be somewhat lower and we have an entire economy of people who want to go out and spend money,"" said George Buckley at Nomura.

""It suggests we will see an increase in consumer spending, particularly services spending, as we stop buying stuff and start buying experiences.""

1/ COUNTDOWN TO LIFTOFF
If markets have it right, the Fed's Jan.25-26 meeting will be the last one before interest rates lift off. 
Roughly four rate hikes are priced for this year, starting in March, but the rates outlook aside, markets will listen for what the Fed says about its $8-plus trillion balance sheet.
December meeting minutes showed lengthy discussions about reducing bond holdings. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the balance sheet could be shrunk faster than in the past.
A Reuters poll predicts the Fed to start trimming its balance sheet by end-September, though some reckon it may happen sooner and faster than flagged. Hawkish signals could extend the selloff in Treasuries and tech shares.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada isn't waiting around for its neighbour and could commence raising rates on Wednesday.

Could 2022 could be the year European equities break a six-year run of underperformance against U.S. peers? 
The old continent is home to an army of cyclical and value (read cheap) stocks like banks, which typically outperform tech in times of monetary tightening. With Wall Street lagging European markets this year, this dynamic seems already at play. 
The Q4 earnings season offers encouragement to Europe bulls; Refinitiv I/B/E/S data shows earnings surging 49% year-on-year. Luxury groups Richemont and Burberry awed markets with quarterly updates. European profits also appear less threatened by wage inflation,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts note. 
U.S. earnings are seen growing 23%, and markets are still coming to terms with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' profit miss and hefty cost increases. 
In coming days, European names LVMH, STMicro and Philips are among those reporting and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the U.S..

Italy needs a new president and the complex process to replace outgoing Sergio Mattarella kicks off Monday, with PM Mario Draghi a frontrunner for the post. 
It could mean weeks of political instability for Italy. If Draghi gets the job, a new prime minister must be found and the multi-party coalition supporting his government could unravel. The same could happen if the parties fail to agree an alternative candidate. 
All this just as bond market angst grows about rising inflation and a more aggressive ECB response. Russia's troop build-up near Ukraine's border is stoking war fears, meaning geopolitical developments more broadly will continue to grab markets' attention.

4/RATES UP DOWN UNDER?
The Fed is not the only central bank to have underestimated inflation. Australian CPI data on Tuesday may well force Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe to capitulate on his long-held contention that rate hikes this year are ""extremely unlikely.""
Money markets have long doubted Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) scenario, and are pricing a first hike to a quarter percent as soon as May with at least three additional quarter-point increases by year-end.
Australia's jobless rate has plunged to its lowest since 2008 and some economists predict core inflation could jump to its highest since 2009, at 2.5%. At the very least, such a reading should seal an end to pandemic-time bond purchases at the Feb. 1 RBA meeting.

Considering the spread of Omicron, global business activity held up surprisingly well in December, purchasing managers indexes (PMI) showed. But when advance January PMIs emerge on Monday, focus will be on how cost pressures are shaping up.

Composite input prices slipped last month as factories' supply chain delays eased, but U.S. service sector input prices rose to the highest since 2009. In Europe they stayed near November's record high, and rose in China for the 18th straight month.
In countries where services contribute the lion's share of economic output, soaring costs add more uncertainty to the inflation outlook. GRAPHIC: Input costs, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgpdwjbyovo/Pasted%20image%201642626686730.png

The Ant subsidiary was Shanghai Yunxin Venture Capital Management Co, the newspaper said.
State broadcaster CCTV named the two mobile payment businesses in a show it aired on Wednesday on the corruption probe into Zhou, who came under investigation by China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CDDI) in August.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - More governments are seeking ways to prevent surging inflation whipping up economic trouble - and even public unrest - without raising interest rates. 
But as the examples below show, past attempts to rein in soaring prices without hiking borrowing costs have often ended badly.
TURKEY
Turkey has spent years slashing rates only to hike again when the lira collapses, stoking inflation. 
It has dabbled with measures including FX restrictions, but this time President Tayyip Erdogan is going all-in by offering to compensate lira savers from the public purse if currency losses exceed bank account interest rates.
That could prove costly, and put at risk a main draw for foreign investors - Turkey's relatively low government debt.
""What the Turks are trying, honestly - I have never seen anything like it before,"" said AXA's chief economist Gilles Moec. Graphic: Turkey inflation seen hitting 55% by mid-year , https://graphics.reuters.com/TURKEY-INFLATION/lgvdwjjwepo/chart.png 
ARGENTINA
A lack of trust in economic institutions - and the peso - has plagued Argentina for decades.
Efforts by right- and left-wing governments to rein in galloping inflation have seen price freezes on many products and capital controls.
Argentines often prefer to do business in dollars but limited access to the U.S. currency has created a huge gap between official and black market exchange rates.
The central bank recently raised interest rates to 40% from 38%. But the ""real"" rate, taking inflation into account, remains deeply negative.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' Argentina economist Alberto Ramos says headline inflation has averaged 47.2% since July 2018, attesting to ""significant macro policy dysfunction and the failure of the monetary authority in securing monetary control"". Graphic: Argentina's annualized benchmark rate, https://graphics.reuters.com/INFLATION-DEBT/ARGENTINA/dwpkrkllgvm/chart.png 
VENEZUELA
Hard-left governments have tried virtually everything over two decades, from fixing prices in 2007 to offering cut-price dollars - a policy quickly reversed due to frenzied demand. 
Venezuela defaulted in 2017 and money-printing to cover the budget deficit caused hyperinflation which reached 65,000% in 2018. The IMF sees inflation at 2,000% this year. 
President Nicholas Maduro eased some price controls in 2019 and lifted a ban on foreign currency transactions. Official and unofficial exchange rates were brought into line but the bolivar plunged 8,000% and Venezuela's debt-to-GDP ratio soared to 500%.
Last month Reuters reported the government was paying providers in dollars to help control inflation. 
But the Inter-American Development Bank and others have warned that such 'dollarisation' leaves those unable to obtain dollars with little access to basic goods, including food.
Graphic: Venezuela hyperinflation, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/movanwrqmpa/Pasted%20image%201642587067092.png BRAZIL
High inflation in the 1980s became hyperinflation in the 1990s, just as Brazil returned to democracy.
Under then-president Fernando Collor de Mello, prices, wages and 80% of private assets were frozen and financial transactions heavily taxed. 
Inflation peaked near 3,000% in 1990 and though it dropped to 433% in 1991 it was back to almost 2,000% by 1993.
The 'Real Plan' of 1994 brought things under control, establishing a new currency, hiking rates and slashing spending. Since 1997, inflation has been in single digits every year but one.
POLAND
Poland's ""anti-inflation shield 2.0"" includes temporary cuts in value-added tax (VAT) on fuel, food and fertilisers to offset annual price growth that could hit double digits for the first time since 2000.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reckons last week's measures and November's Shield 1.0 will reduce inflation by 3 percentage points by mid-year, while Poland's prime minister estimates Shields 1.0 and 2.0 will cost up to 30 billion zloty ($7.53 billion) -- nearly 1% of GDP.
But ""maintaining an optically lower CPI is a lost battle if price pressures prove persistent"", said JPMorgan's José Cerveira.

Prices in Democratic Republic of Congo rose by a cumulative 6.3 billion percent in first half of the 1990s as budget deficits were financed with rampant money-printing.
Monetary and fiscal policy restraint and a floating exchange rate system brought hyperinflation under control in 2001. 
Zimbabwe printed so much money -- including a Z$100 trillion banknote -- that its inflation rate hit 500 billion percent in 2008, rendering the currency almost worthless. 
Price ceilings imposed by the government left sellers unable to make a profit, leading to major shortages. 
By late 2008 Zimbabweans were using U.S. dollars for transactions and in 2009 a multicurrency system also including South Africa's rand was introduced. 
A new Zimbabwe dollar was launched in 2019 but Harare was forced to return to the multicurrency set-up when COVID-19 struck in 2020, pushing inflation to an IMF-reported 349%. 
FRANCE 
Hyperinflation during the French Revolution saw monthly price rises peak at 143%. The 1793 ""Law of the General Maximum"" responded with price limits and the death penalty for price 'gouging'.
Historians say it was mostly a failure, as traders forced to sell at below cost price turned to the black market or kept goods for themselves, resulting in major shortages.
MEXICO 
Falling oil prices and U.S. rate hikes halted Mexico's economic boom in 1980-81 and left the peso's dollar peg under strain, with capital flight and dwindling FX reserves forcing a 260% devaluation in 1982. 
Dollar bank deposits were converted into pesos and a moratorium declared on debt payments. By year-end, all trade became regulated, full capital controls were adopted and banks were nationalised.
Annual inflation neared 100% in 1982-83 as real per capita GDP slumped. It stayed high, topping 150% in 1987.
In 1994 the peso crisis -- which spread to other emerging economies -- forced a free float that saw the currency dive in value. Mexico's banking sector collapsed and the country needed a $50 billion international bailout to avoid default. 
A severe recession and more hyperinflation followed but by 2002 Mexico held investment-grade credit ratings. 
THE 1970s
Many countries turned to price controls after the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates collapsed in 1971 and the 1973 oil crisis triggered a worldwide surge in inflation.
After withdrawing from Bretton Woods, the United States imposed a 90-day freeze on prices and wages for the first time since World War Two. 
It was considered a political success but turned into economic failure, ushering in stagflation and currency instability. The dollar plunged by a third during the 1970s. 
France also brought in price controls, as did Britain where inflation neared 25%. The unpopular policy helped trigger labour strikes that marked the 1978-79 ""Winter of Discontent"".

Inflation receded in the early 1980s after interest rate hikes and an easing in oil prices. 
""History tells you it never works,"" AXA's Moec said of price and wage caps. ""But it doesn't stop people from trying."" Graphic: 1970s inflation spikes, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbvgnjxdjpq/Pasted%20image%201642614453202.png

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reiterated on Friday that it was up to the central bank to decide on an exit strategy from its massive stimulus programme, when questioned in parliament about the rising cost of living.
""It's left to the Bank of Japan to decide on specific monetary policy, including the thinking on an exit from monetary easing,"" Kishida told parliament.
""We hope the BOJ continues to make efforts to achieve its 2% inflation target,"" he said.
Kishida's comments came in response to a question from opposition lawmaker Hitoshi Asada, who called on the government to focus on structural reforms rather than rely too heavily on ultra-loose monetary policy to reflate growth.
""Ultra-loose policy can't continue indefinitely. Without reform, it will only cause price hikes. We're nearing the limit and a potential exit from easy policy,"" Asada said.
With consumer inflation well below its 2% target, the BOJ has stressed it is in no rush to exit from ultra-easy policy and described recent cost-push inflation as transitory.
But some opposition lawmakers have warned of the hit to households from rising food and fuel prices, a sign creeping inflation is emerging as a political topic ahead of upper house elections scheduled later this year.
Policymakers see higher wage growth as crucial to mitigate the pain on households and pull the economy out of the doldrums caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
There is uncertainty over whether companies will heed Kishida's requests for them to raise wages as their margins have been squeezed by a record spike in wholesale prices.

""While prices go up, the economy is slumping. There is growing fear Japan may experience stagflation,"" opposition lawmaker Yuichiro Tamaki said, during the questioning of Kishida in parliament a day earlier.
Japan's core consumer inflation hit 0.5% in December from a year earlier, well below the BOJ's 2% target. The gain was driven mostly by higher fuel costs and a steady wave of price hikes for foodstuffs such as cooking oil and mayonnaise.

The continent's second largest economy, South Africa has been hit hard by four waves of infection that killed close to 94,000 people and infected 3.5 million in Africa's worst caseload.
Successive lockdowns meant to protect people have led to the closure of thousands of businesses, swelling an army of unemployed as South Africa's jobless rate hit records in 2021.

""The World Bank budget support is coming at a critical time for us,"" Dondo Mogajane, the director-general of the National Treasury, said in a statement.
Funds from the development policy loan would help bridge a financing gap stemming from additional spending on the COVID-19 crisis, he added.

""The shortage of skilled workers has become so serious by now that it is dramatically slowing down our economy,"" Christian Duerr, parliamentary leader of the co-governing Free Democrats (FDP), told business magazine WirtschaftsWoche.
""We can only get the problem of an ageing workforce under control with a modern immigration policy... We have to reach the mark of 400,000 skilled workers from abroad as quickly as possible,"" Duerr added.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats, Duerr's libertarian FDP and the environmentalist Greens agreed in their coalition deal on measures like a points system for specialists from countries outside the European Union and lifting the national minimum wage to 12 euros ($13.60) per hour to make working in Germany more attractive.
The employer-friendly German Economic Institute estimates that the labour force will shrink by more than 300,000 people this year as there are more older workers retiring than younger ones entering the labour market.

This gap is expected to widen to more than 650,000 in 2029, leaving an accumulated shortage of people of working age in 2030 of roughly 5 million. The number of Germans in employment grew to nearly 45 million last year despite the coronavirus pandemic.
After decades of low birth rates and uneven migration, a shrinking labour force also poses a demographic time bomb for Germany's public pension system, in which fewer employees are burdened with the task of financing the pensions of a growing mass of retirees who are enjoying longer life expectancy.

The comments come as the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to start hiking interest rates as early as March, while its Chinese counterpart has stepped up monetary easing to prop up a slowing economy, raising concerns about possible capital outflows due to the policy divergence.
During the previous round of Fed tightening in 2018, China's currency depreciated sharply.
China is better able to cope with external changes, and ""this round of tightening by the Federal Reserve may have less spillover effect than the previous round,"" Wang Chunying, spokesperson of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), told a news conference on Friday.
On Wednesday, Chinese government bond yields fell across the curve after an official's comments heightened expectations that the country's benchmark lending rate will be cut as early as this week to shore up the cooling economy.
""In the face of this round of Fed tightening expectations, both cross-border loans or capital flows related to trade financing are relatively stable,"" Wang said.
Robust export growth, ample FX liquidity and the attractiveness of Chinese assets should all help China better tackle changes in the external environment, the regulator added.

The yuan was the best performing emerging market currency in 2021, appreciating 2.7% against a rising dollar. Its gains have extended into 2022, with a 0.2% advance year-to-date.

Still, core consumer prices in the capital city - widely considered a leading indicator of nationwide price trends - likely stayed in positive territory for a fifth consecutive month, even when stripping out the boost they got from 2020's low comparison base brought about by discount travel offers.
Tokyo's core consumer price index (CPI), which includes energy but excludes fresh food prices, was expected to rise 0.3% year-on-year in January, the poll of 16 economists showed. 
That would mark the slowest growth in the core CPI of Japan's capital since a 0.3% gain in November.
""While energy and food prices likely accelerated further as rising import costs are passed on, the gains will be offset by special downside factors,"" economists at SMBC Nikko Securities wrote in a note.
A government campaign to give consumers discounts on overnight stays, which was suspended in December 2020 after a jump in COVID-19 cases, likely led to less downward pressure on prices early last year, slowing year-on-year price growth.
The Bank of Japan (BOJ) this week upgraded its inflation forecasts for the fiscal year starting from April largely due to a surge in global commodity prices, which is prodding more firms to pass on higher costs to consumers.

Minutes of the BOJ's December policy meeting released on Friday showed that some of the central bank's board members said Japanese firms might be starting to be more aggressive in doing that.

The People’s Bank of China is expected to lower the amount of money banks have to keep in reserve in the first quarter of this year, bringing down the ratio for major banks to 11%. Major policy interest rates -- the one-year medium-term lending facility rate, one-year loan prime rate, and seven-day reverse repurchase rate, will likely be reduced by 10 basis points each in the second quarter, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. 
China’s economic growth slowed to 4% in the final three months of last year, and the government and central bank have made clear there will be more action in 2022 to support expansion and stabilize the economy. The central bank cut borrowing costs earlier this week, with banks following the move Thursday by reducing the interest rate on one-year and five-year loans. 
“The PBOC is going to ease monetary policy more proactively, that means it will not wait until the GDP data shows weakness of the economy.” said Iris Pang, chief China economist at ING Bank in Hong Kong. “Fiscal spending on infrastructure investments are likely to speed up, which will give GDP growth a boost.” 
Two front-page reports in important financial newspapers Friday said China was likely to roll out more policies to support economic growth.

(Reuters) -Creating an official digital version of the U.S. dollar could give Americans more, and speedier, payment options, but it would also present financial stability risks and privacy concerns, the U.S. Federal Reserve said in a long-awaited discussion paper released on Thursday. 
The paper made no policy recommendations and offered no clear signal on where the Fed stands on whether to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a digital form of cash in your pocket. The Fed said it would not proceed with creating one ""without clear support from the executive branch and from Congress, ideally in the form of a specific authorizing law.""
The paper tiptoes around a subject that has sparked debate inside the Fed's https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-digital-currency-analysis-idTRNIKBN2GQ13C top ranks, even as other central banks across the globe are exploring the adoption of digital currencies. 
Nevertheless, it sets the stage for the central bank to collect public feedback on the potential costs and benefits of a CBDC, which could ultimately advance legislation long-term.
""While a CBDC could provide a safe, digital payment option for households and businesses as the payments system continues to evolve, and may result in faster payment options between countries, there may also be downsides,"" Fed officials wrote.
Challenges include maintaining financial stability and making sure the digital dollar would ""complement existing means of payment,"" the Fed said. The central bank also needs to tackle major policy questions such as ensuring a CBDC does not violate Americans' privacy and that the government maintains its ""ability to combat illicit finance.""
Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are typically run by private actors, a CBDC would be issued and backed by the central bank. It would differ from electronic transactions that happen through large commercial banks in that it could give consumers a direct claim to the central bank, similar to physical cash.
About 90 countries https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker are exploring or launching their own CBDCs, according to the Atlantic Council. A widely used digital euro, yuan or dollar may still be years away, but the projects could dramatically disrupt the global financial system. 
Despite steering clear of policy recommendations, the Fed did shed some light on how a digital dollar might function. 
Critically, it said a digital dollar would ""best suit"" U.S. needs if it were intermediated through the current financial system. That means individuals would not have CBDC accounts directly with the Fed, an approach backed by some Democrats who say a digital currency could help the unbanked. Banks worried that such an approach would eat into their deposit base.
Still, Fed officials said they are not ruling anything out. 
The central bank will collect comments on the issue via an online form https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/forms/CBDC for 120 days. 
Thursday's paper is separate from research the Boston Fed has been working on with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to explore the technological aspects of a CBDC. That research, including coding that could be used for a potential U.S. CBDC, will be released as early as next month. 
BOARD DIVISIONS
The paper partially echoed the views of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has said such a project must have broad support and ideally be mandated by Congress.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard, meanwhile, has said it is not ""sustainable"" for the United States to hold off on pursuing a digital dollar at time when competing economies are moving ahead. 
Others, including Fed Governor Christopher Waller, are more skeptical and point out that many dollar transactions are already digital.

Jonathan McCollum, chair of federal government relations for Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, said some in Washington worry the United States could weaken its position as the holder of the global reserve currency if it does not move ahead.
""The U.S. has the opportunity to set the rules for how digital currencies function in the international financial system, but it is critical we start now,"" he said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The premier of Canada's Alberta province on Thursday called on the federal government to pause a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers that companies say will disrupt the supply chain and fuel inflation.
The mandate, imposed by Ottawa to help curb the spread of the coronavirus, has cost Canadian trucking companies about 10% of their international drivers, six top executives said this week. They said they are hiking wages to lure new operators during the worst labor shortage they have experienced.
Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, at a news conference in Calgary, urged the government to extend an exemption that had been in place for truckers since the start of the pandemic.
Kenney made his request on the same day the United States confirmed its own vaccine border mandate for truckers would start on Saturday. Canada's has been in place since Jan. 15.
""Common sense tells us that we are at the peak of supply chain constraints across North America, around the world, huge inflation,"" Kenney said.
This is not the moment ""to lose potentially thousands of truckers on our roads, bringing groceries up from the US and who knows maybe (COVID) rapid test kits as well,"" he said.
As many as 32,000, or 20%, of the 160,000 Canadian and American cross-border truck drivers may be taken off the roads by the mandate, the Canadian Trucking Alliance (CTA) estimates. The industry was short some 18,000 drivers even before the mandate, CTA said. 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has resisted industry pressure to delay the mandate since it was first announced in November. On Wednesday Trudeau defended the mandate, saying Canada was ""aligned"" with the United States, its largest trading partner.
On Thursday, Canada's transport ministry said the measure was not negatively affecting the supply of goods, and cross-border truck traffic had not varied significantly.
Within the next two weeks, consumers will see ""there's not as many choices on the shelves,"" said Dan Einwechter, chairman and chief executive officer of Challenger Motor Freight Inc in Cambridge, Ontario.
""Eventually the prices will be passed on from the sellers of those products, because we're passing on our increases to them,"" he said.
Canada's inflation rate hit a 30-year high of 4.8% in December and economists said the vaccine mandate may contribute to keeping prices higher for longer. In the United States, inflation surged 7% on a year-on-year basis in December, the largest rise in nearly four decades.
More than two-thirds of the C$650 billion ($521 billion) in goods traded annually between Canada and the United States travels on roads.
Rob Penner, president and CEO of Winnipeg, Manitoba-based Bison Transport, said from Jan. 1 it raised the base rate for cross-border drivers by almost 20% but failed to gain any.
""There's more freight than there is people right now.""
Fresh foods are particularly sensitive to freight problems because they expire rapidly, though all imports from the United States could be affected, trucking managers said.

Canadian firms see labor shortages intensifying and wage pressures increasing, according to a Bank of Canada survey released on Monday. Investors increasingly expect the central bank to raise interest rates next week for the first time since 2018.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea unveiled a 14 trillion won ($11.75 billion) supplementary budget on Friday to support the self-employed and small businesses that have taken a heavy hit from extended COVID-19 curbs.
Some 11.5 trillion won will be used to help small business owners and compensate their losses caused by the extension of virus-related measures, the finance ministry said.
Another 1.5 trillion won is earmarked to secure COVID-19 treatment pills for 400,000 people and 25,000 hospital beds.
The other 1 trillion won will be used as contingency reserves should the Omicron coronavirus variant spread further and require more support.
To finance the extra stimulus, the government will issue 11.3 trillion won worth of treasury bonds and utilise 2.7 trillion won from public fund reserves.
The extra budget, which will be submitted to parliament on Monday, comes at a time when the ruling Democratic Party is struggling to recover public support just weeks ahead of the country's 2022 presidential election.
With the latest supplementary budget, the total government spending would increase to a record 621.7 trillion won this year, adding to the already approved 607.7 trillion won budget.
That would be an 11.4% increase from the 2021 original budget, while it is also expected to bring the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product to a record 50.1%.

South Korea extended its tougher social distancing rules for three more weeks, including 9 p.m. curfew for restaurants, cafes and bars and limited size of private gatherings, amid concerns over a looming wave of the highly contagious Omicron variant especially ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden will urge U.S. mayors on Friday to use more of their state and local COVID-19 aid funds to expand their workforces, a White House official said, an effort partly aimed at easing economic bottlenecks and inflation.
In an address to the U.S. Conference of Mayors' winter meeting on Friday in Washington, Biden will call to spend more on worker training programs, apprenticeships, education and child care to help develop a stronger workforce and reduce income inequality, the official told Reuters.
Cities have wide-ranging ability to use money from the $350 billion State and Local Fiscal Relief Fund, which was approved in last year's American Rescue Plan COVID-19 aid legislation.
The Treasury Department earlier this month issued final rules for the program that allow greater flexibility for use of the funds on programs such as early childhood education, child care and affordable housing.
The funding also allows city, county, state and tribal governments to replace revenues lost to the pandemic, invest in broadband and water infrastructure, and other uses.
The push for cities to invest more in workforces comes as the Biden administration faces pressure to control inflation. Consumer prices soared by 7% last year, the biggest annual increase in nearly 40 years https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-consumer-prices-increase-strongly-december-2022-01-12 as demand for goods and housing outstripped supply, a phenomenon which economists attribute partly to a lack of qualified workers.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - South Korea's economy likely accelerated in the last quarter, buoyed by strong exports and investments, but an economic slowdown in China and surging COVID-19 cases pose a significant risk, a Reuters poll found.
Asia's fourth-largest economy is expected to have expanded a seasonally-adjusted 0.9% in the fourth quarter, according to the median forecast of 10 economists, up from a 0.3% rise in the preceding quarter.
However, the survey showed growth in annual terms likely slowed to a median 3.7%, based on a higher sample of 16 economists, from 4.0% in the third quarter, partly due to the above-trend expansion registered in the comparable period in 2020.
The data will be released on Jan. 25.
""It is highly probable private consumption has weakened somewhat due to the re-spread of the COVID-19 in Korea, but solid exports and investments supported growth in Q4,"" said Chun Kyu-yeon, an economist at Hana Financial Investment in Seoul.
South Korea's recovery from a pandemic-induced economic slump has been largely driven by robust exports, which expanded at their fastest pace in 11 years in 2021. By destination, exports to China, the United States and the European Union rose 22.9%, 29.4% and 33.9%, respectively.
But an upsurge in COVID-19 cases, the waning effects of pandemic-related stimulus and an economic slowdown in China, the country's largest trade and investment partner, will weigh heavily on the economy this year and next.

""Exports have continued to be a pillar of strength, but are likely to provide a smaller boost to growth going forward. The ongoing slowdown in China poses another headwind,"" wrote Krystal Tan, an economist at ANZ in Singapore.
A separate Reuters poll published a week ago showed growth averaging 3.9% in 2021. It was then expected to ease to 2.9% in 2022 and 2.5% in 2023.

""We have been hit by a pandemic that has created economic challenges that none of us anticipated, and it is our hope and intention to bring inflation down to levels that are consistent with the Fed's interpretation of price stability,"" Yellen said.
The Treasury chief and former Fed chair said that U.S. household finances were in good shape, with some families better than before the pandemic, and built-up savings should help sustain the economy for years to come, even with less fiscal support going forward.

Meanwhile, she said it was critical for more people to come back into the labor force, which would help ease supply pressures. This will require the pandemic to be brought under control. If that happens, she said she expects inflation pressures to ease throughout 2022.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top executives at the biggest U.S. banks have been optimistic about the nation's economic outlook this earnings season, pointing to healthy consumers who have cash in the bank, are again eager to spend and also to borrow. 
Consumer spending, a key driver of the U.S. economy, fell sharply during the start of the pandemic as Americans, fearing the worst, hoarded cash and saved money by staying at home. 
At the same time, government aid padded many Americans' bank accounts, and many used the cash to pay off debts.
Now, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the No. 1 and 2 largest U.S. banks which together reach around 140 million households, say consumers are in good shape, even if the Omicron variant dampened spenders' enthusiasm some late last year. 
Some analysts also cautioned inflation had the potential to further dampen spending if it continues.
Bank of America, which provided the most comprehensive consumer spending data when it reported earnings on Wednesday, said its 67 million customers spent a record $3.8 trillion in 2021, a 24% increase from 2019, the pre-pandemic benchmark. 
That figure includes all the ways in which the bank's customers spend money - credit and debit cards, ACH, wire transfers, cash, checks and money sent via platforms like Zelle.
Fourth quarter payments were up 28% on the same period in 2019, also a record jump. Spending has continued into January, with payments up 11% as of Jan. 17 compared to the beginning of January 2021, Bank of America said. 
Nearly all customers' account balances grew from June to December, it added.
""We believe there's lots of potential spending capacity left as average deposit balances continue to move up to the end of the year despite the heavy spending you see,"" Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said on Wednesday.
JPMorgan said that combined debit and credit card spending was 27% higher in the fourth quarter last year compared to the fourth quarter 2019, with travel and entertainment spending up 13% over the same period. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said credit card spending and median account balances for the fourth quarter were both up 27% compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Consumer loan balances across the industry also fully recovered from their COVID fall in the fourth quarter, led by auto loans and loans for tuition, medical care, vacations and other purposes, according to Federal Reserve data. 
(Graphic: Consumers are borrowing again, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/klvykqrbjvg/chart.png) 
""Seeing the results ... make us incrementally more optimistic about the loan growth trends,"" said  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Keith Horowitz.
CREDIT CARDS, INFLATION
Still, there were some signs consumers have not fully returned to their pre-COVID spending patterns.
Spending on credit cards, for example, which rebounded strongly in October and November, plateaued from early December and remain 7% below their pre-pandemic peak, Fed data shows.
(Graphic: A consumer snapshot, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/gkplgbejovb/chart.png) 
JPMorgan, for example, reported credit card balances for the fourth quarter were up 5% compared to the same period in 2020, but they were still 8% lower than pre-pandemic levels because customers continue to pay down debt.
The bank also noted that travel and entertainment credit and debit card spending ""saw some softening ... contemporaneously with the Omicron wave.""
That looked to be in line with some softening in retail sales during December as consumers, fearing supply chain delays, completed their shopping early, and as Omicron stopped others from getting into stores.

Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf also noted that some of the uptick in consumer spending was driven by inflationary pressure. That is a possible overhang for the consumer spending outlook, said Viola Risk Advisors bank analyst David Hendler. 
""Inflation could hurt people's ability to spend money because it's too expensive,"" he said.
