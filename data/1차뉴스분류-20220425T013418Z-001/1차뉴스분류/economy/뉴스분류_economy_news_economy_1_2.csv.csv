ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The International Money Fund (IMF) has asked Pakistan to explain how it would fund a $1.5 billion subsidy package announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin said on Sunday. 
""There are no issues. We have given them details as to where the funds would come from,"" Tarin said, adding the IMF wanted details of the resources to fund the subsidy in fuel and electricity, which Pakistan has frozen for the next four months until the new budget. 
The IMF has begun the seventh review of the $6 billion rescue package agreed with Pakistan in 2019, and Tarin said he will have a final meeting with the lender on Tuesday.
The IMF asked it will need to see the agreements of the dividends of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) as well as details of the spare funds the central government will get from provinces. 
""We have done our homework,"" Tarin said.
Some of the subsidy money would also come from above-target revenues Pakistan was getting this fiscal year, he had said previously. 
Earlier this month, Tarin said revenue would hit 6.1 trillion Pakistani rupees ($34.2 billion), compared to a target of 5.8 trillion rupees.
Embattled Khan, facing a no-confidence move to oust him from office by opposition parties, had announced a cut in petrol and electricity prices despite a steep rise in the global

oil market.
The south Asian country had to undertake fiscal tightening measures to pass its last IMF review, which was delayed by months as the government struggled to complete prior action required by the lender to release $1 billion in February.

Inflation hit 54% in February and economists expect it to continue rising towards 70% in coming months, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent commodity prices soaring and knocked the lira.
Speaking at a business conference in the southern resort of Antalya, Nebati said a government-backed scheme that protects lira deposits against depreciation had helped eliminate concerns over what he called ""attacks"" on the lira's exchange rate.
""What we have seen in recent months is that the exchange rate is stable and moves forward within acceptable limits,"" he said.
The lira is down 11% against the dollar this year, mainly due to the economic fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The currency had declined 44% last year, mostly after a series of rate cuts, long sought by President Tayyip Erdogan, which sparked a currency crisis and sent inflation to a 20-year high.
The lira protection scheme as well as costly forex market interventions by the central bank helped stem the currency crisis in December.
The central bank cut its policy rate by 500 basis points to 14% between September and December but has kept it unchanged at the last three meetings.
Erdogan's new economic plan prioritises a current account surplus, exports, credit and growth, while keeping interest rates low.
However Russia's actions in Ukraine, which it terms a ""special operation"", risk widening Turkey's current account deficit, due to rises in commodity prices and a potential decline in tourism revenue.

The farmers, who staged weeks of protests over high energy prices earlier this year, say their costs are so high they will be forced to produce less and also raise prices for consumers.
The government has so far spent about 3.7 billion euros ($4.08 billion) since September to alleviate pain from soaring energy and fuel costs for farmers, households and businesses.
It cut a sales tax on fertilisers by 46% to 13% and on Thursday announced it would be lowered further, to 6%, and also announced a tax rebate on fuel for agricultural vehicles.
Farmers say the measures do not go far enough and everything has become too expensive, from fuel to animal feed.
""Our survival is really at stake this year,"" said one protester, Giorgos Laoutis. ""With the cost of production, electricity, agricultural supplies, fuel.""
Farmers from across Greece joined the rally. Some protesters hung black flags on shepherd's crooks or sticks.
""The situation has become unbearable,"" said another farmer, Diamanto Kritikou.
""We can't work our fields, we can't cultivate, we can't put gas in our vehicles, and (we can't buy) seeds, fertilizers... there will be a problem with food supply in the country,"" she said.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has driven retail gasoline and diesel prices to record highs.
Russia is also a big producer of potash-, phosphate- and nitrogen-containing fertilisers, and a leader in fertilizer exports, accounting for 13% of world output.
This month, its trade and industry ministry told the country's fertilizer producers to temporarily halt exports.

As a result of the conflict in Ukraine, the United Nations food agency said last week that international food and feed prices could rise by up to 20%.

The ECB left rates steady this month and will be in no hurry to raise them, President Christine Lagarde said on Thursday. 
Holzmann, governor of Austria's central bank, supports the majority decision of the ECB, the Krone paper cited him as saying, but he added: ""The system of bond purchases is difficult for the population to understand. An interest rate increase would have been a signal that everyone would have understood.""
Holzmann had also challenged the bank's long-held view about the sequencing of its policy moves last month.
He said in the Krone interview published on Saturday that the euro zone economy would have been on a ""wonderful growth path"" if not for the war in Ukraine.
Asked if he was worried about the high level of debt in some countries, he said: ""This topic is taken very seriously by the Euro Group but, as is known, there are different ways of looking at it.""
Simply cutting government spending would not be enough without structural changes as well, he said, noting the challenge of promoting growth that can create sufficient financial leeway while still combating the climate crisis.

""This transition, even more so in the middle of a crisis, costs money. A lot of money. It makes sense to develop new renewable energy sources, but it does not come for free,"" he said. 
The paper paraphrased Holzmann as saying he expected inflation to drop to the targeted 2% in the medium term or else appropriate interest rate steps would have to be taken.

ROME (Reuters) -Italy on Friday approved measures to help consumers and firms cope with surging energy costs exacerbated by the Ukraine crisis, in a wide-ranging decree that also strengthens Rome's powers to shield key assets from foreign bids.
The package, worth 4.4-billion euro ($4.86 billion), is the latest step to curb energy and fuel prices and comes on top of some 16 billion euros budgeted since last July to try and soften electricity and gas bills for firms and households.
""We have taken important and motivated measures to respond to the consequences on our country of the war in Ukraine,"" Prime Minister Mario Draghi told a news conference after a cabinet meeting on the issue.
The measures are funded by taxing extra profits of energy firms that benefited from surging energy prices and will not worsen the public deficit. The levy takes the form of a 10% one shot contribution on profit margins that rose significantly in the last six months on an annual basis.
""This redistributive intervention ... allows us to avoid extra borrowing and keep public accounts under control,"" Draghi said.
Rome last autumn targeted the fiscal gap to fall to 5.6% of GDP this year from 7.2% in 2021.
In beefing up Rome's ""golden power"", the decree introduces a specific set of measures to oversee and block takeovers and commercial agreements on 5G networks and cloud technology.
Firms operating in these two sectors will be required to supply on an annual basis considerably more detailed notification to the authorities for proposed mergers and supply deals.
A new 10-member body at the prime minister's office will be responsible for vetting any potentially sensitive deals, said a draft decree seen by Reuters.
Since the golden power was introduced in 2012, government authorities have blocked foreign forays into Italy six times. Five of those headed off Chinese bids, and four have come since Draghi took office 13 months ago. 
The government also told public authorities to replace anti-virus software linked to Russia, and says it is considering measures to block exports of raw materials to shield domestic industries from shortages.
In the energy part of the decree, Rome set out plans to cut excise duties on petrol and diesel. This would cut prices paid at the pump by 25 cents per litre until the end of April.
Italy's economy, which grew 6.6% last year following a record contraction of 9.0% in 2020 caused by extended coronavirus lockdowns, is now facing an increasingly weak growth outlook.

The Treasury is preparing to downgrade Italy's growth target significantly below 4% this year from a previous 4.7% goal made last autumn, a government source said.

(Reuters) -Two of the Federal Reserve's most hawkish policymakers on Friday said the central bank needs to take more aggressive steps to combat inflation, and two others said they would be open to it – one of whom just six months ago envisioned a 2022 with no rate increases at all
It still could be that the Fed only needs to raise rates ""modestly"" above neutral, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said in an essay published on the regional Fed bank's website in which the former dove said he wants to raise rates to 1.75% to 2% this year.
But, he said, the economy may have shifted to a ""high-pressure, high-inflation equilibrium,"" requiring the Fed ""to act more aggressively and bring policy to a contractionary stance in order to move the economy back to an equilibrium consistent with our 2% inflation target."" 
Which way the Fed needs to go will depend on what economic data shows over the course of the year, he said.
Fed officials hiked interest rates this week for the first time in three years and signaled that more rate increases are coming as the central bank removes the support provided during the coronavirus pandemic and works to tame inflation at 40-year highs.
Most Fed policymakers see rates rising next year to a level that would restrict growth, forecasts show, but exactly how fast or high rates should rise is a matter of debate.
Earlier in the day, Fed Governor Chris Waller said economic risks around Russia's war in Ukraine led him to vote in favor of a quarter percentage point rate increase at this week's meeting rather than dissent in favor of the larger half point increase he had been advocating. 
""The data is screaming at us to go 50 (basis points) but the geopolitical events were telling you to go forward with caution,"" Waller said on CNBC. But in the months ahead Waller said he would favor a series of half percentage point increases to ""front load"" tighter policy and have a quicker impact on inflation.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who dissented on this week's action in favor of a half point increase, said on Friday that officials should raise the Fed's overnight lending rate to more than 3% this year to catch up with elevated inflation. After Wednesday's move, the Fed's target rate is now 0.25-0.50%. 
He said he not only favored a half point increase this week, but rate increases at a pace that would require half point increases at five of the Fed's six remaining meetings this year.
""The U.S. economy has proven to be especially resilient,"" against the pandemic and geopolitical risks, Bullard said in a statement explaining his dissent. 
With inflation by the Fed's preferred gauge running above 6%, triple its 2% target, Bullard said more Fed action was needed ""to prudently manage the U.S. macroeconomic situation.""
INFLATION FIGHTING STANCE
Though most Fed officials see six more quarter-point rate increases this year, seven of the Fed's current 16 policymakers, like Bullard, think rates should go even higher by year's end. 
To counteract inflation faster Waller said the central bank should pack more of that into the next few months. ""I really favor front-loading our rate hikes...Just do it rather than just promise it,"" he said.
While he did not specify where he would like to see the target federal funds rate end the year, Waller said he would prefer to get above the 2% to 2.25% level he sees as acting neutrally for the economy. 
Half of Fed policymakers see rates rising to at least 2.8% by the end of next year, high enough to brake economic growth in the view of most of them, projections released this week show.
With rates still far from a level that would constrain growth, that rate path ""shouldn't drive economic decline,"" said a fourth Fed policymaker, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin. 
Barkin said he is ""very open"" to a half-point rate hike if inflation accelerates or expectations move up. But, he said, setting the pace is a ""balancing act"" between raising rates enough to contain inflation but not so much it hurts jobs. 
Kashkari did not address the possibility of a half-point hike, but the shift in his policy outlook encapsulates the Fed's pivot from policy designed to cushion the pandemic crisis to its current inflation-fighting stance.
In September he was the Fed's most dovish member, arguing that as the pandemic receded inflation would cool this year without any interest rate hikes as supply chains got fixed, workers returned to the labor force, and super-charged demand for goods ebbed. 
Instead, inflation has accelerated to well above the Fed's target. Supply chains have been slow to recover and a resurging pandemic in China risks continued bottlenecks; wage growth has picked up instead of slowing and, in what Kashkari said was his biggest surprise, spending on goods remains elevated. 
Speaking at a North Dakota Petroleum Council event, Kashkari underscored his hawkish turn, saying he favors starting to reduce the Fed's balance sheet next month at a pace twice as fast as the Fed used the last time it shrank its portfolio. 

He said he still thinks it's possible inflation is mostly driven by a supply-demand imbalance that will right itself, allowing the Fed to raise rates only slightly above the 2% he sees as a neutral level. 
But Russia's invasion of Ukraine makes inflation pressures worse, and continued strong household spending suggests that ""robust economic activity and the associated high inflation may be sustained and in fact might not be transitory,"" he said.

""The Fund would give liquidity for continued support to authorities and in the longer term serve as backbone for reconstruction of a free and democratic Ukraine once hostilities stop"", Michel said in a tweet.
Partners could contribute to the fund through an international donors conference, Michel said.

An EU official said the topic would be discussed at a summit of EU leaders next week, adding that the presidents had discussed the need for Ukraine to retain access to international financial support to fund imports of basic necessities and military equipment.
The Russian invasion has cut Ukraine off from international financial markets, and the fund could provide the liquidity needed to keep government services running, to continue defence efforts and to provide basic services, the official said.

In an analysis blog https://www.cgdev.org/blog/price-spike-caused-ukraine-war-will-push-over-40-million-poverty-how-should-we-respond, the Washington-based think tank said food commodity prices since the start of the conflict have risen above levels experienced in price spikes in 2007 and 2010. It cited World Bank Research showing that the 2007 spike may have pushed as many as 155 million people into extreme poverty, and separate research showing the 2010 episode pushed 44 million into extreme poverty.
""Price increases seen to date are already of a similar magnitude to the 2010 increases, and our analysis suggests at least 40 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty by the 2022 price spike,"" CGDEV researchers wrote.
The World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on less than $1.90 a day. 
The researchers said the most immediate concern was for direct wheat customers of Ukraine and Russia, which together account for more than a quarter of world wheat exports. These include Egypt, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Turkey, but prices will rise worldwide as importers compete for alternative supplies.

Households in low-income countries allocate nearly half of their budgets to food, and higher prices will force ""hard choices between food and other necessities."" 
The CGDEV blog urged development agencies and international finance institutions to move quickly to respond to a clear increase in humanitarian needs around the world, while wealthy governments should provide supplemental funding to the institutions well in advance of the coming food crisis.

BALTIMORE (Reuters) - The rate increases projected by Federal Reserve officials this week represented a ""balancing act"" between the need to begin normalizing monetary policy in the face of high inflation, while guarding against a fast tightening of credit that could damage the economy, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Friday. 
""The rate path we announced this week shouldn't drive economic decline. We are still far from the level of rates that constrains the economy,"" Barkin told a Maryland Bankers Association economic forum in what were his first public remarks since the U.S. central bank on Wednesday approved a quarter-percentage-point increase in the target federal funds rate.
""Think of it as an indication that the extraordinary support of the pandemic era is unwinding,"" Barkin said. The federal funds rate has been near zero since March of 2020.
New projections showed Fed officials at the median envision raising that rate to 1.9% by the end of this year, still below the roughly 2.4% level that policymakers feel would have a neutral impact on economic decisions.
Amid calls by some officials for faster hikes in borrowing costs, Barkin said the Fed could move more quickly, including in half-percentage-point increments, ""if we start to believe that is necessary to prevent inflation expectations from unanchoring.""
But he added that such a shift didn't seem to be happening so far, and in the meantime it remained uncertain how quickly some of the lingering problems from the pandemic - from supply chain troubles to the skewed demand for goods - will be resolved. Until that becomes clearer, Barkin said, it will be hard to know just how fast the Fed should raise interest rates. 

""Setting the right pace for rate increases is a balancing act - we normalize rates to contain inflation, but if we over-correct, we can negatively impact employment, which is the other part of our dual mandate. And we have some time to get to a neutral position,"" Barkin said.
""Inflation and employment are still being heavily influenced by pandemic-era supply and participation pressures - and more recently, the war on Ukraine - and it will take a while for us to understand and meet the dynamics of the post-pandemic economy,"" he added.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's $45 billion debt deal with the International Monetary Fund, approved by the country's Congress on Thursday, now faces its final hurdle: the lender's own board, which needs to sign off on the mega refinancing agreement.
The government struck a staff-level deal with the IMF in early March to replace a failed $57 billion program from 2018 that had been unable to keep the grain-producing country from slipping into economic crisis and a private sector default.
The IMF board is set to meet in the coming days to green light the deal, which would unlock an initial nearly $10 billion disbursement, with the clock ticking ahead of a $2.8 billion repayment due early next week that the country will struggle to make.
""Now, the next step is the approval of the IMF board. We look forward to multilateral support. It will bring more stability to Argentina, Latin America and the world,"" Economy Minister Martin Guzman said after the Senate vote.
He said that without an agreement it would have been ""impossible"" for the country to pay back its obligations to the IMF, adding the deal was necessary - despite push-back from some lawmakers and protesters - to stabilize the economy.
""In this context of geopolitical conflict that raises international inflation in food and energy, it is of particular importance to provide certainty rather than more uncertainty.""
The new program would see funds disbursed over 30 months and a new repayment schedule between 2026-2034. It includes an economic program to reduce the fiscal deficit, bolster reserves, cut huge energy subsidies and push up real interest rates.
Not everyone in Argentina has rallied behind the deal, with concerns that economic strings attached will put pressure on people already grappling with both high levels of poverty and inflation, which is running at over 50% annually.
Gisella Lazcano, an activist protesting the deal, called it a ""scam"" and said the country should not pay the money back, echoing calls in recent street protests.
""The payment of that illegitimate debt is a burden on the shoulders of the working class,"" she said.
The congressional approvals have helped buoy Argentine bonds, which have been languishing in distressed territory, despite concerns about whether the country, a serial defaulter, will be able to meet the economic targets.
""There is a certain amount of fear linked to the economic situation and the likelihood of concrete measures that affect people's wallets,"" said Esteban Neme from research firm Horus.
""People are afraid of the adjustments that may be caused by the agreement, mainly the impact on the prices of products and services.""

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve should raise its policy rate to the range of 1.75% to 2% this year, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said on Friday, and at least modestly higher after that to put the brakes on the economy and bring down inflation. 
If data this year show supply and demand normalizing and inflation coming down on its own, that may be enough, Kashkari said in an essay published on the Minneapolis Fed's website. 
But if it turns out the economy has shifted to a ""high-pressure, high inflation equilibrium,"" then the U.S. central bank ""will need to act more aggressively and bring policy to a contractionary stance in order to move the economy back to an equilibrium consistent with our 2 percent inflation target.""
The Fed raised rates earlier this week as it pivoted from policy designed to cushion the economy from the coronavirus pandemic to an inflation-fighting stance, and signaled a rate-hike path that would bring its benchmark overnight interest rate to 1.9% this year and higher next year.

Kashkari's remarks on Friday showed he not only endorses that path - a sharp shift from his position just six months ago as the Fed's most dovish member - but that he's open to even more rate hikes should inflation prove intransigent. 
""Over the course of this year, while we are moving to what I expect will be a neutral policy stance, we will get information to help us determine how much further we may need to go,"" Kashkari said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Myanmar's junta has given the final approval for the sale of Norwegian telecommunications company Telenor's operations in the country to a local company and a Lebanese investment firm, the firm said on Friday.
Telenor Chief Executive Sigve Brekke said in a statement the firm had to leave the country to ""adhere to our own values on human rights and responsible business, and because local laws in Myanmar conflict with European laws"".
""The security situation is extreme and deteriorating, and we must ensure that our exit does not increase the safety risk for employees,"" he said.
Reuters reported the approval earlier on Friday, citing three sources with knowledge of the deal.
According to a letter of approval sent on March 15, seen by two of the people, the transfer of Telenor's Myanmar unit to its new owners must happen within five days.
Myanmar authorities did not immediately respond to telephone and email requests for comment. 
""The last year has been an extremely difficult situation, I think it is the most challenging Telenor has ever had to handle, even more for the people living on the ground,"" Brekke told Reuters.
One of Telenor's investors, pension fund KLP, which owns 1.43%, welcomed the approval of the sale.
""It is satisfying to know that Telenor has finally received an approval on the sale given the demanding circumstances,"" Kiran Aziz, KLP's head of responsible investments, told Reuters.
""Until the approval it had been a balancing act for the company in order to stay neutral in the ongoing conflict, (while) at the same time (managing) the employee safety risk and respecting human rights.""
A Norwegian opposition lawmaker said the sale was a ""terrible decision"".
""Those who fight for democracy will be put into more danger,"" Ola Elvestuen, who had questioned the handling of the sale process by the government in parliament, told Reuters. The Norwegian state is the majority owner in Telenor.
Some civil rights groups have said the deal could put the data of 18 million people within the junta's reach, and called on Telenor to delete personal information of customers. 
Telenor has said doing so would violate local laws and expose employees to danger.
The Norwegian industry ministry said Telenor had faced ""several dilemmas"" in Myanmar. 
LONG PROCESS
Telenor, one of the biggest foreign investors in Myanmar, sought to leave the country after last year's military coup. The company told Reuters in September it was selling its operations to avoid European Union sanctions after ""continued pressure"" from the junta to activate intercept surveillance technology.
Its departure from a country that accounted for 7% of its earnings in 2020 has been mired in difficulty.
Military leaders late last year rejected its plan to sell its local operations to Lebanon's M1 Group for $105 million, Reuters reported. Instead, they wanted M1 to partner with a local firm, Shwe Byain Phyu.
Reuters reported in February that Shwe Byain Phyu, whose chairman has a history of business ties to the military, will own 80% of the unit while M1 will own the rest.
Telenor only learnt ""a couple of months ago"" who would become the new majority owner, Brekke told Reuters. ""We have not been involved in discussions as such."" 
Shwe Byain Phyu has denied ties to the Myanmar army and previously said it was ""selected by Telenor ... because it was the most unrelated to the military"".
In its statement, Telenor said the agreement to sell the Myanmar unit was with M1 alone, but added that the ""regulatory approval requires that M1 ensures a local majority owner after the closing of the transaction between Telenor and M1"".
The firm said on Friday that M1 had informed Telenor that its local partner, Shwe Byain Phyu, would be the 80% owner after the transaction. 
""Sanctions screening from external consultants has assured Telenor that Shwe Byain Phyu and its owners are not subject to any current international sanctions,"" Telenor said.
""The reason for sanctions is that there are close ties between individuals and companies and the military,"" Brekke said. ""Knowing that the Shwe Group is not on the sanctions list has been important for us.""
M1 said in a statement that it had partnered with Shwe Byain Phyu Group to form a joint venture to take over ownership of Telenor Myanmar called Investcom PTE.
The company said it would work with stakeholders to close the transaction as ""soon as possible"". 
CEO Azmi T. Mikati said in the statement that, ""M1 Group is committed to support Investcom PTE in providing essential communications services and investing to develop the telecommunications infrastructure."" 
Shwe Byain Phyu did not respond immediately to requests for comment by Reuters. 
Reuters reported earlier in March that Telenor is planning to transfer $100 million held by its Myanmar operations to the unit’s new buyers - an amount roughly equivalent to how much it will be paid over five years, three people with knowledge of the deal's terms said.
Senior foreign Telenor executives were barred from leaving Myanmar while negotiations around the sale were ongoing, a junta minister told Reuters last year.

Two of the sources said a senior Telenor Norwegian foreign executive had recently received permission from authorities to fly out. 
A company spokesperson said in a statement that ""one Norwegian employee has been allowed to leave after 10 months of being banned from leaving Myanmar"".

15,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 11:32AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russia's central bank kept its key interest rate at 20% on Friday following last month's massive emergency hike and said it would start buying OFZ government bonds, warning of an imminent spike in inflation and a looming economic contraction.
Bank of Russia policymakers held a scheduled rate meeting after more than doubling the key rate to 20% from 9.5% in a one-off action on Feb. 28 to support financial stability and shore up the rouble. The currency had crashed to record lows as Western countries imposed sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine.
Governor Elvira Nabiullina, who was nominated for a third term by President Vladimir Putin earlier on Friday, said the central bank will start buying OFZs on the market when the Moscow Exchange resumes trading of the bonds on Monday. 
""After the situation on financial markets stabilises, we're planning to fully sell this portfolio of bonds to neutralise the impact of this transaction on monetary policy,"" Nabiullina said.
Trading of stocks and bonds on the Moscow Exchange has been suspended since Feb. 28. Currency trading has continued, with the rouble hitting an all-time low of 120 against the dollar on March 6, which has already fanned consumer inflation.
Presenting the rate decision, which was in line with a consensus forecast of analysts polled by Reuters, Nabiullina said the central bank would give the economy time to adapt to new and difficult conditions.
She said the banking system was working ""without any flaws"" after the central bank pumped in liquidity. 
NEW CHALLENGES
In a statement, the central bank said Russia was entering ""a temporary but inevitable period of increased inflation"" and that flash indicators suggested a deterioration in conditions that will cause the economy to shrink in the coming quarters.
The central bank did not give inflation or economic forecasts for this year, saying it aimed to return inflation to its 4% target in 2024.
Economists polled by the central bank last week expected the economy to contract by 8% and inflation to reach 20% in 2022.
Annual inflation in Russia accelerated to 12.54% as of March 11, its highest since late 2015, with the weakening rouble sending prices soaring amid unprecedented Western sanctions. Nabiullina said that spike was driven largely by panic-buying of consumer goods, which had now slowed.
High inflation dents living standards and has been one of the key concerns among households for years. Higher rates help tame inflation by pushing up lending costs and increasing the appeal of bank deposits.
With the next rate-setting meeting due on April 29, the monetary policy outlook remained uncertain and subject to further developments around the situation in Ukraine and Western sanctions, analysts said.
Sova Capital's chief economist Artem Zaigrin said the central bank could take the key rate to 25-30% in April-June if risks continue to materialise.

VTB Capital analysts said they expected rates to stay unchanged until mid-2022, then be lowered to 16% by year-end.
Gazprombank said a first interest rate cut could take place in the second half of 2022.

In a released statement explaining his dissent against the Fed's approval of a quarter point increase this week, Bullard said the Fed ""will have to move quickly to address this situation or risk losing credibility on its inflation target.""
He said he not only favored a half point increase this week, but rate increases at a pace that would require half point increases at 5 of the Fed's 6 remaining meetings this year. 
""The U.S. economy has proven to be especially resilient,"" against the pandemic and geopolitical risks, Bullard said. With inflation running above 6%, triple the Fed's 2% target, Bullard said more Fed actions was needed ""to prudently manage the U.S. macroeconomic situation.""
The pace of rate increases he suggested is far beyond even what investors have priced into contracts linked to the federal funds rate. 
The Fed on Wednesday approved the first rate hike since 2018, effectively ending its battle against the economic fallout from the pandemic to focus on controlling inflation.
Though most Fed officials see six more quarter point rate increases this year, 7 of the Fed's current 16 policymakers do, like Bullard, think rates should go even higher by year's end, a near split in favor of a more aggressive tightening of credit.

Bullard has dissented four times since becoming St. Louis Fed president in 2008, including three times under current Fed chair Jerome Powell.
He has been on both sides of the inflation hawk-dove divide, opposing plans in 2013 to announce a reduction in Fed bond purchases when inflation was weak, and dissenting in favor of earlier and deeper rate cuts when the economy was slowing in 2019.

Nabiullina, who was proposed by President Vladimir Putin to be re-appointed for a third term on Friday, said the Moscow Exchange would resume trading OFZ state rouble treasury bonds from Monday and that the central bank plans to buy there. 
The central bank would fully sell its OFZ bonds at some point later, Nabiullina said in at an online briefing. She did not take questions.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - By extending a cap on retail fuel prices days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has steered into a policy trap that might complicate efforts to keep the economy stable after an April 3 parliamentary election.
Faced with a surge in inflation to near 15-year highs ahead of the vote, the 58-year-old nationalist leader imposed caps on basic foods, fuels and mortgages, extending price curbs on household energy bills in place since 2015.
Despite those moves, which Budapest says have lopped 3 to 4 percentage points off inflation, price growth accelerated in February as the conflict in Ukraine caused energy and some food prices to soar on global markets. Some economists say inflation is on track to reach double digits in May-June, when the price caps are set to expire.
Think tank GKI said its regular survey tracking consumer confidence showed an 11-point plunge in March, the second-largest fall since the pandemic started, even with Orban's 1.8 trillion forint ($5.38 billion) pre-election spending spree to support households.
With inflationary expectations surging, some analysts say if oil prices stay above $100 per barrel, scrapping the fuel price cap in one step after the election will become politically unfeasible and could trigger another inflation shock.
Market prices for gasoline stood at 641 forints per litre on Friday based on a tally by price comparison website holtankoljak.hu, compared with a 480 forint per litre price cap in place since November and due to expire in mid-May.
The National Bank of Hungary (NBH) is expected to raise its base rate by another 75 basis points next Tuesday, extending a campaign of sharp rate rises to shore up local markets.
""The NBH will not be able to curb fuel prices with rate hikes. However, they can help to keep household inflationary expectations under control,"" said ING economist Peter Virovacz.
""The bank will have to deal with the psychological impact. If fuel prices were to jump above 600 forints, that would lead to a surge in inflationary expectations.""
REFUELLING LIMITS
Erste Bank oil and gas sector analyst Tamas Pletser said the price cap was costing Hungarian energy group MOL 1.5 billion to 2 billion forints per day, although a recent retreat in global oil prices has provided some relief.
MOL did not respond to emailed questions for comment.
Shell (LON:RDSa) has imposed a 25,000 forint refuelling limit at its regular pumps in Hungary this month to ensure the safety of supply, while OMV has capped refuelling at 100 litres per transaction at its normal pumps and 300 litres at high-pressure diesel pumps.
""The problem with fuel price regulation or utility price cuts is that when market prices diverge substantially, that makes it very hard to reconcile the two,"" Pletser said, noting the failure of similar efforts in oil producer Venezuela.
Economists say the surge in energy prices is also putting increased pressure on Orban's policy of curbing household energy bills with state-backed price controls.
Pletser said it would take a four- to five-fold increase in gas and electricity prices to reach market levels, without which the government would have to inject up to 1.5 trillion forints into state-owned energy group MVM this year to cover its losses.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) economist Eszter Gargyan, who estimates the fiscal cost of the utility price cap at 1 trillion forints, or 1.5% of GDP, sees inflation rising to 10% if the fuel price cap is lifted but household utility price curbs are kept in place.
MVM declined to comment on analyst forecasts. The finance ministry said increased fiscal buffers would help cover unforeseen expenditures.

""Hungary is brimming with such hidden fiscal issues, which will surface after the election,"" Pletser said.

19,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 09:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller said economic risks around the war in Ukraine led him to vote in favor of a quarter percentage point rate increase at the Fed meeting this week rather than dissent in favor of the larger half point increase he had been advocating.
""The data is screaming at us to go 50 (basis points) but the geopolitical events were telling you to go forward with caution,"" Waller said on CNBC. But in the months ahead Waller said he would favor a series of half percentage point increases to ""frontload"" tighter policy and have a quicker impact on inflation. 
""Going forward that will be an issue about going 50 in the next couple of meetings or not, but the data is suggesting we move in that direction,"" Waller said. 
The Fed on Wednesday approved its first rate increase since 2018 to focus on taming inflation that is currently above 6%, far higher than the central bank's 2% target.
Most Fed officials see rates rising to around 1.9% by the end of the year, a pace equivalent to a quarter point increase at each of the central bank's 6 remaining meetings.
To counteract inflation faster Waller said the central bank should pack more of that into the next few months.
""I really favor frontloading our rate hikes...Just do it rather than just promise it,"" he said. 

While he did not specify where he would like to see the target federal funds rate end the year, he said he would prefer to get above the 2 to 2.25% level he sees as acting neutrally for the economy.
In projections issued Wednesday, 3 policymakers projected rates should end the year at 2.375%, and one projected 2.625%. The most aggressive, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard, feels rates should end the year at 3.125%.

20,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 09:16AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - As the Russia-Ukraine conflict rages, hectic diplomacy is underway. U.S. and European Union leaders will meet and so will the NATO alliance, while all sides are courting China for support.
What kind of hit economic confidence is taking may be shown by Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMIs) for March, while central banks continue to take different paths - Norway is expected to tighten again while more easing could come from China. 
Here's your week ahead in markets from Tom Westbrook in Singapore, Lewis Krauskopf in New York, and Sujata Rao and Dhara Ranasinghe in London.
1/TALKING SHOPS
As Russian jets pound Ukrainian cities, there have been no breakthroughs in peace talks between the two sides. But hectic diplomacy, on several fronts, continues.
Russia is engaging the support of China, India and others, not least to sell commodities in ways that bypass Western sanctions.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is lobbying foreign parliaments and NATO for a no-fly zone over his country. NATO remains wary of direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. It meets on Wednesday in what its chief Jens Stoltenberg calls ""a defining moment for our security"". 
President Joe Biden will join the meeting, and also a mid-week EU summit in Brussels, aiming to cement the new-found cohesiveness with European allies.
But the West risks rifts with China and India, which have not condemned Russian actions. India is buying more Russian oil, and studying a rupee-rouble payment mechanism. A call between Biden and China's Xi Jinping is unlikely to dent China's efforts to occupy the space vacated in Russia by Western firms..

2/LITMUS TEST 
It's flash PMI week. The forward-looking gauge of economic activity for March will be a litmus test of sorts of the impact from the war in Ukraine. 
Generally, PMIs have held above the 50-mark that divides contraction from expansion. But after the ZEW index showed a record slump in German investor morale in March, a recession in Europe's biggest economy cannot be ruled out.
The ZEW hardly registered with markets, more focused on central banks' efforts to stamp on inflation.
But as soaring energy costs squeeze real incomes and consumption, a seriously downbeat batch of PMIs might set the recession warning bells a-ringing.

3/S&P 500 THEN AND NOW
Two years ago on March 23 2020, the S&P 500 index troughed out from a COVID-related nosedive. Since then, it has rallied some 90%, thanks to massive government stimulus and unprecedented support from the Federal Reserve.
Now, markets face a new set of worries. Chief among them: whether the Fed, which lifted rates on Wednesday for the first time since 2018,– will be able to fight soaring inflation without driving the economy into recession.
Ten-year Treasury yields have risen nearly 70 basis points this year, while 2-year yields have jumped 120 bps. If the gap between the two segments, currently around 20 bps, turns negative, it could mean an economic recession is coming.
After the Fed laid out a steeper rate-hike trajectory than many expected, markets will watch upcoming data - besides PMIs, consumer sentiment, new home sales and durable goods are due. They may indicate whether the S&P 500 can claw back a year-to-date 8% loss.

4/ THE HAWK AND THE DOVE
Norway was the first developed nation out of the blocks with post-pandemic policy tightening, having raised interest rates in September and December. On March 24 it will hike again, taking rates to 0.75%. 
With inflation above the 2% target and predictions of 3.6% GDP expansion in 2022, banks expect as many as four rate rises this year. The upcoming meeting will be the first one chaired by new governor Ida Wolden Bache.
Expect no hawkishness from the Swiss National Bank, which meets the same day. It's expected to sit tight and is in no hurry to raise its -0.75% rate, the world's lowest. 
Although February's 2.2% inflation was the highest since 2008, tighter policy risks more Swiss franc appreciation, an important consideration for the export-heavy economy. The SNB made a rare verbal intervention recently and also stepped up foreign currency buying.

5/BOTTOMS UP? China's State Council assurances that policy easing really is on the way and authorities will be gentler on markets gave Chinese stocks their biggest bounce in more than a decade. The challenge now is to deliver meaningful support without spooking investors about the state of the economy. An opportunity arrives Monday when the benchmark Loan Prime Rates are fixed. 

Policy easing could also be delivered by reducing banks' reserve requirement ratios or by moving medium-term rates lower in April after unexpectedly leaving them on hold this month Either way, investors will need to see something soon.

WARSAW/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission could soon approve Poland's coronavirus recovery plan, but Warsaw might only get billions in EU money months later once it satisfies rule-of-law concerns and implements other agreed reforms, EU officials said.
The 27-nation bloc's 800 billion euro ($880 billion) post-pandemic recovery fund will finance the ""green"" and digital transformation of member states' economies between 2021 and 2026.
Countries will get their money once national plans on how to spend the cash are approved by the EU's executive arm and the bloc's finance ministers.
But Poland's plan, under which it could get 23.9 billion euros in grants and 12.1 billion in very cheap loans, has been stuck in the Commission since May 2021 because of accusations the ruling eurosceptic PiS party has been subjecting the country's courts to political control.
Releasing billions from the recovery fund hinge on each country applying the Commission's annual recommendations for reforms and for Poland these say the country must address the EU's rule-of-law concerns.
""There are certain rule of law issues which need to be addressed, which have been also now addressed in a European Court of Justice ruling and of course, we need to see how this European Court of Justice ruling is being implemented,"" Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said this week.
""It's clearly quite a fundamental question on the respect of rule of law, which we are discussing, but we are in constructive contact with Polish authorities. I hope we will be able to make progress on this quite rapidly,"" he said.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month that has sparked an inflow of more than 2 million refugees to cross into Poland, the Warsaw government has argued any conflict over other issues should be put aside.
The EU's top court has ruled the establishment of a disciplinary chamber in the Polish supreme court, appointed by ruling politicians, was unlawful and the chamber should be disbanded. Warsaw denies that and says its court overhaul aims to make the system more efficient and fair.
Poland's ruling party has so far refused to disband the chamber, holding up the Commission's approval of the recovery plan. Approval might come soon, a senior EU official said, but there would be no immediate disbursement of funds.
""The Polish national recovery plan will be approved by the Commission and if the Polish government passes a law that disbands the disciplinary chamber and reinstates judges who were illegally suspended, it will get the money from the recovery fund, of course if it also meets the other agreed milestones and targets,"" a senior EU official, who asked not to be named, said.
Had the Commission issued its approval last year, Warsaw would have been eligible, like all other countries, to get 13% of the total of the cash it cold get, so 3.1 billion euros in grants, in the form of a pre-payment.
But the option of receiving the pre-payment -- money EU countries get before even starting the agreed reforms to transform their economies -- ended last year.
Any approval now means EU disbursements to Poland will only be made once Warsaw delivers on the agreed targets -- one of which is likely to be addressing the EU's rule of law concerns.

""It's a tough balancing act - the rule of law can't be sacrificed for false sense of unity in the face of an armed conflict next door. But the Commission doesn't want to keep blocking the funds, given that the majority of the projects need to be approved this year,"" said another source familiar with the Commission's deliberations.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Russians newly arrived in Turkey are struggling to make deposits and transfers at banks that are taking a careful and sceptical approach for fear of contravening Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over the war in Ukraine, according to several sources.
Private lenders especially are resisting some customer requests and running others through extra layers of compliance to ensure they are abiding by international and domestic law, four bankers and two Turkish officials told Reuters.
All of this is frustrating some Russians who have arrived in Turkey since Moscow invaded Ukraine more than three weeks ago, many with wads of cash in hand. Scores have left home either opposing the war or avoiding new restrictions in Russia, travelling mostly to Middle Eastern or Caucasus countries.
Turkey is one of the few countries still operating direct flights with Russia.
Some Russians in Istanbul told Reuters it was difficult to do basic banking, in part due to Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) suspending operations for them as part of U.S. sanctions meant to punish President Vladimir Putin for the invasion.
""I managed to bring dollars from Moscow and trade them here. But I don't have a card yet,"" said Filipp Chekhunov, a Russian who works in animation and arrived in Istanbul in recent weeks.
Another Russian, Maria, said she had even faced difficulty buying a cup of Turkish tea after trying to use her Visa card.
""I tried to pay for my tea at a café, but the payment was denied,"" said the 33-year-old documentary filmmaker, who declined to give her last name for safety reasons.
""The waiters looked at me with sympathy, shook their heads and said: 'You are Russian!'""
CAUTION
Seeking workarounds to pay for things like accommodation, many Russians have sought to open accounts and deposit funds at local banks, given Turkey has good ties with Russia and opposes the sanctions imposed by many of its NATO allies.
But even though they technically face no more hurdles than other foreigners, visits to bank branches have not been easy.
""Especially the private banks are very careful on new Russian deposits and are afraid of sanctions,"" said a senior banker who requested anonymity.
""The problem is not opening an account but rather how will the money come and what will happen if any sanctions come,"" the person said. ""Banks are very careful in terms of new accounts.""
The BDDK banking regular said authorities and financial institutions are closely following the sanctions applied on Russia. But ""our organisation does not have any instructions to limit citizens of any country that is not in the scope of sanctions decisions,"" it told Reuters.
It is unclear how many Russians have arrived in Turkey since the invasion began.
MIR CARDS
Their inability to use Visa and Mastercard abroad has spurred demand for the home-grown Mir card payment system, which works in Turkey, Armenia, Vietnam and some other countries. 'Mir' means 'world' or 'peace' in Russian.
Russia's Otkritie Bank, hit by U.S. and EU sanctions, said it had issued six times more Mir cards over the past two weeks than in the same period in previous months.
Three Turkish banks accept the Mir payment system: Isbank, Vakifbank and Ziraatbank, and a Turkish banker told Reuters that ""the revenue from transactions via Mir for these three banks increased exponentially"" after Visa and MasterCard's pullout.
""However, they face some hurdles to collect these revenues from the Russian side due to capital controls and other restrictions"" in the fallout from sanctions, said the banker, who wished to remain anonymous.
Some Russians have sought to join China's UnionPay system, accepted in 180 countries. Demand for UnionPay cards has also soared, Russian banks said.
Many Russians in Istanbul have been observed paying hotel and restaurant bills with Turkish lira, which is cheap after sliding more than any other emerging market currency last year.
""I only have cash,"" said Chekhunov, the Moscow native.

""We've made the difficult decisions that we have to make,"" Sunak told a conference organised by his Conservative Party. 
""My priority going forward is to cut taxes. I made that very clear at the budget.""
Sunak said changes to the welfare benefits system he announced last year represented a start to the process of cutting taxes. ""My plan over the course of this parliament is to keep cutting taxes get the tax burden down,"" he said.
The government's tax take is on course to reach its highest since the 1950s - upsetting many Conservative lawmakers - after Sunak announced an increase in social security contributions from April and a big hike in corporation tax in 2023.
He is due to deliver a half-yearly budget update on March 23 and is under pressure to spend billions of pounds more to ease the growing cost-of-living squeeze.

""No government can solve every problem, particularly when you're grappling with global inflationary forces,"" he told the conference on Friday when asked about his Spring Statement.
""But as you saw a month or so ago - when we announced a very significant intervention to help people meet some of the additional cost of energy bills - where we can make a difference of course I can, I'm always going to do that.""

24,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 07:35AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed nominating central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina for a third term in a bid to ensure macroeconomic stability, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
A surprise appointment in 2013, 58-year-old Nabiullina, an economist and former advisor to Putin, is the first woman to chair one of Russia's most respected institutions. 
Her current term ends in June and on Friday Putin asked the Lower House of Parliament, or Duma, to consider his re-appointment proposal on March 21. 
""Now, when the central bank is facing a growing responsibility to maintain macroeconomic stability, the president regularly speaks to Nabiullina,"" Peskov told reporters on a daily call. 
Nabiullina is a committed inflation fighter, resisting calls from powerful industrialists and the Economy Ministry for interest rate cuts to revive growth. 
The bank held its key interest rate at 20% on Friday after a sharp emergency hike in late February. Nabiullina is due give a monetary policy statement at 1400 GMT, without taking questions. 
""Reappointment removes unnecessary questions from different 'groups of influence',"" said Dmitry Polevoy, investment director at Locko Invest. 
""Obviously, in the current environment, the economy would need a stimulating monetary policy which will further impact the trajectory of the key rate. But it seems that there will be no radical change in the approach given Nabiullina's re-appointment."" 
The central bank raised its key rate from 9.5% on Feb. 28 as the rouble crashed to record lows and people rushed to withdraw money from banks following an unprecedented barrage of Western sanctions against Russia for what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. 
""The Russian economy is entering a large-scale structural transformation phase, which will be accompanied by a temporary but inevitable period of increased inflation,"" the central bank said on Friday. 
An independent survey of analysts requested by the central bank this month forecast inflation of 20% and an 8% economic contraction this year while predicting the key interest rate would average 18.9%. 
The central bank did not provide inflation and economic growth forecasts on Friday, only saying that gross domestic product would reduce over the coming quarters and that it expects annual inflation to return to its 4% target in 2024. 

Before the wider military conflict between Russia and Ukraine broke out in late February, the central bank had revised its year-end inflation forecast to 5.0-6.0%, giving up earlier hopes that it would ease to 4.0-4.5%.
Back then, it expected inflation to reach its 4% target in mid-2023.

Investing.com -- U.S. President Joe Biden will warn China's Xi Jinping that the U.S. will retaliate against it if it provides active support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Xi, meanwhile, signalled a subtle shift in China's Covid-19 policy to alleviate the stress on China's economy. Russia avoids default - at least for now - but oil rises further on fears that it intends to escalate the war. GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares stumble after a surprise loss over the holiday quarter. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 18th March.
1. Biden – Xi talks
U.S. President Joe Biden will talk with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, and will warn him that China will face “costs” if its verbal support of Russia over Ukraine morphs into more substantial help, according to Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.
According to various reports, the U.S. is determined to stop China undermining Western sanctions against the country and to deter it from sending the military assistance that it says the Kremlin has asked for. Russia denies that it has asked for help.
China – like India – abstained from the UN motion two weeks ago condemning Russia’s invasion, and official media have largely followed the Russian line in blaming U.S.-led expansion of NATO for triggering the conflict. Chinese officials have repeatedly expressed concern about the damage to the world economy from the sanctions imposed by the U.S., EU and allies since the invasion. 
Federal Reserve officials Michelle Bowman, Charles Evans and Tom Barkin are all due to speak later, giving their take on the events of earlier in the week.
2. Russia avoids default for now
The sanctions on Russia may not actually be as tight as advertised. Reports suggest that Russia has serviced its international debt payments, using central bank reserves that were supposed to be frozen under the measures announced two weeks ago.
Newswire reports said that bondholders had started to receive payments in respect of interest totalling $117 million, avoiding what would have been a momentous default that would have sent shockwaves through the emerging market debt universe.
Bloomberg reported that various leading Russian companies, such as Norilsk Nickel (OTC:NILSY) and  Severstal  (LON:0SJQ), have also serviced their foreign debt obligations. Russia’s central bank will hold a regular policy meeting later, and Governor Elvira Nabiullina, who was earlier re-nominated for another term by President Vladimir Putin, is likely to be asked about both this week’s payments and future ones.
3. Stocks set to open lower; Boeing-Delta deal in focus
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower later but still in the green for the week after two days of solid gains since the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates for the first time in over three years.
By 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 187 points or 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.6% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.7%. The three indices had all risen by over 1% on Thursday, after even bigger gains immediately after the Fed decision on Wednesday.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Boeing (NYSE:BA), which was reported by Reuters to be in advanced talks with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) over an order for around 100 of its 737 MAX 10 aircraft. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) will be in the spotlight after its earnings spoke of increasing cost pressures, while GameStop’s turnaround again looks in doubt after it posted a surprise loss during the holiday quarter.
4. Xi signals shift in Covid policy 
Chinese President Xi Jinping signalled a shift in the country’s ‘zero-tolerance’ policy to Covid, bolstering hopes that the country will come to terms with a virus that has become too hard to suppress entirely.
China will “strive to achieve the maximum prevention and control effect at the least cost and minimize the impact of the epidemic on economic and social development,” Bloomberg reported Xi as telling a Politburo standing committee meeting on Thursday.  
The lockdowns in Shenzhen and Jilin over the last two weeks have not been as severe as those seen in 2020, although they have been enough to lead to widespread factory closures.  Shenzhen, a major manufacturing hub, is set to loosen its restrictions soon, local authorities said on Thursday, but gave no precise timetable. 
Hong Kong, meanwhile, continues to suffer one of the highest death rates seen anywhere in the world over the last two rates, as a combination of low vaccination rates and high population density takes its toll. 
In Europe, Germany is also set to drop most of its Covid restrictions from Monday, despite a continued run of high infections.
5. Oil pushes higher on Ukraine escalation fears
Crude oil prices drifted higher again on Friday as fears of further escalation to the war in Ukraine predominated. U.S. officials have warned that, after suffering repeated battlefield setbacks, Russia may be preparing to use chemical weapons to increase the pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept its demands.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 1.3% at $104.35 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 1.3% at $107.97 a barrel.
Fears that Western sanctions could lead to a sudden stop of Russian export appear to be misplaced, however. India has quadrupled its imports of Russian oil this month to some 360,000 barrels a day, according to Kpler data cited by the Financial Times.

The bank's statement followed an announcement from Japan's Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group that it would not invest in Nusantara, despite previous remarks by an Indonesian minister that the group had offered billions of dollars for the project.
The NNCA is headed by Bambang Susantono, a former vice president for ADB and former deputy transport minister for Indonesia.
Susantono was quoted in Friday's ADB statement as saying he was keen to learn about others' experiences in creating carbon-neutral and inclusive cities.
Jokowi, as the president is commonly known, has said he wants the government to finance only about a fifth of the cost of the new capital city, and that private and foreign investors should bankroll the rest.

Indonesia's sovereign wealth fund will invest in the new capital city if it sees the project as commercially viable, the head of the fund told Reuters this week.
The government aims to start construction soon and civil servants are expected to move from the current capital, Jakarta, to Nusantara in 2024.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will impose sanctions on 15 Russian individuals and nine organisations, it said on Friday, among them defence officials and the state-owned arms exporter, Rosoboronexport.
The sanctions, which include the freezing of assets, are Japan's latest measures since Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24. They now cover 76 individuals, seven banks and 12 other bodies in Russia, the finance ministry said.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova and several makers of military equipment, such as United Aircraft Corp, which manufactures fighter jets, are among those sanctioned in Friday's measures.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will address Japan's parliament next week, said former minister Taro Kono, who now heads public relations for Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Russia calls its action in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
The U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, who praised Japan's action as ""hitting at the heart of Russia's war machine"", has offered to host Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war in his residence until they find permanent housing in Japan.
Long refugee-shy, Japan is preparing to take in Ukrainian evacuees, with 47 having arrived since the outbreak of the war.
""We would like to do our part, too, by assisting the evacuees until they are able to move into more permanent housing,"" Ambassador Emanuel, the grandson of Ukrainian immigrants, said in a statement.
This week, a U.S. Air Force cargo jet flew to Ukraine helmets and other non-lethal military equipment donated by Japan.
A main U.S. security ally in Asia, Japan still has stakes in gas and oil projects in Russia's Sakhalin island, after energy majors Shell (LON:RDSa) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) pulled out of them. 
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has given no clear indication of the fate of Japan's investment in the projects, underscoring both their importance for its energy security and his intention to keep step with G7 peers' sanctions against Russia.
The Russian ambassador to Japan has said it was logical to maintain ""mutually beneficial"" energy projects in Sakhalin.
Japan does also not intend to ban Russian seafood, the Jiji Press news agency said.

Seafood comprises 9% of Japan's total imports from Russia, on which it relies heavily for items such as sea urchin and frozen crab, the non-profit think tank Japan Forum on International Relations says.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan maintained its massive stimulus on Friday and warned of heightening risks to a fragile economic recovery from the Ukraine crisis, reinforcing expectations it will remain an outlier in the global shift towards tighter monetary policy.
Rising fuel and commodity prices blamed on the war in Ukraine could drive up consumer inflation to the BOJ's 2% target in coming months, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said.
But such cost-push inflation will be short-lived and won't prompt the BOJ to withdraw stimulus, he added, stressing the bank's resolve to maintain huge monetary support for an economy yet to fully recover from the COVID-19 pandemic's wounds.
""There's a chance Japan will see inflation move around 2% from April onward. But most of that is due to rising commodity prices, so there's no reason to tighten monetary policy. Doing so would be inappropriate,"" he told a news conference. 
The BOJ's dovish tone is in stark contrast with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which raised interest rates this week to stop fast-rising inflation becoming entrenched.
As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its short-term rate target at -0.1% and that for the 10-year bond yield around 0% at the two-day policy meeting that ended on Friday.
A resource-poor country that relies almost entirely on imports for fuel and gas, Japan is particularly vulnerable to the economic hit from global commodity inflation.
The war-driven spike in energy prices is adding to pressure on the world's third-largest economy, which likely saw growth stall in the current quarter as supply disruptions and COVID-19 curbs hobbled output and consumption.
""Japan's economy is picking up as a trend,"" the BOJ said in a statement, offering a bleaker view than in January when it said the economy was showing ""clearer signs of pick-up.""
The BOJ also removed from its statement language projecting a positive economic cycle, under which rising corporate profits drive up wages, capital expenditure and consumption.
""Japan's economy is still in the midst of recovering from the pandemic's impact. What's important for us now is to support the recovery by maintaining easy monetary policy,"" Kuroda said.
The BOJ warned of fresh risks from the Ukraine crisis, which it said was destabilising markets and boosting corporate costs.
""There is very high uncertainty on the impact developments in Ukraine could have on Japan's economy and prices via markets, raw material prices and overseas economies,"" the statement said.
The BOJ is likely to more thoroughly assess the fallout from the Ukraine crisis at its next meeting in April, when it will issue fresh quarterly growth and inflation forecasts.
Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.6% in February from a year earlier, marking the fastest pace in two years in a sign of growing inflationary pressure.
Analysts expect consumer inflation to approach 2% from next month due to rising energy costs and the dissipating effect of cellphone fee cuts. But that would still leave Japan's inflation well below 5.9% in the euro zone and 7.9% in the United States.
Inflation is far from being entrenched in Japan, where wage growth remains modest and long-term inflation expectations have barely moved, Kuroda said.
Some analysts doubt whether households can stomach further price rises if wages don't pick up much.

Highlighting the hit to households from rising fuel costs, energy and electricity bills both shot up by around 20% in February from year-before levels, the fastest pace since 1981.
""With inflation and wage growth lagging other countries, the BOJ has no choice but to patiently maintain stimulus at least until Kuroda serves out his term in April 2023,"" said Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Securities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly backed legislation on Thursday to remove ""most favored nation"" trade status for Russia and Belarus over the invasion of Ukraine, paving the way for higher tariffs on imports from the countries.
The Democratic-controlled House voted 424-8 in favor of removing Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status, the latest congressional effort to put economic pressure on Moscow.
To become law, the measure must also pass the Senate. Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said it would move through the Senate quickly, after approval by the House.
The move to revoke Russia's status at the World Trade Organization is being coordinated with similar efforts by other G7 democracies. It would automatically raise U.S. tariffs to non-WTO rates for imports from Russia and it authorizes U.S. President Joe Biden to proclaim higher tariff rates on products from both Russia and Belarus.
But after a ban on U.S. imports of Russian energy products last week, the impact from the tariff status change may be largely symbolic, said Chad Bown, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
""Looking at the data, we just don't import a lot of stuff from Russia,"" Bown said.
According to World Bank data, the biggest non-petroleum imports from Russia in 2020 were palladium, raw ""pig"" iron, rhodium, unwrought aluminum alloys, plywood and fertilizers. Palladium and rhodium are used in automotive catalytic converters.
The House vote took place a day after Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy made an emotional speech to Congress - via videolink - appealing for more support. Many lawmakers wore Ukrainian flag pins as they voted.
The measure also would expand the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, easing the imposition of sanctions on Russian officials for human rights violations.
All eight ""no"" votes came from Republicans, some of whom said the Magnitsky provision gave too much power to the president.
""If we do not speak out for human rights because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights,"" Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, urging support for the bill.

Republican Representative Victoria Spartz, the only Ukrainian-born member of Congress, said it was important that close Russian ally Belarus was included. ""We cannot create a loophole where Putin is going to use Belarus to funnel money through them,"" she said.
The measure also directs U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai to use ""the voice and influence of the United States at the WTO"" to encourage other countries to suspend trade concessions to Russia and to halt Belarus' accession to the trade body.

The poll nevertheless found expectations for cuts growing after Vice Premier Liu He on Wednesday said Beijing would roll out more support measures for the Chinese economy.
Among 36 financial institutions surveyed in a snap Reuters poll, just over half said they expected China's one-year loan prime rate (LPR) and the five-year rate to remain unchanged at the March fixing. 
Five respondents said they anticipated a 5 basis point reduction in the five-year rate and no change in the one-year rate. 
""I think they'll cut the five-year, since the one-year follows the MLF,"" said a trader at a Chinese bank. ""They want to stabilise the property market so it's more important to cut the five-year.""
The central bank surprised markets on Tuesday by not cutting its one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) rate, despite growing risks to the economic outlook, including mounting COVID-19 disruptions, increasing global risks from the Ukraine conflict and a weak property market.
Reflecting market uncertainty, other respondents predicted a wide range of different cuts. 
Four respondents expected a 5 basis point cut in the one-year rate, but no change in the five-year, and six respondents said they expected at least one of the rates to be cut by 10 basis points.
Regardless of whether Monday's fixing brings a cut, investors see Liu's comments as having boosted the likelihood of other easing measures, particularly as China struggles with a worsening COVID-19 outbreak.
""Given strict social distancing measures, it is likely that more cities could find themselves being put under 'semi-lockdown',"" analysts at ING said in a note.
""We expect the central bank to respond with targeted (reserve requirement ratio) cuts aimed at supporting small and medium-sized enterprises.""
Most new and outstanding loans in China are based on the one-year LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of home mortgages. 

The one-year LPR is 3.7% following cuts of 5 and 10 basis points in December and January, respectively, while the five-year LPR is 4.6% after a 5-basis-point cut in January.
The MLF rate serves as a guide to the LPR, which is decided on the 20th of each month.

China reported 2,388 new local cases with confirmed symptoms on March 17, almost double the count a day earlier, as it battles its worst coronavirus outbreak since the virus first emerged in Wuhan in 2020.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a report late Thursday it expected a loss of 0.03 to 0.05 percentage point to GDP growth per week of the lockdown, on the current size of the lockdown. 
Earlier this month, China forecast a slower economic growth of around 5.5% this year as domestic headwinds, including a downturn in the country's vast real estate sector and lacklustre consumption, cast a pall on its outlook.
""We view China's recent COVID cases and restrictions as a potential demand-side shock that could partly offset the Russia/Ukraine supply-side shock to some commodities,"" Credit Suisse economists said.

Separately, J.P.Morgan said it expected 20% of China's GDP to undergo a ""more severe economic shock"" associated with the ""zero-COVID"" policy, but expected it to recover in May and June.
The brokerage forecasts China's full-year GDP growth to be 4.9%, down from its previous estimate of 5.1%.

Following are excerpts from BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's comments at his post-meeting news conference, which was conducted in Japanese, as translated by Reuters:
UKRAINE CRISIS' IMPACT
""The biggest impact on Japan's economy from the Ukraine crisis is through rising raw material costs. Japan's inflation is likely to accelerate clearly for the time being. But it also weigh on the economy from a longer-term perspective by pushing down corporate profits and households' real income."" 
""Developments regarding the Ukraine crisis are highly uncertain. We will closely watch whether they inflect negative impact on Japan's economy that is still in the midst of recovering from the pandemic's hit."" 
INFLATION
""It will depend on future crude oil price moves and the government's steps to cushion the blow. But we could see inflation move at around 2% for some time from April. Rising costs will push up inflation. But it weighs on households and corporate profits, and could have a negative impact on Japan's economy. We will maintain our powerful monetary easing patiently to achieve sustainable, stable inflation.""
WEAK YEN
""A weak yen affects Japan's economy in different ways as the country's economic and trade structure changes. But overall, there's no change to how a weak yen is basically positive for Japan's economy. It's true the impact is felt unevenly among sectors, corporate size and economic entities...""
""The recent rise in import costs is driven more by surging raw material costs than by a weak yen.""
""The relationship between interest-rate differentials and exchange-rate moves isn't clear-cut ... I don't think interest rate differentials alone would weaken the yen further.""
STAGFLATION
""I don't think Europe, the United States and Japan will face stagflation""
INFLATION AND MONETARY POLICY
""There's a chance Japan will see inflation move around 2% from April onward. But most of that is due to rising commodity prices, so there's no reason to tighten monetary policy. Doing so would be inappropriate. We need to tweak monetary policy if inflation expectations or wages see second-round effects. But Japan isn't in such a situation.""
JAPAN'S ECONOMY
""So far the spring wage negotiations are turning very positive results. It's hard to predict how the Ukraine situation develops, so that needs close attention. But at this stage, I don't think the positive economic cycle has been disrupted.""
BOJ RESPONSE TO WEAK YEN
""Exchange rate policy falls upon the jurisdiction of the finance ministry. The BOJ does not need to, and does not have the power to influence exchange rates. But it's true exchange rate moves affect the economy and prices, so we're watching moves carefully.""
PRICE RISE
""Japan's consumer inflation may move around 2% from April onward but that's unlikely to persist for a long period of time ... Price rises driven mostly by cost-push inflation are basically temporary and unlikely to be sustained.""

JAPAN INFLATION OUTLOOK
""When we look at various data, short-term inflation expectations are heightening, but medium- and long-term expectations are barely moving. At least for now, we're not seeing any major change in Japan's inflation expectations.""

The end of the week is in sight and one thing is clear, central banks increasingly appear to be on different paths and investors are not entirely convinced that it's the right one. 
So even as the Federal Reserve kicked off its rate hiking cycle and signalled an aggressive plan to push up borrowing costs to tame inflation, market pricing suggests that such action could trigger a potential recession. 
At just 24 basis points, the gap between two and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields is near its tightest levels since March 2020. That means the yield curve is not far from inverting -- an indicator of a likely recession in the following one to two years. It has a good track record. 
Meanwhile the Bank of England raised rates for a third time on Thursday but softened its language on the need for more hikes as households face a huge hit from soaring energy bills.
European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said the ECB would be in no hurry to raise rates (markets still price in at least 4 rate hikes of 10 bps each by year-end), while the Bank of Japan on Friday maintained its massive stimulus and warned of heightening risks from the Ukraine crisis.
Whether to hike rates and tame inflation, but risk tipping the economy into recession, or do nothing to steer the economy through the fallout of the war in Ukraine and risk inflation spiralling, puts policymakers in a bind.
See-sawing oil is not helping with crude back above $100.
A first Russian external bond default in a century however appears to have been have averted for now. Sources say some creditors have received payment, in dollars, of Russian bond coupons which fell due this week.
European stocks futures are broadly flat, while U.S. futures are lower, with global markets taking a breather after several days of gains.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday: 
- S&P cuts Russia's ratings to 'CC' on debt default risk
- Euro zone wages/employment, trade balance data

The move, which will also apply to Toyota Motor Corp and Isuzu Motors Ltd vehicles that use one of the Hino engines, will be formally announced by the ministry on March 25, it said in a statement.
Hino this month admitted to falsifying data related to emissions and fuel economy performance for three of the engines. In a fourth engine, it said performance was later discovered to be less than specified, although it had so far not found evidence of misconduct.
It has established a special investigation committee composed of outside experts to probe the matter.

Hino is the latest in a string of Japanese automakers involved in improper emissions tests.

LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Rishi Sunak must decide next week whether to spend billions of pounds more to ease the growing cost-of-living squeeze for households and businesses as inflation soars higher.
Sunak, who is due to deliver a budget update on Wednesday, wants to steer the public finances of the world's fifth-biggest economy back to normality after a COVID spending surge which pushed government borrowing to its highest ever in peacetime.
But fast-rising inflation - which looks on course to top 8% after Russia's invasion of Ukraine - has led to calls for Sunak to dig into the public coffers again and provide more emergency support.
The cost-of-living squeeze - which is also being driven by higher Bank of England interest rates - is set to overshadow his plans to address the longer-term challenge of fixing Britain's weak productivity record when he makes his Spring Statement.
Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said Sunak faced a huge judgment call about whether to protect households from the energy price surge.
""If he doesn't, then many on moderate incomes will face the biggest hit to their living standards since at least the financial crisis,"" Johnson said. ""If he does, then there will be another big hit to the public finances.""
The IFS estimates Sunak would have to spend a further 22 billion pounds ($29 billion) if he wanted to restore the real value of the energy price support for households that he promised only last month, and to maintain the real-terms size of public-sector pay rises he announced in his October budget.
Britain's finance ministry says it has already promised direct cost-of-living support worth more than 20 billion pounds for this year and next.
OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE RESPONDED
Britain's debt interest bill for next year is also likely to increase by a similar amount, according to some estimates.
Around a quarter of British government borrowing pays interest that is tied to the rate of retail price inflation
Britain's borrowing has come down fast from 15% of gross domestic product at the height of the pandemic to about half of that in the tax year just ending, and Sunak has an estimated 20-30 billion pounds in wiggle room within his fiscal rules.
But analysts at bank Investec said Sunak might have to raise tax revenues to fund any new relief package for households. 
""A 'windfall' levy on oil and gas producing companies would be one possibility. Another would be to do nothing for now and to defer a decision until later in the year,"" the analysts said.
Other governments have responded to the latest surge in energy prices. France and Sweden will subsidise automotive fuel costs. Germany and Italy are considering similar plans.
Businesses are also demanding support measures which range from the suspension of April's social security increase to more tax breaks to encourage business investment.
Sunak last month outlined his strategy for giving Britain's economy a productivity boost via tax incentives for investment in equipment and in research and development.
That could help boost Britain's sluggish economic growth over the longer term and allow Sunak to cut taxes, something many members of his Conservative Party demand.

At the moment, the government's tax take is set to reach its highest since the 1950s after Sunak announced an increase in social security contributions - that he has insisted will still start in April - and a big hike in corporation tax in 2023.

While the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has ""resolutely probed"" and dealt with cases violating statistical discipline and laws in recent years, ""the problem of statistical data fraud is still relatively prominent,"" said a statement from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI).
The NBS publishes China's closely watched gross domestic product (GDP) numbers, among other key data. 
China has set an annual economic growth target of around 5.5% this year but economists have questioned if the country is able to achieve it amid intensifying geopolitical challenges, global commodity price inflation and a zero-COVID policy that clogs supply chains. 
A few regions created the ""illusion of economic development"" by falsifying data and some local authorities issued secret instructions to intervene in manipulating data.
Data fraud is being found in more areas including R&D funding ratios, energy intensity and carbon intensity that typically reflects the quality of economic and social development, the anti-graft watchdog said.
Energy intensity and carbon intensity indicate the amount of energy consumed and carbon emitted per unit of GDP, and are used to gauge the progress of a country's campaign to tackle climate change.
Inspectors from the CCDI added that some local officials prioritise economic growth and ignore other areas of economic development, or seek to show off their personal achievements through statistics.

The CCDI will carry out random inspections on data quality on a regular basis and supervise the establishment of an accountability system among local authorities to prevent and punish statistical fraud.

Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Australia was working in close cooperation with international partners to increase sanctions pressure on oligarchs close to Russian President Vladimir Putin over the invasion of Ukraine.
""Australia has now added two billionaires with links to business interests in Australia, Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg,"" Payne said in a statement.
The measures are in addition to curbs on 41 oligarchs and immediate family members who already face targeted financial sanctions and travel bans, she said.
Payne said the government welcomed Australian companies taking a principled stand with moves to cut ties with Russia ""in protest of Moscow’s illegal, indefensible war against Ukraine"".
Russia says it is carrying out ""a special military operation"" to stop the Ukrainian government from committing ""genocide"" - an accusation the West calls a fabrication.
Vekselberg is an investor in the Russian energy sector, who has interests in a company working with Origin Energy on a gas project in the Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory.
Origin said it was seeking clarification on the sanctions from the Australian government, and told Reuters the Beetaloo Basin project was not a producing asset and had no earnings.

EN+ Group is the major shareholder in Russian company Rusal, which has a 20% share in the Queensland Alumina (OTC:AWCMY) Limited (QAL) refinery in Gladstone, in a joint venture with Rio Tinto.
Rio Tinto previously said it was cutting ties with Rusal as part of its overall withdrawal from Russia. 

Queensland Alumina Ltd did not respond to a request for comment.
Deripaska reduced his controlling stake in EN+ Group from 70% in 2019 - to lift a prior round of U.S. sanctions from the major aluminium producer.

43,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 11:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Japan kept its stimulus on hold and indicated increasing concern over the economy as it stuck with a dovish stance that contrasts with the rate hikes of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England this week.  
The BOJ left its interest rates and asset purchases unchanged, according to a statement Friday, as predicted by all economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank revised down its economic assessment just two months after it was upgraded, citing the impact of Covid. 
It also flagged the need to monitor developments in markets and commodity prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
With the decision, the BOJ cemented its outlier status following the interest-rate hikes of its global peers this week. 
With little local price growth and, the economy struggling to return pre-pandemic level and the outlook clouded by the war in Ukraine, the decision probably wasn’t difficult. Still the position for policy makers could get increasingly awkward for policy makers of the coming months as public angst rises over cost-push inflation driven by rising fuel prices and a weakening yen. 
The BOJ tweaked its wording on the outlook for inflation, saying it’s expected to “clearly” rise and citing energy prices as the key driver. It kept a bias toward easing, with guidance for rates to stay low or go even lower, wording that the European Central Bank ditched last week.
Japan’s key consumer prices rose 0.6% last month, according to a government report earlier Friday as energy costs rose at the fastest pace in 41 years.

Price growth is expected to accelerate from April, when the heavy drag from cell phone fee cuts begins to drop out of calculations. With a further boost from energy prices also expected, an increasing number of economists are warning inflation could reach 2% or breach it. That might put consumers off spending and deepen public discontent at a time of limited wages growth.
A jump in oil prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine is already pushing inflation beyond the BOJ’s most recent quarterly projections in January, adding to negative factors weighing on the fragile economy, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg earlier this month. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“Our focus will be on the BOJ’s assessment and any guidance it gives on how it may respond to the risks. In our view, the timing of its policy normalization has shifted further into the future, to 2024.”

A weaker economy could complicate Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s campaign for key elections this summer. On top of the measures he has taken to cap gasoline prices, the premier is likely to order a large-scale economic package, according to a local media report Wednesday. 
The economy is on the verge of another contraction this quarter, mainly due to fallout from the omicron variant that struck earlier in the year. With few natural resources, Japan is set to be hard hit by the surge in oil and commodity prices. 
It’s critical for the BOJ to align with Kishida’s government, particularly this year as he is likely to select a successor to Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, whose term ends in April next year. 
Kuroda is likely to stress the need to keep ultra-loose policy in place to support the economy during his press conference in the afternoon. In doing so, he will need to tread a delicate path as too strong a tilt toward easing could weaken the yen further and add to concerns over import costs.
There is little the central bank can do in the current economic circumstances, according to Kazuo Momma, a former top BOJ official in charge of monetary policy. Changes are likely to come via nuance in the BOJ’s communications, including deemphasizing its 2% target in the face of cost-push inflation and touching on the negative aspects of a weaker yen for some parts of the economy, he said.

Wuhan is offering firms up to 50 million yuan ($7.88 million) in financial incentives each in projects related to the manufacturing of satellites, rockets and spacecraft, according to a notice from the city government on Wednesday.
The amounts for the inland city are modest compared with ambitious plans outlined by other prosperous coastal cities, but the effort suggests a deepening push by China to become a major space power by 2030. 
China envisions massive constellations of commercial satellites that can offer services ranging from high-speed internet for aircraft to tracking coal shipments. 
The Wuhan city government will encourage companies to use locally sourced equipment, software and services. 
If a firm uses local products in more than 10% of the production of high-orbiting and low-orbiting satellites as well as spacecraft, it will get financial incentives of up to 15 million yuan. 
If local products account for more than 30%, the firm will get up to 50 million yuan. 
Last year, the tech city of Shenzhen in southern Guangdong province offered up to 300 million yuan in incentives for every project related to the development of satellites and related industry applications.
China is also planning a new commercial space port in the southern island province of Hainan. 

In the eastern port city of Ningbo in Zhejiang province, China is separately constructing its fifth rocket launch site.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's Senate voted late on Thursday to approve a $45 billion debt deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), converting the agreement into law and ensuring that the economically battered country can avoid another messy default.
After an extended debate, the IMF debt restructuring deal backed by President Alberto Fernandez was passed with 56 senators voting in favor, 13 against, along with three abstentions.
The South American country's center-left Peronist government led by Fernandez struck a staff-level agreement with the international lender at the beginning of March, which was then approved last week by the Chamber of Deputies.
It now needs to be signed off by the IMF board.
The deal lays out a fresh schedule of financing over a 30-month period to replace a failed $57 billion program from 2018 that the grains-producing country was unable to pay back after years of recession, spiraling inflation and capital flight.
It garnered broad support from the center-right opposition, though some ruling party lawmakers have opposed it citing the economic strings attached, which include reducing the fiscal deficit, raising interest rates and cutting energy subsidies.
""This agreement will allow us to accumulate reserves, which will favor Argentina's exchanges with the world and will allow sustained growth,"" Senator Sandra Mendoza, from the ruling Peronists, said during the debate.
Roberto Basualdo, a senator from the opposition alliance Together for Change, told Reuters earlier in the day that approving the deal was key to any future economic expansion.
""We need to grow and the only way to grow is to be in international markets,"" he said.
Many lawmakers stressed that the vote removes the worst-case scenario for near-term economic prospects.

""By approving this agreement we are prioritizing the interests of the Argentine republic by preventing default,"" said Senator Jose Torello, of the opposition alliance.
Fernandez wants a quick approval of the agreement ahead of a $2.8 billion payment due to the IMF at the beginning of next week and billions more later this year. The new program would see repayments made between 2026 and 2034.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan's next governor must be someone who can steer the central bank toward an exit from ultra-easy monetary policy, Kenta Izumi, head of the country's biggest opposition party, said on Thursday.
Izumi, president of the left-leaning Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), also said the yen's recent declines could be hurting the economy by pushing up import costs.
""We're beginning to see bad inflation"" fuelled by a weak yen and rising raw material prices, Izumi told Reuters.
""The impact is starting to be really big,"" he said, adding that rising prices of imported goods were hurting people's livelihoods and corporate activity.
Izumi, who said households were taking a hit from high fuel and food costs, has instructed his party's policy research committee to draw up measures for dealing with surging prices.
The remarks highlight a sea change in how Japanese politicians perceive the pros and cons of a weak yen.
Some of the key members of CDPJ are from the former Democratic Party of Japan which, after taking power in 2009, repeatedly pressured the BOJ to ease monetary policy to prevent a strong yen from damaging the export-reliant economy.
The BOJ is likely to keep monetary policy steady as it says it won't withdraw stimulus until its 2% inflation target is achieved in a stable manner, Izumi said.
But the central bank may need to consider reviewing monetary policy if inflation continues to rise, he added.
Any shift in BOJ policy could be tied to the government's choice of a successor to incumbent Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, whose second, five-year term ends in March 2023.
After deploying a massive asset-buying programme in 2013 to pull Japan out of deflation, Kuroda has consistently called for the need to keep monetary policy ultra-loose to achieve his elusive 2% inflation target.
But the BOJ has faced growing criticism over the rising cost of prolonged easing, such as the hit to bank profits from years of ultra-low interest rates.

Some lawmakers also blame the BOJ's easy policy for weakening the yen and aggravating rising import costs.
""The government should choose someone who has a clear idea on how the BOJ could normalise monetary policy,"" Izumi said.

(Reuters) -Some creditors have received payment, in dollars, of Russian bond coupons which fell due this week, two market sources said on Thursday, meaning that Russia for now may have averted what would have been its first external bond default in a century.
The Russian finance ministry said earlier that it had sent funds to cover $117 million in coupon payments on two dollar-denominated sovereign bonds. 
The payments, due on March 16 but with a 30-day grace period, are seen as the first test of whether Moscow will meet its international debt obligations after Western sanctions hobbled its financial dealings.
""The coupon was paid, against my expectations, and in dollars,"" one person said. Another person said the money had been received by a client who was a bondholder. 
Some other creditors said they had yet to receive their funds but were optimistic they were on the way, noting they had received payments on hard currency bonds from a raft of state-run and private Russian companies in recent days.
Earlier, another source told Reuters that JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) , Russia's correspondent bank, had processed the cash sent by the government and credited it to the paying agent,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) . It would be checked and then distributed to various bondholders, the source said.
Citi declined to comment.
The external sovereign bond payments were the first to fall due since the sanctions imposed over Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Moscow's tit-for-tat measures, and bondholders had feared the transaction would be frustrated. 
Russia had planned to send the equivalent interest payment amount in roubles if dollar payments did not reach foreign bondholders, something credit rating agency Fitch said would constitute a sovereign default if not corrected within a 30-day grace period. 
S&P on Thursday lowered Russia's rating to ""CC"" from ""CCC-minus,"" saying that debt service payments in the coming weeks may face technical difficulties.
Washington imposed harsh sanctions on Russia's central bank in late February, days after the invasion of Ukraine, blocking Americans from engaging in any transactions involving it. 
In early March, however, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) authorised transactions for U.S. persons for ""the receipt of interest, dividend, or maturity payments in connection with debt or equity"" issued by Russia's finance ministry, central bank or wealth fund - an exemption that runs out on May 25.
Russia also laid down strict new rules for foreigners seeking permits to buy and sell Russian assets ranging from securities to real estate, a client memo by Citigroup showed, raising fresh concerns that Western investors could face large write-downs.
MONITORING UPCOMING PAYMENTS 
The March 16 coupons are the first of several, with another $615 million falling due over the rest of the month. The first principal payment is due on April 4 when a $2 billion bond matures.
""Even if this week’s payment is made, investors will need to then monitor the next upcoming payments as they may be treated differently,"" Jonny Goulden, head of EM local markets and sovereign debt strategy at JPMorgan, said in a note. 
He noted the upcoming payments either clear via the Russian NSD settlement mechanism or because they have the option to make the payment in roubles embedded in the bond contract.
After the May 25 sanctions deadline and until year-end, Russia is due to pay nearly $2 billion more on its external sovereign bonds. 
The bonds themselves have been issued with a mix of terms and indentures. Bonds sold after Russia was sanctioned over its 2014 annexation of Crimea contain a provision for alternative currency payments. For bonds listed after 2018, the rouble is listed as an alternative currency option.
Russian bonds are hovering at deeply distressed levels in very illiquid trading, with most issues trading less than a handful of times a day, according to Refinitiv data.
The premium demanded by investors to hold Russian hard-currency bonds over U.S. Treasuries, as calculated by the JPMorgan EMBI global diversified index, nevertheless tightened to 3,737 basis points on Thursday - the lowest level since early March.
That premium had been just over 200 bps until mid-February, when a Russian default seemed unthinkable. 

Russian companies are also under scrutiny for their ability and willingness to pay. They have nearly $100 billion in hard currency bonds outstanding, of which around a fifth are held by international investors. 
The country's second-largest state lender, VTB, also the target of Western sanctions, said on Thursday it would hand over servicing of foreign securities to other Russian financial companies, the TASS state news agency reported.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -At least five vessels are headed toward Russia with nearly 200,000 tonnes of Brazilian raw sugar sold by European traders, according to shipping data seen by Reuters, about double the country's normal annual imports of the sweetener.
Sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine have boosted demand for sugar and other food staples there, and store shelves have been emptying due to food hoarding. Yet sanctions may also make it harder for shippers to get paid for their cargoes.
The volume of sugar being shipped is unusually high, traders said, noting Russia tends to import roughly 100,000 tonnes of sugar per year. Russia is not a notable importer or exporter of sugar, but Russians have started to hoard the sweetener.
While sugar sales are not covered by the sanctions, financial transactions are. Also, analysts said security issues in the Black Sea may hinder the vessels.
Black Sea shipping routes have been tangled as the war has shut ports in Ukraine and as companies refuse to buy some commodities from Russia. A U.S.-based trader said the Russia-bound ships are waiting in the Black Sea area for clearance to move to the Novorossiysk port in Russia's Krasnodar Krai area.
In addition to the Russian shipments, there are also three vessels with nearly 100,000 tonnes of sugar heading to Russia's neighbor Georgia, according to port movement data provided by shipping agencies in Brazil and information from sugar market traders.
Russia was expected to import only around 100,000 tonnes of sugar in the whole year from all suppliers, not just Brazil, according to data from the International Sugar Organization. Georgia was expected to import 130,000 tonnes.
""Well, all that sugar might land in Georgia, but then it will be sent to Russia,"" said a U.S.-based sugar trader.
Another sugar trader, based in Brazil, said the volumes are too high for a short period of time, both for Russia and for Georgia, saying buyers were probably looking to boost stocks. 
Shipments to both Russia and Georgia were loaded on vessels leaving Brazil, the world's largest sugar exporter, with three European food traders and one Brazilian company behind the deals: Sucden, Louis Dreyfus Co and Tereos in Europe, and Raizen in Brazil. 
Sucden is the largest player in those deals, with one vessel heading to Georgia and four ships going to Russia with a total amount of 188,250 tonnes of raw sugar. The company did not respond to questions about safety and payment for the cargoes.
Dreyfus said the vessel Pu Lan Hai, which left Brazil late in February declaring Russia as its destination, will now leave part of the load in Egypt and the remainder in Georgia. It declined to comment further.

Dreyfus, one of the world's largest commodities traders, said on March 4 it was stopping operations in Russia due to the conflict in Ukraine, which Moscow has called a ""special operation.""
Tereos said the vessel with 50,000 tonnes of sugar heading to Russia had been resold to another shipper and it is not in charge of that deal anymore. It says it complies with current European rules. Raizen declined to comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown and other Senate Democrats have asked government regulators to examine  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC)'s mortgage refinancing policies to ensure they do not discriminate against minority borrowers.
In letters to the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the lawmakers said the government should ensure Wells Fargo is complying with fair lending laws after a recent analysis found the bank approved less than half of mortgage refinancing applications from Black borrowers, while signing off on 72% of such requests from white applicants.
""The stark racial disparity in refinance approval rates at Wells Fargo raises questions about whether its mortgage systems and processes comply with all federal fair housing and fair lending laws and regulations,"" the group, which included influential Senators Dick Durbin and Elizabeth Warren, wrote.
The lawmakers said borrowers denied refinancing may have missed out on an opportunity to take advantage of record-low mortgage rates, leading to higher costs that could span decades, now that the Federal Reserve has begun to raise interest rates for the first time since 2018.
The letter references a Bloomberg News analysis that found Wells Fargo lagged its counterparts in approving refinancing applications from minority borrowers.

In addition to finding that the bank approved less than half of all refinancing applications from Black borrowers, the analysis found that just 53% of Hispanic applicants were approved in 2020. The average approval rate among all other lenders for Black and Hispanic applicants came in at 71% and 79%, respectively, according to Bloomberg's analysis.
A Wells Fargo spokesperson said in response to the letter that the bank complies with the law and works closely with regulators on ""our shared goal of decreasing the homeownership gap."" The bank previously told Bloomberg its own internal review determined the discrepancy was due to additional credit factors.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Russia laid down strict new rules for foreigners seeking permits to buy and sell Russian assets ranging from securities to real estate, a client memo by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) showed, raising fresh concerns Western investors could face large write-downs.
Russia temporarily stopped foreigners trading Russian assets this month, saying it wanted to ensure decisions to exit were considered and not driven by political pressure, following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
It has now revealed the details of an application process that must be followed before the Finance Ministry will decide if assets can be traded, including disclosure of any beneficiaries and strategic investments such as defence.
""Western investors are going to be highly agitated and deeply concerned,"" said Eric Schiffer, chief executive at California-based private equity firm Patriarch Organization and a specialist in risk management. ""This is likely one step of many future steps until Russia has clarity on its own financial security.""
Funds with tens of billions of dollars in exposure to Russia have been awaiting details on the restrictions they will face as they seek to offload assets, against a backdrop of increasing economic isolation for President Vladimir Putin.
""I don't think anyone in Russia dares tell Putin the financial problems that lie ahead,"" said Alastair Winter, a global investment strategist at Argyll Europe, predicting ""mass write-offs"" for many foreigners exposed to the country.
The invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise Ukraine, has triggered an exodus of international firms and has largely cut off Russia's economy from the rest of the world.
The Russian authorities published Decree 81 this month that stipulates that any transaction between Russians and foreign counterparties requires permission from Russia's Government Commission for Control of Foreign Investment.
Effectively this means foreign investors, who had acquired Russian stocks and bonds without restrictions, were left stuck with those holdings while the economy lurches from an enticing oil-rich investment destination to a financial pariah.
""Russian authorities have announced the order for obtaining permits to carry out operations determined by Decree 81. An authorised body empowered to take decisions on the issuance of permits has been established,"" the Citigroup memo says.
The process involves an application and related documents to be submitted to the Russian finance ministry, in the Russian language, containing ""information on the purpose, subject, content and essential conditions of the transaction.""
Applicants must also disclose full information on beneficiaries and beneficial owners, the memo says, as well as details on any investments in companies in a ""strategic sector"" such as aviation, space, production of natural resources or work with weapons or military equipment.
""This is just a mechanism to control which entities can transact foreign currencies and it won't be companies from hostile countries that are exiting the country,"" said one banking source about the rules.
Citigroup declined to comment beyond confirming the authenticity of the memo.

A second bank source said they had advised clients against trading under such terms, flagging fears about the sharing of sensitive data and the lack of transparency on application approvals or rejections. However, some investors will likely comply in the hope of avoiding losses, experts say.
""If you have the potential of losing all your assets versus sharing data, I think you'll have some that will want to consider it,"" said Patriarch's Schiffer.

LONDON (Reuters) -Investors scaled back their expectations for future Bank of England interest rate rises this year, sending British bond prices sharply higher, after the BoE hiked again on Thursday but softened its language about further tightening. 
The BoE has now raised interest rates at three successive meetings, taking Bank Rate back to its pre-pandemic level of 0.75%. On Thursday it changed its guidance to suggest further tightening ""might"" be needed, however, rather than being ""likely"" as in February.
While surging commodity prices fuelled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine are likely to cause inflation to peak higher than previously expected, it also increases the risk of an economic downturn, the BoE said.
Unlike in February, none of the nine Monetary Policy Committee members voted for a 50 basis point increase, and Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe opposed any change.
""The BoE still signals hikes ahead but also more caution,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) economist Robert Wood and bond strategist Agne Stengeryte wrote in a note to clients.
The BoE's message appeared calibrated to eliminate market bets that the central bank would raise rates by half a percentage point at a future meeting, they said. 
Last month four out of nine policymakers voted for such a move to tame inflation expectations, bigger than any rate increase by the British central bank since it gained operational independence in 1997.
Interest rate sensitive two-year gilt yields struck a one-month high of 1.472% moments before the BoE decision but later slumped by 20 basis points. 
At 1659 GMT the two-year yield was 10 basis points lower from Wednesday's close at 1.29%.
The intra-day fall was one of the biggest in two-year yields after any BoE decision. There were larger drops in November, when many investors had expected the BoE to start tightening policy, and in March 2020 when it announced an emergency 200 billion pounds of bond purchases as the COVID-19 pandemic began.
Benchmark 10-year gilt yields were 6 basis points down on the day at 1.57%.
Financial markets see a 91% chance that the BoE will raise rates to 1% at its next meeting in May - when inflation is set to reach 8% - and a 73% chance that they will reach 2% by the end of the year.

Before the meeting, markets had fully priced in rates of 1% in May and 2% in December, with a 50 basis point rate rise priced in for some point in the next three months.
Pantheon Macroeconomics' Samuel Tombs said the repricing of market interest rate expectations for the next six months was sharper than any in more than a decade except that in the wake of November's surprise decision.

Sentiment is rising for so-called secondary sanctions on any country or entity that helps Russia evade sanctions. On Thursday, Republican Senator Marco Rubio introduced a bill specifically aimed at Chinese financial institutions that conduct transactions with Russian entities through any alternative to the SWIFT financial messaging system.
“We cannot allow China to become a safe haven for Russian firms seeking to avoid international sanctions,” Rubio said in a statement. “My bill would make it nearly impossible for Chinese banks to access the U.S. financial system if they choose to transact with Russian banks using Chinese or Russian financial messaging systems.”

Rubio said the legislation is a “powerful” disincentive for China deepening its ties with Russia. It would impose sanctions on any Chinese financial institution that uses the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or CIPS, to help Russia evade sanctions.
Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said he has discussed the issue of secondary sanctions with President Joe Biden’s administration. Any such move by the U.S. should be done in coordination with European allies, he said.
The moves in Congress come as Biden is set to speak with China’s President Xi Jinping on Friday as the U.S. leader looks to shore up global pressure on Russia to halt its war in Ukraine. It will be their first call since November, and follows a meeting in Rome Monday between National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi. 
“The two leaders will discuss managing the competition between our two countries, as well as Russia’s war against Ukraine and other issues of mutual concern,” the White House said in a statement.
Biden to Speak With Xi Friday in Bid to Pressure Putin (2)
Lawmakers acknowledged that Xi could be one of the few people in the world capable of persuading Putin to pull back from Ukraine, though that’s tempered by skepticism that he would take that extraordinary step after publicly backing the Russian president in the weeks leading up to the invasion. 
“Could Xi be aggressive enough to convince him to do something different?” Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee said, referring to Putin. “Perhaps but I don’t think he’d do it.”
The CIPS system was set up in October 2015 as a settlement and payment clearing system for transactions that use the yuan, also known as the renminbi, or “people’s currency.” It is supervised by China’s central bank but is run by CIPS Co. Ltd in Shanghai, with ownership spread among dozens of shareholders including state-owned Chinese financial institutions, exchanges and Western banks. While the system handles only a fraction of global financial transactions, lawmakers worry it could become a back door for Russian banks and oligarchs to transfer money out of the country.

LONDON (Reuters) -The Bank of England raised interest rates again on Thursday in a bid to stop fast-rising inflation becoming entrenched, but it softened its language on the need for more increases as households face a huge hit from soaring energy bills.
Eight of the nine Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members voted to raise Bank Rate to 0.75% from 0.5%, taking the benchmark for UK borrowing costs back to its pre-pandemic level.
BoE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe was the sole advocate of keeping rates on hold, warning of a big hit to demand from higher commodity prices. 
On Wednesday the U.S. Federal Reserve also raised interest rates, the first time it had done so since the COVID-19 pandemic, and signalled an aggressive plan for more hikes to come, a contrast to the BoE's more cautious approach.
The British central bank has now raised rates at three consecutive meetings for the first time since 1997. 
But investors were surprised no policymakers opted for a 50 basis point hike, after four did so last month. Most economists polled by Reuters had not expected any votes for rates to stay unchanged.
""The MPC struck an unambiguously dovish tone today, contrasting sharply with the predominant market narrative and the reasoning of both the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve,"" Citi economist Benjamin Nabarro said.
The BoE said inflation was set to reach around 8% in April -- almost a percentage point more than it forecast last month and four times its 2% target -- and warned it could peak even higher later in the year.
Soaring energy bills, driven up by the conflict in Ukraine, meant the pressure on British household budgets was likely to be much bigger than the record 30-year squeeze which the BoE predicted last month.
Reflecting these worries about the outlook for growth, policymakers on Thursday pushed back against investors' bets that Bank Rate will rise sharply to around 2% by the end of this year, toning down its language on the need for more hikes.
""The Committee judged that some further modest tightening might be appropriate in the coming months, but there were risks on both sides of that judgement depending on how medium-term prospects evolved,"" the BoE said.
Last month the MPC said further modest tightening ""is likely to be appropriate"".
STALLED CYCLE?
The pound slumped almost a cent against the dollar and British government bond prices jumped as investors trimmed their bets that the BoE would raise rates rapidly this year. 
Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said an end to BoE rate hikes was in sight.
""Today's minutes leave us more confident in our view that the rate hiking cycle will stall after the Committee increases Bank Rate to 1.00%, most likely at the next meeting in May,"" he said.
Tombs pointed out that the drop in Bank Rate expectations in the futures market was the second-biggest since records stared in 2009, behind only November's rate decision, when the BoE surprised many investors by keeping rates on hold.
The BoE said inflation expectations remained well-anchored. But the majority of the MPC said they needed to raise rates now to reduce the risk that recent trends in pay growth and prices push up long-term inflation expectations. 
Businesses surveyed by the BoE expect to raise pay by 4%-6% this year, compared with 2.5%-3.5% in 2021.
The BoE said Russia's invasion of Ukraine was likely to cause global inflation pressures to strengthen considerably in the coming months and add to supply chain disruptions.

Some analysts said the BoE had gone soft on inflation.
""What the MPC has done today, in concluding that the war in Ukraine generates two-sided risks to growth, is put itself even further behind the inflation curve,"" said Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A commodities rally sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine will push Canadian inflation higher for longer, with the headline rate now seen peaking at or above 6%, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates more aggressively, economists told Reuters.
Canada's inflation rate has already surged well above the 5.1% that the Bank of Canada forecast for the first quarter in January, highlighting the tough road ahead to get price growth back down to the 2% target. 
Graphic: Canada's annual inflation rate: https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-ECONOMY/INFLATION/egpbkqrxrvq/chart.png 
The central bank will have to balance efforts to tamp down on soaring prices against the risks that spiraling levels of mortgage debt could make Canada's economy more sensitive to interest rate hikes than before the coronavirus pandemic. 
Some investors worry that the BoC could cut short the economic expansion if it tightens too fast. 
A Reuters survey of economists at five leading financial institutions and a consultancy showed that most now expect the Bank of Canada to hike borrowing costs four to five times in 2022, lifting its policy rate to 1.25% or 1.5% by the end of the year. Scotiabank is forecasting a year-end policy rate of 2.5%. 
Canada's latest inflation data on Wednesday surprised on the upside, with the Consumer Price Index hitting a new 30-year high of 5.7% in February. The jump was driven by broad gains across all sectors.
All six economists surveyed now see inflation peaking at or above 6% in the coming months, with their year-end forecasts ranging from 3.3% to 5.8%. The BoC in January forecast fourth-quarter inflation of 3.0%.
""The commodity price increases that we have seen in the past couple of weeks - that's something that a central bank would normally want to look through,"" said Josh Nye, a senior economist at RBC Capital Markets who was among those surveyed. 
""But with inflation already so far above the Bank of Canada's target, they've said they're more concerned about upside surprises than they are about downside surprises on inflation.""
CATCHING UP
The central bank raised its policy rate to 0.50% from 0.25% this month, its first increase in three years. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said more rate hikes were coming and he left the door open to a rare half-percentage-point increase.
Money markets see a roughly 50% chance of the larger rate increase when the central bank issues its next policy decision on April 13. It has been almost 22 years since Canada saw a 50-basis-point rate hike. 
The conflict in Ukraine and ensuing sanctions on Russia have played havoc with global supply chains, sending prices of many key commodities higher. Russia is one of the world's biggest energy producers, and both it and Ukraine are among the top exporters of grain.
Nye estimated the surge in oil prices since late February on its own will add about three-quarters of a percentage point to Canada's CPI.
U.S. inflation is expected to average 7.7% this quarter, according to a Reuters poll of 69 economists last week, up from the 7.1% forecast in February.
With Canada's economy firing on all cylinders, its central bank must now act forcefully on interest rates to tame price surges, said Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank.
""Given how far behind the inflation curve the Bank of Canada finds itself, they need to do something more convincing in order to demonstrate that they are serious about their inflation mandate,"" said Holt, who also participated in the survey. 
Still, the central bank will need to take into account the potential that war will slow global economic activity, while also balancing the inflationary pressures coming from supply shortages due to the latest COVID-19 restrictions in major Chinese manufacturing hubs.

""There is the probability of renewed supply chain issues in other goods that will also keep inflation more elevated than we previously anticipated,"" said Andrew Grantham, a senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets who was among those surveyed.

57,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 12:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Just one day after the Federal Reserve kicked off its cycle of interest-rate increases, traders are speculating the central bank will start easing monetary policy again in less than three years.
The implied yield on December 2024 eurodollar futures is 2.39%, or 28 basis below the year-earlier contracts, indicating that traders expect the Fed’s benchmark rate will be cut over that time. The gap was 0.2% on Tuesday before the Fed policy meeting and was at zero as recently as in February.
The pricing reflects the risk that a series of aggressive interest-rate hikes aimed at slowing inflation will weaken economic growth or even tip the economy into a recession. That concern is evident in the Treasury market, where the gap between 5- and 10-year yields has collapsed, signaling expectations that growth will slow. 
The Fed boosted its key rate to a target range of 0.25% to 0.5% Wednesday. In its so-called dot plot, officials’ median projection was for the benchmark rate to be increased to 1.9% by the end of 2022, hit about 2.8% in 2023 and remain steady in 2024.

LONDON (Reuters) - Demand for sustainable stock funds waned in February as Russia's invasion of Ukraine hit investor sentiment and higher gas prices and energy security fears bolstered the appeal of the traditional Oil & Gas sector. 
Interest in environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues such as climate change has surged in recent years, leading many investors to avoid the high carbon-emitting energy sector, but this got a boost after the conflict began in late February.
While the STOXX Europe 600 fell 3.4%, the Oil & Gas sector rose 0.8%, buoyed by a 10.8% gain in Brent crude futures and a 15% gain in European natural gas prices.
Equity ESG funds, which make up the bulk of funds focused on sustainable investing, saw a 60% slowdown in inflows to $9.4 billion during the month, Refinitiv data showed, compared with inflows of $24.4 billion in the prior month. 
Graphic: Flows into ESG equity funds vs non-ESG equity funds: https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/byvrjeggnve/chart.png 
Total flows across all equity funds, meanwhile, slowed to $56.7 billion from $65.4 billion, for a 13% drop.
""The Russian invasion of Ukraine has put ESG investing on the backfoot, as energy security has taken centre stage over carbon intensity,"" said Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell Investments.
""Continuing use of coal power, which was unthinkable only a few weeks ago, is now on the agenda across Europe, and the rising price of oil and gas might have persuaded some ESG investors who were in it for the profits, that there may yet be some life left in traditional energy sectors.""
Total assets under management in equity ESG funds stood at $3.2 trillion at the end of February, down 9.3% since the start of the year.
""In the longer term the policy winds are still prevailing in the direction of renewables, but the Ukraine crisis has definitely prompted a recalibration of governmental priorities when it comes to energy,"" Khalaf said. 
Graphic: Global equity ESG funds' asset size: https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/gdpzybxzkvw/chart.png 
After posting a record gain of 47% last year, the MSCI World ESG Leaders' index has fallen 9.8% so far this year to underperform the MSCI World index's decline of 9.4%. 
Otto Christian Kober, director at Refinitiv Lipper, said the negative performance for favoured ESG stocks in February was also due to a rise in geopolitical risks. 

""The outlook for investors pouring in new money into these fund types will strongly depend on turning market trends and (an) easing of geopolitical risks,"" he said.

59,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 11:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will be in no hurry to raise interest rates and any move will be gradual, ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Thursday, even as another policymaker made the case for one and possibly two rate moves later this year. 
Speaking just a week after accelerating the ECB's exit from unconventional stimulus, Lagarde said the decision gives the ECB ""extra space"" between the planned end of its money-printing programme this summer and the first interest rate hike in more than a decade. 
Investors were ramping up their bets on higher ECB rates after the Federal Reserve raised the cost of borrowing late on Wednesday, tightening its stance for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic and despite uncertainty stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [GVD/EUR]
Central banks worldwide have been caught on the hop by a surge in inflation, which hit 5.9% in the 19-nation euro zone last month after spending most of the last decade below the ECB's 2% target.
But, in a repeat of last week's message, Lagarde said that any increase in the ECB policy rate will be gradual and come only ""some time"" after its bond-buying programme ends, now slated for sometime in the third quarter.
""This maintains our traditional sequencing logic, but also gives us extra space if needed after we stop purchasing bonds and before we take the next step towards normalisation,"" she told a conference in Frankfurt.
Money markets were pricing in increases worth nearly 50 basis points to the ECB's deposit rate by the end of this year, which would take it back to zero after eight years in negative territory.
But even one of the most conservative members of the ECB's Governing Council, Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot, said he anticipates only one rate hike this year after the central bank brings its bond purchases to an end as early as July.
""A rate hike in the fourth quarter to me still is a realistic expectation,"" Knot said at another event, adding that two increases could not be ruled out if inflation forecasts are raised again.
The ECB said last week it expected inflation to come in at 5.1% this year, 2.1% the next and 1.9% in 2024. 
But Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco said those forecasts were already out of date as the outlook had ""severely worsened"" since their cut-off date on Feb. 28.
""I think households will be hard hit by energy and food price shock, particularly those in the low income brackets,"" said Visco, a so-called ""dove"" favouring easier monetary policy.
The ECB has said it needs to be confident that inflation in the euro zone, including core measures that exclude volatile components such as energy and food prices, stabilises at 2% before raising rates.
Speaking after Lagarde, the ECB's chief economist Philip Lane said core inflation, which came in at 2.9% in February, would likely fade over time as fuel costs level off.
Lane estimated that around 80 basis points of core or underlying inflation was purely down to the energy price shock. 
He added that market-based expectations of long-term inflation, which hit 2.3% earlier this week, were actually still below the ECB's goal once the risk premium - or compensation demanded by investors at times of uncertainty - was taken out. 

Lagarde added that the ECB could devise new tools to ensure monetary policy reaches all corners of the euro zone even as it winds down its bond purchases.
These have helped cap the spread between the borrowing costs paid by top-rated Germany and those of indebted countries like Italy and Greece.

SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's stance on Russia's war in Ukraine over the coming months will reshape global flows of money and trade, possibly leading to the emergence of new economic spheres, investors say.
Last month, shortly before Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his forces into Ukraine, he and Chinese President Xi Jinping declared in Beijing a ""no limits"" partnership, with a promise to collaborate more against the West.
Beijing has declined to join Western countries in condemning what Moscow calls a 'special military operation' while also calling for restraint on all sides.
Sino-Russian trade surged 35% in 2021 to $146.9 billion, Chinese customs data show, a trend likely to be turbo-charged by sweeping new sanctions that cut Russia from Western markets.
A shift in trade flows has been brewing since Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, said Tom James, chief executive of TradeFlow Capital Management in Singapore, a trade finance fund.
""Russia has already started trading in renminbi with China,"" he said, adding that banks can deal with each other outside the SWIFT network - from which Moscow is now blocked - and Beijing could benefit greatly, though not without risks.
Just over a quarter of Chinese exports to Russia were settled in yuan in the first half of 2021, up from just 2% in 2013, as both countries seek to cut reliance on the dollar.
""The X-factor is tariffs and sanctions or quotas, if they're placed, in terms of how much Russian produce countries are willing to take,"" James said. ""It's already triggering something of a protectionism from countries for food security.""
PRESSURE
Financial markets have been gyrating on worries that a Russia-China bloc could face U.S. retaliation, with Chinese equities among the worst performers since the invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24.
China's onshore Shanghai Composite index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng have each lost about 6% since the start of the war. That compares with a gain of about 1% for global equities and 1.6% for the S&P 500.
China's hitherto steady currency has also started to show flashes of vulnerability and volatility and on Tuesday hit a three-month low.
""The pressure is very big at the moment,"" one Chinese government adviser told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
""It's pragmatic to buy some oil and gas from Russia, but everybody is watching you,"" he said. ""We don't want to upset Russia, but at the same time it's difficult not to side with the majority of countries.""
And China's trade with Russia is dwarfed by what it conducts with Western countries. China's trade last month totalled $137 billion with the European Union and $123.3 billion with the United States, but just $26.4 billion with Russia.
Asked about the risks Beijing might face if it provides economic help to Moscow, including sanctions blowback, China's foreign ministry told Reuters in a statement: ""China and Russia will continue to carry out normal economic and trade cooperation in a spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.""
But stress to global trade resulting from the war is already apparent in export bans and supply chain snarls.
Materials from Indonesian coal to Egyptian pulses and vegoils are unavailable for foreign sale.
Food buyers are scrambling for rice to replace Ukrainian and Russian wheat, a fertiliser shortage looms as the world is cut off from Russian potash - a key ingredient - and there seems to be little momentum to repair the globalised system.
In its place are hints at a new order where Russia's commodity and energy exports find markets in China and India while Australian minerals and gas end up in Europe.
CAUTION
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Jonathan Garner said in a recent podcast he was more cautious on India and China and was seeking exposure to Australia as an exporter aligned with sources of global capital and thus less prone to its withdrawal.
India, meanwhile, a buyer of Russian military hardware, is mulling an offer for cheap Russian crude and, according to banking sources, is exploring setting up a payment mechanism for rupee-rouble trade.
Decisions in China, the world's biggest exporter, have the potential to drive sizeable flows of money and goods outside a dollar-dominated system - something Beijing has sought to do for a decade.
""In essence they're creating their own operating platform which is different to the past 70 years...of the U.S.-led global capital system,"" said George Boubouras, head of research at K2 Asset Management which invests globally from Melbourne.
This week the Wall Street Journal reported that talks between China and Saudi Arabia about trading oil for yuan rather than dollars had accelerated, perhaps a step forward in the efforts to promote the yuan as a trade and reserve currency.
Reuters was unable to confirm the report.
However, China keeps a tight leash on the yuan and its takeup as a reserve currency remains modest.
Most market participants also doubt that China would suffer any sudden exclusion from its Western export markets, but there is a distinct flavour of epochal change in market commentary.
""When this crisis (and war) is over, the U.S. dollar should be much weaker and on the flipside, the renminbi much stronger,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) strategist Zoltan Pozsar said in a note outlining a ""regime shift"" as China buys Russian commodities.

Diego Parrilla, who manages Quadriga Igneo, a $150 million fund designed to profit in turmoil, takes a very different view, and is wagering that the yuan falls as trade fragments and China prints or borrows more and more to support its economy. 
""There is no return from here. Russia is heading East, not West... I think globalisation as we know it is finished, and we are in a de-facto bipolar world,"" he said.

61,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 11:26AM ET</span>","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Europe's effort to wean its economy off Russian gas is likely to be a persistent boost to inflation even beyond the current spike, European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel said on Thursday.
After Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month, European Union leaders agreed to accelerate the bloc's green transition, heralding an abundance of investment in renewable energy. 
In the foreseeable future, the conflict is likely to remain a key contributor to inflation, as any marked decline in fossil energy prices seems unlikely, Schnabel said in a speech to a financial conference. 
But even beyond the current conflict, prices are likely to rise as the transition creates a huge investment need that is likely to fuel a persistent positive demand shock, which normally generates inflation.
""Such indirect effects of higher energy prices can be a persistent source of upward pressure on underlying inflation,"" Schnabel said.
""They are not a one-off price shock that policymakers can simply look through, in particular when pipeline pressures are continuing to build up, like today,"" she added.
But Schnabel also played down concerns about the central bank's powers in acting to temper price growth during such a boom. 
In the current environment, ECB tightening to combat high inflation would curb demand, just as high energy prices are already sapping household purchasing power, leaving policymakers with a dilemma. 

But the green transition beyond the current shock is more a classical, demand-driven inflation scenario, and the ECB has the tools to temper that, Schnabel said.
""Greenflation is much more likely to be the result of a strong and persistent positive demand shock, or investment boom, that re-establishes the 'divine coincidence' of monetary policy – that is, the ability of central banks to stabilise inflation and output simultaneously,"" Schnabel said.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's macroeconomic fundamentals remain strong but the unfolding global developments pose downside risks in terms of spillover, the Reserve Bank of India said in its monthly bulletin on Thursday.
""The ongoing geopolitical crisis has heightened the uncertainty clouding the global macroeconomic and financial landscape even as the world economy struggles to recover from the pandemic,"" the RBI wrote, adding that the uncertain economic outlook has increased risks to emerging economies.
Even though India is making steady progress on the domestic front, the spiralling oil and gas prices and unsettled financial market conditions also pose fresh headwinds to the still incomplete global recovery, it observed.
The RBI also said that a rapid and large withdrawal of fiscal support risks pushing the economy over the cliff into a sharp downturn.
""Exiting policy makers have to contend with the razor’s edge trade-off between cliffs and ramps,"" RBI added.
It has continued with the accommodative stance even as inflation has inched up and had left the key lending rate unchanged, keeping it at record lows in the last central bank policy announcement held in February.
RBI once again highlighted the risks emanating from virtual currencies and noted that crypto technology is underpinned by a philosophy to evade government controls and threaten the financial sovereignty of a country and make it susceptible to strategic manipulation.

""They can (and if allowed most likely will) wreck the currency system, the monetary authority, the banking system, and in general government’s ability to control the economy,"" RBI wrote.
Last month, the central bank had delivered a stark warning against investing in cryptocurrencies and had compared it to Ponzi schemes, adding that they should be banned.

U.S. consumers exposed to a surge in energy costs due to the war in Ukraine may need targeted support that would delay fiscal consolidation, according to the chief economist of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
Speaking in an interview on Bloomberg Television, Laurence Boone said some lower-income households are particularly exposed to food and energy that account for between 30% and 50% of their purchases. 
“These very high energy and food prices mean that some consumers, some households will be hurt, and those households, they need to be supported,” she said. “If there is this fiscal-targeted support measure for these people, then perhaps fiscal consolidation in the U.S. will be delayed a little.”
The economist’s message follows the OECD’s assessment of the economic impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier on Thursday, in which its officials put the onus of the policy response to the crisis on governments rather than central banks. 
Boone said support for households would in fact make it easier for the Federal Reserve to continue moving “in the direction that it should” as the recovery from Covid is strong, unemployment is low and prices pressures are broad-based.
“This is a moment for fiscal policy makers,” she said. “That will also actually help inflation to be kept in check by lowering the wage-price spiral.”

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has darkened the outlook for the global economy by causing a surge in energy and food prices that spells more pain for consumers and businesses.
So while many are focused on containing inflation, they are also wary of the fallout from the conflict. Here's a look at where policymakers stand on the path out of pandemic-era stimulus, ranked in terms of hawkishness.

1) NORWAY
Norway started its rates lift-off in September and hiked its key rates again in December, to 0.5%.
Norges Bank is expected to hike again on March 24. Nordea expects four rate hikes this year.
2) NEW ZEALAND 
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand last month raised its key rate by 25 basis points to 1% and forecast a higher peak in the tightening cycle. 
It has said more work needs to be done to control inflation and that it's too early to assess the impact, if any, of the Russian invasion on policy -- a reminder that the central bank is one of the most hawkish among developed countries.
Markets are confident of a 0.5% increase in April, and expect rates to hit 2.75% by year-end.

3) BRITAIN
The Bank of England raised its key rate by 25 bps to 0.75% on Thursday in its third straight increase. But with the economy facing a hit from soaring energy prices, it softened its language on the need for further increases.
The pound slumped almost a cent against the dollar and British government bond yields fell sharply as investors trimmed their bets that the BoE would raise rates rapidly this year.

The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday hiked its key rate by a quarter point to a range of 0.25%-0.5% and laid out an aggressive plan to tighten monetary policy in a bid to tame inflation, running at almost 8%.
Most policymakers now see the federal funds rate rising to a range between 1.75% and 2% by the end of 2022, the equivalent of a quarter-percentage-point rate increase at each of the Fed's six remaining policy meetings this year.
May is now seen by analysts as a ""live date"" to start unwinding quantitative easing.

On March 2, the Bank of Canada raised its key rate by a quarter point to 0.5%, the first rate rise since October 2018.
Global uncertainty is unlikely to sway it from its battle to contain inflation running at 30-year highs. BoC chief Tiff Macklem says there is ""considerable space"" left to hike rates this year and doesn't rule out a 50 bps move.

6) AUSTRALIA
The Reserve Bank of Australia kept rates at a record low 0.1% at its March 1 meeting, citing the Ukraine crisis as a new source of uncertainty.
After ending its bond-buying scheme last month, the RBA has pushed back against expectations for an early rate rise. Its dovish stance has been cemented by the war, even though the economy is growing faster than predicted. 
7) EURO ZONE 
The ECB plans to end asset purchases in the third quarter, accelerating its exit from extraordinary stimulus, predicting inflation to average 5.1% in 2022, more than double its target.
The Russia conflict is expected to have a ""material impact"" on economic activity, and the ECB believes any interest rate adjustments will take place ""some time"" after the end of asset buys. They would be ""gradual"", it added.
Markets are pricing in almost 50 bps of tightening by year-end, equivalent to five 10-bps hikes.

Surging inflation means that Sweden's central bank may need to bring forward its first rate hike since the pandemic began, Governor Stefan Ingves said on Wednesday.
Headline inflation hit 4.5% in February and, excluding volatile energy prices, was running at 3.4% - it's highest level since 1993.
Sweden's Riksbank has pencilled in a rate hike for 2024, which Ingves says might be a ""bit too far off."" Economists expect as many as two rate hikes this year.
9) JAPAN
Japan is unlikely to see inflation hitting its central bank target of 2%, even accounting for rising energy costs, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Thursday, making the case for keeping monetary policy ultra-easy.
The BOJ's dovish stance makes it an outlier as more of its central bank peers eye rate rises.

10) SWITZERLAND 
The Swiss National Bank remains at the dovish end of the spectrum, seeing its stance as appropriate even with inflation hitting 2.2% in February, the highest since 2008.
Safety-seeking flows sparked by the Ukraine conflict have pushed the Swiss franc to its strongest levels against the euro since January 2015, when the SNB scrapped its currency peg. 

While franc strength helps contain inflation, the pace of the move has caused unease, prompting a rare verbal intervention from the SNB about the franc.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's secretive banks hold up to $213 billion of Russian wealth, the country's financial industry association estimates, as sanctions on Russia give a rare glimpse inside Swiss vaults.
The Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) estimated that the banks hold between 150 billion and 200 billion Swiss francs ($213 billion) of Russian client money in offshore accounts.
This indicates that the extent of wealthy Russians' business with banks in Switzerland, the world's biggest centre for offshore wealth, is far more extensive than the on-balance sheet exposures several of its financial firms have begun to detail.
The SBA's revelation is rare for Switzerland, which has stone-walled many previous transparency requests, and comes as it took the unusual step of applying European Union sanctions to Russian cash following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last month.
There is growing Swiss public debate about its role, with Mattea Meyer, co-president of the Social Democrats, calling for Switzerland to clamp down on any cash belonging to Russians close to President Vladimir Putin and his government.
""Part belongs to oligarchs loyal to the Kremlin. The money and their activity ... helps finance the war,"" she said, adding that Switzerland ""must do everything possible to turn off the money taps"".
The SBA estimate, which dwarfs initial indications of the credit exposure to Russia, makes clear the scale of the task of imposing sanctions, such as by freezing the cash.
The Swiss economy ministry said that it had no meaningful estimates on frozen Russian assets as it tallies reports from banks facing a growing Swiss sanctions list.
Despite its Russian tally estimate, the SBA stressed that this was small compared to overall assets held in Switzerland, which has been regarded by generations of wealthy individuals from around the world as a safe haven for their money. 
""The share of assets held for Russian clients likely accounts for a share in the low single-digit percentage range of the total cross-border assets deposited with Swiss banks,"" it said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Wednesday, referring to money held for clients residing abroad. 
RUSSIAN RISK
As Western governments unleash a growing list of sanctions in response to Russia's invasion, banks are seeing their business with Russian clients scrutinized far beyond the loans they have granted or business done out of Russian subsidiaries that could lead to balance sheet losses.
Analysts have said direct Swiss bank exposures to Russian clients look manageable, based on what has been made public.
Switzerland's two biggest banks last week detailed ""limited"" exposures to Russia, with the largest UBS saying a $634 million direct exposure had been cut since year-end. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein on Tuesday said some 4% of the assets Switzerland's second-biggest bank manages for wealthy clients belong to Russians, amounting to tens of billions of dollars. 
That is far greater than the 848 million Swiss franc net credit exposure in Credit Suisse's annual report.
While the bank has not provided an updated tally, it managed 827 billion francs in its wealth management businesses at end-2021, so 4% would amount to some 33 billion Swiss francs in assets associated with Russian customers.
UBS and Switzerland's third-largest listed lender, Julius Baer, have declined to detail assets they hold for Russian customers, but UBS CEO Ralph Hamers indicated sanctions were keeping the country's biggest bank busy.

""New lists come out every night,"" he said, adding that UBS was looking to shield not only against current compliance but also against the risk of future penalties.

In a new policy statement marking the end of its full-on battle against the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. central bank flagged the massive uncertainty the economy faces from the war in Ukraine and the ongoing health crisis, but still said ""ongoing increases"" in the target federal funds rate ""will be appropriate"" to curb the highest inflation in 40 years.

""The Fed followed through today on what was already assumed to be a foregone conclusion, by raising the federal funds rate by a quarter-percent. This is likely only the first step in a larger campaign of policy normalization from the Fed, as it seeks to rein in hotter-than-normal inflation.
""The press release introduced fresh language highlighting the uncertainty prompted by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, noting that “the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.” The war in Eastern Europe is unlikely to halt the Fed’s tightening plans, but it may prompt caution on the speed of rate hikes as the economic effects of the conflict become better understood.
JOSEPH LAVORGNA, AMERICAS CHIEF ECONOMIST, NATIXIS, NEW YORK
“The Fed is reacting to the market's fear of inflation. So, they validated expectations of seven hikes this year. 
“They’re going to try to be aggressive here in raising rates. I wish Jay Powell and company all the best of luck because they're not going to get anywhere near as they think, unless they’re willing to throw a lot of people out of jobs, because that's what's going to happen.  Because we're going to have a recession. This is a recession forecast.
“This is magical forecasting. I don’t think it holds up to historical scrutiny. You got a weakening economy, and you are going to take rates well above where they say neutral is. Neutral is lower than where they believe it is. I just don't see the Fed being able to engineer this kind of tightening for what right now is inflationary demand destruction. 
PAUL ASHWORTH, CHIEF US ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS, TORONTO (via email)
""The Fed began its tightening cycle with a 25bp hike today and, despite the uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine and China's efforts to contain the spread of the Omicron variant, officials look set to hike rates by an additional 25bp at each of the remaining six policy meetings this year, which would take the fed funds target range to between 1.75% and 2.00%. As the statement put it ""ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate"". The pace of tightening is then expected to slow, with the median projection pointing to a 25bp rate hike at every other meeting next year, taking the target range to between 2.75% and 3.00% by end-2023. That would take the policy rate slightly above the median estimate of the neutral rate, which was lowered very slightly to 2.4%. Even after the rally in rate expectations in recent days, the Fed's own projections are on the hawkish side. 
HINESH PATEL, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, QUILTER INVESTORS, LONDON 
“It is early days in the hiking program, but we finally have lift off at the Federal Reserve. Despite being behind the likes of the Bank of England this has been a very well telegraphed and managed rate rise, even with the threats of Omicron, China’s regulatory crackdown and now the knock on effects of the war in Ukraine.
“None of these threats, however, are resolved by monetary policy and with the inflation shock reverberating around the system the Fed needs to move back to normalcy, at least to build in some insurance for when easing will once again be required in the future.”
SCOTT LADNER, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HORIZON INVESTMENTS, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA
“What is driving it down is really the aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve. The one key thing the Fed is forecasting is to push interest rates above neutral and every time interest rates go above neutral, the economy tips into recession sometime after that.”
“This looks like a Fed that is intending on causing recession in order to stamp out the inflation problem and that is as short sighted as calling inflation transitory a year ago.”
“What they're reacting to isn't the 25 basis point rate hike that was well telegraphed and fairly well expected, what they’re really reacting to is the new dot plot from the Fed showing that they anticipate also seven rate hikes this year.”
ROBERT PAVLIK, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, DAKOTA WEALTH MANAGEMENT, FAIRFIELD, CONNECTICUT 
“It was pretty much right in line with what the market expected.”
“What we were seeing heading into this is buy the rumor, and now we are seeing a little bit of sell the news.”

“It’s really going to be a focus on how many interest rate hikes are these Fed (officials) forecasting this year and how fast are they going to roll off the balance sheet.”

70,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 08:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England raised its key interest rate for the third successive meeting, taking borrowing costs back to their pre-pandemic level and warning the war in Ukraine may push inflation well above 8% later this year.
The increase to 0.75%, was backed by eight of the bank’s nine policy makers, with Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe voting for no change. It marks the quickest pace of tightening since 1997, just after the BOE won the authority to set policy independently. 
The central bank said inflation now looked set to climb to around 8% in the second quarter, up from 7.25% previously. It warned the peak rate later this year could be “several percentage points higher” than estimated in February. 
Officials led by Governor Andrew Bailey said a further tightening of policy “might be” appropriate in the coming months, a softening from the wording in February, when they said such a move was “likely.” They also noted “there were risks on both sides of that judgment.”
The spike in inflation means the squeeze on households incomes in the U.K. will be “materially larger” than implied in February, the BOE said. It also warned that the war in Ukraine will exacerbate global supply chain disruptions and said its regional agents found evidence it’s already snarling supply chains for manufacturers. 
The squeeze on incomes will lead to a weaker outlook for growth and raise unemployment, officials said. Cunliffe in voting to leave rates unchanged focused on that dynamic and concerns about the “very material negative impacts” that higher commodity prices will have on living standards.
For the rest of the committee, robust growth in recent months and a continued tightening in the labor market warranted a move. They said that job shortages were unlikely to ease as quickly as had been expected in February.
The decision suggests policy makers expect an increasingly delicate balancing act in the coming months as they weigh both how to combat inflation and the growing threats to growth from the impact of the war in Ukraine.
Further out, the BOE also said inflation will “fall back materially,” a comment that, combined with the gloomy outlook for living standards, suggests a degree of pushback against current market pricing for rates to hit 2% by the end of the year.
For now, the BOE is leading the way in a global tightening of monetary policy, and is the first major institution to bring rates back to their pre-covid setting. The BOE decision came just hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point and signaled six more such hikes this year.

Investing.com -- The global rally in stocks faded as analysts expressed skepticism at the assumptions behind the Federal Reserve's guidance. The Bank of England is expected to follow the Fed in hiking later. The war in Ukraine escalated, as Russia sends reinforcements from thousands of miles away to replace its combat losses. Jobless claims and housing starts data are due, and oil is back at $100. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 17th March.
1. Fed rally fades; jobless claims, housing starts due
Global markets struggled to extend the gains they made in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise U.S. interest rates for the first time in three years, amid skepticism at the assumptions behind the central bank’s guidance.
The Fed’s ‘dot-plot’ of expected rates over the next three years foresees at least another six quarter-point raises, but its economic analysis foresees no real rise in the jobless rate – something that would be a contrast with previous tightening cycles.
In the bond markets, the U.S. yield curve flattened markedly, a movement that usually heralds an economic slowdown ahead. That’s unlikely to be reflected much in today’s data, however, which should reflect continued strong growth. In addition to weekly jobless claims, and housing starts, and building permits data for February at 8:30 AM ET, there will be industrial production at 9:15 AM ET, as well as the Philadelphia Fed’s monthly business survey.
2. War rhetoric escalates; Russia says it made payment on debt
The war in Ukraine escalated, despite ongoing ceasefire talks, as the U.S. agreed to send an extra $1 billion in military assistance to resist the Russian invasion. U.S. President Joe Biden called Russia’s Vladimir Putin a ‘war criminal’, something that – by definition – will make negotiating with his regime harder.
Putin responded with a televised attack on domestic resistance to his war, calling his opponents ‘scum and traitors’ and saying that he looked forward to a ‘healthy and necessary cleansing’ of Russian society. The newspaper Vedomosti reported that demand for flights out of Russia rose by 650% year-on-year in the three weeks since the war started, with 65% of the flights booked being one-way.
Open-source video footage suggests that Russia is now moving large-scale reinforcements to Ukraine from the Far East and the Caucasus.
Western hopes to convince China and India to join the condemnation of Russia’s attack were again thwarted, with China angrily rebutting suggestions by Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that it was ignoring the UN charter by its support for Russia.
Elsewhere, Russia’s central bank said it had made an interest payment on the country’s foreign debt, but there has still been no confirmation from bondholders that they have been paid in dollars, as required.
3. Stocks set to open lower as yield curve flattens
U.S. stocks are set to open lower later, with Wednesday’s relief rally quickly running out of gas.
By 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 146 points, or 0.4%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.6%.
The Dow had risen 1.6% on Wednesday in response to the Fed’s decision and guidance, while the S&P had risen 2.2% and the Nasdaq Composite 3.8%.
In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year yield fell to 2.12%, having risen as high as 2.24% on Wednesday.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Dollar General (NYSE:DG), which report earnings early, while FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reports after the close.
4. Bank of England set to hike again
The central bank action continues worldwide, with the Bank of England widely expected to raise its key rate by 0.25% later. That will be the third straight hike in as many meetings for the BoE which, like the Fed, faces overshooting inflation and a hot labor market.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned in a keynote speech that the war in Ukraine could start dangerous new inflationary trends, but again stressed that any interest rate hikes from the ECB would be measured and gradual.
The European economy is under much greater pressure from the war than the U.S., with energy prices having surged and disruptions to vital industrial inputs from Russia and Ukraine causing plants in sectors such as chip-making and car-making to be suspended. EU car sales fell 6.7% in February, a record low, even before the impact of the war was felt.
Elsewhere, the Brazilian central bank followed the Fed’s action by raising its key rate a full percentage point on Wednesday.
5. Oil back at $100; nickel turmoil continues
Crude oil prices rebounded as the prospects for a quick peace in Ukraine appeared to dissipate.
By 6:25 AM ET, U.S. crude was back at $99.42 a barrel, up 4.6% on the day, while Brent futures were up 4.7% at $102.51 a barrel.
On Wednesday, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned empty-handed from a trip to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where he had hoped to persuade their two governments to increase oil output.
Other commodity markets also continued to show volatility, with the London Metals Exchange again forced to suspend trading in Nickel Futures almost immediately after reopening."
74,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 06:21AM ET</span>","PARIS (Reuters) - The Ukraine crisis could knock more than a percentage point off global growth this year and add two and a half percentage points to inflation, the OECD estimated on Thursday, calling for targeted government spending hikes in response.
Well-targeted increases in government spending by OECD countries of the order of 0.5% of GDP could reduce the war's economic impact by around half without significantly adding to inflation, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.
With Europe strongly dependent on Russian energy imports, the negative impact of the war to the euro zone economy could be as much as 1.4% while in the United States it would be about 0.9%, the OECD estimated in an analysis of the economic fallout of the war.
Although Russia and Ukraine make up only 2% global GDP, they have an outsized impact on the energy and commodities markets as major producers of raw materials used in everything from catalytic converters for cars to fertilisers.
As energy and commodity price spikes put new pressure on already surging inflation, the OECD said that central banks should focus on normalising monetary policy although a slower pace would be warranted in countries where the economic fallout from the war is worst.
It added that central banks should be prepared to intervene as necessary to keep financial markets functioning if major stress emerges.

In the face of surging energy and food costs, many governments have made handouts to consumers and businesses, with some also introducing price controls or cutting fees and taxes.
The OECD said governments should be careful to ensure that such measures are temporary and targeted, and suggested some could consider funding the extra spending by taxing windfall gains.

76,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 03:21AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - In March 2021, as the Bank of Russia hiked interest rates for the first time in three years, Governor Elvira Nabiullina wore a brooch in the shape of a hawk - the latest in series of such sartorial nods to policy picked up by the Russian media. 
Less than a year later, black-clad and grim-faced, Nabiullina announced she was more than doubling the bank's policy rate to 20% and imposing some capital controls as Russia faced deepening economic isolation over its invasion of Ukraine.
That emergency rate is expected to stay when the central bank meets on Friday. But limiting the damage from the conflict could force Nabiullina, who put inflation-targeting at the centre of policy, off the path of monetary orthodoxy. 
Economists polled by central bank last week expected the economy to shrink 8% this year while inflation reaches 20% as Russia buckles under the economic backlash from its invasion, which Moscow has described as a special operation.
Renaissance Capital economist Sofia Donets said Nabiullina's firmness and consistency had made her an ""exceptional"" governor, but added: ""Now the game rules are changing again and this is not the central bank's choice – a new challenge may require rewriting the handbook.""
INFLATION FIGHTER
A surprise appointment in 2013, 58-year-old Nabiullina, an economist and former advisor to President Vladimir Putin, is the first woman to chair the central bank, one of Russia's most respected institutions.
She soon established herself as a committed inflation fighter, resisting calls from powerful industrialists and the Economy Ministry for interest rate cuts to revive growth.
""Nabiullina's brooches"" added a playful twist to an otherwise technocratic image. 
""To support economic growth we need to lower inflation. This is our main goal,"" she said early in her term. ""Let me say it again: monetary stimulus would not be effective in our view.""
In December 2021 Nabiullina told Reuters that inflation staying high could undermine the central bank's credibility. 
Those early comments showed her in tune with ordinary people, who told pollsters inflation was Russia's most pressing economic problem. She held that line for years, staunchly defending it against challengers from within Putin's entourage.
""Nabiullina has established a really strong reputation as an inflation hawk and a credible central bank governor. She floated the rouble and the (central bank) has cleaned up large parts of the banking sector under her watch,"" Capital Economics chief emerging markets economist William Jackson said. 
""It seems clear that she must have had Putin's support to do this."" 
CRISIS MEASURES
In 2014, a plunge in prices for oil, Russia's main export, tipped the economy into crisis. At the same time, Putin's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine provoked western sanctions and an investor stampede out of Russian assets.
Nabiullina's decision to let the rouble fall caused pain for Russians who saw their savings in dollar terms wiped out while prices of imported goods shot up. A 650 basis point rate hike was Russia's biggest since the 1998 financial crisis, superseded only by that on Feb. 28.
But her policies were credited with staving off an economic meltdown and Nabiullina won several awards for central banking.
Floating the rouble rather than spending to prop it up helped Nabiullina build up some $640 billion of gold and foreign exchange reserves to insulate the economy against future crises - only to find, as Russians queued to salvage their savings in February, that sanctions meant she could not use them. 
Asked in December about reserve management, she said it took into account geopolitical as well as economic risks. 
The Ukraine crisis has already necessitated capital controls, which Nabiullina had long opposed, and she may yet be forced to drop her focus on inflation as a policy goal. 
""Either the economy operates in a market mode, when capital flows are formed based on market factors such as exchange rate and key rate, or capital can no longer move freely, and then the role of the key rate as a policy instrument is sharply reduced,"" Alfa Bank's chief economist Natalia Orlova said. 
TIME UP? 
A rare female at the top of Russian officialdom, Nabiullina made a point of hiring others. She and monetary policy deputy Ksenia Yudayeva were described in a 2013 profile as the most qualified team in the central bank's history. 
Her modernising drive also saw an institution which a few years before had not even disclosed the dates of its meetings hold regular news briefings, although the central bank has said she will not take questions on Friday.
One unknown is whether Nabiullina will stay on when her current term expires in June. The central bank declined to comment on that issue although the rules say Putin must nominate her or another candidate by March 24. 

The Ukraine crisis ""will accelerate Russia's shift towards isolation and autarky"", Jackson at Capital Economics said, a break from the policy stances Nabiullina has championed. 
""While I don't think Nabiullina's credibility as a policymaker is necessarily being questioned, it's unclear whether she will actually be able to revert to the macroeconomic orthodoxy that she introduced,"" he said.

Below are five facts about Russia's central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina:

-Highly respected, including by many in the West, Nabiullina is credited with modernising the central bank and making it into an institution foreign investors trusted to steer the economy through tough times, including Western sanctions in 2014. 
-Following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, she helped build a $640 billion warchest of gold and foreign exchange reserves and oversaw a reduction in the share of reserves held in dollars. 

-An ethnic Tatar and a rare female in the top echelons of Russian officialdom, Nabiullina earned Putin's trust. Known as a policy hawk, in a December interview with Reuters she said high inflation could undermine the central bank's credibility.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened further on Wednesday, as the Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the first time in three years and set out a path of tighter monetary policy to fight unabated inflation. 
The shape of the yield curve is a key metric investors watch as it impacts other asset prices, feeds through to banks' returns and has been an indicator of how the economy will fare. Recent moves have reflected investor worries over whether the Fed can tighten monetary policy to tame inflation without hurting economic growth. 
Here is a quick primer explaining what a steep, flat or inverted yield curve means and whether the yield curve’s current shape is forecasting a recession.
WHAT IS THE U.S. TREASURY YIELD CURVE? 
The U.S. Treasury finances federal government budget obligations by issuing various forms of debt. The $23 trillion Treasury market includes Treasury bills with maturities from one month out to one year, notes from two years to 10 years, as well as 20-and 30-year bonds.
The yield curve plots the yield of all Treasury securities.
WHAT SHOULD THE CURVE LOOK LIKE? 
Typically, the curve slopes upwards because investors expect more compensation for taking on the risk that rising inflation will lower the expected return from owning longer-dated bonds. That means a 10-year note typically yields more than a 2-year note because it has a longer duration. Yields move inversely to prices. 
A steepening curve typically signals expectations of stronger economic activity, higher inflation, and higher interest rates. A flattening curve can mean the opposite: investors expect rate hikes in the near term and have lost confidence in the economy's growth outlook.
WHY IS THE YIELD CURVE FLATTENING NOW? 
Yields of short-term U.S. government debt have been rising quickly this year, reflecting expectations of a series of rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, while longer-dated government bond yields have moved at a slower pace amid concerns that policy tightening may hurt the economy.
As a result, the shape of the Treasury yield curve has been generally flattening. A closely watched part of the curve, measuring the spread between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, showed the gap at 24.5 basis points on Wednesday, over 60 points lower than where it ended 2021. That flattening increased on Wednesday after the Fed hiked rates. 
While rate increases can be a weapon against inflation, they can also slow economic growth by increasing the cost of borrowing for everything from mortgages to car loans.
Two-year U.S. Treasury yields, which track short-term interest-rate expectations, have risen to 1.94% from 0.73% at the end of last year, a 166% increase.
U.S. benchmark 10-year yields have gone up to about 2.19% from 1.5%, a 46% rise. In February they topped the 2% level for the first time since 2019. 
WHAT DOES AN INVERTED CURVE MEAN, AND WILL IT HAPPEN?
Some investors and strategists have forecast a curve inversion could happen, with short-term yields higher than long-term yields, as soon as this year - an ominous sign.
The U.S. curve has inverted before each recession since 1955, with a recession following between six and 24 months, according to a 2018 report by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. It offered a false signal just once in that time.
The last time the yield curve inverted was in 2019. The following year, the United States entered a recession - albeit one caused by the global pandemic.
DOES THE WHOLE CURVE INVERT OR PARTS OF IT? 
Traders typically watch the shape of the curve determined by comparing two-year and 10-year Treasury notes, because a yield curve inversion on that spread has anticipated previous recessions. That curve is flattening but not yet close to inversion, with the spread down to 24.5 basis points on Wednesday from 29.10 a day earlier.
But distortions can occur anywhere along the curve without inverting the entire curve.
On Wednesday, the 5s/10s curve inverted in intraday trade. It switched back to positive territory but the gap was down to 0.4 basis points from 3.8 a day earlier.
A less closely watched part of the curve has inverted several times over the past few weeks, with the premium of U.S. Treasury 10-year notes over seven-year Treasuries closing in negative territory every day since March 11.
The 20-year/30-year spread has been negative since late October, though supply and demand technical factors may have contributed. 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE REAL WORLD? 
Aside from signals it may flash on the economy, the shape of the yield curve has ramifications for consumers and business. 

When short-term rates increase, U.S. banks tend to raise their benchmark rates for a wide range of consumer and commercial loans, including small business loans and credit cards, making borrowing more expensive for consumers. Mortgage rates also rise.
When the yield curve steepens, banks are able to borrow money at lower interest rates and lend at higher interest rates. Conversely, when the curve is flatter they find their margins squeezed, which may deter lending.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. politicians know high inflation can bring careers in public office to an early end, but it is ultimately up to the unelected officials of the Federal Reserve to control what is considered first and foremost a ""monetary phenomenon.""
With inflation at a 40-year high, war in Europe threatening to push it higher, and consumers feeling the weight of higher gasoline and food prices and, for many, a cut in the purchasing power of their wages, the heat is once again on the Fed.
The U.S. central bank's main tool in managing inflation is the federal funds rate, an interest rate that governs short-term loans among financial institutions and forms a sort of bedrock for other types of loans. It has been set near zero since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and is a big reason why home mortgages, for example, have been so cheap.
That is now changing. The Fed on Wednesday, as part of an effort to control inflation, which by the central bank's preferred measure is running at 6% annually, voted to increase the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a target range of 0.25%-0.50%. What's more, Fed policymakers laid out a plan for what amounts to a rate hike at each of their remaining six meetings this year in an old-school battle against inflation few of them saw coming.
The aim of rate-increase cycles like this are to temper consumer and business spending. If interest rates on home equity loans rise, for example, consumers won't be as likely to tap them to pay for renovations or new furniture. By curbing demand, prices should rise less quickly. Ultimately, the Fed wants inflation to be around 2% annually.
Not all of the Fed's efforts to tighten monetary policy have worked the same way. Some have led to recessions that lowered inflation but also killed jobs and economic growth, a ""hard landing"" in Fed parlance.
What will happen this time? There are no perfect parallels in recent decades, but each hiking cycle may hold lessons.

One of the Fed's most glaring policy mistakes also set the stage for one of its most notable, and notably painful, successes.
Fed Chair Arthur Burns was late to begin raising interest rates in the early 1970s after coming under pressure from then-President Richard Nixon to keep unemployment low ahead of the 1974 presidential election.

Current Fed officials don't like to discuss resemblances between now and the 1970s. But there are similarities. Rising wages, loose monetary policy, ultra-low unemployment, and, now, an oil shock. An embargo by Arab states in 1973 and the Iranian revolution six years later led to skyrocketing prices and some fuel rationing in the United States.
Inflation at the peak exceeded 14%, and it fell to Fed Chair Paul Volcker to break the cycle. He did, but pushed interest rates so high - home loans, at 18%, were as expensive as credit cards are today - the economy fell into two recessions in short order. 
It was tough medicine some say the economy needed. But it was costly: The unemployment rate topped 10% in 1982.

GREENSPAN: THE ANCHOR, MODERATION AND CRISIS
Alan Greenspan took over as Fed chief in 1987 and for much of his tenure was credited with finishing the work Volcker had begun. Under Greenspan the Fed cemented public trust that the Fed would keep inflation under control, creating a psychological ""anchor"" that may serve to temper actual price increases. 
Greenspan's several hiking cycles were not as violent as Volcker's, and he is credited with what is considered a classic ""soft landing"" in the early 1990s when policy tightened without a recession. A short downturn started the new century, but was also attributed to a crash in technology stocks. 
Greenspan's oracular standing took a hit less than two years after his departure in early 2006 from the Fed when a crisis that began in the U.S. housing market triggered a global meltdown. His willingness to leave interest rates low and take a lighter touch to banking regulation - a market-based view that investors would take rational risks if left alone - is cited by some as a cause of the crisis. 
Interest rates did rise from 2004 to 2006, though the ensuing 2007-2009 recession in the United States was less about the level of borrowing costs than the earlier spread of bad mortgage bets through the financial system.

A NEW ERA?
Since the financial crisis and recession more than a decade ago, U.S. central bankers have come to grips with a new world in which inflation seemed safely stuck near or even below their 2% target, and interest rates globally appeared in decline.
The Fed for the first time ever cut rates to near zero during that crisis, and they remained there until late 2015. When Fed Chair Janet Yellen and her successor, Jerome Powell, lifted rates, they did not get as far as expected. Even before the coronavirus pandemic caused a recession, the economy was showing signs of stress, and the hiking cycle was cut short. 
Yellen and Powell lift off (sort of) https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/HIKES/zgpomzgqgpd/
https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/HIKES/lgvdwadmwpo/chart.png 
The outcome this time will depend on many things, including whether the war in Ukraine ends or intensifies. The energy shock resulting from Russia's invasion of its neighbor is already looking less persistent than those of the 1970s. Investors and analysts do not expect the Fed will need to resort to Volcker-style aggressiveness for prices to ease.
That doesn't mean it will be easy. In fact the Fed is banking that inflation snaps back to the trend in place before the pandemic. But with the economy now on a path to less globalization, more expensive supply chains, and tighter job markets, that is far from assured.

80,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 12:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China watchers expect the central bank to take policy action within days after top financial leaders made a strong pledge to boost markets and support the economy.
Past meetings of the Financial Stability Development Committee, chaired by Vice Premier Liu He, in 2018 and last year were followed by a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio or signals of a cut in the following days, CSC Financial Co. analysts said in a report late Wednesday. 
Expectations are also growing that banks could lower their quotes for the loan prime rate, the de facto benchmark lending rate, when it’s announced by the People’s Bank of China Monday. That would be a rare move after the central bank kept a key policy rate on which the LPR is based unchanged earlier this week. 
Investors saw the statement by Liu, China’s economic czar, as a reassurance that a crackdown on internet companies was nearing an end and the government would do more to prevent a collapse in the property market. It also signaled a step up in monetary and fiscal stimulus already highlighted at the annual parliamentary meetings earlier this month.
The committee vowed that monetary policy “will be proactive” and new loans will keep growing to boost the economy in the first quarter. 
Liu Peiqian, China economist at NatWest Group Plc, brought forward a call for either a 50-basis point cut in the RRR or a 5-basis point reduction in the LPR in coming days.
“I expect more monetary easing policies to follow up and spur loan growth,” she said. The PBOC has an incentive to use “high-profile, broad-based easing” in the short term as that will stabilize market sentiment, even though further easing may be more gradual and targeted going forward, she said.
Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group., predicts a targeted RRR cut for large banks and possibly a 5 basis-point reduction in one-year and five-year LPRs, respectively.
Chinese stocks soared for a second day. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, a gauge of Chinese firms listed in Hong Kong, surged as much as 8.2% early Thursday following its biggest jump since 2008 in the previous session. The CSI 300 Index rose more than 3%. Property shares were among the biggest gainers after regulators said they would not expand a trial on property taxes this year.
While signs of a market bottom are piling up, traders say more concrete measures in the property and tech sectors are needed to tell if the turnaround is here to stay.
Foreign investors net sold Chinese stocks for eight straight sessions through Wednesday, matching a streak in October 2020. The amount of shares trimmed totaled 66.8 billion yuan ($10.5 billion) during the period, more than triple the value seen nearly two and half years ago. The traders returned on Thursday, snapping up 3.2 billion yuan worth of equities as of the mid-day break.
The PBOC held its key interest rate for one-year policy loans unchanged earlier this week, confounding the expectations of the majority of economists polled by Bloomberg who expected a cut in the medium-term lending facility rate. 
With the U.S. Federal Reserve kicking off its rate hike cycle Wednesday, the room for more easing by the PBOC could narrow as the spread between rates in China and the U.S. declines, putting pressure on capital outflows.
 
The gap between China-U.S. 10-year government bonds shrank to 61 basis points on Wednesday, the smallest since March 21, 2019 and down from 127 basis points at the end of last year.
The PBOC held a meeting Wednesday chaired by Governor Yi Gang, issuing its own statement shortly after the financial committee, saying it will step up support for small businesses and the real economy. The central bank also pledged to coordinate policies with other government agencies to boost confidence and keep capital markets stable.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan is unlikely to see inflation hitting a central bank target of 2%, even accounting for rising energy costs, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Thursday, making the case for keeping monetary policy ultra-easy.
His remark highlights the widening divergence between the BOJ's dovish stance and the U.S. Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates on Wednesday for the first time since 2018 and laid out plans to keep hiking borrowing costs.
""It will take more time to achieve our 2% inflation target in a stable manner, so it's too early to debate specifics on how to exit from easy policy,"" Kuroda told parliament.
Analysts expect Japan's core consumer inflation, which hit 0.2% in January, to accelerate to near 2% from April as the effect of cellphone fee cuts dissipate.
The recent spike in energy and commodity prices, driven by the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, adds to inflationary pressures with the impact likely to persist for most of this year.
Kuroda, however, played down the chance that inflation will hit 2% long enough to warrant withdrawing monetary stimulus.
""I don't think Japan is in a condition where inflation stably hits 2%, even when the impact of cellphone fee cuts taper off and energy prices rise further,"" he said.
When 2% inflation is achieved, the BOJ will consider exiting ultra-easy policy and disclose its plans, Kuroda said.

""In doing so, we will guide monetary policy to ensure markets including those for Japanese government bonds remain stable,"" he added.
At its two-day meeting ending on Friday, the BOJ is widely expected to policy steady and warn of heightening economic risks from the Ukraine crisis.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nearly 70% of Japanese firms expect the fall-out from the crisis in Ukraine to hurt earnings, a Reuters poll showed, with a majority of those citing a surge in oil prices as their primary concern.
The latest Reuters Corporate survey highlighted the likelihood of more pain ahead for companies in resource-poor Japan, where a weakening yen is further adding to the cost of commodities and heaping more pressure on households.
A total of 69% of companies surveyed said they expected the crisis to hit earnings, with 9% of firms saying they expected a large impact.
""As the price of merchandise rises, consumers are tending to favour less expensive goods and services as they become more thrifty,"" a manager of a retailer wrote in the survey, which polled 500 non-financial firms between March 2 and March 11. 
Some 240 companies responded on condition of anonymity.
""We are concerned about the cost of raw materials as well as currency fluctuations,"" said a manager at a machinery maker.
Global concern about Russian oil supplies have pushed up oil prices above $100 per barrel to levels not seen in almost a decade and prices of many other commodities from metals to grain have surged, too. 
Meanwhile, the yen has fallen to its weakest in five years, at 118 to the dollar, further driving up the price of oil and other imports for Japanese buyers.
Of the firms that cited concern about impact from the Ukraine crisis, 63% picked oil price spikes as their primary worry while 15% cited supply-chain disruptions as their main worry.
Asked what areas they want the government to focus on the most, 63% of firms chose efforts to counter energy and broader price hikes, 50% picked economic growth strategy and 43% selected COVID-19 measures.

The government is considering compiling a fresh economic stimulus package to help ease the pain from high energy costs, the Kyodo news agency reported on Wednesday.
Separately, the government has also said it would raise its gasoline subsidy for oil distributors to the upper limit to help ease the cost pressure.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese households accumulated a record $17 trillion in financial assets as of December last year, roughly four times the size of its economy, as the COVID-19 pandemic kept consumers housebound, saving their money instead of spending it.
While the crisis in Ukraine clouds the outlook by pushing up fuel and living costs for households, the government's decision to end pandemic curbs next week could give consumption a much-needed boost.
""Households may see their purchasing power sapped as prices of goods like flour and gasoline rise,"" said Masato Koike, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. ""But consumption is likely to recover as Japan pulls out from the pandemic.""
The 2,023 trillion yen ($17.02 trillion) in financial assets households accumulated as of December 2022 was 4.5% higher than year-before levels, central bank data showed on Thursday.
Roughly half of the total was held in cash and deposits, the data showed, underscoring households' aversion to risky investments.
The quarterly flow of funds data also showed the central bank held 530 trillion yen worth of Japanese government bonds (JGB) as of December, making up 43.4% of the total market.
The amount was down 2.9% from year-before levels, the fastest decline since March 2009, suggesting the Bank of Japan (BOJ) continued to steadily taper asset purchases.

Since shifting in 2016 to a policy targeting interest rates instead of the pace of money printing, the BOJ has been slowing its JGB buying as its huge presence in the market drew criticism for draining market liquidity.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. interest rates are on a far steeper and faster climb than previously anticipated following the Federal Reserve's liftoff on Wednesday, bringing to an end zero-interest-rate policy, or ""ZIRP,"" that has been mostly in place since the 2008 Great Financial Crisis.
Money markets are signaling that the Fed's surprisingly aggressive posture on inflation will put the brakes on the economy, forcing it to cut rates perhaps as early as the second half of next year, and definitely by 2024.
Traders are not pricing in recession though, at least not yet. Any reduction in the fed funds rate in the next couple of years would bring rates down to ""neutral"" from ""restrictive"" levels rather than signal a full-blown easing cycle.
At no point over the next three-to-five years does the Eurodollar curve show the Fed's benchmark rate falling below the 2.25% area. Before Wednesday's meeting and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, that floor was closer to 2.00%.
""No one wants to have to put restrictive monetary policy on in order to get inflation back down. Frankly, the need is one of getting rates back up to more neutral levels as quickly as we practicably can, and then moving beyond that if that turns out to be appropriate,"" Powell said.
But citing the new median forecasts that show the fed funds rate moving above longer-term neutral rate, Powell added: ""And as you can see, it is appropriate.""
2024 EURODOLLAR INVERSION
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its fed funds target range by a quarter percentage point to 0.25%-0.50%, the first hike since 2018 and as expected. What surprised markets was just how far policymakers are prepared to go to choke off inflation.
New Fed projections showed a median interest rate of 1.9% this year and 2.8% for the next two years, significantly higher than the respective projections of 0.9%, 1.6% and 2.1% at December's policy meeting.
That's equal to seven quarter-point hikes this year, rising to at least 10 next year. The new ""terminal"" rate of 2.8% is also higher than the projected ""neutral"" rate of 2.4%, the level that neither runs the economy too hot nor too cold.
This prompted the Eurodollar curve to accelerate the hawkish repricing under way even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine three weeks ago put a fire under oil prices and inflation expectations.
The June 2023-December 2023 part of the curve inverted slightly again, indicating a slender chance of a rate cut in the second half of next year, but the bigger bets on a policy shift were set for 2024.
The first signs of this in the Eurodollar strip appeared on Feb. 10, two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine, when various parts of the 2024 curve inverted. These bets intensified on Wednesday.
GOOD LUCK
The Eurodollar curve can be distorted by perceived credit risk and strong hedging demand from market players, so a premium is built into implied rates. But it is still considered a good guide to Fed expectations, so the flattening is noteworthy.
Yet it may not be flagging recession. Put another way, if traders think the economy will shrink in the next couple of years, they would surely be betting on more than 25 bps of rate cuts.
Granted, the Fed's room for maneuver will be more limited than before, with the exception of the last recession in 2020. That COVID-triggered slump in GDP was one of the steepest in U.S. history, but also the shortest.
The Fed slashed interest rates by 150 bps, brought back ZIRP, and launched a huge bond-buying program. With inflation as high as it is, no rate-cutting cycle is being reflected in money market pricing this time around. At least not yet.
Two reliable recession indicators give different signals: Plunging U.S. consumer confidence suggests recession is likely; but despite Wednesday's flattening the 2-year/10-year yield curve has not inverted yet, suggesting it is unlikely.
""Historically the Treasury yield curve inverts or is very close to inversion for several quarters ahead of a business cycle downturn. At present, we are just at rate lift-off at the Fed,"" SocGen's Stephen Gallagher wrote to clients.
But other observers, like Joe Lavorgna at Natixis, are skeptical the Fed can tighten financial conditions sufficiently to get inflation back down to its 2% target without hurting employment, demand and ultimately economic growth.
""I wish Jay Powell and company all the best of luck because they're not going to get anywhere near as they think, unless they're willing to throw a lot of people out of jobs, because that's what's going to happen. We're going to have a recession,"" Lavorgna said.

(Reuters) -A key Senate panel late Wednesday gave its stamp of approval to President Joe Biden's renomination of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and two other nominees to the Fed Board. 
It deadlocked on a fourth, but her nomination will likely also advance to consideration by the full Senate. 
Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown, in remarks ahead of the vote, lauded Powell for his leadership of the Fed through the coronavirus pandemic and for his defense of the central bank's independence when Powell came under fire from Republican former President Donald Trump. Powell ""has earned the opportunity to lead the Fed as chair,"" Brown, a Democrat, said.
The 23-1 vote in favor of advancing Powell's nomination -- with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren the lone dissent -- came just a few hours after Powell announced what is expected to be the first of a series of interest rate hikes this year to fight soaring inflation. 
The panel also approved the promotion of Fed Governor Lael Brainard to Fed vice chair, in a 16-8 vote, and approved unanimously the nomination of Philip Jefferson, an economist and the dean of faculty at Davidson College in North Carolina. Their names, along with Powell's, are now sent to the full Senate.
Republicans on the panel refused to endorse Lisa Cook, an economics professor at Michigan State University, whom Biden picked to be the first Black female Fed governor. 
Her nomination will go forward anyway. Brown said Wednesday he would transmit notice of the tied vote to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who under Senate rules can have the full Senate ""discharge"" the panel from further consideration and allow a confirmation vote to proceed. 
If all nominees are confirmed, the Fed Board will be the most diverse ever by race, with two Black governors serving at the same time. But the seven-member panel will remain one seat short of its full complement. 

On Tuesday, Sarah Bloom Raskin withdrew as Biden's nominee to become the top bank regulator at the Fed after Democrat Senator Joe Manchin said he would oppose her. 
In a 50-50 Senate that Democrats control only by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking position, nominees opposed by a united Republican front need the backing of every member of Biden's party to gain confirmation.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England looks set to press on with raising interest rates on Thursday as it tries to stop soaring inflation from becoming engrained in the British economy.
All but five of 49 economists recently polled by Reuters thought the BoE will raise Bank Rate for a third meeting running, back to its pre-pandemic level of 0.75%, with the rest expecting it to stay on hold at 0.5%.
The BoE last month predicted inflation will peak at around 7.25% in April - almost four times the British central bank's 2% target - but that forecast has been overtaken by seismic shifts in European energy markets following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Investors will be watching for any new thinking from rate-setters on how they - like central bankers elsewhere - plan to deal with the competing forces of price pressures and slowing economic growth which could even turn into a recession.
The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday and laid out an aggressive plan to push borrowing costs to restrictive levels by next year, as concerns about high inflation and the war in Ukraine overtook the risks of the coronavirus pandemic.
The European Central Bank, which is behind the BoE and the Fed in reversing its pandemic stimulus, agreed last week to stop pumping money into markets this summer, clearing the way for possible rate increases in 2022.
""The war in Ukraine means that UK inflation is going to stay higher for longer,"" said ING economists James Smith and Chris Turner. ""Markets have concluded that this means the BoE will double-down on its tightening plans."" 
The Reuters poll of economists, published on Tuesday, suggested inflation in the second quarter will average almost 8%, which would be the highest rate since the early 1990s.
All nine Monetary Policy Committee members were expected by most economists to vote for a rate hike, but there could again be a split vote over the extent of tightening needed.
Last month a slim majority of five, including Governor Andrew Bailey, voted to raise rates by 25 basis points, rather than a bigger 50 basis point hike. Faster action risked ramping up market expectations for future rates hikes that were already sufficient to push inflation well below target in future years, they said.
Those bets in the market have steepened over the last month and now point to a Bank Rate of 2% by the end of next year. 
Paul Hollingsworth, chief European economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), said he thought growth concerns would come to the fore later this year, ""suggesting that market pricing of six hikes by the year-end looks way off the mark.""
The four MPC members who voted to raise rates by 50 basis points last month worried that high inflation risked becoming engrained in expectations for prices and wages among businesses and consumers.
Data over the past month brought mixed news on that front.
The public's inflation expectations have strengthened to new multi-year highs, according to surveys as the labour market remained hot.
But a BoE report last week pointed to weak forecasts of pay growth among households, which sat awkwardly with Governor Bailey's appeal last month for people to show restraint when asking for a pay rise.

With investors also eyeing a budget update next Wednesday from finance minister Rishi Sunak, the British Chambers of Commerce said economic policymakers should beware of an increased risk of recession.
""Raising interest rates and taxes at this time would weaken the UK's growth prospects further, by undermining confidence and diminishing households' and firms' finances,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates for the first time since 2018 and laid out an aggressive plan to push borrowing costs to restrictive levels next year in a pivot from battling the coronavirus pandemic to countering the economic risks posed by excessive inflation and the war in Ukraine.
The U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee kicked off the move to tighten monetary policy with a quarter-percentage-point increase in the target federal funds rate, lifting that key benchmark from the current near-zero level in a step that will ripple through a variety of other rates charged to consumers and businesses.
But more notably, new Fed projections showed policymakers ready to shift their inflation fight into high gear, with one policymaker, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, dissenting in favor of an even more aggressive approach.
Most policymakers now see the federal funds rate rising to a range between 1.75% and 2% by the end of 2022, the equivalent of a quarter-percentage-point rate increase at each of the Fed's six remaining policy meetings this year. They project it will climb to 2.8% next year - above the 2.4% level that officials now feel would work to slow the economy. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking after the end of the latest two-day policy meeting, said the economy is strong enough to weather the rate hikes and maintain its current strong hiring and wage growth, and that the Fed needed to now focus on limiting the impact of price increases on American families.
Even with Wednesday's actions, inflation is expected to remain above the Fed's 2% target through 2024, and Powell said officials would not shy from raising rates more aggressively if they don't see improvement. 
""The way we're thinking about this is that every meeting is a live meeting"" for a rate hike, Powell said in a news conference, emphasizing that the Fed could add the equivalent of more rate increases by also paring its massive bond holdings. ""We're going to be looking at evolving conditions, and if we do conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly to remove accommodation, then we'll do so."" 
Rate increases work to slow inflation by curbing demand for big-ticket items like houses, automobiles or home improvement projects that become more expensive to finance, which can also slow economic growth and potentially increase unemployment.
The economy may already be slowing for other reasons. Fed policymakers marked down their gross domestic product growth estimate for 2022 to 2.8%, from the 4% projected in December, as they began to analyze the new risks facing the global economy.
""That is just an early assessment of the effects of spillovers from the war in Eastern Europe, which will hit our economy through a number of channels,"" Powell said. ""You are looking at higher oil prices, higher commodity prices. That will weigh on GDP to some extent.""
Over time, Fed policy itself would begin curbing economic activity, Powell said.
""The Fed is playing catch-up and clearly recognizes the need to get back in front of the inflation situation,"" said Seema Shah, chief strategist with Principal Global Investors.
""It won't be easy - rarely has the Fed safely landed the U.S. economy from such inflation heights without triggering an economic crash. Furthermore, the conflict ... has the potential to disrupt the Fed's path. But for now, the Fed's priority has to be price stability.""
The Fed's preferred measure of inflation is currently increasing at a 6% annual rate. 
STUBBORN INFLATION
The policy statement, which dropped a longstanding reference to the coronavirus as the most direct economic risk facing the country, marked the end of the Fed's full-on battle against the pandemic. After two years focused largely on ensuring families and firms had access to credit, the Fed now pledges ""ongoing increases"" in borrowing costs to curb the highest inflation rates in 40 years.
The interest rate path shown in new quarterly projections by policymakers is tougher than expected, reflecting Fed concern about inflation that has moved faster and threatened to become more persistent than expected, and put at risk the central bank's hope for an easy shift out of the emergency policies used to fight the fallout from the pandemic.
Major U.S. stock indexes briefly pared gains after the release of the statement and projections before recovering to close sharply higher, with the S&P 500 index up 2.2% on the day.
Two-year Treasury note yields rose to 2.002% while benchmark 10-year Treasury yields reached 2.246%, both the highest levels since May 2019, before falling back to 1.948% and 2.188%, respectively. 
The dollar traded lower against a basket of currencies.
Even with the tougher rate increases now projected, the Fed expects inflation to remain at 4.3% this year, dropping to 2.7% in 2023 and to 2.3% in 2024. The unemployment rate is seen dropping to 3.5% this year and remaining at that level next year, but is projected to rise slightly to 3.6% in 2024. 

The new statement said the Fed expects to begin reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet ""at a coming meeting."" Powell told reporters that policymakers had made ""excellent progress on that front and could finalize details at their next policy meeting in May. 
The central bank's holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities ballooned after the start of the pandemic in 2020 when it began making massive monthly asset purchases to bolster the economy.

BAY CITY, Mich. (Reuters) - Western sanctions and other actions to punish Russia over its invasion of Ukraine will impose costs on the United States and its allies, and policymakers needed to consider how to mitigate those impacts, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said on Wednesday.
Tai, asked about effects on U.S. automakers of revoking Russia's Permanent Normal Trade Relations status -- a move that would allow higher tariffs on imports from Russia -- said that the action was aimed at imposing costs on Russia.
""Those consequences are intended to have a cost on Russia. But they also will require us to bear some costs,"" Tai told reporters at an SK Siltron silicon wafer plant in Michigan.
""What we need to do — and this is really a key to policy making — is to figure out how to take action that maximizes the consequences for Russia while we figure out how to mitigate the impacts on our economic interests,"" Tai said. 
She did not provide any specifics on whether certain metals imported from Russia, including palladium, rhodium and platinum used in vehicle exhaust catalytic converters and aluminum increasingly used in vehicle bodies, could be could be spared from higher tariffs.
She said that Russia's actions had undermined a longstanding system of global economic integration, with consequences for the global economy. 
""The president's been very clear that first we have a responsibility to democracy and the rule of law in the world. We also have a responsibility to thinking through and doing the best that is strategically possible,"" she said.
The Biden administration and European Union have pledged to revoke Russia's normal trade relations at the World Trade Organization, a move that for Washington requires approval by Congress. Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, told reporters on Wednesday that he hoped an authorizing bill could pass in the coming days. 

Tai was in Michigan with South Korean Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo to mark the 10th anniversary of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) at a plant where the South Korean-owned SK Siltron was investing $300 million.
The biggest non-petroleum U.S. imports from Russia in 2020 were palladium, pig iron, rhodium, unwrought aluminum alloys, plywood and ammonium nitrate fertilizer, according to World Bank data.

The central bank hiked its benchmark rate by 25 basis points, looking to counter economic risks posed by excessive inflation and the war in Ukraine. Policymakers signaled they would push the key federal funds rate to a range of 1.75% to 2.00% by the end of 2022.
Banks, which make money on the difference between what they earn from lending and pay out on deposits and other funds, typically thrive in a high interest rate environment.
In after-market trading, shares of big U.S. banks were up between 3.3% and 6.6% each.

The Fed faces the task of charting a course for the economy to weather rate hikes without a repeat of the 1970s-style predicament in which the central bank's rate hikes to fight inflation resulted in a steep recession.
Inflation, running at three times the Fed's 2% target and a hot-button political issue, has been worsened by the war in Europe which has led to a surge in commodity prices and piled pressure on to an already battered supply chain.

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point and signaled that it plans to lift them further in the coming months to battle high inflation, a shift that will likely be felt by most households. 
Higher interest rates can raise borrowing costs for consumers seeking to buy homes and cars, a shift already taking place. Those increased costs could help to cool inflation by lowering demand and slowing economic growth. 
Here is a look at the various ways higher interest rates could affect borrowers.
MORTGAGES 
Mortgage rates started rising in anticipation of the Fed's rate increases and are likely to go up further now that the Fed is bumping up short-term borrowing costs. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.27% in the week ending March 11, up roughly a full percentage point from a year earlier and the highest level since May 2019, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
Higher mortgage rates can increase home buying costs, making it more difficult for some aspiring buyers to afford a home. For example, some buyers may need to increase their monthly payments or aim for a less-expensive home to keep payments at a level they can afford.
Increased borrowing costs could weaken demand for homes, but with the inventory of homes for sale at a record low, it could take time before that shift affects home prices, said Domonic Purviance, real estate expert for the Atlanta Fed. Home prices may increase more slowly in the near term, but they are unlikely to decline, said Purviance.
AUTO LOANS 
A shortage of cars for sale has sent car prices rising and now higher interest rates could make car loans more expensive. That's because the short-term interest rates controlled by the Fed can indirectly affect the rates charged on auto loans. People who already have cars purchased with a fixed-rate loan shouldn't be affected.
As with housing, those increased borrowing costs may deter some people from buying more cars. Comparing rates from multiple lenders may help buyers find a more affordable loan. 
SAVING RATES 
The Fed's rate hikes could translate into higher yields paid on savings accounts, but that may not happen immediately. Banks may take their time to lift the rates they pay on deposits, especially if they are already swimming in cash. 
Eventually, the increase in short-term rates should lead to larger payouts on certificates of deposits and other savings accounts. Online savings accounts typically offer higher yields than savings accounts held with traditional banks. Savers can compare rates offered by various financial institutions online. 
CREDIT LINES
Certain types of loans with adjustable interest rates, including home equity lines of credit and credit cards, may show the effects of the Fed's rate moves almost immediately.
The first rate increase of 0.25 percentage point announced on Wednesday may not deal a huge blow to consumers' pockets. But borrowers could feel more strain after a series of rate hikes. 

Fed officials project that the central bank's benchmark overnight rate could rise to a range of 1.75% to 2.00% by the end of the year and could go as high as 2.8% by the end of next year. 
""The cost of that debt is only going to grow over the next couple of years,"" Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate, said in a statement.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The busiest U.S. seaport expects its robust flow of imports to continue in the near term, but is closely monitoring COVID-19 shutdowns in major cities in China, its executive director said on Wednesday.
""In the weeks ahead, we expect to see an increase in vessels headed our way as retailers to get a big push to replenish shelves,"" Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said on a media call. 
""We're also watching very closely the events in China with yet another wave of COVID-19 spreading through major cities and businesses,"" Seroka said.
The Port of Los Angeles and the adjacent Port of Long Beach handle more imports from China than any other U.S. ocean gateways. They set a new record for imports in February, handling a combined 814,408 20-foot equivalent units (TEU) - 3.5% more than the year earlier.
Forty-four ships are already sailing cargo to the Southern California port complex, versus the 30 that are typically seen at this time of the year, Seroka said.
Meanwhile, China has put millions of people under lockdown in a bid to stop the spread of a highly contagious Omicron variant. That action is already impacting factories that make everything from electric scooters to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones.
China has imposed some of the toughest measures in the key manufacturing hubs of Shenzhen, Dongguan and Changchun, as well as the financial center of Shanghai - home to the world's busiest container port.
Many small, high-value electronics from Shenzen enter the United States by plane. Inexpensive or bulky items move by ship, including Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) toys, furniture and other home goods sold by QVC owner Qurate Retail Group (NASDAQ:QRTEA), and dishwashers from Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), said Eric Oak, a supply chain analyst at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence's trade data firm Panjiva. Mattel, Qurate and Samsung (KS:005930) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

While major air and sea ports in Shenzhen and Shanghai continue to operate, locals are reporting that trucks are delayed by road and testing restrictions and that some Shenzen warehouses are no longer accepting deliveries.
The supply chain depends on all of the links working together, said Phil Levy, chief economist for freight forwarder Flexport. ""If you don't have truckers and you don't have warehouses, (you can move) things already in process, but you'll have a problem with new stuff,"" Levy said.

93,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 05:16PM ET</span>",,,,,,"CAIRO (Reuters) -Gulf central banks on Wednesday raised their main interest rates by a quarter percentage point in lockstep with the U.S. Federal Reserve as it began a monetary tightening cycle in a newly aggressive stance against rising inflation.
The six Arab nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council typically follow the Fed's lead on interest rates as their currencies are pegged to the U.S. dollar, except Kuwait's, which is pegged to a basket of currencies including the dollar.
""If policymakers in the Gulf did not allow interest rates to follow those in the U.S., capital would flow out of their economies and this would put downwards pressure on their currencies,"" James Swanston, Middle East and North Africa economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note.
The Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) increased both its repo and reverse repo rates by 25 basis points (bps) each to 1.25% and 0.75%, respectively.
""Policy rate adjustments are consistent with SAMA's objectives of maintaining monetary stability and supporting the stability of the financial sector in the evolving domestic and international monetary conditions,"" SAMA said in a statement.
The Central Bank of the UAE raised its base rate, which is on its overnight deposit facility, by 25 bps to 0.4%. CBUAE maintained the rate on borrowing short-term liquidity from it through all standing credit facilities at 50 bps above the base rate.
INVESTMENT
The central banks of Kuwait and Bahrain also raised their key interest rates by 25 bps. Qatar and Oman are widely expected to follow.
Historical precedent points to oil prices as a more potent harbinger for Gulf economies' fortunes than interest rates, though the hikes could impact people and companies' appetite to borrow for investment and consumption and boost saving by households, Swanston said.
""In terms of the supply of loans, rate increases will prompt banks to deem some potential lending opportunities no longer viable,"" he said, adding it could lead to higher debt servicing costs for businesses and individuals. 
""All of this acts as a headwind to domestic demand, although this may be welcomed in so far as it helps to dampen inflationary pressures across the Gulf,"" Swanston said, as inflation has climbed to multi-year highs across the region, except in Saudi Arabia.
Companies in the UAE and Qatar, particularly in sectors hard-hit by the pandemic like tourism and real estate, risk a further increase in non-performing loans as central banks wind down pandemic-linked payment holidays, he said.
Government debt servicing costs will increase, but with Brent crude at over $97 a barrel, all Gulf governments are expected to post a fiscal surplus this year, reducing the need to raise debt to plug deficits.

However, Bahrain and Oman, the only GCC countries with sub-investment-grade credit ratings, have high fiscal breakeven oil prices, so even a small downturn in crude prices could swing them to deficits.
""Ultimately, we think that both Bahrain and Oman will need to turn to the rest of the Gulf for financial assistance in the coming years,"" Swanston said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers have made ""excellent progress"" on their plan for reducing the central bank's nearly $9 trillion balance sheet, and could finalize details at their next policy meeting in May, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday. 
Overall, he said, the plan will look ""familiar"" to when the Fed last reduced bond holdings between 2017 and 2019, ""but it will be faster than the last time, and of course it's much sooner in the cycle than last time."" 
The Fed will provide more details on the plan's parameters when it releases minutes of Wednesday's policy meeting in three weeks' time, he said. 
The U.S. central bank's balance sheet more than doubled during the pandemic as it scooped up trillions of dollars in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, first to calm markets and then to support the economy. 
It ended those bond purchases this month. Shrinking the portfolio will help tighten monetary policy and financial conditions, complementing the Fed's move to higher interest rates to bring inflation back under control, Powell said.

Earlier this year the Fed said balance sheet reductions would generally happen not through outright sales of bonds but by allowing securities to roll off as they mature. Investors expect the Fed to set monthly caps to control the reduction and make it predictable. 
""We'll be mindful of the broader financial context when we make the decision on timing"" of reductions, Powell said. ""We always want to use our tools to support macroeconomic and financial stability, and we want to avoid adding uncertainty in a highly uncertain situation already."" 
 
"
95,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 04:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- While history suggests it won’t last, an emotion approaching euphoria descended on equity markets Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell persuaded investors his first interest rate hikes in four years won’t throttle the economy.
Markets initially shuddered after the quarter-point increase was announced, but quickly found their footing as Powell made a point of repeatedly affirming the pace of economic growth. The Fed chief reported scant evidence of a downturn anytime soon, saying probability of a recession in the next year is “not particularly elevated.”
Indexes rebounded sharply in the aftermath, with the S&P 500 closing more than 2% higher after briefly erasing gains as Powell began speaking. The Nasdaq 100 Index soared 3.7%, the most in a year.
The buoyancy attests to how quickly the perception of threats has evolved in risk markets. Where once pronouncements of economic confidence were enough to shock stocks because of the cover they provide for rate hikes, now they are cause for celebration as anxiety about a recession becomes the larger concern.
“Jobs are stronger than ever. The unemployment rate is lower than pre-COVID, basically. Consumer spending is quite healthy. Consumer savings remains at all time highs at $2.7 trillion,” said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and CIO of Defiance ETFs. “It’s really hard to think about how we would go into a recession.”
While not reflected in data or forecasts, recession angst has seeped deeply into trader psyches, and on some recent days has dominated them. Among signals bears are heeding are a worrisome flattening in the gap between short- and long-term interest rates, spiking oil prices that threaten demand and declines from stock records that recently exceeded 10% in the S&P 500 and 20% in the Nasdaq Composite Index.
No such anxiety was evident in the wake of Powell’s performance. Nine of 11 sectors in the S&P 500 finished Wednesday higher, with technology stocks outperforming even as Treasury yields climbed.
To be sure, Powell’s commentary wasn’t the only thing buttressing risk assets. Stocks soared overnight after China vowed to support its financial markets, giving a reprieve to beaten-down technology shares. Equities got a further boost from speculation Russia and Ukraine had moved closer to a compromise in peace talks.
It’s also not unusual for stocks to rally in the early stages of a tightening cycles. Among five Federal Open Market Committee meetings since 1990 when an initial rate hike was announced, four saw gains in the S&P 500. Often it was pronouncements about the economy’s health that spurred the advances.
Wednesday’s rebound in risk appetite lands in a market where conviction is lacking. The murkiness of the outlook for growth, inflation and interest rates -- as well as the war in Europe -- has translated into extreme swings in asset prices. Though it fell while Powell spoke, the Cboe Volatility Index has spent most of the last two weeks above 30, exceeding its historical average. Speculation that the Ukraine invasion would worsen inflation contributed to a stretch of futility that saw the S&P 500 slump in nine of 11 days through Monday.
In the eyes of Cetera Investment Management’s Gene Goldman, there’s more turbulence to come as policy makers navigate that landscape.
“The Fed is suffering from blissful ignorance,” said Goldman, the firm’s chief investment officer. “How can they expect to dramatically raise rates in the next two years -- I think ten times for this year and next year in total -- but they don’t expect the unemployment rate to move higher, they expect economic growth to not be impacted that much?”
Powell indirectly addressed those concerns, noting that financial conditions “have already incorporated a significant number of rate increases.” Excluding the 2020 coronavirus shock, they sit near the tightest levels since 2018, according to the Bloomberg measure of U.S. financial conditions. 
Financial conditions -- a multi-input measure of stress across equity and credit markets -- is how monetary policy changes are transmitted to the real economy, Powell said Wednesday. Continued tightening may allow the Fed to hike less overall, especially as the Fed begins to whittle down its massive balance sheet, according to Adam Phillips of EP Wealth Advisors. 
“Financial conditions allowed the Fed to get away with quarter-point hike today,” said Phillips, managing director of portfolio strategy at EP Wealth Advisors. “We learned today that the Fed could start shrinking the size of its balance sheet as early as May, so we will be interested to see how this amplifies the impact of policy tightening coming from higher rates.”

97,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 04:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico should enact a series of reforms to boost the country's low productivity, the World Bank said in a report released on Wednesday.
It said the need for change was ""more important than ever"" as the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated long-standing structural challenges to productivity growth. 
The financial institution, which seeks to fight poverty worldwide, said that Mexico lacks the capital to propel economic growth. 
Central bank member Jonathan Heath similarly said in February the country lacked a ""growth engine"" and the private investment needed to up the country's gross domestic product (GDP).
The World Bank called for an end to market concentration in Mexico and said that while large firms control much of the country's economic power, they do not grow quickly enough or create enough jobs. 

If the Latin American nation had followed the United States' recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, Mexico's productivity would be 9% higher, the report said. 
In an accompanying event in Mexico on Wednesday, the country's Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio said that the hit to global value chains initially caused by the COVID-19 pandemic would likely be prolonged due to Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine.

98,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 03:47PM ET</span>","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The poorest will be the hardest hit across Latin America and the Caribbean by the economic fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the region facing further inflationary pressure, a senior official at the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday.
""High inflation, especially food inflation, affects the poor in our region the most. So that's the main challenge that the region will face,"" Ilan Goldfajn, the head of the IMF's Western Hemisphere Department, told Reuters.
The cost of U.S. crude oil jumped to its highest level since 2008 earlier this month, while the price of wheat, for which Ukraine and Russia account for 30% of global exports, reached a record high.
The current spike in wheat prices was triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions on Moscow and trade disruptions that followed. The World Bank said a number of developing countries face near-term wheat supply shortages due to their dependence on Ukrainian exports.
Russia was the top wheat exporter in 2018 and Ukraine the fifth largest, according to World Bank data. 
""You're having an inflation of food and energy on top of a high inflation legacy of the previous (COVID-related) shock,"" Goldfajn said.
The supply chain bottlenecks linked to the pandemic had already sent Latin America on a monetary-tightening path, with all the major central banks raising interest rates, both to fight inflation and protect against an expected outflow of capital chasing returns in developed countries.
Now they might have to tighten further.
""We expect that given the main channel (of economic transmission) of the conflict is inflation in energy and food, central banks will end up having to react and further defend their credibility,"" Goldfajn said, adding that so far inflation expectations in the region remain anchored.
A further ratcheting up of borrowing costs, the income-corrosive effects of inflation and a slowing global economy could undermine growth in the region, said Goldfajn.
With inflation-adjusted income falling and the global economy decelerating, Latin America faces a similar backdrop as it did in 2018-2019, when citizens took to the streets in protests that only stopped when pandemic lockdowns were imposed in 2020.
""Governments should continue strengthening the well-targeted social safety nets, trying to expand them and expand the coverage and reach,"" Goldfajn said.
More social spending might be a tall order for governments facing higher borrowing costs and stretched fiscal positions after two years of lockdowns, especially in many countries in the Caribbean and Central America, where commodities are mostly imported.
For some other nations in South America, the increase in commodity prices could be a macroeconomic lifeline, even as consumers get hit.
As the region's largest grains exporters, Argentina and Brazil could benefit, while Colombia could take advantage of its oil exports. Chile's mining capacity should also be a tailwind.

""The human suffering in the conflict and the negative global shock does not benefit anybody,"" said Goldfajn.
""When you look at South America, (they) export commodities that are exactly the ones that are being affected globally, so you do have mitigating factors. But you need to be able to seize the opportunity.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's public health governance is expected to come under acute pressure in coming weeks as the biggest wave of COVID-19 cases since the 2020 Wuhan outbreak stretches medical resources, tests the country's ability to contain infections and strains the economy. 
In the past 10 weeks, China has reported more new local symptomatic cases - more than 14,000 - than in all of 2021 amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, fuelling fears of hard lockdowns of cities and economic instability. 
Some parts of China are already feeling the crunch as they scramble to test local populations and quarantine the infected under China's strict COVID-19 playbook, despite relatively low caseloads by global standards. 
In the northeastern province of Jilin, the hardest-hit region in the current outbreak, affected cities are racing to prepare temporary hospitals. A local official said on Tuesday the province's epidemic prevention supplies will run dry in two to three days. 
""The next two weeks are key to determining whether existing policies can really be effective in curbing infection growth or even reaching completely zero cases in one city as we saw last year,"" said Chen Zhengmin, professor of epidemiology at the University of Oxford. 
China has stood firmly by its ""dynamic"" zero-COVID policy - rigorously identifying infections and blocking them as they emerge but not insisting on zero infections - for both public health and political reasons. 
Although China has a vaccination rate of nearly 90%, Chinese experts said not enough elderly people have received boosters, risking deaths and severe cases. It is also unclear how well Chinese vaccines reduce the risk of developing the disease caused by the Omicron variant. 
China's leadership has staked much on its COVID-19 battle, and would be loath to alter course in a sensitive year when President Xi Jinping is set to secure a third term.
""Preventing and controlling epidemics has become more difficult,"" National Health Commission spokesperson Mi Feng said on Tuesday. But he stressed ""it has been proved in practice"" that China's current virus measures are still effective against Omicron.
The country is also struggling to balance pandemic measures with an economic recovery. Citi analysts estimate the latest wave will shave 0.5-0.8 percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. 
China should consider less disruptive or resource-consuming measures, including allowing asymptomatic infections to quarantine at home, though such a move is unlikely to happen soon, some experts say.
""The old way has been very effective, regardless of the cost, and [epidemic prevention] is the biggest political task,"" Chen said. ""Also, if such a change is made, the general public might misinterpret that as giving up.""
Some experts already say China's COVID approach is no longer sustainable. 
Kyoto University professor Hiroshi Nishiura, who led an early Wuhan study in 2020, said he was ""not very optimistic,"" even if strict lockdowns slow the spread. 
""Multiple introductions (of Omicron) in mainland China would be unavoidable,"" Nishiura said. 
(GRAPHIC: COVID-19 cases in mainland China (2021-2022) - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/CHINA/znvnenaadpl/chart.png) 
HIGH STAKES
China is trying to strike a balance between targeted curbs to stop the virus's spread and ensuring disruptions do not worsen an already uncertain economic outlook. 
Shanghai and Shenzhen have adopted tougher restrictions rare for those two cities - one closing all primary, middle and high schools and the other suspending non-essential businesses - but stopped short of a harsh lockdown such as the one in Wuhan in 2020. 
China's COVID-19 policy has not completely broken down, but daily increases of over 1,000 cases are a warning sign, said University of Hong Kong professor Jin Dong-Yan. 
To bolster China's testing ability, authorities last week approved the use of self-administered antigen testing kits as a supplement to polymerase chain reaction tests.
China said late on Tuesday that patients with mild symptoms will be quarantined at centralised facilities, revising an earlier requirement of moving them to hospitals, in response to concerns about medical resources.
""The worst-case scenario for them is that Omicron will overload the Chinese health-care system, and the entire country is inundated with COVID cases,"" said Huang Yanzhong, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.
In mainland China, the official death toll has been largely static since 2020, with only two fatalities reported in 2021 and none this year.
The elderly in China are vulnerable to Omicron variants, so ""a substantial number of cases and deaths would be expected,"" said Kyoto University's Nishiura. 
ECONOMIC TOLL
There are signs some cities are taking a harder line. 
Shenzhen, home to about 17.6 million people, said on Monday only one member of a household could venture out every two to three days to stock up on necessities. 
""I think there is no way to stop Omicron now,"" said Peter, 49, a Shenzhen resident and owner of a VR startup. ""The only way is to maintain normalcy and welcome the virus. You see abroad, the coronavirus is like a cold. Many people have recovered and travelled everywhere. Why are we trapped here?""
In Shanghai, 106 international inbound flights scheduled from March 21 and May 1 will be diverted to other Chinese cities.
Businesses from automaker BYD to KFC operator Yum China say their operations have already been hit, with more disruptions expected as cases mount.
In the locked-down city of Changchun, the impact of curbs has been hard. 

Guo, owner of a pedicure and beauty salon, said she was worried about her loans and her workers' salaries.
""I'm feeling very overwhelmed right now,"" Guo said. ""Only those who are in an epidemic zone would understand this feeling.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The economic cost of Russia's assault on Ukraine was further exposed on Wednesday as the sanctions-hit country teetered on the brink of its first default on international debt since the Bolshevik revolution. 
Moscow is due to pay $117 million in interest on two dollar-denominated sovereign bonds it sold in 2013. But the limits it now faces in making payments, and talk from the Kremlin that it might pay in roubles - triggering a default anyway - has left even veteran investors guessing at what might happen.
One described it as the most closely watched government debt payment since Greece's default at the height of the euro zone crisis. Others said a grace period that allows Russia another 30 days to make the payment could drag the saga out.
""The thing about defaults is that they are never clear-cut and this is no exception,"" said Pictet emerging market portfolio manager Guido Chamorro. 
""There is a grace period, so we are not really going to know whether this is a default or not until April 15,"" he said referring to the situation if no coupon payment is made. ""Anything could happen in the grace period.""
Creditors had not received funds by close of business in London, two sources familiar with the situation said. 
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov meanwhile said Moscow had made the payment which had reached the correspondent American bank, and it was now down to Washington to clarify whether settlement is possible.
A default by the Russian government was unthinkable until what Russian President Vladimir Putin calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine began in late February.
It had nearly $650 billion of gold and foreign currency reserves, investment-grade credit ratings with S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch, and was raking in hundreds of millions of dollars a day selling its oil and gas at soaring prices.
Then the tanks rolled and the United States, Europe and their Western allies fired back with unprecedented sanctions that froze two-thirds of Russia's reserves which it turned out were held overseas. 
""I think the market now expects Russia not to make the (bond) payments,"" said the head of emerging market debt at Aegon (NYSE:AEG) Asset Management, Jeff Grills, adding that the conflict was one of the few emerging market events capable of really unsettling global markets. 
That is because Russia's role as one of the world's top commodity producers has sent prices and global inflation skywards.
At the same time it has left Russia a virtual pariah state, crippled by sanctions and watching hundreds of the world's largest firms quit the country after deciding their presence there is no longer feasible.
DEFAULT SCENARIOS
As for Russia's battered government bonds, most are now changing hands at just 10%-20% of their face value.
The two payments on Wednesday are the first of several, with another $615 million due over the rest of March, and the first ""principal"" - final full payment of a bond - on April 4 worth $2 billion alone.
Experienced investors see three potential scenarios for how Wednesday's crucial deadline plays out.
The first is that Moscow pays in full and in dollars, meaning default worries go away for the time being. 
Big Russian energy providers Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and Rosneft have both made payments on international bonds over the last 10 days so there is still a sliver of hope it could be done if Moscow feels it is in its interests.
The second possibility is that Moscow doesn't pay, starting the 30-day grace period countdown clock until default. 
A third option where Russia pays but in roubles is also possible, although the legal terms of the bonds would mean that is still tantamount to a default. The 30-day grace rule would still apply.

""Maybe we will know today (if they pay) but maybe we won't,"" said Pictet's Chamorro. His firm doesn't hold the bonds, but does hold other Russian debt - and when a country defaults on one of its bonds it tends to mean all its bonds ""cross default"". 
""In situations like these it's safest to expect the unexpected. You can't really rule anything out"".

COLOMBO (Reuters) -Sri Lanka will work with the International Monetary Fund to help solve the country's economic crisis, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa said on Wednesday, setting a target of cutting its trade deficit by about 14% this year.
The Indian Ocean nation's foreign exchange reserves have fallen 70% in the past two years to about $2.31 billion, leaving it struggling to pay for essential imports, including food and fuel.
""I have decided to work with them after examining the advantages and disadvantages,"" Rajapaksa said in an address to the island nation of 22 million people.
""We must take action to increase our foreign exchange reserves. To this end, we have initiated discussions with international financial institutions as well as with our friendly countries regarding repayment of our loan installments.""
Sri Lanka has already received financial support from China and India in the form of credit lines and currency swaps.
Rajapaksa said Sri Lanka would try to reduce the trade deficit to $7 billion this year from $8.1 billion last year. He said the government was expecting $5 billion in remittances to shore up state finances, nearly the same as last year.
If the IMF programme goes ahead, it would be Sri Lanka’s 17th financial rescue package from the global lender that generally comes with a lot of conditions https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/02/21/28/IMF-Conditionality, such as sticking to fiscal goals.
Analysts say the country will have to agree to a strong reform package that could include transparent energy pricing, reforming of state enterprises and new taxes to boost government revenue.
""Going to the IMF is a positive decision,"" said Dimantha Mathew, head of research at First Capital.

""But it is critical that debt repayment is stopped, and some level of debt restructuring is done because Sri Lanka's main problem is high levels of debt.""
The president identified rising fuel costs as the most serious issue faced by his country.

""We have to prepare for a long crisis,"" Prime Minister Jean Castex told a news conference as he presented the new ""resilience plan"".
""We must prepare without delay measures to limit the impact on our companies, our jobs and our purchasing power"", he told journalists.
With a presidential election looming next month, the government already last year capped gas and power price increases and offered financial handouts to low-income households to cope with higher energy prices and inflation.
As the Ukraine crisis puts additional pressure on prices, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that the additional measures would bring the total bill to 25-26 billion euros ($27.5-$28.6 billion).
Among the new measures, Castex said the government would cover more than half of the cost of companies' increase in their gas and power bills to help absorb losses they would have otherwise suffered.
Meanwhile, firms struggling with high energy prices or the loss of export markets would be able to get tax and payroll charges postponed.
Castex said that the government would also prolong and expand state-guaranteed loans set up during the COVID-19 crisis as well as reactivate a subsidised furlough scheme for firms suffering from a drop in client demand.
With fuel prices at a record high, a 15 cent per litre fuel discount announced this weekend would be broadened to include natural gas used in vehicles while TotalEnergies had indicated it would add an additional discount at its petrol stations, Castex said.

The new package also included measures targetting the fishing, road transport and construction sectors.

104,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 12:09PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden will outline U.S. assistance to Ukraine on Wednesday, following an emotional appeal from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for Biden to lead the world in punishing Moscow for its invasion.
Zelenskiy pleaded with the U.S. in a speech to Congress to vastly expand the economic consequences for Russia’s invasion, including by closing its ports to all Russian goods and providing Ukraine with fighter jets. After showing lawmakers a graphic video of Ukrainian casualties in the war, including children, Zelenskiy addressed Biden directly in English: “Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.”
The White House is touting $1 billion in security assistance the U.S. has authorized for Ukraine in the past week, bringing the total for the last year to $2 billion. Officials note that the U.S. is the largest single donor of such aid to Ukraine. 
Biden on Tuesday signed a $1.5 trillion government funding bill, and on Wednesday authorized spending $800 million on security assistance. On Saturday, he signed off an additional $200 million for arms and equipment as part of a stopgap spending bill.
Still, the assistance falls short of Zelenskiy’s biggest requests -- a no-fly zone over Ukraine or the transfer of fighter jets from NATO countries -- neither of which the White House has agreed to.
Zelenskiy on Wednesday urged lawmakers to remember the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York and Washington as it weighs more aid.
“Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people,” Zelenskiy said following a standing ovation from lawmakers.
The Ukrainian leader, who at first spoke through an interpreter and then later switched to English, continued his calls for a no-fly zone over his country but added, “If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative,” stressing that the country needs more air defense systems like the S-300.
The previous U.S. assistance included about 600 Stinger antiaircraft systems, 2,600 Javelin anti-armor systems, an undisclosed number of helicopters and patrol boats, 200 machine guns, 200 grenade launchers, and 40 million rounds of small-arms ammunition, Biden officials said.
NBC reported Tuesday that the Biden administration was considering providing Ukraine with U.S.-made armed drones. Ukraine has already used Turkish-made drones to great effect against Russian armored vehicles, according to Western military officials.

The White House also is stressing what it is willing to do diplomatically and on a humanitarian basis to demonstrate support for Ukraine, announcing Tuesday that Biden will fly to Brussels next week for “extraordinary summit” with NATO allies. And he held an event Tuesday -- with a crowd of reporters watching -- to sign into law the government spending bill that includes a total of $13.6 billion in humanitarian, economic and defense aid for Ukraine.

(Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) are preparing to cut tens of thousands of jobs combined this year in one of their biggest layoff rounds as the internet firms try to cope with China's sweeping regulatory crackdown, sources said.
While Alibaba is yet to specify a group-wide target for the layoffs, China's biggest e-commerce company could ultimately axe more than 15% of its total workforce, or about 39,000 staff, estimated one of the sources with knowledge of the company's plans. 
Tencent, the owner of China's dominant messaging app WeChat, also plans to make employees redundant this year in some of its business units, said three separate sources with knowledge of the matter. Its unit overseeing businesses including video streaming and search will see a 10%-15% headcount cut this year, said one of the three people.
Alibaba and Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The job cuts at the two companies would be their first major layoffs since Chinese regulators launched an unprecedented campaign a year-and-a-half ago to rein in its internet giants after years of laissez-faire approach that drove growth at breakneck speed.
The regulatory crackdown, coupled with a slowing economy, has sharply slowed sales growth for most of the internet companies, smashed their share prices, and made new capital raising and business expansion much tougher in the world's second-largest economy, forcing companies such as Alibaba and Tencent to look for ways to cut operating costs.
Alibaba started to fire employees last month, the first source said. It discussed job cuts with several business units last month and left it to them to make specific plans, the source added. 
Some business units have moved fast since then.
Its local consumer services segment, which includes food delivery business Ele.me and other groceries delivery and mapping services, intends to lay off up to 25% of its employees, said the second source.
The company's video streaming unit Youku is planning layoffs too, according to another source. That includes the planned dismissal of a team responsible for producing shows for kids, the source said. 
Alibaba reported in February its slowest quarterly revenue growth since going public in 2014, hit by a fall in sales at its core business segment and intensifying competition. Its stock has tumbled more than 60% since the beginning of last year. 
The company has been under pressure since late 2020 when its billionaire founder Jack Ma publicly criticised China's regulatory system, triggering a chain of events that saw Beijing slapping the firm with a record $2.8 billion fine and introducing a series of new rules for its internet sector.
Alibaba, whose total headcount more than doubled to 251,462 last year from 2019, won't be wielding the jobs axe indiscriminately. Two separate sources said staff at growth engine Alibaba Cloud have not been informed of layoffs yet.
PREPARING FOR 'WINTER' 
According to the sources with knowledge of Tencent's plan, layoffs at the company are also set to start at its less profitable or loss-making businesses such as Tencent Video and Tencent Cloud. 
During an internal meeting at Tencent at the end of 2021, chief executive Pony Ma told staff that the company should prepare itself for a ""winter"", according to two other sources who said this prompted insecurity among some staff about their jobs.
Tencent had 94,182 employees as of June last year compared with 70,756 a year earlier, according to its 2021 interim report. (For an interactive graphic on Chinese tech giants, click https://tmsnrt.rs/3w7z4oF) 
China's biggest ride-hailing firm Didi Global Inc is also planning to reduce its overall headcount by as much as 15% as its domestic business has been impacted by the crackdown, said another person with direct knowledge of the matter.

Didi, which has been subjected to a cybersecurity probe after its $4.4 billion New York listing last year, aims to complete the layoffs by the end of March, said the source.
Didi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

While short-term political considerations will keep anti-euro EU members on their current trajectory for now, longer-term views about the merits of closer cooperation are being tested, according to EBRD President Odile Renaud-Basso.  
“There will be a lot of solidarity on how to deal with the consequences of the crisis and, in my view, that’s clearly a push toward a more united Europe and more integration,” she said in an interview in Warsaw.
Currencies of EU members with independent central banks have been hit hard by the nearby military conflict. Poland’s zloty and Hungary’s forint plunged to record lows against the euro in past days.
Some countries, including Romania and non-EU member Serbia, keep strict control over their currencies amid concern over depreciation.
Others, including Croatia and Bulgaria, are already on track to join the single-currency bloc in what Renaud-Basso sees as a “new wave of euro enlargement.” 
Authorities in Poland, the region’s biggest economy, said last week the war in Ukraine wasn’t a reason to reconsider its resolutely anti-euro stance.
The EBRD last week announced 2 billion euro ($2.2 billion) in financing for Ukraine and countries affected by refugees.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The World Bank on Wednesday said a number of developing countries face near-term wheat supply shortages due to their high dependence on Ukrainian wheat exports that have been disrupted by Russia's invasion.
The World Bank said in its latest Trade Watch report that Gambia, Lebanon, Moldova, Djibouti, Libya, Tunisia and Pakistan are the most exposed to the disruptions of wheat exports from Ukraine, which make up roughly 40% or more of their wheat imports.
""These importers will have trouble quickly switching to alternative sources, possibly leading to supply shortages in the short run,"" the World Bank said.
The grain supply situation has been worsened by Russia's imposition of export curbs on wheat and other cereal grains to countries outside of fellow Eurasian Economic Union members Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
Russia was the top wheat exporter in 2018 and Ukraine the fifth largest, according to World Bank data. The two countries together make up about a quarter of world exports.
Western sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine do not specifically target Russian grain exports, but sanctions that prohibit dollar and euro transactions with top Russian banks make trade finance more difficult.
Aside from the direct supply shortages to Ukraine's biggest grain customers, higher market prices for wheat will affect middle-income countries across the globe, the World Bank report said.
The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization's Cereal Price Index https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en in February was up 14.8% from a year earlier, and the World Bank said wheat futures prices had surged 60% since the start of the conflict.
""Moreover, disruptions to exports of wheat will affect markets for corn and rice, which are wheat substitutes, benefiting net exporters and harming net importers of those products,"" the bank added.

Disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine also could challenge a strong global trade recovery in 2021, with goods and services trade now exceeding pre-pandemic levels, the World Bank said.
Overall trade in 2021 surged by 26% over 2020 levels and by 17% over 2019 levels, with trade values exceeding 2019 levels in all regions, except for transportation equipment, the World Bank said.

Primary energy expenditure as a share of output is set to double from 2021’s level of just 6.5%, according to analysis by consultancy Thunder Said Energy. Soaring commodity costs are pushing up inflation and adding to bills for households and industry alike.
“Curtailing demand is the only short-term option to alleviate shortages,” wrote Rob West, a former Redburn analyst and the founder of Thunder Said Energy. “There are no good options here, only ‘less bad’ ones.”
Energy commodity costs have soared on supply concerns and the Ukraine war, with natural gas prices in Europe up more than 500% from this time last year. Russia’s lower Oil production might also add to price inflation, as the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday that output could slump by about a quarter next month.
The 13% level for 2022 just matches the proportion of GDP in 1980, a period when oil prices were soaring. 
West’s report assumes ranges of $250-300 a ton for coal, $125-150 a barrel for oil and $40-45 per thousand cubic feet for gas. “So this is not an ‘oil shock’ or a ‘gas shock’ but an ‘everything shock’,” he wrote.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog said on Wednesday it is talking to fund managers about how to handle Russian assets rendered worthless by sanctions, joining its counterparts in Luxembourg and elsewhere.
The Financial Conduct Authority said the discussions focus on the optional use of ""side pockets"" in investment funds to segregate Russian and Belarusian assets, originally worth hundreds of millions of pounds but now suspended due to sanctions, from other core investments.
Luxembourg's markets watchdog, the CSSF, in a statement to Reuters also confirmed it was considering their use in relation to EU-regulated funds known as UCITS exposed to investments in illiquid Russian securities. 
The FCA said it was discussing options to allow UK authorised retail funds to make exceptional use of side pockets ""given the significant practical challenges in disposing of Russian and Belarusian assets in the context of suspensions and extensive global sanctions"".
The Investment Association said it was a potential solution for funds suspended due to the war in Ukraine.
""Ensuring they work appropriately and all investors are treated fairly will be paramount,"" IA CEO Chris Cummings said.
Side pockets would allow new investors to enter a fund without getting exposure to Russian assets, and allow existing investors to redeem the rest of their investment, the FCA said in a statement.
The Russian assets would have zero value in many cases, while retaining rights to any eventual value, such as if sanctions were lifted and trading in the assets resumed.
Side pockets were used by hedge funds in the global financial crisis, and have also been used by catastrophe bond fund managers when they faced large losses due to natural catastrophes like hurricanes.
Their use in the European Union, where Luxembourg and Dublin are major fund centres, hinges on national regulators.
The Central Bank of Ireland said side pockets are permissible for hedge funds and other alternative investment funds, but not for UCITS.

Side pockets are available in France, but a source familiar with the situation said they have not yet been used by funds exposed to Russian assets.

The economic cost of Russia's actions in Ukraine has been fully exposed as President Vladimir Putin's sanctions-ravaged government teeters on the brink of its first international debt default since the Bolshevik revolution.
Speaking in an interview with RT Arabic, Siluanov said Russia had sent an order on Monday to a correspondent bank for the payment of $117 million in coupons, and that it was now up to authorities in the United States on whether to accept it.
""The capability or incapability of meeting our obligations in foreign currency equivalent does not depend on us, we have the money, we have made the payment, now the ball is in the court, primarily, of the American authorities,"" Siluanov said.
Sanctions have cut Russia off from key parts of global financial markets and have frozen nearly half of the country's $640 billion gold and foreign exchange reserves. Siluanov said the block on its dollar account meant there were risks the payment would not reach the final, intended recipients.
""The payment has reached the correspondent American bank,"" Siluanov said. ""At the moment the payment is being processed and we do not yet have reports on whether it has gone through or not. It has not been cleared yet.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida signalled a fresh stimulus package on Wednesday, saying the government is ready to take further steps to cushion the economic blow from rising energy costs driven by the Ukraine crisis.
While a weak yen is playing some part in driving up import costs in Japan, global commodity inflation is largely to blame for pushing up energy and food bills, Kishida said.
With an upper house election looming later this year, Kishida is under pressure from politicians to ramp up spending to ease the pain for households and retailers still suffering from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
""We'll need to take further steps, all available measures, to protect the economy and people's livelihood if the spike in prices continue,"" Kishida told a news briefing.
The Kyodo news agency reported on Wednesday that Tokyo is considering compiling a fresh stimulus package that includes an extension of temporary subsidies given to energy wholesalers that expire at the end of this month.
The ruling coalition, together with the opposition Democratic Party for the People (DPFP), agreed on Wednesday to look into unfreezing a ""trigger clause"" that removes the gasoline tax when the price exceeds 160 yen ($1.35) for more than three months, DPFP Secretary General Kazuya Shimba said.
""The government will consider what the most effective steps would be in addressing higher fuel costs, including the possibility of unfreezing the trigger clause,"" Kishida said.
The clause was frozen in 2011 to secure funds to rebuild Japan after it was hit by devastating earthquake and tsunami.

The government is cautious about unfreezing it for fear of losing tax revenue, and had instead offered temporary subsidies to energy wholesalers to cap gasoline prices. [T9N2U1022]

China's property market chilled last year as Beijing's deleveraging campaign triggered a liquidity crisis at some major property developers, resulting in bond defaults and projects being shelved or left unfinished.
Overall demand remains sluggish, though a slew of measures have been put in place to revive buying interest.
New home prices stalled in February after edging up a month earlier, official data on Wednesday showed.
The implementation of a property tax faces challenges, including macroeconomic pressures and downward pressure on the real estate market, said Yan Yuejin, research director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development.
""This move is bound to reduce home buyers' concerns,"" said Yan, adding it was also favourable for real estate companies.
Chinese vice premier Liu He on Wednesday urged government bodies to roll out market-friendly policies and ""cautiously"" introduce measures that risk hurting markets. He also pledged to tackle risks in the property sector.
China will implement city-specific policies to promote the healthy development of the property sector, Premier Li Keqiang told the annual meeting of parliament earlier in March.
In 2011, China launched a property tax pilot in Shanghai and Chongqing, and the idea of rolling out a new trial has been resisted by stakeholders including local governments that rely heavily on land sales as a source of financing.
In October, the top decision-making body of parliament said it would roll out a pilot real estate tax in some regions, but did not identify the regions or give other details.

Most analysts were expecting the property tax to be delayed, according to a Reuters poll last month.
At the annual meeting of parliament earlier this month, China omitted a potential property tax in its 2022 legislative plan for the third consecutive year.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan will revoke Russia's most-favoured nation trade status as part of further sanctions against Moscow following the invasion of Ukraine, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Wednesday.
Tokyo will also ramp up sanctions by expanding the scope of asset freezes against Russian elites and banning imports of certain products from the country, Kishida said.
""Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a historic atrocity,"" Kishida told a news conference. ""We're taking necessary steps including sanctions to apply further pressure on Russia.""
The moves are in line with an announcement on Friday by the United States and its allies to escalate their economic pressure on Russia, which amount to a fourth set of sanctions against the country over the Feb. 24 invasion.
Russia calls its action in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour.
Japan will also coordinate with other Group of Seven nations to prevent Russia from tapping loans from the International Monetary Fund and other global lenders, Kishida said.
He did not clarify which goods will see tariffs raised from the revocation of the most-favoured status.
But the Mainichi newspaper reported the move would lead to higher tariffs for certain seafood products such as sea urchins and crab imported from Russia. 

In 2021, Russia accounted for 81% of sea urchins and 47.6% of crab imported by Japan, according to government data.
Japan has already slapped sanctions on Russia-bound exports of chips and high-tech equipment, as well as on dozens of Russian and Belarusian officials, business executives and banks by freezing their assets.

On the other hand, Indian bonds suffered outflows of $421 million after an inflow of $698 million in the previous month.
""Considering that the Russia-Ukraine conflict occurred in the second half of February, whole-month bond flow figures may not reflect the full impact on foreign demand for Asia bonds,"" said Duncan Tan, a strategist at DBS Bank.

FRANKFURT/MADRID (Reuters) - European Union regulators have told some banks to scrutinise transactions by all Russian and Belarusian clients, including EU residents, to ensure that they are not used to circumvent Western sanctions against Moscow, three sources told Reuters.
The instructions from European Central Bank (ECB) supervisors mean tens of thousands of Russians and Belarusians resident in the EU face intense surveillance by their banks, which are on alert for big payments and deposits as well as new credit applications, the sources familiar with the matter said.
While EU sanctions against Moscow exempt people holding temporary or permanent EU residence permits, they place some restrictions on access by Russian nationals to banking services, including preventing banks from accepting deposits above 100,000 euros ($110,000) from Russian nationals or entities. 
The ECB move brings even EU residents under heightened scrutiny and would make it harder for them to operate bank accounts, with one of the sources saying some were already facing restrictions in Spain. This follows Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which the Kremlin describes as a special operation to demilitarise and ""deNazify"" the country.
The ECB is checking that banks which it supervises ""have in place the necessary arrangements to adhere to the sanctions"", including with regards to transactions and relationships with clients, but it has not issued any guideline beyond the EU's rules, a spokesperson for the Frankfurt-based central bank said.
Some ECB Joint Supervisory Teams, which include staff from the central bank and national authorities, have told banks to tighten control of EU residents too if they come from Russia or Belarus, the three sources, from banks and watchdogs, said.
While it is not the ECB's role to police sanctions, the supervisors are concerned that banks in the bloc could incur hefty fines if their clients channel money on behalf of sanctioned individuals, two of the sources said. 
    Supervisors informed the affected banks between the end of February and early March and gave them a week to comply, two of the sources said, adding an audit of responses is planned. It was not immediately clear when this would be completed.
""At first, the measures were focused on those of Russian nationality, whether they were residents or non-residents, and later it was extended to Belarusians,"" one of the sources said.
Most Russians living in the EU are resident in Germany, where Eurostat says there are more than 230,000, followed by Spain, with more than 81,000. Other popular places are France, Italy, Latvia, Czech Republic, Austria and Finland. 
Belarusians living in the EU are chiefly in Germany, Lithuania and Italy, the Eurostat data shows.
'EXISTING RISKS'
    In one instance, a Spanish bank has put around 8,000 Russian clients who are not on the EU sanctions list and are residing in Spain under surveillance, one of the sources said. 
All new lending to Russians who do not have Spanish residency has been halted and at least one bank will not allow non-resident Russians to open new accounts, they added.
Italian banks, too, were monitoring all accounts above 100,000 euros held by Russian clients even if they were living in the EU and were not on the sanctions list, a fourth source familiar with the situation said.
    Asked if lenders were intensifying scrutiny of Russian clients, the Bank of Spain told Reuters that both supervisors and banks were ""carrying out the necessary controls to assess the situation and the possible existing risks"".       
    The Bank of Italy declined to comment.
While the banks affected do not have to stop transfers, the first three sources said they must make additional checks to establish the source of the money, its destination and purpose.

Supervisors also told banks they should take extra care with loan applications from Russians or Belarusians, they added. 
    However, one of the sources said there is nothing to stop banks from granting credit to a well-established Russian customer who is not subject to sanctions.

Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates for the first time in over three years - but how many more hikes will the central bank guide for this year? Retail sales data for February are due. China's government and central bank promise support to the economy and to financial markets, triggering the biggest one-day rally in Chinese stocks in years. U.S. stocks are set to build on Tuesday's gains as oil remains under pressure, relieving some of the fears about stagflation. And the Russian Federation is expected to miss payments on its international debt for the first time.  Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 16th March. 
1. Fed set to start rate hike cycle; February retail sales due
The Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates for the first time since 2018 when it winds up its regular policy meeting at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT).
Consensus expectations are for a 25 basis point increase in the fed funds target range, taking it to 0.25%-0.5%.  A bigger hike of 50 basis points hasn’t been entirely ruled out but would go against the guidance given by Chairman Jerome Powell at his recent Congressional testimony. Wall Street analysts suggest the Fed will raise rates by some 150-175 basis points in all this year, as well as starting the run-off of the massive bond portfolio it has accumulated over the last two years.
A minority argues that such dramatic tightening won’t be necessary, due to the economic slowdown to be expected from the impact of war in Ukraine and higher energy prices. February’s retail sales data, due at 8:30 AM ET, may throw some light on how much the U.S. consumer has been affected so far by such factors.
2. Team China charges to the rescue 
China’s stock markets roared to their biggest one-day gain in years after coordinated statements from the central bank and the government promising support both to the economy in general and – in a rare move – to financial markets in particular.
Chinese stocks had slumped in recent days on a combination of fears over Covid-related lockdowns, regulatory campaigns against tech companies, and the threat of delisting from U.S. exchanges. The property sector continues to suffer from a much-needed deleveraging process, meanwhile.
The statements from the government promised a measured approach to domestic regulation and said progress was being made in talks with the U.S. 
3. Stocks set to open higher as oil slides again
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher later, with early trading set to be dominated by the retail sales numbers and later developments completely dependent on the Fed.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 330 points, or 1.0%, while S&P 500 futures were up 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.8%. All three indices had risen sharply on Tuesday as the slump in oil prices assuaged one of the market’s biggest fears.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN), which reports earnings on the same day as the National Association of Home Builders releases its monthly report on the housing market. Chinese ADRs, meanwhile, look set for the mother of all bounces. 
4. Ukrainian peace talks continue as Russia prepares to miss payment on foreign debt
Ukrainian and Russian officials continued to strike a more positive tone in their comments regarding the possibility of a ceasefire and a diplomatic solution to the war, although the difficult choreography of such comments ensures that there are always conflicting statements to be found.
In an interview with the Russian media company RBC, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov echoed comments from a top advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that there are areas of progress and opportunities for compromise (Zelensky repeated his admission that NATO membership for Ukraine is impossible in the foreseeable future on Tuesday). Lavrov said a neutrality model akin to that of Austria and Sweden after World War 2 is on the table.
However, in comments late on Tuesday, President Vladimir Putin had said Ukraine was “not serious” in wanting a ceasefire, and officials announced a counteroffensive had started in several areas. Zelensky is due to make a virtual address to Congress today and is likely to repeat his determination to carry on the conflict.
Elsewhere, the Russian government is likely to miss interest payments on its international debt later, given that it has signalled its intention to make payments only in rubles. In contrast to its 1998 default, this would be a default of choice, rather than the result of an inability to pay.
5. Oil slides as IEA slashes demand outlook, Iran signals closing in on nuclear deal
Crude oil prices edged down in volatile trading, extending Tuesday’s slump on fears for the trajectory of Chinese demand as Iran announced the release of two Western citizens in a move that appeared to be a prelude to lifting the sanctions related to its nuclear program.
The International Energy Agency earlier revised down its estimate of global oil demand this year by 1 million barrels a day due to the impact of the war in Ukraine and the Western sanctions that have accompanied it. It argued, however, that 3 million b/d of supply in Russia could be shut in from April as a result of the sanctions.
Elsewhere, the U.S. government will release its weekly oil inventories data, after a shocking 3.75 million build in crude stocks reported by the American Petroleum Institute suggested that record-high gasoline prices had finally had an effect on U.S. demand.
By 6:25 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 1.5% at $95.39 a barrel, while Brent crude futures were down 0.9% at $99.00 a barrel."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will work closely with G7 advanced economies to prevent Russia from tapping loans from the International Monetary Fund and other international lenders, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Wednesday.
In a news conference, Kishida also said he will expand the scope of asset freezes against Russian elites, and ban imports of certain products from Russia.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sanctions imposed on Russia could prod more countries like China to look at central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as a tool to counter the dollar's dominance in the global financial system, former Bank of Japan executive Hiromi Yamaoka said on Wednesday.
While sanctions using financial infrastructure are necessary in extreme cases like the Ukraine crisis, they are ""emergency means"" that should not be over-used, said Yamaoka, who is well versed in CBDC and global settlement affairs.
U.S. allies including Japan imposed a series of sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, including the freezing of the central bank's foreign assets and the removal of many Russian banks from the global payments system SWIFT.
""The most effective, powerful weapon was the freezing of Russia's foreign reserves,"" said Yamaoka, former head of the BOJ's payment and settlement systems department.
""It meant U.S. allies intentionally created a situation that pushes Russia into default,"" he told Reuters.
Yamaoka said it was unlikely crypto-currencies would serve as a useful loophole against sanctions for Russia, as they are too risky as a means to transfer huge amounts of funds.
But the Western sanctions on Russia underscored how politics and national security are increasingly affecting the world of finance including digital currencies, he said.
China's rapid progress in developing a digital yuan has alarmed some lawmakers in G7 advanced economies as a potential threat against the U.S. dollar's global hegemony.
U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order last week that requires the government to assess the risks and benefits of creating a central bank digital dollar.
""There's a chance a country like China could promote usage of digital yuan for cross-border transactions and create a currency bloc"" to counter the dollar's dominance, Yamaoka said.

""Defense and national security will likely become key themes when debating CBDC.""
During his stint at the BOJ, Yamaoka was directly in charge of the central bank's research on digital currencies including a joint experiment with the European Central Bank. He now chairs a group of banks and companies looking at building a common settlement infrastructure for digital payments.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sarah Bloom Raskin's decision Tuesday to withdraw her nomination as the Federal Reserve's Wall Street cop further delays rule changes that have been in limbo since Randal Quarles stepped down as vice chair for supervision in October.
A Fed controlled by Democrats will pursue the same broad agenda regardless of who is in the supervision seat, and staff and governors may be able to work on some measures while the White House figures out a new nominee, analysts said.
But major policy decisions will need to be led and backed by a confirmed Fed official to gain support in Congress. Here is the regulatory agenda that will fall to a confirmed vice chair: 
DE-REGULATION REDUX?
Over the past four years, Quarles led a review of regulations introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, arguing they were too blunt and onerous. Democrats accused Quarles of saving Wall Street billions of dollars while increasing systemic risks, and they want the Fed to revisit some of those changes.
Among the most contentious were revisions to the “Volcker Rule” curbing speculative bank investments; scrapping a requirement for big banks to hold capital against certain swap trades and stripping the Fed of its power to fail banks on their annual “stress tests” based on subjective concerns.
Whoever replaces Quarles would have to pick which of these to address. Even if Raskin had been confirmed quickly, the process of overhauling many of these rules was expected to be extremely time-consuming.
CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS
Climate change, a top policy priority for Democrats, is expected to rapidly rise on the Fed agenda under new leadership.
So far, the Fed has asked lenders to explain how they are mitigating climate change-related risks to their balance sheets, with the industry expecting to progress to a formal climate change scenario analysis in 2023, Reuters has reported. 
Those projects are expected to accelerate. The big question will be whether the Fed pushes for restrictions or stiffer capital requirements on banks with significant exposures to polluting industries or other climate-specific risks.
Fed officials may end up treading more carefully than progressives had hoped, as Raskin's nomination was ultimately sunk by concerns she would push too aggressively on climate risk.
BANK M&A
The delay in finding Quarles' replacement may compound a logjam in approving bank tie-ups since last year due to uncertainty over Fed personnel changes. 
Some pending deals have been approved following Fed Chair Jerome Powell's renomination, but the industry is still waiting for the Fed and the Justice Department to decide on a potential new policy for bank deals. The next regulatory chief is expected to lead the committee that scrutinizes potential tie-ups, suggesting any new merger policy may also need her backing. 
Without that certainty, bankers and lawyers have said they would be reluctant to pursue new tie-ups. 
FINTECH FRAMEWORK
The Fed is also expected to tackle a regulatory blueprint for ""fintech"" companies that are quickly chipping away at the traditional financial sector.
It's exploring how banks intersect with fintechs, particularly with smaller lenders that may outsource more services and infrastructure. Fintechs are also lobbying the Fed for access to its payments system.
While other banking regulators have worked for years to bring fintechs under their regulatory umbrella, the Fed has resisted, fearing doing so could create systemic risks. But as the sector continues to balloon, the Fed is expected to act.
SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO
Another issue on the table is the supplementary leverage ratio, a rule created after the decade-ago crisis requiring banks to hold capital against assets regardless of their risk.
The Fed had to temporarily ease that rule in the midst of the pandemic as a glut of bank deposits and Treasury bonds drove up capital requirements on what are viewed as safe assets.
Despite intense bank lobbying, the Fed let that relief expire last year but promised to review the overall rule. The Fed has yet to publish a proposal.
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT
The central bank will also play a key role in a long-awaited overhaul of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rules which promote lending in lower-income communities. 

The Fed, which shares responsibility for writing the rules with other bank regulators, hopes the CRA can be updated to reflect the growth in online banking, while still ensuring lenders make meaningful contributions to the poorer areas they serve.
A new Fed regulation chief would likely have to be in place before the Fed could sign off on the changes.

GENEVA (Reuters) -Nine out of 10 Ukrainians could face poverty and extreme economic vulnerability if the war drags on over the next year, wiping out two decades of economic gains, the U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) said on Wednesday.
Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator, said that his agency was working with the Kyiv government to avoid a worst case scenario of the economy collapsing. It aimed to provide cash transfers to families to buy food to survive and keep them from fleeing while propping up basic services.
""If the conflict is a protracted one, if it were to continue, we are going to see poverty rates escalate very significantly,"" Steiner told Reuters.
""Clearly the extreme end of the scenario is an implosion of the economy as a whole. And that could ultimately lead to up to 90% of people either being below the poverty line or being at high risk of (poverty),"" he said in a video interview from New York.
The poverty line is generally defined as purchasing power of $5.50 to $13 per person per day, he added in a video interview from New York. Before Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24, an estimated 2% of Ukrainians lived below the $5.50 line, he said.
Ukraine's top government economic adviser Oleg Ustenko said last Thursday that invading Russian forces have so far destroyed at least $100 billion worth of infrastructure and that 50% of Ukrainian businesses had shut down completely.
""We estimate that up to 18 years of development gains of Ukraine could be simply be wiped out in a matter of 12 to 18 months,"" Steiner said.
CASH TRANSFERS
UNDP is looking at ""tried and tested"" programmes that it has used in other conflict situations, he said.
""Cash transfers programmes particularly in a country such as Ukraine where the financial system and architecture is still functional, where ATMs are available, a critical way in which to reach people quickly is with cash transfers or a temporary basic income,"" he said. 
The logistical challenges were significant but ""not insurmountable"", he said.
    ""Clearly some of the recent announcements by World Bank and International Monetary Fund in terms of credit lines and funding that is being made available will obviously assist Ukrainian authorities to be able to deploy such a programme,"" he said.
The UNDP report said that an emergency cash transfer operation, costing about $250 million per month, would cover partial income losses for 2.6 million people expected to fall into poverty. A more ambitious temporary basic income programme to provide $5.50 per day per person would cost $430 million a month.
Ukraine's economy is expected to contract by 10% in 2022 as a result of Russia's invasion, but the outlook could worsen sharply if the conflict lasts longer, the IMF said in a staff report released on Monday.
The World Bank on Monday approved nearly $200 million in additional and reprogrammed financing to bolster Ukraine’s support of vulnerable people. The funding comes on top of $723 million approved last week and is part of a $3 billion package of support that the World Bank is racing to get to Ukraine and its people in coming weeks.

Steiner emphasized Ukraine's importance to the economies of other nations, especially a group of African nations who he said get a third of their wheat supplies from Ukraine and Russia.
""We are also trying to stabilise an economy that is for 45 African nations, least developed countries, the breadbasket for them,"" Steiner said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine will affect the entire global economy by slowing growth and jacking up inflation, and could fundamentally reshape the global economic order in the longer term, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Tuesday.
Beyond the human suffering and historic refugee flows, the war is boosting prices for food and energy, fuelling inflation and eroding the value of incomes, while disrupting trade, supply chains and remittances in countries neighbouring Ukraine, the IMF said in a post on its website.
It is also eroding business confidence and triggering uncertainty among investors that will depress asset prices, tighten financial conditions and could trigger capital outflows from emerging markets, it said.
""The conflict is a major blow to the global economy that will hurt growth and raise prices,"" the IMF said.
IMF officials has already said they expect to lower the Fund's previous forecast for 4.4% global economic growth in 2022. In Tuesday's post, they suggested their regional growth forecasts would also be likely be revised downward. 
The IMF is due to release updated forecasts on April 19.
Countries with direct trade, tourism, and financial exposures would feel mounting pressure, the IMF said, citing a greater risk of unrest in some regions, from Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America to the Caucasus and Central Asia.
At the same time, food insecurity was likely to further increase in parts of Africa and the Middle East, where countries like Egypt import 80% of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine.
In the longer term, it said, ""the war may fundamentally alter the global economic and geopolitical order should energy trade shift, supply chains reconfigure, payment networks fragment, and countries rethink reserve currency holdings.""
The IMF predicted deep recessions in Ukraine and Russia, and said Europe could see disruptions in natural gas imports and wider supply-chain disruptions. Eastern Europe, which has absorbed most of the 3 million people who have fled Ukraine, would see higher financing costs as a result.
The IMF said countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia with close trade and payment system links to Russia would be more affected by its recession and sanctions imposed since the invasion of Ukraine, curbing trade, remittances, investment and tourism. Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
In the Middle East and Africa, worsening external financing conditions may spur capital outflows and add to growth headwinds for countries with elevated debt levels and large financing needs, the IMF said.
Higher energy and food prices, reduced tourism and problems accessing international capital markets would threaten countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which imports around 85% of its wheat supplies, with a third coming from Russia or Ukraine.

Food and energy prices are the main channel for spillovers in the Western Hemisphere, with high commodity prices likely to significantly quicken already high inflation rates in Latin America, the Caribbean and the United States.
In Asia, the biggest impact will be felt among oil importers of ASEAN economies, India, and frontier economies including some Pacific Islands, while new fuel subsidies could ease the impacts in Japan and Korea, the IMF said.

Five-year Treasury yields rose to as high as 2.149%, their highest since May 2019, while 10-year yields rose to 2.204% and were last up 2 bps on the day. 
Thirty-year yields briefly touched 2.537%, their highest since August 2019.
The Fed concludes a two-day meeting later on Wednesday and is expected to deliver its first rate increase in three years, in what is likely to be a series of rate increases to tame inflation. 
The urgency surrounding the Fed's policy meeting this week has intensified because inflation has shown no signs of easing and could rise further since Russia's invasion of Ukraine has driven up oil prices.
U.S. money markets price in roughly seven, 25 basis point rates hikes in total this year. 
""We have priced in a lot already and so far that hasn't caused big market troubles,"" said Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea.
""But it's clear that the U.S. inflation outlook calls for more than just a fine-tuning of policy. This (rate-hiking) cycle is going to be a long one.""

U.S. headline inflation is running at almost 8% and data on Tuesday showed producer prices rose in February at an annual rate of 10% following a similar gain in January.

They were the latest sanctions imposed on Moscow since Russian forces invaded Ukraine nearly three weeks ago in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Moscow calls the assault a ""special operation.""
The U.S. State Department announced the sanctions on 11 Russian military leaders, including several deputy ministers of defense and Viktor Zolotov, chief of Russia's national guard and a member of Russian President Vladimir Putin's security council. 
The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets those targeted may have and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.
The Russian embassy in Washington said the penalties were ""another hostile action (that) drives Russian-U.S. relations further into an even more dead end"", in a statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
It said the measures would not go unanswered, without going into further detail.
The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on four Russians and one entity it accused of playing a role in concealing events around the death of whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky or of being connected to human rights violations against human rights advocate Oyub Titiev.
A Treasury statement said it was adding to its sanctions against Lukashenko and also targeting his wife.
Andrea Gacki, the head of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, said in the statement its sanctions were the consequences for people engaged in corruption or connected to gross violations of human rights.
""We condemn Russia's attacks on humanitarian corridors in Ukraine and call on Russia to cease its unprovoked and brutal war against Ukraine,"" she said.
Magnitsky was a Russian lawyer arrested in 2008 after alleging that Russian officials were involved in large-scale tax fraud. Magnitsky died in a Moscow prison in 2009 after complaining of mistreatment.
Tuesday's measures targeted Judge Natalia Mushnikova, accused by Treasury of ""participating in efforts to conceal the legal liability for the detention, abuse, or death"" of Magnitsky.
Sanctions were also imposed on the Kurchaloi District of the Chechen Republic Branch of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, whose officers arrested Titiev in 2018 and charged him with possession of drugs.

Those sanctioned include Nurid Salamov, the investigator who opened the case against Titiev; Khusein Khutaev, the officer who allegedly spotted drugs in Titiev’s car; and Dzhabrail Akhmatov, who the Treasury said decided to bring charges against Titiev.
Titiev, head of the Memorial human rights centre in Chechnya, was detained and accused of possessing illegal drugs in 2018. Titiev said the police had planted the drugs on him during a shake-down. He was sentenced to 4 years in a penal colony.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The queues of container ships outside major Chinese ports are lengthening by the day as COVID-19 outbreaks in manufacturing export hubs threaten to unleash a fresh wave of global supply chain shocks, ship owners, logistics firms and analysts say.
China is experiencing its biggest spike in COVID-19 infections since an initial outbreak in the central city of Wuhan was contained in early 2020.
The spread of the highly-infectious Omicron variant this month has led to movement controls across China, including in key manufacturing hubs of Shenzhen and Dongguan, paralysing factories making goods from flash drives to car parts.
While China’s main ports remain open and vessels are continuing to dock, congestion is building up and some container ships are re-routing to avoid expected delays, according to ship owners, analysts and supply chain managers.
Charter rates are expected to ramp up, while delays to shipping freight grow longer, they said. 
Container vessel congestion builds off China’s key manufacturing hubs as COVID cases climb https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jnvwebnrmvw/ContainerCongestionMar162022.png 
SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS
Container loading is “decreasing massively” at Shenzhen's Yantian port, the world's fourth largest container terminal, as port workers, truckers and factory workers stayed at home, said Jasmine Wall, Asia-Pacific manager at SEKO Logistics.
“This implies that it will become difficult to get cargo to and from the ports and hence whether the terminals are open or not becomes a moot point,” said Lars Jensen, CEO at Vespucci Maritime, a container shipping advisor.
""It will have a disruptive impact on the supply chain - in turn prolonging the current supply chain crisis.”
Currently there are 34 vessels off Shenzhen waiting to dock, compared to an average of seven a year ago, according to Refinitiv ship tracking data. At Qingdao, an eastern Chinese port city, there are around 30 vessels waiting to dock compared to an average of seven last year.
Charter rates per 40-foot container remain close to all-time highs across major global shipping routes, trading at around $16,000 on the China-U.S. West Coast route and nearly $13,000 from China to Europe, according to Freightos shipping index. 
Key global container shipping rates remain near all-time highs on major routes https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gdvzyboaopw/ContainerRatesMarch162022.png 
""WHIPLASH EFFECT""
Similar COVID lockdowns last year saw operations at Yantian cut to one-third of capacity, leading to a bigger disruption of global shipping than the one caused by the closure of the Suez Canal for six days last year after the Ever Given container vessel ran aground, a director of Maersk, the world's largest container liner, noted last year
Although supply chain experts say that Chinese ports are more resilient now to staff shortages and transport disruptions, there remains the fear that Yantian may have to shut if infections and restrictions spread. 
Supplier and shipping delays, while still elevated, had eased to their lowest level since early 2021 in February, according to JP Morgan Global PMI.
""If the (Yantian) port does close, then the whiplash effect when it reopens will lay waste to all the progress made in the U.S.,” said Bjorn Vang Jensen, vice president at consultancy Sea-Intelligence.
Even if ocean freight terminals remain open, the lack of truck drivers and warehouse operators means there will be delays in filling shipping containers and taking them to port. 
Container vessel congestion builds off China’s main export hubs as COVID restrictions bite https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/akvezxkrgpr/ChinaContainerPortCongestionMarch162022.png 
INFLATION
With other nearby export hubs also suffering from bottlenecks, including Hong Kong and Shanghai, vessels may have to wait until congestion eases to load cargo and that will mean phones, televisions and toys take longer to get to the United States, said Peter Sand, Chief Analyst at Xeneta, a freight analytics firm.
""I expect the consumers in the U.S. and shippers with cargo going for North America will be hardest hit,” Sand said.
Shipping lines are also contending with the possibility of a rapid escalation of Omicron variant COVID cases in China, as seen elsewhere in the world, which could result in more widespread disruptions and have implications for already rising global inflation.

""The Chinese authorities’ zero-tolerance policy would seem to indicate a high likelihood of further lockdowns,” said Niels Rasmussen, Chief Shipping Analyst at BIMCO, a shipowner association.
""A slowdown in Chinese exports will exacerbate supply chain delays and reduce inventories held by businesses, which could drive further price increases.""

The container ship is operated by Evergreen Marine Corp Taiwan Ltd, the same Taiwanese transportation company that operates the Ever Given. The Ever Given ran aground last March, blocking traffic in the Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest waterways and the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia.
The Coast Guard received reports on Sunday that the Ever Forward was grounded and is now conducting checks every four hours to ensure the safety of the crew on board and marine life, according to Petty Officer 3rd Class Breanna Centeno.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government will run out of supplies of COVID-19 treatments known as monoclonal antibodies as soon as late May and will have to scale back plans to get more unless Congress provides more funding, the White House said on Tuesday.
Raising the alarm about depleted funding for the U.S. pandemic response, the White House said the government also would not have enough money to provide additional COVID-19 booster shots or variant-specific vaccines without a new injection of cash.
The White House has requested $22.5 billion in immediate emergency funding to fight the pandemic, but, after objections from Republicans and some Democrats, the money was removed from the latest government funding bill passed by lawmakers last week.
White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said there would be ""dire"" consequences if the funding did not come through.
""With cases rising abroad, scientific and medical experts have been clear that in the next couple of months there could be increasing cases of COVID-19 in the United States as well,"" she told reporters. ""Waiting to provide funding until we're in a worse spot with the virus will be too late. We need funding now so we're prepared for whatever comes."" 
An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the government had planned to put in an order with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) on March 25 for what would likely have been hundreds of thousands of doses of monoclonal treatments. That order would have to be scaled back or scrapped without new funds, the official said.
""We'll likely run out of these treatments for our most vulnerable ... Americans by the end of the year if not sooner,"" the official said. ""Without additional funding soon, thousands of patients could lose access to treatments and these companies will have little incentive to continue investing in the development and manufacturing of these treatments.""
A program that reimburses medical providers for providing COVID testing, treatments and vaccines to uninsured people will have to be scaled back in March and shuttered in April without additional funding, the White House said.
President Joe Biden is scheduled to sign the larger funding bill without the emergency pandemic relief on Tuesday afternoon. 
Republicans objected to the additional aid, arguing that it was not needed, while Democrats did not like how it was going to be distributed. The money was to be used for research and to stockpile vaccines for possible future spikes in COVID-19 infections.
Lawmakers plan to revisit the matter in separate legislation.
There have been more than 972,000 COVID-19 deaths and more than 79.6 million infections recorded in the United States - the most in the world - since the pandemic began in 2020, according to Reuters data.

The call for funding comes as precautionary measures against COVID-19, including mandatory mask requirements, have been lifted across the country, with cases decreasing and Americans relishing a return to some form of normalcy.
But the White House has said other COVID-19 variants may come. It said on Monday that the Omicron BA.2 sub-variant had been circulating for some time, with roughly 35,000 current cases and more expected.

The number of people in extreme poverty - defined as those living on less than $1.90 a day - was 24.3 million last year, or 3.7% of Southeast Asia's collective 650 million population, the ADB said in a report. 
Before the pandemic, figures for those in extreme poverty in Southeast Asia had been on the decline, with 14.9 million in 2019, down from 18 million in 2018 and 21.2 million in 2017. 
""The pandemic has led to widespread unemployment, worsening inequality, and rising poverty levels, especially among women, younger workers, and the elderly in Southeast Asia,"" said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa. 
Asakawa urged governments to improve health systems, streamline regulations to boost business competitiveness, invest in smart, green infrastructure and adopt technology to speed up growth. 
The ADB said there were 9.3 million fewer employed workers in Southeast Asia in 2021 as COVID-19 curbs reduced economic activity, leaving millions without work.
Its 2021 growth forecast for Southeast Asia was 3.0%. 
The region was projected to grow 5.1% this year but the Omicron COVID-19 variant could cut its growth outlook by as much as 0.8 percentage points if it spreads further and triggers supply and demand shocks, the ADB said.
Ramesh Subramaniam, director general at the ADB, said Southeast Asia's growth outlook will be revised to reflect the impact of the Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which he expected to be ""manageable"". 
""The challenge is going to be what does the medium term holds. Is this going to affect the region's recovery from the pandemic and the fiscal challenges it will face?"" Subramaniam said at the report's launch. 

""How can we make sure that any knock-on effects don't become serious in the case of Southeast Asia?""
The conflict has forced Asia's policymakers to rethink assumptions for 2022, with the risks of weak growth coupled with surging prices adding unwanted complexity to monetary setting plans.

In the years following the financial crisis, the Bank of England stuck resolutely to easy money while fiscal policy got tough when Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne imposed swingeing budget cuts.
But as the economy grapples with the highest inflation level in three decades and the fallout from the war in Ukraine, it’s BOE Governor Andrew Bailey who’s playing the bogeyman. The central bank, which is expected to hike interest rates for a third straight meeting on Thursday, is taking the lead among global peers with a high-speed tightening of monetary policy,
By contrast, Treasury chief Rishi Sunak -- for all his talk of the need to rein in borrowing -- is keeping more of his pandemic fiscal stimulus in place than most other developed countries and spending billions more to shield households from a surge in the cost of everyday goods and services.
Tellingly, as the conflict in Ukraine rages, it’s also the Chancellor, not the BOE, who is facing increasing calls to step in to support the economy further. 
The switch among the policy heavyweights may come into sharper focus this month, when the BOE’s rate decision is set to be followed within days by Sunak’s spring statement, a fiscal update akin to a mini-budget.
The turnaround is part of a wider re-evaluation of how fiscal and monetary policies can best work to support economies, in the U.K. and beyond. 
“Having got through this thing, there’s a real need for ongoing fiscal support,” said David Owen of Saltmarsh Economics. “Fiscal policy should be used pretty proactively. The combination of that along with a tightening of monetary policy to me makes perfect sense. I’m really all for it -- it puts the U.K. internationally in a good position.”
Put simply: In the pandemic, compared with the Great Recession, budget spending did more of the heavy lifting. Governments doled out more cash. Economies bounced back faster. And policy makers trying to manage the recovery now face a different set of problems -- above all, inflation.
The U.K. was one of the biggest Covid spenders. Its budget stimulus was matched only by the U.S., relative to the size of their economies, according to UBS. Sunak’s measures to prop up incomes for workers and businesses cost a total of about 370 billion pounds ($484 billion), including loans. 
The BOE offered full support, slashing interest rates to near-zero and buying government debt to soak up the extra borrowing. The 440 billion pounds of BOE bond buying between March 2020 and December 2021 was enough to offset about 94% of the increase in the U.K.’s net borrowing requirement over the period.
In the years after 2008, when the economy was slow to recover, the government soon pivoted to arguing that the top priority was to lower budget deficits and debt. 
Osborne used the specter of bond-market turmoil and debt crises in euro-area countries like Greece or Spain to invoke the need for fiscal austerity. And he pointed to the low interest rates on British government debt as evidence that his plan was working.
In hindsight, though, many economists are inclined to credit monetary policy for that achievement. In other words: if U.K. borrowing costs stayed low, it was because the BOE kept them that way. That argument was only reinforced when intervention by the European Central Bank -- Mario Draghi’s famous “whatever it takes” –- succeeded in bringing down bond yields in even the most fiscally challenged euro-members.
“I never understood George Osborne’s mantra of the need to get the deficit down at the time,” Owen said. “Covid has changed a lot of these things in this world we are currently in and I don’t see an issue with rolling out more targeted measures.”
As the pandemic fades, Sunak -- like his Conservative Party predecessor Osborne -- has also been talking about the need to get public finances back into shape. He’s actually gone further than many finance ministers by raising taxes to pay for some of the pandemic spending.
But that step has been accompanied by policies like giving households financial aid to cope with higher energy bills and signing off spending increases for every government department over the next three years. Now, the Treasury is facing calls is turn the spending taps on further, to help firms cope with a historic surge in energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Meanwhile, with inflation hitting an 30-year high of 5.5% -- and forecast by some to hit 10% later this year as a result of the Ukraine crisis  -- it’s been the central bank that hit the brakes early and hard. The BOE has already hiked rates twice -- before the U.S. Federal Reserve, for example, even got started on tightening -- and announced a run-down of its bond holdings. 
At some point, the chancellor himself may feel the sting of the BOE’s newfound hawkishness. If central bank policies helped keep government borrowing costs down after 2008, then they’re having the opposite effect right now, as gilt yields rise in line with anticipated rate hikes.
Should the BOE benchmark hit 2% this year, as markets are predicting, then the cost of servicing bonds held under the BOE’s QE plan alone will jump hit 17 billion pounds a year, about double the level before officials hiked rates for the first time in December, according to calculations by Bloomberg.

133,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 10:55PM ET</span>",,,,,,"PARIS (Reuters) - Poland, Sweden, Estonia and Malta blocked on Tuesday a French-proposed compromise on how to implement minimum corporate tax across the European Union, dealing a blow to the global overhaul of cross-border tax rules.
As tax issues require unanimous backing in the 27-nation European Union, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that he would put the issue back on the table the next time ministers meet in April.
""Tax justice takes a long time but in the end it's important that tax justice wins,"" Le Maire told a meeting with top tax officials from EU countries.
After years of negotiations nearly 140 countries reached a two-track deal last October on a minimum tax rate of 15% on multinationals and agreed to make it harder for companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to avoid tax by booking profits in low-tax jurisdictions.
France, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, has been pushing for quick EU implementation of the overhaul of cross-border tax rules.
However, in the face of concerns from some EU countries that they would not be ready, France proposed a compromise that pushed back implementation of the new rules until the end of next year, rather than the beginning. 
It also proposed a firm political commitment to not let the two pillars of the overhaul be separated, but Poland said that did not go far enough and it needed stronger legal assurances.
""Tax justice means both pillars are implemented together,"" Polish revenue chief Magdalena Rzeczkowska told a meeting in Brussels, adding that Warsaw looked forward to a ""more balanced"" proposal.

Swedish, Estonian and Maltese officials also said that they could not sign on to the deal as it currently stands although Ireland and Hungary, which have had strong misgivings in the past, said they were satisfied.
The global tax reform is supposed to be brought onto countries' lawbooks next year, although that has long been seen as highly ambitious in large part because the U.S. administration has struggled to push it through Congress.

""Despite her readiness — and despite having been confirmed by the Senate with broad, bipartisan support twice in the past — Sarah was subject to baseless attacks from industry and conservative interest groups,"" Biden said in a statement. 
Raskin had become the most contentious of Biden's five nominees to the central bank's Board of Governors, generating strong opposition from the outset from Republicans who said she would use the vice chair of supervision post to steer the Fed toward oversight policies that would penalize banks who lend to fossil fuel companies.
Raskin had been favored by progressive Democrats, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who had pushed Biden to install someone who would pursue stiffer banking oversight after regulatory rollbacks under the previous supervision czar, Randal Quarles.
Her withdrawal clears the way for the Senate to act on the four remaining nominees, which include Jerome Powell for a second term as the central bank's chair. 
Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee, which reviews Fed appointments, had blocked progress on the nominations by refusing to attend voting sessions over their objections to Raskin. 
The banking committee's top Republican, Pat Toomey, said on Tuesday he and his colleagues were now ready to vote.
Republicans may still try to block at least a couple of Biden's other picks, including Lael Brainard, an existing Fed governor, to be the central bank's vice chair, and Michigan State University's Lisa Cook, who would be the Fed Board's first Black female member. Toomey has said he opposes both.
Powell and the last nominee, Davidson College's Philip Jefferson, have bipartisan support.
In a 50-50 Senate that Democrats control only by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking position, nominees need the backing of every member of Biden's party to gain confirmation if Republicans are united in opposition, as they appeared to be in Raskin's case.
When Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a conservative Democrat from a Republican-leaning state that is among the country's biggest coal producers, announced his opposition to Raskin on Monday - followed by ""Nos"" from moderate Republicans - her nomination was effectively over.
""Their point of contention was my frank public discussion of climate change and the economic costs associated with it,"" Raskin said in her resignation letter. It is ""not a novel or radical position,"" she wrote, to add climate change to the list of risks the Fed should consider to ensure financial and economic stability. 

The question for the Biden administration now is whether to pivot toward a moderate for the job or even leave the post open.
The New Yorker magazine first reported that Raskin had withdrawn her nomination.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese accountant Masamitsu has not travelled or gone to the cinema in years and rarely eats out.
Instead, his annual salary of about $34,000 goes to support his family and has risen by just $4 a year for nearly a decade.
""I can't save, I have nothing at all put by for my old age. I'll just have to keep on working,"" said the 50-year-old, who declined to give his last name out of concern for his job at a small company that works in event planning.
""After I retire from this company, I'll do anything I can get. Maybe work as a security guard.""
Masamitsu's plight mirrors that of many workers at small and medium-sized firms in Japan, where the average salary in 2020 was $38,515, little changed from the 1990s and well below the average of $49,165 in countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has urged profitable companies to boost wages at spring wage negotiations, when managements of blue chip firms meet key unions for talks to fix wages in the coming year, setting a guideline for most other companies.
This year's talks are expected to wrap up on Wednesday.
Masamitsu, who was trained in accounting at a vocational school, switched jobs at age 43, in a move relatively unusual for Japanese employees, after his previous employer cut salaries.
After a long series of unsuccessful interviews, he felt lucky to land his current job, only to be told upfront that raises would be only 500 yen ($4.25) a year for the first decade.
""Given my age, the base pay actually wasn't too bad, there were other places that were lower,"" he said. ""And I was told that after 10 years, it'd go up by 5,000 yen a year.""
Masamitsu's monthly pay, along with allowances common in Japan, amounts to about 250,000 yen, and he gets a bonus of two months' pay twice a year for a yearly total of roughly 4 million yen ($34,000). 
""It's kind of unfortunate it doesn't rise more, even though I'm working hard,"" he said. 
From this sum he supports his wife, who works part-time to supplement their income, and a daughter who is just about to complete high school.
For recreation, he and some friends do yoga from YouTube videos, though he occasionally buys a one-day gym pass to take yoga classes. 
""I'd have liked to have had another child, but the one has taken everything we have,"" he said. 
He has little hope that Kishida's urging will change much.

""This kind of thing doesn't really reach people in places like me,"" he said. ""Officials say a lot of things that don't really work out.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Andrew Bailey is leading the Bank of England into one of its most complex challenges in decades while facing criticism of his record in a key part of the job - how to explain his thinking and that of the central bank. 
Bailey marks two years as governor on Wednesday after succeeding Mark Carney in March 2020, just as the world's fifth-biggest economy was sliding into its historic COVID-19 slump.
The BoE cut interest rates a few days before Carney left and did so again four days after Bailey took over. It also expanded its bond-buying scheme by 200 billion pounds ($260 billion).
The swift response helped settle near-panic in financial markets and earned the BoE plaudits.
But since then Bailey has drawn criticism from investors, trade unions and by some people who have worked with him. 
The International Monetary Fund said in late February that ""predictability and clear communications about forward guidance would improve policy effectiveness"" by the BoE.
Also last month, Bailey angered unions and was rebuffed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman when he called for pay restraint in the face of fast-rising inflation.
Other BoE policymakers tried to shift the focus to pricing decisions by companies but Bailey hit the headlines again when he struggled to answer a question about his own pay - 575,000 pounds including pension contribution - from a lawmaker.
It was not the first messaging problem for Bailey, whose career has mostly been as a financial regulator.
Late last year, many investors thought comments he made meant the BoE was poised to tighten monetary policy. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and other banks predicted a first rate hike in November.
When the Monetary Policy Committee kept rates on hold, British government bond prices jumped by the most since the 2016 Brexit shock. Sterling fell by the most in over 18 months.
Many investors were also caught out when the BoE did start to raise rates in December.
""He has shown a lack of appreciation for the impact that his comments can make in the markets,"" Oliver Blackbourn, portfolio manager on a UK-based multi-asset team at Janus Henderson Investors, said. 
""There is a really fine line in the way central banks communicate. I think that they have completely misjudged that at times.""
Market forecasts for UK interest rates to peak in 18-24 months' time reflected worries about the BoE managing to control inflation without starting a recession, Blackbourn said.
Britain faces a severe cost-of-living squeeze as inflation looks set to rise above 8% - four times the BoE's target - as the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine adds to a surge in energy prices and COVID-19 supply-chain bottlenecks.
The BoE is expected on Thursday to announce a third interest rate since December.
The BoE's press office declined to comment when contacted by Reuters for this story.
Bailey has defended his comments in the run-up to November's policy decision, saying he never pre-committed to any move.
MIXED MESSAGES
Bailey's messaging problems began in 2020 when he said the BoE's bond-buying, as well as helping to get inflation back up to target, would smooth the government's borrowing needs.
Some commentators said that blurred the BoE's independence.
Other top BoE policymakers then stressed that the bond-buying was increased purely to meet the inflation target. 
But last July, the Economic Affairs Committee in the upper house of Britain's parliament said Bailey's comments were likely to have added to the perception that the jump in bond-buying was at least partially motivated to help finance the government.
""If this perception continues to spread, the Bank of England's ability to control inflation and maintain financial stability could be undermined significantly,"" the committee said in a report.
People who have worked with Bailey at the BoE said he sometimes made unprepared comments, in contrast to Carney who rehearsed more before speaking in parliament and to the media.
Carney had his own messaging problems, chiefly the way his trademark ""forward guidance"" about the likely path of interest rates on occasions was overtaken by shifts in the economy.
But the Canadian was so focused on the details that his aides made sure he knew the price of milk and bread in case he was asked, a level of preparation that Bailey does not follow, a senior BoE official said.
Bailey is not the only top finance official who has struggled to communicate. 
The leaders of central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve have had to backtrack on their view that the jump in inflation was probably transitory.
Investors have also been wrong-footed by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde's attempts to finesse divisions within the ECB.
But a person familiar with debates inside the BoE said Bailey could be stubborn about sticking to his own view, even when colleagues more experienced than him on macroeconomic policy issues tried to change his mind. 
Such differences included Bailey's linking of bond purchases to the government's fiscal policy in 2020 and publicly voicing concern about the size of the central bank's debt stockpile, something colleagues warned could add to the perception that the BoE's independence was being weakened, the person said.
Another BoE official defended Bailey, saying he prepared extensively for all his duties and that he spent no less time getting ready for public events than any previous governor. 
Bailey liked to provide direct answers to direct answers and also made plenty of time available to talk to colleagues and staff, that official said.
The communications challenge for Bailey is only likely to grow in his third year as governor as inflation and recession risks mount.

""Looking forward, given the way markets are worried about policy mistakes and the way inflation and growth outlooks are evolving, investors could really do with a steadier hand on the tiller from here,"" Blackbourn of Janus Henderson said.

138,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 06:40PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russia is due to pay $117 million in interest on two dollar-denominated sovereign bonds on Wednesday - the first such payments since its invasion of Ukraine which sparked a raft of sanctions from Western capitals and countermeasures from Moscow.
Russia's finance ministry said on Monday it had sent an order to a correspondent bank for the payment of coupons on eurobonds amounting to $117.2 million which are due on Wednesday.
The diplomatic standoff and economic curbs have sparked questions over whether and how Russia will make the payment, raising the spectre of its first major external debt default since 1917, when Bolsheviks failed to recognise Tsarist debt in the wake of the revolution. 
Here is what we know and do not know about Russia's debt and its repayment: 
HOW MUCH DOES RUSSIA OWE IN HARD CURRENCY BONDS? 
Russia has 15 international bonds with a face value of around $40 billion outstanding, around half of them held by international investors. 
The coupons on March 16 are the first of several, with another $615 million due over the rest of the month. The first principal payment is due on April 4 when a $2 billion bond matures.
The bonds themselves have been issued with a mix of terms and indentures. Bonds sold after Russia was sanctioned over its 2014 annexation of Crimea contain a provision for alternative currency payments. For bonds listed after 2018, the rouble is listed as an alternative currency option.
The bonds linked to Wednesday's coupon payment were listed in 2013 and are to be paid in U.S. dollars, with Citi as the paying agent.
Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday that if the payments were done in roubles, it would constitute a sovereign default if not corrected after a 30-day grace period.
According to the bonds' prospectus, payment in other currency would only be effective after the recipients exchange that currency amount for dollars, and at the dollar amount recoverable in the open market.
Citi declined to comment.
WILL MOSCOW PAY?
Sanctions have been biting hard, especially the freezing of the central bank currency reserves, with Moscow initially balking at the prospect of sending scarce hard currency to foreign investors. 
A presidential decree on March 5 announced that Russian debtors have the right to pay foreign creditors in roubles and by putting their funds in a Type C account at the national depository. However, the central bank and finance ministry can make exceptions. 
Subsequent statements have been more nuanced and seemingly allow hard currency payments. The finance ministry said in a statement https://minfin.gov.ru/ru/press-center/?id_4=37805-utverzhden_vremennyi_poryadok_ispolneniya_gosudarstvennykh_dolgovykh_obyazatelstv_rossiiskoi_federatsii_v_inostrannoi_valyute on Monday that it had approved a temporary procedure to make FX payments and that Russia would fulfil obligations ""in a timely manner and in full.""
However, if foreign banks fail to execute the payments, Russia could withdraw the funds and pay them in roubles into an account at the national depository. 
WILL INVESTORS BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE MONEY? 
Sanctions from both sides mean it has become more complicated for Russia to transfer the funds, but also for foreign investors to receive them. 
The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued general license https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/russia_gl9a.pdf 9A on March 2 which authorizes transactions for U.S. persons with regards to ""the receipt of interest, dividend, or maturity payments in connection with debt or equity"" issued by Russia's finance ministry, central bank or national wealth fund. However, that exemption runs out on May 25 with Russia due to pay nearly $2 billion on its external sovereign bonds after that deadline and until year-end. 
WHAT IS THE PROSPECT OF A RUSSIAN DEFAULT? 
A Russian external debt default seemed unthinkable with its international bonds trading above par until well into February. 
Harsh sanctions have changed all that and now bonds hover at distressed levels, some barely at a tenth of their face value. 
Most payments due - like the one on Wednesday - have a 30-day grace period during which Russia has time to make the payment. Some issues have a 15-day grace period. Unlike some of Russia's other external bonds, which have alternative payment provisions in the small print, the coupons due on Wednesday have to be paid in U.S. dollars.
Failure to pay them in full or paying in another currency would lead to a default by the end of the grace period, according to analysts. 
WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES OF A DEFAULT?
Countries in default have no access to international capital markets, though given current restrictions, Russia is shut out of markets anyway. 
However, a default could have consequences far and wide.
It could trigger Russian debt default insurance policies known as Credit Default Swaps (CDS) that investors take out for this kind of situation. Investment bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimates there are roughly $6 billion worth of outstanding CDS that would need to be paid out.
Furthermore, it is not just international asset managers who are exposed to Russia's external debt. ""Many Russian investors bought this paper via their accounts in Western banks,"" said Evgeny Suvorov, Russia-based economist at CentroCredit Bank. ""There is a large suspicion that it's specifically Russian investors that are the main bondholders of sovereign external debt.""

Russian banks could also be in trouble with the bonds making up part of their capital buffers. 
Being under the jurisdiction of a defaulted sovereign adds to pressure on Russian corporates, which have frequently used international capital markets to raise financing and have nearly $100 billion in hard currency bonds outstanding.

139,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 06:16PM ET</span>","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Credit ratings agency Fitch said on Tuesday that if Russia were to make two U.S. dollar bond coupon payments due Wednesday in roubles, it would constitute a sovereign default after a grace period expiration.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month triggered sanctions from across the world that have limited Moscow's ability to access and allocate cash.
""The payment in local currency of Russia's U.S. dollar Eurobond coupons due on 16 March would, if it were to occur, constitute a sovereign default, on expiry of the 30-day grace period,"" Fitch said in a statement.
Russia is due to make two hard currency coupon payments of near $117 million on Wednesday.
In the event of a payment in roubles, Fitch said, the rating on both bonds would be lowered to 'D' after the grace period expires, while Russia's long-term foreign currency rating would be set at 'Restricted Default.'
Fitch said the local-currency rating of 'C' is consistent with Russia's failure to credit foreign investors with the local-currency bond coupons that were due on March 2.
""We understand that Russia’s Ministry of Finance made these coupon payments on the 2024 OFZs to the National Settlement Depository, but they were not paid on to foreign investors because of Central Bank of Russia restrictions,"" Fitch said.

""This will constitute a default if not cured within 30 days of the payments falling due.""
Fitch said it is applying a 30-day grace period in local bonds, known as OFZs, even if those are not detailed in the bonds' documents.

Private overseas investors bought $62.22 billion in Treasuries and foreign official institutions bought $12.29 billion in January, according to Treasury International Capital (TIC) data.
Foreigners have bought Treasuries in eight of the last 12 months, including a record net monthly purchase of $118 billion in March 2021.
Overall, the data showed a net TIC inflow of $294.2 billion. Of this, net foreign private inflows were $270.8 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $23.4 billion. 
But total foreign holdings actually fell, as yields rose. 
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields peaked at 1.9020% in January and ended the month at 1.7838%, up about 27 basis points from the end of December.
The yield on the two-year note rose to 1.1846% in January from 0.7341% as markets anticipated a Federal Reserve interest rate hike to slow price rises and stave off hotter inflation. 
The Fed is expected to raise its policy rate on Wednesday by 0.25%, the first hike since 2018, and announce it had ended pandemic-era bond purchases, with an aim to start letting its massive balance sheet shrink. Several more rate hikes are expected this year and next.
Foreign holdings of Treasury securities fell to $7,662 trillion from $7,747 trillion, led by custodian locations such as the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg.
If a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the 
data.
""It does show you that a lot of foreign investors were selling their Treasury holdings during the month, said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities, who added that it was consistent with the sell-off in Treasuries during the month.
Japan's holdings of Treasury securities fell by just under $1 billion to $1.303 trillion in December although it remained the largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries.
China, the second largest holder of Treasuries, saw its holdings decline to $1.060 trillion from $1.068 trillion in December. 

""That's consistent with the really big jump in rates that we saw early in the year just on expectations of stronger global economic growth and potentially more hawkish central banks,"" said Goldberg. ""So the data certainly matches the price action fully at the start of the year.""
In other asset classes, U.S. corporate bonds, posted an inflow of $7.62 billion in January, reversing December's net outflow of $4.02 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Sarah Bloom Raskin ended her bid to become the top bank regulator at the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, one day after Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said he would not support her, citing worries she would discourage banks from lending to oil and gas companies. 
With Raskin informing President Joe Biden she was withdrawing her name from consideration, according to a source familiar with the matter, the administration is now on the hunt for a possible replacement. 
Here are the candidates likely to be in the mix, according to analysts and Washington insiders. 
RAPHAEL BOSTIC, ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT
With his appointment as president of the Atlanta Fed in 2017, Bostic became the first Black person to hold a regional Fed president role. He has been outspoken on racial diversity and economic inequality issues, both of which are key policy priorities for the Biden administration. 
An economist by training, Bostic previously held roles at the U.S. central bank in Washington, where he won praise for his work on community lending rules, and at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
However, Bostic represents a bit of an unknown regarding financial regulation, analysts said. Even so, some banks were keen on Bostic for the role when his name was first floated last year, according to two industry executives. 
A spokesperson for Bostic did not immediately provide comment.
NELLIE LIANG, TREASURY UNDERSECRETARY
Liang, a former Fed official who is now Treasury's undersecretary for domestic finance, was instrumental in building the regulatory framework after the 2007-2009 recession and financial crisis. She spent decades at the Fed as a staffer, ultimately becoming the first director of the central bank's Division of Financial Stability.
She left the Fed in 2017 to join the Brookings Institution think tank, where she criticized Republican efforts to trim capital and liquidity requirements for large banks, among other changes. 
Liang was nominated for a seat on the Fed's Board of Governors during the Trump administration, but she withdrew in 2019 after Republicans blocked her nomination over worries she would be too tough on Wall Street.
However, some progressives are unhappy that Liang has not taken a tougher stance on cryptocurrencies, ""so it is unclear whether she would be in any future conversation about this role,"" Isaac Boltansky, policy director for brokerage BTIG, wrote in a note on Monday. 
A spokesperson for Liang did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
MICHAEL HSU, ACTING COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY
Currently acting comptroller of the currency, Hsu previously led big bank supervision at the Fed. In his current role, he has pushed Democratic priorities, including climate change risk and has warned banks against ""over-confidence"" https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-banking-regulator-cautions-firms-against-overconfidence-following-pandemic-2021-05-18 coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
While he would be a good fit for Fed supervision, Washington insiders said, it's unclear if his stance on climate financial risk would be palatable to Manchin, a moderate who represents coal-producing West Virginia in the Senate.
A spokeswoman for Hsu did not immediately respond to a request to comment.
FORMER TREASURY UNDERSECRETARY MARY MILLER
A new name floated on Monday was Mary Miller, who was at the Treasury from 2010 to 2014. She recently served as the interim senior vice president for finance and administration at Johns Hopkins University.
During her stint at the Treasury, Miller was responsible for Treasury debt management, fiscal operations, and the recovery from the financial crisis. She played a central role in implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, helping agencies write complex regulations like the ""Volcker Rule"" and standing up the new Financial Stability Oversight Council. 
Miller could not immediately be reached for comment.
RICHARD CORDRAY, FORMER HEAD OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (CFPB) 
A former Ohio attorney general, Cordray served as the first director of the CFPB. 
Under his leadership the agency took an aggressive stance in going after abusive mortgage and payday lenders, earning praise from progressives and criticism from Republicans who said he was overstepping the agency's statutory remit.

After leaving the agency, Cordray ran unsuccessfully for Ohio governor. He currently runs the Education Department's federal student aid programs. Cordray was in the running for the supervision post late last year, Reuters reported.

(Reuters) - Brianna Lombardozzi finally has her finances to a point where she might be able to buy a house. But she isn't feeling great about her odds. 
Lombardozzi, 37, used her federal stimulus checks and other savings built up during the pandemic to pay down the majority of her credit card debt - a move that helped her credit score rise by almost 100 points. 
But competition is intense for homes in her price range of $175,000 to $225,000 in Central, South Carolina, and she has had four bids rejected over the past month. Now with mortgage rates rising, she doesn't know if she'll find an affordable property before her lease is up at the end of May.
""Right now, I feel a little defeated,"" said Lombardozzi, who works in housing for a local university. 
As home prices soar, housing affordability is sinking to the lowest levels since 2008 and first-time buyers - who haven't benefited from rising home values and are also coping with rising rents - are being squeezed out. 
First-time buyers accounted for 27% of existing home sales in January, according to the National Association of Realtors, near 2014 levels. With mortgage rates above 4%, around the highest in about three years, and expected to rise further, buyers on tight budgets may struggle even more to find homes they can afford.

AFFORDABILITY STRAINED 
Demand for housing soared during the pandemic as buyers capitalized on record-low mortgage rates and remote workers sought more living space. Some people, like Lombardozzi, saved money they would have typically spent on travel or dining out while much of the economy was shut down, leaving them with more cash to potentially invest in a home. 
At the same time, the number of homes for sale plunged as some owners stayed put because of uncertainty and supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages slowed new home construction. 
While some imbalances are easing, the supply of homes for sale at the end of January was at a record low - only enough to last 1.6 months, NAR data shows. That is forcing buyers to compete over limited listings and pushing prices higher.
At the end of 2021, housing affordability dropped to the lowest levels since November of 2008, with households earning the median income needing to spend nearly 33% of their income to afford payments on a median-priced home, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve. Housing is generally viewed as affordable when households spend no more than 30% of their income on shelter. 
Affordability may be strained even further by rising mortgage rates. Some people who had been pre-approved for a mortgage may find they no longer qualify for the same maximum loan amount after mortgage rates rise, said Jennifer Beeston, a senior vice president of mortgage lending for Guaranteed Rate, a mortgage lender.
First-time buyers are already struggling to compete with all-cash offers, including from institutional investors such as private-equity funds, which are taking up a greater share of purchases and are viewed as less risky by sellers, analysts say. Cash purchases accounted for 27% of sales in January, up from 19% a year earlier, according NAR. 
And some new buyers are being outbid by people with enough cash to pay above what a mortgage banker is willing to lend, based on the home's appraised value, said Erica Barraza, a real estate broker in the Seattle area.

BRACING FOR DISAPPOINTMENT
Many prospective home buyers find they need to increase their budgets or lower their standards just to have a chance at a winning bid. They also have to move fast, viewing homes the day they go on the market and making offers within a day, or minutes after the viewing. 
Those conditions are hitting morale: A survey by Fannie Mae found just 29% of respondents think it's a good time to buy a home, near a record low for a series launched in 2010. ""What I spend 50% of my time doing now is pep talks,"" said Beeston, who works in mortgage lending. 
Jason Harrison and Jamar Haggans are just getting started with their home-buying search, but they are already lowering expectations. 
Their search for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Kansas City, Missouri, priced under $450,000 turns up only 10 to 20 new houses daily. Many of them sell within a day or two - often well above the asking price. 
After reviewing the quality of homes listed, they upped their budget by $75,000 and are nervous about over-paying. 
""My biggest fear right now...is that if we want to get a home we're going to have to pay more than it's actually worth,"" said Harrison, 36. 
Harrison and Haggans are not willing to waive home inspections or appraisals, which they worry will make them less appealing than buyers willing to make those concessions. They hope more people will list their homes in the spring. 
Delaying a home search also has costs for buyers facing rising rents. 
Lombardozzi, who lost at least one bid to an all-cash offer, estimates she has about a month to find a home before she needs to start looking for rentals. 
The house she's been renting for six years was recently sold, and she says comparable rentals are going for 20% to 40% more than what she is paying now. 

She first started searching for homes in January, and Mortgage Bankers Association data shows home-loan costs have climbed roughly three-quarters of a percentage point in that window, reducing how much she can borrow if she wants to keep the monthly mortgage payment at a level she can afford. 
""By the time I might actually get an offer accepted, what will the rates have gone up to?"" she said. ""Will I just not be able to buy a house period?""

LONDON (Reuters) - Rules forcing Britain's banks to wrap their retail arms with a bespoke cushion of capital should be retained for now, though they could ""ossify"" the sector in the longer term if left unchanged, an independent review for the finance ministry said on Tuesday.
The'ring-fencing' rules were introduced for banks with deposits of over 25 billion pounds ($32.6 billion) to insulate accounts from any blow-ups in separate investment banking activities, a lesson from the financial crisis when taxpayers had to bail out banks.
Banks wanted the rules, applied by seven lenders, including HSBC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Lloyds (LON:LLOY) and NatWest, to be dismantled, saying they risk harming competitiveness.
The review, chaired by Keith Skeoch, said the rules have improved resilience of retail banking, though they need to be more adaptable for simpler lenders.
The 25-billion-pound threshold should remain but its application made more flexible so that less complex banks would be exempt from ring-fencing, even if they hold deposits above this amount, the review said.
""Ring-fencing has to date had some impact on banking competition and competitiveness but has not been the main driver in any of these areas,"" the review said.
""In the longer term, there is a risk that retail banking in the UK ossifies and remains focused on addressing the risks and opportunities of the past, rather than being able to adapt to address the risks and opportunities identified in the future.""
The benefits of ring-fencing will diminish with time as separate 'resolution' rules for dismantling a failing bank and moving accounts to another lender, become embedded.
As regulators become comfortable with the ability of the resolution rules to work well, they will also become confident in continuity of retail services without the structural separation of ring-fencing, the review said.

""Our main recommendation would change the scope of the regime in the longer term by giving the authorities more flexibility and a new power in their toolkit to remove banks from the ring-fencing regime that are judged to be resolvable,"" Skeoch said in the review's foreword.

Sailing away:
- An Airbus A340 Prestige jet linked to Usmanov flew out of Munich, Germany to Tashkent, Uzbekistan on Feb. 28 and hasn't been tracked since, according to Radar Box data.
Softly, softly:
- The U.S. Treasury, while blocking Usmanov's personal assets, has left companies controlled by him off its list of sanctions in an effort not to raise the price of commodities.
ROMAN ABRAMOVICH
Roman Abramovich, 55, billionaire businessman with an estimated $12.3 billion fortune, has been sanctioned by Britain, and was added to the EU sanctions list on Tuesday. 
Suspended:
- Abramovich's attempt to sell Chelsea Football Club was halted when Britain announced sanctions. Britain's asset freeze and sanctions bar the sale of players, new tickets and merchandise, but the team will be able to play matches. 
- British MP Chris Bryant said Abramovich was trying to sell his 15-bedroom mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens to avoid sanctions. He bought the home in the area of London nicknamed ""Billionaire's Row"" for 90 million pounds ($119 million) in 2011. 
- The Kensington home, along with other property and his stakes in steelmaker Evraz and Norilsk Nickel, are also subject to the British sanctions. It was not immediately clear if any assets had been seized.
Stranded:
- An aircraft linked to Abramovich is at Europort Airport near Basel, which straddles the Swiss-French border, and is unable to leave due to Swiss airspace restrictions.
Signed over:
- New York City property records show a trio of Upper East Side properties worth $92.3 million are tied to his ex-wife Dasha Zhukova, a New York real estate developer married to shipping heir Stavros Niarchos. She is also building the 21-storey Ray Harlem, which will house the National Black Theater, according to her website. 
Sailing away:
- The $600 million Solaris yacht linked to Abramovich left the Barcelona shipyard where it had been undergoing repairs on March 8, arriving in Montenegro territorial waters on March 12, according to monitoring site Marine Traffic. It is now on the move off the coast of the Greek island of Corfu but still ""awaiting orders"" on its final destination, according to the same monitoring site.
- A second yacht linked to Abramovich, Eclipse, was out of tracking coverage for over 24 hours from early on Sunday, according to Marine Traffic. Eclipse's tracking system was back on for a few hours on Tuesday, showing the yacht north of Algeria in the Mediterranean Sea. 
- A Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787-8 linked to Abramovich flew from Moscow to Dubai on March 4, according to Radarbox data.
- A business jet linked to Abramovich landed in Moscow early on Tuesday from Istanbul, according to FLIGHTRADAR24 data. It was briefly in Israel, where Abramovich was spotted in an airport VIP lounger, before the jet departed to Turkey.

- The fate of Deripaska's multi-million pound property portfolio in Britain remained unclear after the government said its assets would be frozen.
Swarmed, not seized:
- In October 2021, FBI agents raided a historic New York City townhouse at 12 Gay Street in Greenwich Village as well as a Washington D.C. mansion connected to Deripaska. He responded on social media by saying nobody was living in those properties. 
- ""I have to ask: how much of Putin's money was found in those abandoned houses yesterday?"" he said, sarcastically inquiring whether investigators had discovered any mouldy jam or vodka in the cupboards.
- Through an LLC in the British Virgin Islands, Deripaska also owns a townhouse on 11 E. 64th Street, which he bought for $42.5 million in 2008, according to New York court records. 
- These properties have not been seized by the government, despite sanctions that prevent him from doing business or owning property in the United States. 
- Deripaska's British Virgin Islands holding company also owns 5 Belgrave Square in London. He bought the mansion in the exclusive Belgravia district for 25 million pounds ($33 million) in 2003, according to multiple media reports. 
- Squatters occupied 5 Belgrave Square on Monday, saying ""this property has been liberated.""
Softened:
- U.S. sanctions were lifted against Rusal and its parent company En+ in 2019 when Deripaska reduced his stakes below a majority threshold to 44.95%. There are still concerns, however, that the Russian oligarch is pulling the strings of his business empire behind the scenes. 
Sailing away: 
- Deripaska's $65 million yacht Clio is one of several vessels owned by billionaires anchored in the Maldives, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, according to shipping database MarineTraffic.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union on Tuesday launched a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, including bans on Russian energy sector investments, luxury goods exports to Moscow and imports of steel products from Russia.
The sanctions also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich and the head of Russian state TV Channel One Konstantin Ernst, who were added to a blacklist that already includes dozens of wealthy Russians.
The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank, the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks, and the freeze of assets of oligarchs and top politicians, including Russia's President Vladimir Putin and foreign minister Sergey Lavrov.
The European Commission said the sanctions included ""a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector"". 
The measures will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) Neft, who will be subjected to a transactions ban, but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them.
Investment in energy projects within Russia run by other Russian companies, including gas giant Gazprom, will also be banned.
The investment ban applies to the whole energy sector, excluding nuclear energy, because some EU countries still rely on technology provided by Moscow for Russian reactors on their soil, the official said. Russia's exports of several raw minerals, including fossil fuels and palladium, remain possible.
There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex.
NO MORE CAVIAR
The bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday.
Under the sanctions, the assets of Abramovich and other oligarchs are to be frozen, but decisions on how to apply this measure rested on EU governments.
The impact on companies owned by blacklisted businessmen remained unclear because there are no precise rules at EU level on how to identify control or ownership, an EU official said.
The EU is trying to bolster exchange of information among EU states to facilitate seizures, as some members have limited staff and may also lack the political will.
The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products.
EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export to Russia any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including precious stones, crystal, caviar, wine, handbags, leather products, shoes and coats. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned.
This was meant to impact on the lifestyle of Russia's elites, an EU official said.
The package also prohibits credit rating agencies based in the EU from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies.
One EU official said the EU was in advanced talks with Washington for the adoption of similar measures by the U.S. which is home to the world's top agencies, ""otherwise the measure will have very little effect.""
The EU also agreed to strip Russia of its ""most-favoured nation"" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.

Russia has $117 million in payments due on Wednesday on two dollar-denominated eurobonds. Its finance ministry has said it will make the payments in roubles if sanctions prevent it from paying in dollars - a move markets would view as a default. 
Russia describes its actions in Ukraine as a ""special military operation"". It has 15 international bonds with a face value of around $40 billion outstanding. Around half of the bonds are held by foreign investors.
Russia's last major external debt default was over a century ago, when Bolsheviks failed to recognise Tsarist debt after the 1917 revolution. In 1998, Russia defaulted on its domestic debt.
The cost of insuring Russian debt against default has surged, and Russian credit spreads have widened.

The forecast represents a jump of 13% from 2021 and follows a total spend of $1.7 trillion over the course of two years of the COVID-19 crisis, starting March 2020. 
""The pandemic was a consequential moment for e-commerce. Not only did it accelerate growth by nearly two years, but it also impacted the types of goods consumers are willing to buy online,"" said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights.
For 2022, the National Retail Federation (NRF) forecast non-store and online sales to grow between 11% and 13% to a range of $1.17 trillion to $1.19 trillion.
The trade body expects overall retail sales, excluding automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants, to rise between 6% and 8%.
""We should see durable growth this year given consumer confidence to continue this expansion, notwithstanding risks related to inflation, COVID-19 and geopolitical threats,"" NRF Chief Executive Officer Matthew Shay said.
Online spending on groceries soared during the pandemic, rising 7.2% last year after more than doubling in 2020, Adobe said, as consumers preferred the safety and convenience of home deliveries. 
That compared with modest growth for apparel, while electronics cemented its position as the top online-shopping category. 
""E-commerce is being reshaped by grocery shopping, a category with minimal discounting compared to legacy categories like electronics and apparel,"" said Patrick Brown, vice president of growth marketing and insights at Adobe.

The forecast was also supported by signs of robust demand even as product prices surge.
After accounting for $32 billion of e-commerce sales last year, inflation would make up as much as $27 billion in online spending in 2022, Adobe said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU finance ministers agreed on Tuesday to subsidise household fuel prices and offer support to companies hit by surging energy prices as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, French Finance Minister Bruno le Maire said.
""This war in Ukraine is leading to a sharp increase in the price of commodities, particularly gas and food. This calls for a coordinated economic response by European states,"" le Maire told a news conference after chairing talks between EU ministers. 
Le Maire, whose country holds the rotating six-month presidency of the 27-nation EU, said the joint strategy was based on European Commission proposals to ease curbs on EU state aid to help deal with the Ukraine emergency. 
""The strategy is based on three key aspects. First, support for all households affected by the sharp rise in fuel prices. This one we did in France and many other European countries have done the same, or are considering doing this,"" said Le Maire.
""That would be a kind of discount on prices at the pump. Many, many people have no choice but to drive to work by car. The support for households we deem necessary,"" he said. 
The second support measure was to help companies hardest hit by the upsurge in gas prices. The help would come as loans guaranteed by the government or grants for companies which consume a lot of energy. 
The third measure was to diversify sources of energy to become independent of Russia which is the bloc's biggest energy supplier, providing 45% of its gas, more than a quarter of its oil and half its coal.
""We have to construct our energy independence as soon as possible. We have to speed up investment, we have to diversify sources of energy, we have to diversify supply sources, we have to build up stocks,"" le Maire said.
European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said EU countries could finance such investment from very cheap loans available under the EU's recovery fund that remained untapped.

""There is still 200 billion euros available in loans that member states can request up to August 2023 to finance more investment and reforms,"" Dombrovskis told the news conference.
""That is a massive amount which can be used to respond to certain challenges arising from the conflict - for example, to accelerate the development of renewables.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain imposed sanctions on hundreds of Russian individuals and entities on Tuesday, using a new law to catch up with the European Union and United States in targeting people accused of propping up Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Britain, the EU and U.S. hope the sanctions will deter Putin from pressing his invasion of Ukraine.
In the latest round of sanctions, brought quickly after the government's Economic Crime Bill became law, Britain moved against those close to Putin, such as former president Dmitry Medvedev, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russian television executive, Konstantin Ernst.
Russian businessmen Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven, oligarchs who amassed their wealth before Putin came to power, were also put under sanctions, as were Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov and foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova.
Britain said the latest round of sanctions included elites with a net worth of 100 billion pounds ($130.63 billion).
""We are going further and faster than ever in hitting those closest to Putin - from major oligarchs, to his prime minister, and the propagandists who peddle his lies and disinformation. We are holding them to account for their complicity in Russia’s crimes in Ukraine,"" foreign minister Liz Truss said.
""Working closely with our allies, we will keep increasing the pressure on Putin and cut off funding for the Russian war machine,"" she said in a statement.
She said Britain had imposed more than 370 new sanctions, taking the total to over 1,000 since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Britain earlier said it would ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and impose a new 35% tariff on 900 million pounds ($1.2 billion) worth of Russian imports, including vodka, metals, fertilisers and other commodities.
""Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.
Russia says it is carrying out a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" Ukraine, which Kyiv and its allies call a baseless pretext to invade a democratic nation of 44 million people.
The government said the export ban would come into effect shortly and it would soon set out which products were affected, but added they would likely include high-end fashion, works of art and luxury vehicles. 
Many British firms including carmakers Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin and luxury fashion label Burberry have already said they are temporarily shutting their outlets in Russia or suspending the supply of goods. 
The government said the goods subject to an additional tariff of 35% had been chosen to minimise impact on Britain while maximising impact on the Russian economy. 
The goods include iron, steel, fertilisers, wood, tyres, railway containers, cement, copper, aluminium, silver, lead, iron ore, residue/food waste products, beverages, spirits and vinegar glass and glassware, cereals, oil seeds, paper and paperboard, machinery, works of art, antiques, fur skins and artificial fur, ships and white fish.

The government also said it was cutting off all export finance support to Russia and Belarus, meaning it will no longer issue any new guarantees, loans or insurance for exports. Existing British exposure to Russia through its export credit agency is around 100 million pounds.

Below is a list of the measures announced by the government on Tuesday:
PUTIN OFFICIALS
Britain imposed sanctions on Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, the former Russian president and top security official Dmitry Medvedev, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov and foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova.
TYCOONS
Britain imposed sanctions on Russian businessmen, including Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and Andrei Melnichenko.
The government said the oligarchs sanctioned on Tuesday had a combined estimated worth of more than 100 billion pounds, based on Forbes estimates. 
BAN ON LUXURY GOODS
""The export ban will come into force shortly and will make sure oligarchs and other members of the elite, who have grown rich under President Putin's reign and support his illegal invasion, are deprived of access to luxury goods,"" the government said in a statement.
""The ban will likely affect luxury vehicles, high-end fashion and works of art."" 
END OF MOST FAVOURED NATION STATUS 
Britain will ""deny Russia and Belarus access to Most Favoured Nation tariff for hundreds of their exports, depriving them of key benefits of WTO membership,"" the government said in a statement.
NEW TARIFFS ON IMPORTS

Britain published a list of goods - including vodka - which will now face additional tariffs of 35%, on top of any existing duties.
Iron, steel, wood, copper, aluminium, silver, lead, iron ore and beverages are among the Russian imports that will face the higher tariffs, the government said.

Tai, in remarks prepared for a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event, said there was more work to do to increase automotive and agricultural trade with South Korea.
""Over the last decade, the value of the goods and services we have exported to Korea has grown by over 17 percent to nearly $70 billion,"" Tai said. ""Along with the successes of the agreement, we have also grappled with disappointments and challenges in its implementation.""
KORUS, which took effect 10 years ago on Tuesday, saw a more-than-doubling of the U.S. goods trade deficit with South Korea to $29.1 billion in 2021 from $13.2 billion in 2011, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
Tai said the U.S. auto industry had increased exports to South Korea, making it the fifth-largest market for U.S.-made vehicles, but there was ""much further to go"" to expand auto export opportunities.
""We must also remain vigilant in our government-to-government cooperation to overcome barriers that undermine the quality and quantity of those opportunities,"" Tai said.
The U.S. trade chief, who has taken a low profile on Russia trade matters since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine, did not mention the war in her remarks. U.S. lawmakers are working on legislation to strip Russia of its permanent normal trade relations status, which would allow the Biden administration to hike tariffs on imports from Russia well above levels pledged to the World Trade Organization.
Tai said U.S. agricultural imports have grown 35% in KORUS' first decade to $9.4 billion in 2021, making South Korea the top export destination for U.S. beef.

""Yet, despite this success, there is still room to grow the market in Korea for U.S. agricultural products – including creating a regulatory environment that facilitates access to agricultural biotechnologies,"" Tai said.
Tai's office said she will travel to Michigan on Wednesday with South Korean Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo to tour a silicon wafer plant being expanded by South Korean semiconductor manufacturer SK Siltron CSS.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Democratic Commissioner Allison Lee plans to leave the agency after her term ends in June, but will remain in office until a successor is named, she said in a Tuesday statement.
""My term as Commissioner expires in June of this year, and I have notified President Biden that I intend to step down from the Commission once my successor has been confirmed,"" Lee said on Tuesday.
Lee's departure would come as the agency tackles an ambitious agenda of rule changes that would affect public companies, brokers, Wall Street banks and investment funds.
The SEC would still maintain a thin 2-1 Democratic majority, however, as it continues to await a replacement of one empty Republican seat vacated by former Commissioner Elad Roisman in January.
A commissioner since 2019, Lee had previously spent several years in senior roles at the SEC from 2005 to 2018, including time as an enforcement attorney.
In January 2021, she began serving as acting chair of the agency until Gary Gensler was sworn in as chief of the Wall Street regulator in April 2021.

""Allison Lee definitively raised the bar while serving as acting chair of the SEC,"" said Satyam Khanna, a sustainability consultant and former SEC policy advisor for climate and ESG.
""She launched pathbreaking ESG initiatives across the SEC, including issuing a request for public information on climate risk disclosure; directing the examination unit to enhance its focus on ESG; and helping shine a light on how investors' money is voted in corporate elections,"" Khanna said.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) -Thousands of workers at Canada's second-biggest railway,  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd, have threatened to strike this week, potentially disrupting the movement of grain, potash and coal at a time of soaring commodity prices.
The strike is the latest risk to Canada's battered supply chain, which last year weathered floods in British Columbia that washed out track and suspended access to Canada's biggest port. The COVID-19 pandemic, a trucker shortage and costly global freight rates have also hampered the flow of goods and ignited food inflation. 
Canada, the second-largest country by area after Russia, depends heavily on rail to move commodities and manufactured goods to port.
CP's network runs across much of southern Canada, extending as far south as Kansas City in the United States. Grain is CP's largest business. 
The last major Canadian railway labor stoppage, at Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co in 2019, lasted eight days and took weeks for shippers to recover.
Some 3,000 members of Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, including engineers, conductors and yard workers, voted this month to potentially strike just after midnight Wednesday. The union has not yet given the required 72 hours notice, however, meaning no legal work stoppage can occur before Friday at the earliest, a CP spokesperson said.
The main outstanding issues are wages, benefits and pensions, the union said.
""Should the (union) exercise its right to strike, CP will be unable to operate the railroad,"" CP Chief Marketing Officer John Brooks said in a March bulletin.
CP said the key bargaining issue is the union's request for higher pension caps. Chief Financial Officer Nadeem Velani said at a New York investor conference on Tuesday that the railway is unwilling to accept that demand.
Velani said the company is considering a lockout before any strike, but would also have to provide 72 hours notice and has not done so.
Manufacturers of goods ranging from food to cars are already struggling with supply chain disruptions, said a coalition of Canadian trade associations.
Numerous U.S. farm industry groups wrote a joint letter to President Joe Biden this month asking him and the Canadian government to avert a strike.
CP carries U.S. grain to Pacific Northwest export terminals, and moves potash fertilizer into the United States, which is critical ahead of spring planting season.
Potash prices have soared with western sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, and against Belarus, the No. 2 and 3 producers after Canada.
A CP strike would have ""serious implications"" for potash transport to ports for shipment to offshore buyers, said Natashia Stinka, spokesperson for Canpotex Ltd, the company owned by  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) Ltd and Mosaic Co (NYSE:MOS).

Federal mediators are assisting the two sides in talks and the Canadian government prefers a negotiated settlement, said a spokesperson for the employment ministry.
The Canadian government can seek to pass legislation that would order workers back to their jobs if they strike.

COLOMBO (Reuters) -Opposition leaders led a march of hundreds of protesters through Sri Lanka's main city of Colombo on Tuesday as anger grows over a worsening economic crisis that has brought fuel shortages and spiralling food prices.
President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's government said it will begin talks next month with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance, while Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa flew into New Delhi to sign a $1-billion credit line to tackle the situation.
""Even after working about 14 to 16 hours a day, we still can't make enough money to support our families,"" said rickshaw driver Nissanka Gunewardena, one of those who marched on a tree-lined boulevard in central Colombo.
""How can anyone live like this?"" added Gunewardena, 34, who has two young children and wore a black headband that read ""Gota Go Home"", referring to the president. 
Historically weak government finances, badly timed tax cuts and the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit the lucrative tourism industry and foreign remittances, have wreaked havoc on the economy, leading to a currency devaluation last week.
Sri Lanka's foreign exchange reserves have fallen 70% in the last two years to about $2.31 billion, leaving the Indian Ocean island nation struggling to pay for essential imports, including food and fuel.
Last week's devaluation stoked further inflation, inflicting more distress on Sri Lankans battling rolling power cuts and fuel shortages.
""We have told the government time and again to change their policies,"" said Eran Wickramaratne, a leader of the opposition alliance, Samagi Jana Balawegaya.
The government, led by the Rajapaksa brothers, another of whom is Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, has pushed Sri Lanka's 22 million people deep into hardship, he added.
""This is the only country in the world where the president and the finance minister have no idea about economic management."" 
IMF TALKS
After months of resistance to seeking IMF help, Rajapaksa's government said on Tuesday it would begin talks with the multilateral lender next month after cabinet authorised the finance minister to draw up proposals.
Cabinet spokesman Ramesh Pathirana said the government would firm up plans on IMF assistance in the next few weeks as the finance minister prepares to visit Washington D.C. in mid-April for the discussions.
In New Delhi this week, the finance minister will sign the $1-billion credit line previously agreed with India to bring in key imports of medicine, food and fuel. He will also meet India's finance and energy ministers.

""Now we are all very disappointed,"" said Gunewardena, the protester, adding that he had voted for Rajapaksa in the last presidential election in 2019.
""We think this government should go. We want change.""

Investing.com -- China's stock market continues to tank on fears of a Covid-driven slowdown and political pressure from the U.S. on Beijing. China again refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine after seven hours of 'intense' talks with the U.S. officials on Monday. Russian bombardments intensify, and European data show growing evidence of stagflation. The Fed's two-day policy meeting starts, and oil is back under $100 a barrel as OPEC prepares to put out its monthly report. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 15th March.
1. Russian bombardment intensifies after inconclusive talks
Russia’s air and artillery bombardment of Ukrainian cities intensified after a day of intense diplomacy that ultimately yielded little. Chinese officials repeated that they want to avoid Western sanctions but again refused to condemn Russia's invasion.
Russian attacks have meanwhile spread to western Ukraine, while at least two of its drones have violated the airspace of NATO members Poland and Romania.  
The European Union extended its sanctions list late on Monday and also imposed a ban on exports of luxury goods to Russia. That led the stock prices in that sector to underperform on what was, in any case, a bad morning for European stocks, marked by a bad miss on the key German ZEW sentiment indicator and another overshoot in French inflation.
2. U.S. PPI due as Fed meeting starts; U.K. jobs data keep rate hike on track
Inflation is on the radar later in the U.S. too, as February’s producer price inflation data are released. Analysts expect a 0.9% rise on the month, taking the annual rate up to 10.0% - a somber backdrop for the start of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting.
The Fed is widely expected to raise the target for the fed funds rate by 25 basis points, its first rate hike since 2018. A more aggressive hike of 50 basis points is seen as less likely, following hints from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at his Congressional testimony a couple of weeks back. The sharp drop in oil prices in the last couple of days may have ended what little risk there was of such an eventuality.
In the U.K. too, economic data continued to support the case for what would be a third straight interest rate rise when the Bank of England meets later this week. The jobless rate fell below its pre-pandemic level in February, while average earnings growth accelerated well above expectations.
3. Stocks set to open lower  
U.S. stock markets are set to open mostly lower later, under pressure from weakness in both Europe and China (see below).
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 81 points, or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were effectively unchanged. That reverses the pattern of Monday, when the tech-heavy Nasdaq underperformed.
In addition to the PPI, the New York Empire State Manufacturing survey is also due, while Dole heads a sparse earnings calendar.
Other stocks likely to be in focus include Nielsen (NYSE:NLSN), after reports that it’s in talks to sell itself to a consortium including Elliott Management.
4. Chinese stock rout deepens; Covid wave overtakes strong data
China’s stock rout deepened, as investors continued to flee from a growing number of risks.
Talks between U.S. and Chinese officials on Monday did little to banish fears that China could get drawn into the web of western sanctions as a result of its continued support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while authorities have now locked down over 45 million people in two big industrial hubs at opposite ends of the country to stop the spread of Covid-19.
Technology stocks remain particularly stressed: the Hang Seng TECH index lost another 11% on Tuesday and has now unwound all of its pandemic-era gains. Other benchmark cash indices lost between 2% and 5%.
That all happened despite data showing that both industrial production and retail sales were ahead of expectations in February. The data have been somewhat overtaken by events in the meantime. The yuan weakened to a two-month low.
5. Oil back under $100 on China slowdown fears; API inventories, OPEC monthly report due
Crude oil prices fell below $100 a barrel for the first time this month, and spikes in other commodities also continued to unwind on fears of a Chinese economic slowdown due to its problems containing the coronavirus.  Such fears are outweighing fresh signs of geopolitical tension, with agents suspected of having links to Iran having launched the biggest-ever cyberattack on Israel late on Monday.
By 6:25 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 5.9% at $96.97, while Brent was still holding just above the $100 level at $100.70, down 5.8%.
The U.S.-based American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly inventory assessment at 4:30 PM ET, while the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will release its monthly report on the global oil market. It’s expected to repeat the bloc’s message that there is no physical shortfall of supplies (despite failing to meet its own production targets in recent months).",,,,,

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New economic projections from the Federal Reserve this week will show how far and how fast policymakers see interest rates rising this year, in a first test of the impact of the Ukraine war and surging inflation on the coming shift in U.S. monetary policy. 
The Fed's policy-setting committee is expected to raise borrowing costs by a quarter of a percentage point at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, a session that will set the tone for the central bank's reaction to a war-driven energy shock that is colliding with an end-of-pandemic economic reopening and strong consumer demand.
The latest quarterly economic projections, due to be issued along with a policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, will show what officials anticipate in terms of key indicators, including GDP growth, inflation and unemployment. In particular, updated outlooks will signal how aggressive policymakers may be in raising interest rates and whether that could jeopardize an expected record-setting run of low unemployment.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference shortly after the materials are released to discuss the meeting and outlook.
As of December, policymakers saw a relatively benign battle with inflation that required only modest rate increases and no change to an unemployment rate seen lodged at 3.5% through 2024 - an employment outcome not seen since the early post-World War II boom in the 1950s.
This week's meeting ""is complicated"" by the need to respond quickly to inflation, now running at a 40-year high, but also by a desire to control prices without increasing the unemployment rate, said Steve Englander, head of macro research for North America at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank. 
Fed officials in December projected that raising the benchmark overnight interest rate, or federal funds rate, by a total of three-quarters of a percentage point would be enough in 2022 to start easing inflation back towards the 2% target. 
Since then, price increases have accelerated - the Fed's preferred inflation measure is currently 6% - and the outbreak of war in Europe has added a new set of risks. But Englander said Fed officials may still shy from the sort of restrictive policy that might raise the risk of recession, and rising joblessness, in coming years.
""We are not convinced by the ultra-hawkish arguments"" that see the Fed raising rates at each of its remaining seven policy meetings this year or signaling, at this point anyway, that rates will need to become restrictive to win the inflation fight, he said. 
HAWKISH MESSAGE
Englander said he expects the Fed will signal rate increases totaling 1.25 to 1.50 percentage points this year, which is less than many investors currently expect. 
The median estimate of economists polled by Reuters also projects the Fed will lift the target federal funds rate from the current near-zero level to a range of between 1.25% to 1.50% by the end of 2022, equivalent to five quarter-percentage-point increases. 
Investors in futures contracts linked to the target federal funds rate currently see the Fed hiking borrowing costs at a slightly faster pace to end the year with its policy rate between 1.75% and 2.00%.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic the Fed's projections for the U.S. economy have been out of sync with how things actually evolved.
The unemployment rate fell faster, growth accelerated more quickly, and, perhaps most notably, the rate of inflation surged well beyond what was anticipated.
As the Fed's projections caught up with the economy, the policy outlook adjusted as well, with officials penciling in more and more rate hikes for the coming year and beyond.
Yet as of December they held firmly to the hope of a ""soft landing.""
The federal funds rate would only need to rise to around 2.10% by the end of 2024 for inflation to ease, a rate that is low by historic standards and loose enough to keep economic growth above trend and the unemployment rate at a steady 3.5% through 2024.

It may not all look so rosy when the dust settles on Wednesday.
""Growth and unemployment should be revised lower while headline and core (personal consumption expenditures) inflation get revised higher ... We expect a hawkish message from Chair Powell, who will likely reiterate that the Fed needs to get serious about price stability,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts wrote. 
 
"
163,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 04:20AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) -A key money market indicator is now pricing U.S. interest rates peaking at a higher level than previously forecast, as traders bet that the Federal Reserve will prioritise stamping out inflation over fretting about risks to economic growth. 
As war in Ukraine sparks renewed commodity price surges and threatens more supply chain disruptions, a rethink is underway on how fast the Fed will raise rates, given that inflation is at a 40-year high near 8% and rising.
A quarter-point increase is seen as a done deal at the Fed's Wednesday meeting, with another six or seven moves expected this year. Traders are also re-assessing the ""terminal"" rate - the point were the federal funds rate will peak.
Currently, the expectation is for the terminal rate to be hit in the second half of 2023, and on Monday, the implied yield - essentially a proxy for the fed funds rate - on September 2023 Eurodollar contracts rose to 2.57%. That is up 57 basis points in a week, and up 100 bps this year. 
The fed funds range is currently 0-0.25%.
This means traders now anticipate a terminal rate of around 2.50%. For most of this year, the Eurodollar market indicated a terminal rate closer to 2%. 
The new pricing gels with the 2.5% median forecast of Fed policymakers.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Sven Jari Stehn said his bank's analysis indicates a terminal rate of 2.75%-3%. ""When we think of the post-COVID world, with tight labour markets, elevated inflation and green investment, all that should support higher rates,"" Stehn said. 
Eurodollar futures not only suggest a higher peak but also imply rates will stay higher for longer. Readings are distorted by thinner liquidity further down the curve, but current pricing shows rates staying above 2% for the next decade .

The risk, however, is that too-aggressive a tightening could be a mistake that chokes the economy and heralds recession, particularly at a time of high energy prices. 
""One thing is clear - the Fed's guidance will change from hawkish to dovish at some point,"" Citi analysts told clients. ""There is uncertainty around when the Fed will have to engage in easing but this cycle will very likely be shorter than previous cycles.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is set to keep monetary policy ultra-loose on Friday and warn of heightening economic risks from the Ukraine crisis, unfazed by prospects of rising inflation and anticipated U.S. interest rate hikes.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said Japan won't follow in the footsteps of its U.S. and European counterparts eyeing interest rate hikes, a stance he is likely to repeat at his post-meeting briefing.
Such dovish signals by the BOJ will follow an expected rate hike by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, and may weaken the yen further from a five-year low against the dollar on prospects of widening Japan-U.S. interest rate differentials.
While the BOJ sees a weak yen benefitting the economy via rising exports, it adds strain to households and retailers by inflating the cost of already surging fuel and food imports.
Such side-effects complicate the BOJ's efforts to underpin a fragile economic recovery, which has been hobbled by supply constraints and the hit to consumption from COVID-19 curbs.
The BOJ will also face communication challenges as core consumer inflation, currently around zero, is seen accelerating near its 2% goal from April due to rising energy costs and the fading effects of cellphone fee cuts, analysts say.
""Japan's economy is still in the midst of recovering from the pandemic's impact,"" Seiichi Shimizu, head of the BOJ's monetary affairs department, told parliament on Tuesday.
""Cost-push inflation driven by rising fuel costs won't allow Japan to sustainably and stably achieve 2% inflation,"" he said, stressing the BOJ's resolve to maintain ultra-easy policy.
At the two-day policy meeting ending on Friday, the BOJ is set to maintain its short-term rate target at -0.1% and that for the 10-year bond yield around 0%.
The BOJ will project inflation to accelerate more clearly on rising energy prices, while offering a bleaker view on the economy than in January, sources have told Reuters.
But the central bank is expected to roughly maintain its projection of a moderate economic recovery, as policymakers prefer to wait until April for more clarity on how the war in Ukraine could affect the global growth outlook, analysts say.
The BOJ will conduct a more thorough economic assessment at a subsequent policy meeting on April 27-28, when it conducts a quarterly review of its growth and inflation estimates.

While subdued inflation will keep the BOJ from tightening policy any time soon, the BOJ is also cautious about ramping up stimulus due to its dwindling ammunition.
With little room to cut already low rates, the BOJ's first line of defense against any market turbulence would be to pump huge amounts of liquidity and step up buying of exchange-traded funds (ETF), say sources familiar with its thinking.

166,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 12:21AM ET</span>",,,,,,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's central bank kept some of its policy rates unchanged in a liquidity operation on Tuesday, dashing expectations for a cut, although investors believe policymakers may resume monetary easing soon to prop up the cooling economy.
The surprise decision comes a day before the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to deliver its first interest rate hike in three years and analysts say Beijing may want to avoid widening policy divergence for the time being.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it would keep the rate on 200 billion yuan ($31.44 billion) worth of one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans to some financial institutions unchanged at 2.85% from the previous operation.
The operation resulted in a net injection of 100 billion yuan in fresh funds, replacing the 100 billion yuan due to mature on Tuesday. The PBOC attributed the move to ""maintaining banking system liquidity reasonably ample"", according to an online statement.
Most traders and analysts in a Reuters poll predicted a reduction to the one-year MLF rate.
Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank, said the PBOC avoided adjusting its key interest rates ahead of the Fed's policy meeting, at which the U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates.
""But the PBOC will ease monetary policy further by lowering policy interest rates in order to reach the government's annual growth target of around 5.5%,"" Cheung said.
He expects the PBOC to cut MLF rate in April when China reports its first quarter growth.
Major global central banks including United States, Britain and Japan are scheduled to meet this week, with most of them set to turn hawkish in monetary policy stance. China's policy divergence could prompt capital outflow risks.
Also, lowering the MLF rate may not necessarily bring about the desired improvement in credit demand, Marco Sun, chief financial markets analyst at MUFG argued.
The PBOC may want to wait to see the effects of its cut to key rates in January before additional easing, Sun said, adding he still sees the possibility for banks to lower the lending benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) this month.

The central bank also injected 10 billion yuan through seven-day reverse repos to offset same amount of such loans due on the same day, while keeping borrowing costs unchanged at 2.1%, according to the statement.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank remains prepared to be patient on raising interest rates as it waits for wage growth to pick up, though it warned a surge in commodity prices caused by the war in Ukraine would add to inflationary pressure.
Minutes of its March meeting released on Tuesday showed the Board of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) was generally upbeat on the domestic outlook with labour market conditions the tightest since 2008.
However, the outlook for the world economy had been darkened by the conflict in Ukraine.
""The invasion had created additional uncertainty about the global outlook and was an adverse supply shock that would result in lower growth and higher inflation,"" the minutes showed.
Yet Board members agreed it was too early to conclude that inflation would not again fall out of the 2-3% target band once supply pressures abated, and noted wage growth still lagged.
""The Board is prepared to be patient as it monitors how the various factors affecting inflation in Australia evolve,"" it concluded.
The central bank kept interest rates at a record low of 0.1% as widely expected at the March meeting, though RBA Governor Philip Lowe did say it was plausible a first hike could come later this year should the economy strengthen as expected.
So far, economic activity has surprised with its resilience as household's used extra saving built up over the pandemic to spend with abandon. 
A wave of Omicron cases, the rising cost of living and massive flooding on the east coast have tested confidence, but not derailed the recovery.
The labour market has been particularly impressive, generating a record run of jobs that pushed unemployment to its lowest in 13 years at 4.2%.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe is keen to get unemployment under 4% for the first time since the 1970s and is prepared to keep rates low to deliver it and, hopefully, drive wages higher.
Complicating this mission is a recent surge in global commodity prices which looks certain to lift inflation above the RBA's, already lofty, forecasts.
Core inflation is running at a relatively manageable 2.6% but analysts suspect it will spike above 3% in the March quarter and rise further in the June quarter.
That is a major reason financial markets are pricing in a first rate hike to 0.25% in June and a string of increases to at least 1.25% by year end.

Such a rapid-fire tightening would be a shock to borrowers, many of whom have not seen an official rate rise given the last RBA hike was back in 2010.
So indebted are households that many analysts assume rates will not have to rise far to really crimp spending, with some predicting a peak of 1.75-2.0% and a few as low as 1.25%.

169,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 10:01PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China unleashed more funds into the financial system as policy makers sought to bolster the economy weighed by resurgence in virus-led curbs and slowdown in the nation’s property market.
The People’s Bank of China injected a net 100 billion yuan. It also kept the interest rate unchanged at 2.85% on Tuesday after slashing it in January for the first time in almost two years. Ten of the 17 economists polled by Bloomberg had forecast the PBOC to lower the rate.
The need for additional monetary stimulus gained momentum after data last week showed credit expansion in the country unexpectedly slowed in February and a key indicator of home mortgages declined for the first time in at least 15 years. The resurgence of Covid-19 cases and a lockdown in the southern city of Shenzhen, home to major technology firms and one of the busiest ports in the nation, also threatened to slow the world’s second-largest economy.
The government has already outlined higher spending while setting an ambitious a growth target of 5.5% for the year at the National People’s Congress this month. It’s a goal that political leaders say won’t be easy to meet and would need supportive economic policies. 
The PBOC has already resorted to unconventional methods of supporting the economy. It announced a plan to transfer more than 1 trillion yuan ($158 billion) in profits to the government to help finance fiscal spending last week. 
China’s economy rebounded from its pandemic slump to grow 8.1% last year, though the momentum has slowed to half that pace in the final quarter, dragged down by a housing market slump and weak consumption. The outlook is also deteriorating amid geopolitical tensions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a spike in oil prices.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England is almost certain to increase borrowing costs on Thursday, nearly all economists polled by Reuters said, marking the third consecutive meeting where it has raised Bank Rate as it continues its exit from pandemic-related support.
Like most central banks the BoE slashed interest rates to a record low as the coronavirus swept across the world but is now facing soaring inflation, which reached a near 30-year high of 5.5% in January and is likely to rise further.
It was the first major central bank to raise interest rates since the pandemic began two years ago. The United States Federal Reserve is widely expected to act on Wednesday and last week the European Central Bank paved the way for an increase later this year. [ECILT/US]
The Monetary Policy Committee will add another 25 basis points to Bank Rate this week, taking it to 0.75% - its pre-pandemic level - according to 44 of 49 economists polled by Reuters March 10-14. The other five said there would be no change.
In January, the British economy grew much faster than expected, expanding 0.8% according to official data last week. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has injected more uncertainty in a climate where high inflation had already made a difficult path for the Bank to negotiate.
""The economic consequences of the war in Ukraine have worsened the already tricky mix between soaring inflation and slowing GDP growth,"" said Paul Dales at Capital Economics. 
Still, the Bank is expected to follow up this week's increase with another 25 basis point rise next quarter and a matching increase in Q3, poll medians showed. 
It will then raise Bank Rate to 1.50% early next year, the median showed, although that rate was picked by 15 of 44 economists while 21 saw it lower and eight higher. In February it wasn't expected to reach there until 2024.
When asked about the risk to their forecasts for interest rate hikes in the current cycle over three quarters, 14 of 18 economists said it was that the Bank increases faster than they expected. Four said it was the opposite.
Four of the nine MPC members voted for a 50 basis point hike last month but none of the economists surveyed had that as their base case for this month's decision and only four of 18 respondents said it was a likely move this year.
Rate-setter Michael Saunders, who voted for a 50 basis point increase last month, said earlier in March he would not necessarily vote the same way again.
""Following recent commentary from MPC members, we think a 50 basis point hike is very unlikely,"" noted economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
PRICES RISING
Inflation was expected to peak at 7.7% next quarter, almost four times the Bank's 2% goal and a sharp upgrade from the 6.6% median given last month. It was expected to slow in following quarters but won't reach target until late 2023, the poll found.
And 15 of 18 economists said it was likely or very likely they upgraded their medium-term inflation forecasts in the coming months. Only three said it was unlikely. 
In contrast, growth forecasts were largely revised down. Following January's buoyant expansion this quarter's outlook was changed to 0.7% from 0.4% but the following quarters were all downgraded to 0.4% from last month's 0.9%, 0.6% and 0.6%.
Annual rates were also lowered with growth now pegged at 3.9% this year and 1.7% next, down from 4.3% and 2.1%.
""The intensifying cost of living crisis should ultimately weigh on activity – particularly private consumption over the coming quarters,"" said Sanjay Raja at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 

""Consumer confidence is already weakening, and we expect this to translate into weaker GDP data over the course of the year.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A default on Russia's sovereign debt would add further pain to Russia's economy and financial system, making it harder for Moscow to find new lending sources and raising future borrowing costs, a U.S. Treasury official said on Monday.
The official told Reuters the Treasury believes there are limited direct exposures in the U.S. financial system to Russian sovereign bonds and the main impact would fall on a Russian economy already reeling under the weight of Western sanctions.
""A default would make it increasingly difficult for Russia to find new lenders, and those who do lend to them will demand higher interest rates, leading to a further drain on the Russian economy,"" the official said.
Russia, which is pursuing an increasingly destructive invasion of Ukraine, has $117 million in payments due on Wednesday on two dollar-denominated eurobonds. Its finance ministry has said it will make the payments in roubles if sanctions prevent it from paying in dollars - a move markets would view as a default.
Western sanctions have immobilized the foreign exchange assets in Russia's central bank and prohibited international banks from dollar and euro transactions with sanctioned Russian financial institutions - including the central bank - complicating any payments.
Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo earlier told CNBC that Russia's choices in how it pays its debts will drain resources from President Vladimir Putin's ability to continue the war in Ukraine.
""Those choices will ultimately put (Putin) in a position where he has to make a decision about whether he continues the invasion or stops that invasion,"" Adeyemo said. 
The Russian eurobonds in question, maturing in 2023 and 2043, traded at 20 cents on the dollar or lower on Monday. They are among the first to have scheduled payments after Russia was hit by sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.

The U.S. Treasury official said the dramatic falls in the price of Russian sovereign bonds suggested a high probability of default.
""Investors are paying close attention to payments coming due soon and are preparing for alternative outcomes,"" the official added.

LONDON (Reuters) -A global food crisis looms unless the war in Ukraine is stopped because fertiliser prices are soaring so fast that many farmers can no longer afford soil nutrients, Russian fertiliser and coal billionaire Andrei Melnichenko said on Monday.
Several of Russia's richest businessmen have publicly called for peace since President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion on Feb. 24, including Mikhail Fridman, Pyotr Aven and Oleg Deripaska.
The United States and its European allies have cast Putin's invasion as an imperial-style land grab.
They have sanctioned Russian businessmen - including EU sanctions on Melnichenko, frozen state assets and cut off much of the Russian corporate sector from the global economy in an attempt to force Putin to change course. 
Putin refuses to. He has called the war a special military operation to rid Ukraine of dangerous nationalists and Nazis.
""The events in Ukraine are truly tragic. We urgently need peace,"" Melnichenko, 50, who is Russian but was born in Belarus and has a Ukrainian mother, told Reuters in a statement emailed by his spokesman. 
""One of the victims of this crisis will be agriculture and food,"" he said.
Melnichenko is the founder of EuroChem, one of Russia's biggest fertiliser producers, which moved to Zug, Switzerland, in 2015, and SUEK, Russia's top coal producer.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands, displaced more than 2 million people, and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States, the world's two biggest nuclear powers.
FOOD WAR?
Putin said last Thursday that food prices would rise globally due to soaring fertiliser prices if the West created problems for Russia's export of fertilisers, which account for 13% of world output.
Russia is a major producer of potash, phosphate and nitrogen containing fertilisers - major crop and soil nutrients. EuroChem, which produces nitrogen, phosphates and potash, says it is one of the world's top five fertiliser companies. 
The war ""has already led to soaring prices in fertilisers which are no longer affordable to farmers,"" Melnichenko said.
Food supply chains already disrupted by COVID-19 were now even more distressed. 
""Now it will lead to even higher food inflation in Europe and likely food shortages in the world’s poorest countries,"" he said.
Russia's trade and industry ministry told the country's fertiliser producers to temporarily halt exports earlier this month.
International food and feed prices could rise by up to 20% as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, triggering a jump in global malnourishment, the United Nations food agency said on Friday.
PHYSICS STUDENT
Melnichenko, who was just 19 when the Soviet Union collapsed, started out trading foreign currency while a physics student at Moscow State University.
A mathematician who once dreamt of becoming a physicist, Melnichenko dropped out of university to dive into the chaotic - and sometimes deadly - world of post-Soviet business. 
He founded MDM Bank but in the 1990s was still too minor to take part in the privatisations under President Boris Yeltsin which handed the choicest assets of a former superpower to a group of businessmen who would become known as the oligarchs due to their political and economic clout.
Melnichenko then began buying up often distressed coal and fertiliser assets. His fortune in 2021 was estimated by Forbes to be $18 billion, making him Russia's eighth richest man.
The European Union on Wednesday sanctioned Melnichenko for Russia's invasion. It said his attendance at a Kremlin meeting with Putin and 36 businessmen organised by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs showed he was ""one of the leading businesspersons involved in economic sectors"".
Melnichenko ""has no relation to the tragic events in Ukraine. He has no political affiliations,"" his spokesman said. 
""To draw a parallel between attending a meeting through membership in a business council, just as dozens of business people from both Russia and Europe have done in the past, and undermining or threatening a country is absurd and nonsensical,"" the spokesman said, adding Melnichenko will dispute the sanctions. 

On March 9, Melnichenko resigned as member of the board and non-executive director in both EuroChem and SUEK, and withdrew as their beneficiary, the spokesman said. EuroChem has production assets in Russia, Lithuania, Belgium, Brazil and Kazakhstan.
Italian police last week seized his yacht - the 143-metre (470-foot) Sailing Yacht A - which has a price tag of 530 million euros ($578 million).

Asked if the Biden administration would meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's demands to close international waterways for Russia and to implement a full trade embargo against Moscow, Adeyemo said the United States would take actions consistent with Zelenskiy's goals, but declined to be specific. 
""So you’re going to see us continue to put pressure on the Russian economy to stop their ability to project power. We’re going to continue to go after Russian elites in order to take away resources from President Putin,"" Adeyemo said.
""And then we’re going to use export controls to degrade their ability to project power into the future, all of which are consistent with what President Zelenskiy has been asking us to do,"" Adeyemo added.

The Treasury's No. 2 official said that Western sanctions were already causing a ""financial crisis"" in Russia that is forcing difficult decisions on how it finances its war efforts. Russia has two dollar-denominated bond payments due on Wednesday and has said it is prepared to pay in roubles - a move tantamount to a default.
""They're in a position where they're going to have to make choices about what debts they pay going forward and those choices will ultimately put (Putin) in a position where he has to make a decision about whether he continues the invasion or stops that invasion,"" Adeyemo said.

174,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 07:11PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Sarah Bloom Raskin's nomination to become the top bank regulator at the Federal Reserve, already stalled by Republicans, was dealt a heavy blow on Monday after she lost the backing of a senator from President Joe Biden's Democratic Party. 
Raskin's ""previous public statements have failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation's critical energy needs,"" Senator Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia, said in a statement.
""I have come to the conclusion that I am unable to support her nomination,"" he said.
With Manchin casting a thumbs down on her nomination, Raskin would need to win over at least one Republican in the evenly divided U.S. Senate to have a hope of being confirmed.
Raskin, however, is the most contentious of Biden's five nominees to the Fed's Board of Governors and faces strong Republican opposition. The Democratic president also has nominated Fed Chair Jerome Powell for a second term.
Manchin's announcement ""probably"" ends her nomination ""as a practical matter,"" Senator Pat Toomey, the Senate Banking Committee's top Republican, told Bloomberg TV. ""I'm not aware of any Republican support for Ms. Raskin.""
After Manchin's statement, the White House signaled it was sticking with her and was trying to line up Republican support. 
Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican whose support Democrats have courted on key votes in the past, told reporters she also would not vote for Raskin, citing ""gaps in experience"" among other issues.
Toomey and his fellow Republicans on the banking committee have blocked Raskin's nomination from advancing by refusing to appear for a panel vote on the Fed nominees. They say past remarks indicate she would further a green energy policy that they fear could reduce fossil fuel companies' access to capital.
Manchin, who represents the country's second-biggest coal producing state and one that voted overwhelmingly for former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election, has been a persistent roadblock for Biden administration initiatives.

Powell, expected this week to announce the first in a series of interest rate hikes to combat soaring inflation, has broad bipartisan support. Several Republicans have also said they will vote to confirm a second Fed nominee, Davidson College's Philip Jefferson. 
Toomey on Monday told Bloomberg TV he would vote against Biden's pick for Fed vice chair, current Fed Governor Lael Brainard, as well as against Michigan State University's Lisa Cook, who if seated would be the first Black female Fed governor.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union agreed on Monday new rules to limit access to its 2 trillion euros ($2.2 trillion) worth of public tenders in a move designed to pressure countries such as China to open up their markets.
The rules are part of an EU push to develop a more assertive trade policy and insist on fair play after the pain of Brexit, clashes with the Trump presidency and a new realism over China.
European Parliament lawmakers and France, which holds the rotating EU presidency, settled on a text on Monday, paving the way for the launch of the International Procurement Instrument (IPI) later this year.
French trade minister Franck Riester said Europe was stepping away from naivety and looking after its own businesses and insisting on reciprocity. 
Under the proposal, the European Commission will determine if third countries allow fair access to their public tenders to EU companies and, if not, seek remedies.
Otherwise, the EU would apply penalties to companies from that country, such as adding as much as 100% to the price of the bid during the selection process.
The rules would apply for central governments and any local authority with 50,000 people or more and cover tenders of at least 15 million euros for works and concessions, such as road construction, and 5 million euros for goods and services.
Exemptions would only be allowed if the only bids were from targeted countries or in cases of overriding public interest, such as for health.
In some cases, the EU could even exclude bids from particular countries.

The IPI, first proposed in 2012, was blocked for years, but the Commission urged EU governments and the parliament in 2019 to revive talks on a revised text, stressing the challenge posed by China, which EU members now regard more suspiciously.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's federal government plans to announce on Thursday a program providing some 165 billion reais ($32 billion) of economic stimulus during the current election year, three people familiar with the plan told Reuters.
The so-called 'Income and Opportunity Program' includes an early payment of some public pension checks, a measure letting workers withdraw some cash from a severance fund known as FGTS, a new microcredit program, and an expansion of payroll-deductible loans, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
They said at least 30 billion reais will be released from FGTS, allowing for up to 1,000 reais per worker, a move Economy Minister Paulo Guedes had already indicated was on its way.
Both the administrations of President Jair Bolsonaro and his predecessor Michel Temer had already implemented measures to free up those funds. Under normal circumstances, money can only be withdrawn from FGTS in specific situations, such as if a worker retires, is fired, or wants to buy property.
The government will also bring forward the payment of some public pension checks, the sources said, repeating a measure taken in 2020 and 2021 during the coronavirus pandemic. The expected July payment would reach pensioners' pockets before October elections.
Bolsonaro, who is widely expected to seek re-election, is currently trailing in opinion polls to former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. 

The creation of a microcredit program and the expansion of payroll-deductible loans aim to allow workers access to resources that could be invested in small businesses, the sources said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers agreed on Monday to tighten fiscal policy a little next year after three years of pumping billions into the economy due to the coronavirus pandemic, but also to be ready with more cash should the war in Ukraine make it necessary.
""The fundamentals of the euro area economy are strong,"" the ministers from the 19 countries sharing the euro said in a statement after regular talks.
""However, the uncertainty has increased significantly. The economic impact of Russia’s war against Ukraine is yet to be determined and adds to risks stemming from ongoing supply chain problems, higher energy prices and inflation remaining elevated for longer than previously expected,"" the ministers said.
The Commission, the EU's executive, recommended on March 2 that EU governments should move to a neutral fiscal stance next year from a supportive stance now as the economy is growing and EU countries have large debts as a result of the pandemic.
But it also said governments should be ready to quickly move back to supporting the economy with public money depending on what challenges Russia's invasion of Ukraine brings.
""We support the Commission’s view that... transitioning from an aggregate supportive fiscal stance in the euro area to a broadly neutral aggregate fiscal stance next year appears to be appropriate while standing ready to react to the evolving economic situation, also in view of the high level of uncertainty,"" the ministers said in the statement.
A potential quick policy change will be made easier by the fact that EU government borrowing limits, first suspended in 2020 to help fight the pandemic, are likely to stay suspended in 2023 because of the uncertainty brought by war.
Still, the ministers agreed that high debt countries like Italy or Greece should focus on cutting debt, while low debt ones focus more on investment.

The European Central Bank forecast last week that euro zone growth will be 0.5 percentage points slower this year than previously expected because of the war in Ukraine, but still come in at 3.7%, and at 2.8% in 2023.
Inflation, however, is set to average 5.1% in 2022, well above the bank's target of 2.0%, falling to 2.1% in 2023, the ECB forecast. The Commission will publish its own updated economic growth forecasts for the euro zone in May.

181,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 01:56PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Russia on Monday passed a law allowing the country's airlines to place airplanes leased from foreign companies on the country's aircraft register - a manoeuvre likely to stoke Western fears of a mass default involving hundreds of jetliners.
The bill, signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, has rattled global leasing firms days before a March 28 deadline to repossess aircraft worth $10 billion as a result of Western sanctions imposed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Russian airlines have almost 780 leased jets, with 515 leased from abroad. 
The new law, part of Russia's measures to combat the sanctions, says it aims ""to ensure the uninterrupted functioning of activities in the field of civil aviation"".
It comes after Bermuda and Ireland, where virtually all foreign-leased jets operating in Russia are registered, said they were suspending airworthiness certificates on the jets because they could no longer be sure they were safe. 
Re-registering jets in Russia would aim to keep them flying domestically by granting access to new safety approvals.
But adding Russia as a second host country could put Moscow at odds with international rules barring the registration of civil planes in more than one country at a time.
Unless Western lessors agree to Russian requests to release their jets from foreign registries - widely seen as unlikely while they struggle as it is to regain control of assets - the new policy also paves the way for a major contractual debate.
""It is illegal to register an aircraft without proof of deregistration from the previous registry as well as the agreement of the owner. This would be a default under leasing contracts,"" said aviation adviser Bertrand Grabowski.
AIRLINE DILEMMA
Technically, the new law does not instruct airlines to re-register their planes without the permission of owners led by Dublin-based AerCap, the world's largest air lessor.
But experts said it puts the onus on the airline to apply for new registration to keep flying inside Russia - at the risk of poisoning relations with powerful lessors once the crisis is over - or else do nothing and see their fleets grounded.
Not all of Russia's 35 airlines, about 15 of which represent 95% of the country's traffic, are relishing what experts have already warned could spiral into aviation's largest default.
""We hope to avoid registering our planes in Russia; we want to return them to leasing companies,"" a source at one of the airlines said. 
""The airline would become an accomplice. The law provides a way to register in Russia, but does not oblige the airline to do so....It is the first step to the kidnapping of the airplanes.""
Moscow's government insists special measures are needed in the face of sanctions on the economy that President Vladimir Putin has described as ""akin to a declaration of war"".
Lawyers say a three-way legal battle between airlines, lessors and insurers could last for a decade.
AerCap and other major lessors declined comment on the law. Major Russian airlines Aeroflot and S7 also declined comment.
The Russian Federal Aviation Agency said 776 planes were registered abroad as of Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour.
Dozens of older planes that found homes in Russia during the pandemic may never be returned and are said to be worth less than their owners may be able to claim in insurance. 
But the world's 11th largest aviation market also includes some of the newest jets including a state-of-the-art Airbus A350 delivered to Aeroflot on the day of the invasion.

The United States and Europe on one side and Russia on the other have blocked their airspace to each others' airlines.
Russia's state aviation authority recommended last week that airlines with foreign-leased aircraft suspend flights abroad, making it harder for lessors to make repossessions. Some 425 jets are most at risk, the consultancy Ascend by Cirium says.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ukraine's economy is expected to contract by 10% in 2022 as a result of Russia's invasion, but the outlook could worsen sharply if the conflict lasts longer, the International Monetary Fund said in a staff report released on Monday.
The report, prepared ahead of the IMF's approval of $1.4 billion in emergency financing, said Ukraine's economic output could shrink by 25% to 35%, based on real wartime gross domestic product data from Iraq, Lebanon and other countries at war.
Ukraine had an external financing gap of $4.8 billion, IMF staff said in their March 7 report, but its financing needs were expected to grow and it would require significant additional concessional financing as a result of the war.
The IMF is working to set up a trust fund instrument through which bilateral donors can channel resources to Ukraine, an official with the global lender said. 
The $1.4 billion already approved in emergency financing is the maximum Ukraine can borrow under current IMF rules, but the loan is having a ""catalytic"" effect in encouraging other donors, the official said.
Ivanna Vladkova Hollar, the IMF mission chief for Ukraine, said Ukrainian authorities were making ""a remarkable effort"" to keep the country's economy and financial system running in the face of the war.
""Making wage and pension payments, restocking ATMs with cash, opening bank branches ... continuing to make payments on external debt obligations, so that post-war they can resume normal operations with their creditors and markets. It's really actually a remarkable, remarkable effort,"" she said.
The report forecast a deterioration in Ukraine's growth outlook of at least 13.5 percentage points relative to a pre-war baseline, with output falling 10% in 2022, assuming a prompt resolution of the war, and substantial donor support.
That compares to a 6.6% drop in output in 2014, the year that Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine, and just under 10% in 2015.
IMF staff said there was massive uncertainty about the outlook, given the intensity of the conflict, and warned that increasing loss of physical capital stock and huge refugee flows could result in ""significantly more pronounced output contraction,"" a collapse in trade flows and lower tax revenues.
RISING DEBT
The war - the biggest in Europe since World War Two - has sparked a massive humanitarian and economic shock, the IMF report said, citing rapidly increasing loss of life and significant infrastructure damage across the country. Russia describes its invasion as a ""special military operation.""
It said Ukrainian authorities had continued to service their external debt obligations and the country's payment system remained operational, with banks open and mostly liquid.
It said authorities had implemented appropriate emergency measures to stabilize markets and the economy, but the downside risks were ""exceedingly high"" and the country faced large fiscal and external financing gaps.
The country's public debt was expected to spike to 60% of GDP in 2022 from around 50% in 2021, the report said.
Vladyslav Rashkovan, alternate executive director for Ukraine at the IMF, told the IMF's board that Ukrainian authorities were in broad agreement with the IMF staff's assessment of the economic situation, and underscored the need for more financial support.

He said liquidity buffers adopted after the Russian invasion were sufficient for financing expenditures and repaying liabilities, with most Ukrainian companies still paying taxes and some even paying in advance to support the budget.
In his statement, Rashkovan said Ukraine had spent the equivalent of $1.4 billion on servicing and repayment of its foreign exchange public debt since the start of the war.

The move appeared to be part of a tectonic shift in German security policy, including a pledge to reach NATO's 2% target for defence spending, after years of accusations that Germany was too dovish towards Moscow in compensation for its Nazi past.
""After looking thoroughly into all available options, I decided to initiate the purchase of F-35 aircraft as replacement for the Tornado in the role of nuclear sharing,"" Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said in a statement.
The Tornado is the only German jet capable of carrying U.S. nuclear bombs, which are stored in Germany, in case of a conflict. But the German air force has been flying the Tornado since the 1980s, and Berlin is planning to phase it out between 2025 and 2030. 
As a replacement, the F-35 offers unique opportunities for cooperation with NATO allies and other European partners alike, Lambrecht said, referring to the fact that many other nations have ordered the stealth jet built by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT).
A German defence source told Reuters in early February that Berlin was leaning toward purchasing the F-35 but a final decision had not been taken. 
Berlin will also purchase 15 Eurofighter jets equipped for electronic warfare, a capability yet to be developed by Franco-German producer Airbus, according to a confidential document sent to lawmakers to inform them of government plans. 
The F-35 purchase will be a blow for Boeing (NYSE:BA), whose F-18 was favoured by former German defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to replace the Tornado.
The decision could also upset France. Paris monitored Germany's deliberations over the F-18 or more advanced F-35, fearing a deal could undercut the development of a joint Franco-German fighter jet that is supposed to be ready in the 2040s.

In an effort to assuage French concerns, Lambrecht echoed Scholz in stressing continued German support for the joint fighter programme.

186,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 11:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders have boosted their expectations for the amount of Federal Reserve policy tightening that could occur this year and are close to fully pricing in seven standard quarter-point rate hikes.
The last time the market for overnight index swaps linked to Fed meeting dates fully priced that much tightening was on Feb. 11, the day after U.S. consumer-price inflation numbers for January came in hotter than expected, prompting investors to wager on more hawkish central bank policy.
The rate on swaps linked to the December meeting climbed as high as 1.82% Monday, 174 basis points above the current effective fed funds rate of 0.08%. That’s equivalent to almost seven 25-basis-point increases, although the central bank itself has flagged that it could move in bigger increments down the line if necessary.
The swaps rate had reached as high as 1.87% on Feb. 11, but then proceeded to fall in recent weeks, weighed down in large part by the financial market fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It slipped to less than 1.2% on March 1, suggesting at that point that traders were only envisaging between four and five standard hikes.
The latest uptick in U.S. market rates follows the war-related rally in global commodity prices that has helped to rev up investor expectations for inflation, which in turn means that the central bank might need to act more firmly in raising rates. 
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries and German bonds jumped as much as 11 basis points and the rate on U.K. gilts climbed as much as 10 basis points. Five-year Treasury yields topped 2% for the first time since May 2019, as traders braced for the Fed to kick off a tightening cycle on Wednesday.
Officials are widely tipped to lift the monetary authority’s benchmark by a quarter point, and market pricing for this gathering reflects that. Policy makers may also provide clues about their broader thinking and the longer-term path for rates.
Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers recently that he would recommend a quarter-point rate hike at the March 15-16 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, leaving little doubt in the view of economists that will be the outcome. He said larger increases might be warranted in the future if inflation fails to moderate, and swaps tied to the May policy meeting price in about 60% of a half-point increase then.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg say the Fed’s quarterly forecasts in the so-called “dot plot” will show around four hikes for 2022, and they predict the Fed will follow through with five increases with no half-point moves. The economists predict the Fed may raise rates by 1.25% this year, with rates reaching 2.5% in 2024.

Softened:
- U.S. sanctions were lifted against Rusal and its parent company En+ in 2019 when Deripaska reduced his stakes below a majority threshold to 44.95%. There are still concerns, however, that the Russian oligarch is pulling the strings of his business empire behind the scenes.

188,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 10:26AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - The Russian central bank is expected to hold its key interest rate unchanged at 20% on Friday after a sharp emergency rate hike in late February designed to support financial stability, a Reuters poll found on Monday.
The central bank raised the key rate from 9.5% on Feb. 28 as the rouble crashed to record lows and people rushed to withdraw money from banks after the West imposed unprecedented sanctions against Russia for what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
Sixteen out of 17 analysts and economists polled by Reuters predicted that Russia will hold the key rate at 20%, above the 17% level seen in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. One expert said he expected a rate hike to 25%.
""The level of geopolitical uncertainty remains too high for a decisive action,"" said Sofya Donets, chief economist at Renaissance Capital, who previously worked at the central bank's monetary policy department.
There is no need to raise rates now as money flowing into foreign currencies has been blocked by other restrictions, while it is too early to speak about rate cuts that would be needed to limit the depth of economic recession, Donets said.
Russia has introduced commissions on buying foreign currency online and banned selling of cash dollars and euros, while also limiting the maximum amount of FX that can be withdrawn from banks' accounts to the equivalent of $10,000 for at least six months.
Meanwhile, the emergency rate hike made rouble deposits more attractive, with banks offering to pay 20% annual interest on rouble savings. 
Without taking geopolitical issues into account, the level of rates in Russia is shaped by inflation and the need to extinguish panic on the currency market, said Konstantin Svyatny, chief portfolio manager at Aton Management brokerage.
Inflation in Russia is forecast to accelerate to 20% and its economy could fall by as much as 8% this year, an independent survey of analysts requested by the central bank showed last week.

Russians are no strangers to currency crises, having seen hyperinflation destroy their savings after the collapse of the Soviet Union, before President Vladimir Putin came to power.
The Bank of Russia targets inflation at 4% and had gradually raised rates since 2020 to limit a rise in consumer prices, which is denting living standards.

Nabiullina usually holds a news conference broadcast in Russian and English after the bank announces its interest rate decisions, although she did not do so when the key rate was more than doubled in an emergency move on Feb. 28.
The hike to 20% from 9.5% came as the rouble tumbled to record lows following the imposition of sanctions by Western countries on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.
It was accompanied by other measures including some capital controls and an instruction to export-focused companies to sell 80% of their foreign currency revenues. 
Nabiullina read out a statement explaining the moves in an online broadcast.
The central bank has yet to update its forecasts for inflation and growth in light of the Ukraine conflict and sanctions that have isolated Russia economically. 
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice.
An independent survey of analysts requested by the central bank last week forecast inflation of 20% and an 8% economic contraction this year and predicted the key interest rate would average 18.9% in 2022. 
Nabiullina, 58, has led the central bank since 2013, a year before Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, triggering a first wave of western sanctions. 

Her current term expires on June 24 and the rules say President Vladimir Putin must either nominate Nabiullina again or propose another candidate to the lower house of parliament no later than March 24. 
The central bank is due to release its monthly key rate statement at 1030 GMT on March 18, followed by Nabiullina's statement at 1200 GMT.

Christian Lindner's draft budget envisages net new debt of 99.7 billion euros ($109.4 billion) in the core budget, plus additional credit authorisations for a planned special fund for the military.
However, this budget would only be valid for the time being and supplementary measures would follow to address the effect of the Ukraine crisis, which it said was too early to ascertain now.
""We will also submit a supplementary budget to the Bundestag in the next few weeks,"" Lindner said.

Florian Toncar, parliamentary state secretary in the Finance Ministry, told Bild Live separately that a rebate for heating costs for a three-month period was also under consideration. The ministry expected it to cost 1.5 billion euros a month, he said.
Lindner has signalled potential support for companies that are in danger of collapse owing to sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
The sanctions also have negative consequences for Germany, he said, adding: ""That is a price we are ready to bear.""
""The pressure on (Russian President) Vladimir Putin must be increased to the maximum in order to end this war as quickly as possible. We therefore welcome the continued work on sanctions,"" Lindner added.

Security workers staged a full-day walkout at six airports including Duesseldorf, Cologne/Bonn and Berlin on Monday, and one-day strikes have also been called for other airports on Tuesday including Frankfurt and Hamburg.
The strike comes as airlines are reeling from the impact of the war in Ukraine, with soaring fuel prices and airspace closures, after two years of low travel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The walkout by security staff has resulted in a high three-digit number of flight cancellations, German airports association ADV said.
Some 160 of them were at Duesseldorf airport, accounting for more than half of the planned 290 departures and arrivals, the airport said. 
At Cologne/Bonn, 94 out of 136 flights were called off, and Berlin airport's website also showed many cancelled flights.
Tuesday's walkout will hit Germany's busiest airport, Frankfurt, which handled around 2.1 million passengers last month.
Frankfurt airport operator Fraport said only transit passengers would be able to get to their flights on Tuesday, when the airport was originally due to handle around 770 departures and arrivals, serving close to 80,000 passengers.

Classification societies provide services such as checking that ships are seaworthy, and this certification cover is essential for securing insurance and entry into ports.
In recent days, Britain's LR and Denmark's DNV, have both announced they were stopping or winding down their business ties with Russia.
The International Association of Classification Societies (IACS), which had 12 members previously including LR and DNV and forms the top tier of ship certifiers globally, said late on Friday it was withdrawing RS' membership with immediate effect, which it said was ""no longer tenable"", citing UK sanctions on Russia where IACS is domiciled.
""IACS deeply regrets the circumstances that have resulted in this decision,"" it said. 
RS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.
An IACS spokesperson said on Monday that the impact on RS of no longer being an IACS member would ""depend on its various, private bilateral arrangements with entities such as shipowners and flag states"".
The spokesperson said IACS was a technical association that ""develops and agrees minimum technical standards"".
""IACS will need to make various consequential changes regarding the composition of various working groups,"" the spokesperson said. 
""IACS is not involved in the operational and commercial activities of its members. As such, the decision whether to continue to engage bilaterally with RS will need to be taken by each IACS member individually.""
RS said in June last year it had formed a strategic partnership with leading Russian shipping company Sovcomflot (SCF), which included cooperating on the development of new marine fuels to reduce emissions and technical supervision of ice-class ships operating in the Arctic.

SCF was among the Russian entities the U.S. Treasury restricted last month from raising capital in U.S. markets, which shipping sources say will complicate transactions for the Moscow-listed company.

The proposed legislation would apply to companies that are listed or have at least 250 employees, with estimates suggesting it could affect some 2,300 firms in the bloc of 450 million people.
It does not however propose strict sanctions for failing to meet the goals, beyond obliging the companies to introduce clear policies aimed at alleviating the gap.
The 27 member states' employment and social affairs ministers have agreed in principle on the proposal, allowing them to start talks on the plan with the European Parliament.
No date for that has yet been set. It could take months or more for the new rules to get final approval in the EU, if at all. 
""In October 2021, only 30.6% of board members and just 8.5% of board chairs were women. The gap between member states is wide,"" the ministers said in a joint statement.
The renewed push towards quotas comes after studies showed the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected women from jobs to domestic violence, deepening gender inequality in the bloc.
Eight EU countries, including France, already have quotas on a national level, and could opt out of the bloc-wide rules. Other countries that have moved towards the targets through other means could do the same. 
Ten EU states have some measures in place that fall below the proposed quota. Nine have taken no substantial action on the matter so far. Each country would be allowed to chose between the 33% or 40% target. 

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in January it was time for a new push to boost women's representation on boards.
""We want to break the glass ceiling preventing talented women from acceding to boards,"" von der Leyen said on Monday.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's ruling party is being forced to confront a problem that has bedevilled the country since apartheid ended 28 years ago: how to reduce record gross inequality and poverty that hurts the Black majority more than the white minority.
While the issue has never gone away, it has come to a head after the COVID-19 pandemic destroyed jobs and livelihoods.
Unemployment hit a record of nearly 35% last year and anger at the worsening economy has spilled into violent protests and rioting, including last summer when more than 300 people were killed and hundreds of businesses destroyed in the unrest.
The African National Congress (ANC) party is increasingly alarmed at its waning popularity among voters, and a leadership contest is only months away, adding to pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa to improve the lives of ordinary South Africans.
His preference is to give more free money to the poor. The government introduced a social relief grant in 2020 to support those worst hit by the pandemic, and is debating whether to increase handouts and make them permanent.
Ramaphosa's stance pits him against sceptics including his own finance minister, Enoch Godongwana, who fear that a proposed permanent basic income grant could be ruinously costly.
Opponents of more generous handouts also say they act as a disincentive to people looking for work and divert resources from basic services like electricity, water and schools.
For some South Africans, the small social relief grant of 350 rands ($23.20) a month offered to those who were unemployed and did not receive any other form of grant was a godsend, even if it could not solve their problems longer term.
Sunnyboy Moseboa, 53, lives in Diepkloof, one of the poorer parts of the Johannesburg township of Soweto. He set up a stall selling grilled cow feet, using the grant to cover expenses like power to keep his product fresh.
Unmarried and without children, he had been dependent on handouts from his family. Now, his business nets him on average 2,000 rands a month, after years of failed job searches and enterprises.
""It's small, but the 350 (rands) helped,"" he told Reuters outside his house assembled from discarded wooden planks, glass panels and iron sheets. ""Sometimes I have cash flow problems. There are times when there's no food for me to eat.""
Having extended the grant another year in his February state of the nation address, at a cost of 44 billion rands, Ramaphosa is considering making it permanent and increasing it for 10 million beneficiaries - a sixth of the country.
Inequality campaigners see it as a global test case, as robots replace jobs and some countries look into providing unearned income as a solution. Many economists are unconvinced.
""We face a real danger of ... limit(ing) ... job creation potential by increasing the system of social grants,"" some of Ramaphosa's advisers wrote in a leaked February report, seen by Reuters.
'SOCIAL PROTECTION'
After apartheid ended in 1994, the ANC introduced policies aimed at job creation and private sector growth that they hoped would reassure white nationals and international investors and prevent them flooding out of the country.
But it also spent heavily on improving benefits for people who were discriminated against under white rule, including building millions of subsidised homes for the poor.
Despite the huge spend - at 3.3% South Africa spends nearly three times the global median on social assistance as a share of its GDP, according to the World Bank - unemployment is at a record and, on some measures, inequality has got worse.
Economic growth slowed over the last decade as the country struggled with policy uncertainty, political turmoil, an energy crisis and allegations of state corruption under former president Jacob Zuma – who has denied any wrongdoing.
    This has piled more pressure on Ramaphosa, both within the ANC and on the streets, where hundreds have protested in recent months to demand the government limit the number of foreign workers in the country and safeguard jobs for South Africa.
Some analysts say that expanding social protection would be a vote-winner for the ANC, which last year suffered its worst result in local elections since taking power.
Voter support for the ANC dipped below 50% for the first time, raising the possibility that it could lose power for the first time since 1994.
Finance Minister Godongwana noted in his budget speech that the social relief grant had expanded an ""already extensive social safety net,"" now covering half the population.
But Alex van den Heever, a social security expert at University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said the system was stingier than it looked and was less pro-poor when you offset it against tax breaks on private pension income, which funnel 1.7% of GDP back to the top 10% of earners.
Accusations of corruption and mismanagement have also dogged South Africa's welfare programmes, resulting in long backlogs and shoddily-built homes, and preventing help from reaching many of those in need.
Defenders of basic income propose at least doubling the COVID-19 grant to hit the food poverty line.
In downtown Soweto, the unemployed queue from as early as 2 a.m. to get their grants, forming snaking lines - a stark reminder of how persistent South Africa's poverty is.
Among them is Thandi Shabangu, 53, who has four children. Before the grant she did odd domestic jobs and now uses the money from both to buy snacks and sell them at a kiosk.
""The grant helped me to start my business ... with today's, I will buy more stock,"" she said.
Ramaphosa had such people in mind when he said in his address that some used grant money to start businesses, rejecting the theory that they encourage idleness.
Sceptics still worry about the cost.
""Affordability is going to be a serious problem, with our debt levels,"" said Patrick Buthelezi, an economist at South Africa's Sanlam Investments. The Treasury will spend nearly 250 billion rands on grants in the financial year starting in April, up from about 225 billion rands in the previous year.

But Shaeera Kalla, from activist group #PayTheGrants, said that with political will, South Africa could make the money back in taxes on the wealthy, such as VAT on luxury items.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's finance minister held talks with a top International Monetary Fund (IMF) official on Monday, two sources said, as the island nation seeks help to deal with its plunging reserves, a sliding currency and surging inflation.
IMF Asia and Pacific Department Director Changyong Rhee met Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa and Treasury Secretary S.R. Atygalle, two finance ministry officials told Reuters.
Sri Lanka is expected to start formal negotiations with the IMF in April on a possible programme that could boost reserves and put growth on a sustainable path.
In Monday's talks, officials discussed details of the IMF’s latest review of the economy and the assessments outlined by IMF executive directors at an IMF board meeting in late February. 
Rhee meets Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Tuesday. 
""The talks were wide ranging and covered key challenges the economy is facing,"" said one of the ministry officials, asking not to be named given the sensitivity of the talks.
""Right now, the focus is on how Sri Lanka can get IMF support. Talks on specific proposals will come later,” the official added, adding that Rajapaksa would brief the cabinet about the talks at a weekly meeting on Monday evening.
Sri Lanka has been hit by a dollar drought with reserves dropping to $2.31 billion in February. The country is struggling to pay for critical imports including fuel, food and medicines.

Chronic shortages have hit Sri Lankans hard with rolling power cuts, long lines at pumps and record levels of inflation. 
Last week the Sri Lankan rupee fell 30% after the government allowed the currency to free-float, driving prices even higher.

New Delhi (Reuters) -India will take ""appropriate"" steps to calm the rise in oil prices, triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the junior oil minister said on Monday, indicating the country could release more oil from national stocks if required.
India, the world's third biggest oil consumer and importer, imports about 85% of its oil needs.
""Government of India is ready to take all appropriate action, as deemed fit, for mitigating market volatility and calming the rise in crude oil prices,"" Rameswar Teli said in a written reply to lawmakers.
Last month India said it was prepared to release additional crude from its national stocks in support of efforts by other major oil importers to mitigate surging global prices.
Teli said in November the federal government had joined other major consumers to release 5 million barrels of oil from its strategic petroleum reserves to contain inflationary pressures.
On Monday, Teli said India is ""closely monitoring global energy markets as well as potential energy supply disruptions as a fallout of the evolving geopolitical situation"". 
India buys only a fraction of its oil from Russia but has been hit hard by a spike in global oil prices due to Western sanctions against Moscow, the world's second largest crude exporter.
The Indian basket of crude oil had jumped to $112.59/barrel by March 11, after averaging $84.67/barrel in January and $94.07 in February. 

Indian oil companies have not raised fuel prices since Nov. 4 to shield the customers from higher costs. 
However, to ease the import cost for companies, India is considering a Russian offer to sell its crude oil and other commodities at a discount, Indian government sources said.

(Reuters) - With the Federal Reserve almost certain to hike interest rates this week for the first time in more than three years, investors will be focused on how it plans to curb a surge in inflation inflamed by the Ukraine crisis without triggering a recession.
The U.S. central bank is expected at the very least to raise borrowing costs at each of its next three policy meetings as it scrambles to address the fastest inflation in 40 years. Consumer prices rose 7.9% in February on an annual basis. 
But having waited until it was sure the economy and labor market had recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed also risks tightening monetary policy just as growth is slowing. Western sanctions to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine have sent the prices of oil and other commodities soaring, adding to uncertainty over the trajectory of the global economy.
""The policy path set forward is going to be one for further increases,"" said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income analysis at Action Economics, who added that Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his fellow policymakers would likely take a cautious data-dependent approach. ""They really can't do anything else given the uncertainties from the war.""
Powell's news conference after the end of the two-day policy meeting on Wednesday will be closely watched for possible clues as to how aggressive the Fed may be in fighting inflation and whether it will risk a recession to dampen price pressures. 
Bond markets are already betting on a possible economic contraction down the road, with the two-year, 10-year U.S. Treasury yield curve flattening to only 25 basis points, a much smaller gap than at the beginning of previous Fed tightening cycles. An inversion in this part of the yield curve is seen as a reliable indicator of a recession in one to two years.
The Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate ahead of this week's policy meeting was 0.08%. Fed fund futures traders are pricing in a policy rate of 1.75% by the end of this year. [FEDWATCH]
The Fed will also on Wednesday release updated quarterly economic projections and a ""dot plot"" showing policymakers' interest rate projections. Markets expect the Fed to indicate more rate hikes this year and possibly a higher terminal rate, the neutral interest rate seen as consistent with full employment and stable prices.
""Our sense is that they are going to want to front-load the policy tightening and probably go at a slower pace in 2023,"" said Zachary Griffiths, a macro strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). ""It will be interesting to see if any policymakers are starting to revise up their expectations for the terminal rate in response to expectations that inflation will be a fair bit higher perhaps throughout this cycle than what we saw throughout the last economic expansion.""
The new economic projections will show if officials see a near-term easing of price pressures and to what extent GDP growth expectations have been lowered.
BALANCE SHEET REDUCTION
The Fed also may indicate how fast and large the cuts to its $8.9 trillion balance sheet will be when the bonds it holds start rolling off the books, which many analysts expect to happen in May or June. 
The central bank also is widely expected to announce that it has ended the massive bond-buying program initiated in early 2020 to blunt the damage of the pandemic. The asset purchases had dwindled since November 2021.
In January, the Fed said it did not anticipate it would sell its holdings of Treasuries, but instead would allow them to mature without being replaced. It may, however, sell its mortgage-backed securities, which could relieve some of the pressure in hot housing markets.
Meanwhile, money markets will key in on whether the Fed raises the rate it pays investors to borrow Treasuries overnight in its repurchase agreement facility by 25 basis points, or only 20 basis points, following a five-basis point increase last June that was meant to stop short-term interest rates from falling too low.
That could impact demand for the Fed's reverse repo facility, in which investors borrow Treasuries overnight, and which continues to see near-record daily volumes of around $1.5 trillion, said Padhraic Garvey, regional head of research for the Americas at ING.

A smaller rate hike for this facility could ""unwind some of this excess cash that goes back into that window on a daily basis,"" he said. That said, given it's the first rate hike, the Fed may want to simplify the messaging by keeping the 25-basis-point hikes consistent across rates and highlight that there are more to come, he noted.
The central bank raised counterparty limits in the reverse repo facility twice last year to address excess liquidity amid a dearth of safe, short-term investments.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Top European Union diplomats have agreed to add Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich to the EU list of Russian billionaires sanctioned after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, two diplomatic sources said on Monday.
The informal greenlight to Abramovich's listing came in a meeting on Sunday, one source said, and the EU envoys will reconvene at 1100 GMT on Monday to adopt the measure and a further set of economic sanctions against Russia.
Sanctions will be effective only after publication on the EU's official journal, which usually happens within hours or the day following formal approval.
The West has sanctioned Russian billionaires, frozen state assets and cut off much of the Russian corporate sector from the global economy in an attempt to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to change course on Ukraine.
In what would be the fourth package of EU sanctions against Russia since its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, the 27-nation bloc will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia, including expensive cars.
It will also prohibit the import of Russian steel and iron products, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday.
At Sunday's meeting, diplomats asked the Commission, which drafted the economic sanctions, to explain some aspects of the new economic measures to make sure they cannot be successfully challenged in EU courts, according to two EU sources.
No concerns were raised about the new listings of oligarchs and businessmen, which are in a separate legal document drafted by the EU external action service, one diplomat said, noting that Abramovich's listing ""will go through"". 
Further Russian oligarchs will be added to the EU list. Dozens have already been sanctioned.
The new sanctions will hit people active in the Russian steel industry and others who provide financial services, military products and technology to the Russian state, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Friday.

Abramovich has already being blacklisted by Britain.
He holds a Portuguese passport, which means that Portugal could in principle refrain from imposing on him the asset freeze and travel ban decided at EU level, a second EU official told Reuters.

Investing.com -- Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine continue, but the more important meeting is arguably in Rome, where U.S. officials will try to warn China off undermining western sanctions and sending military aid to Russia. Chinese stocks tumble as the manufacturing hub of Shenzhen is forced into a Covid-19 lockdown. And Iran lashes out at U.S. and Israeli targets in Iraq, complicating efforts to restart talks on its nuclear program. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 14th March.
1. Frantic diplomacy
European markets traded positively on fresh hopes of progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, despite signs of conflict escalation over the weekend.
There will be a number of important meetings in the course of the day. The most important of them may be between U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome. The U.S. warned at the weekend that Russia has asked China for military aid to sustain its offensive.  Russia intensified its air and artillery campaign at the weekend, hitting targets further west, near the border with NATO member Poland.
Elsewhere, Eurozone finance ministers is meeting to discuss, among other things, the tightening of sanctions on Russia, including its energy exports.
2. Chinese stocks tumble as Shenzhen, Jilin lock down due to Covid
China’s zero-Covid policy is showing ever bigger cracks. The high-tech manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, which is home to two factories owned by iPhone contract manufacturer Foxconn, has locked down in response to growing numbers of new infections. Businesses will be shut for a full week.
The north-eastern region of Jilin, on the border with North Korea and Russia, is also locking down business and social life for a week. The moves come as Hong Kong continues to suffer among the highest rate of deaths and new infections in the world, after the highly-transmissible Omicron variant broke through the city’s cordon sanitaire.
Covid wasn’t the only thing troubling Chinese markets on Monday though. Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) stock plunged on reports that the central bank will levy the country’s biggest ever anti-money-laundering fine, leading the Hang Seng TECH index to fall as much as 11% intraday, before closing down 4.3%. Fears of U.S. delistings continue to dog Chinese tech stocks ahead of the Sullivan-Yang talks.
3. Stocks set to open higher
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher, with trading algorithms at least buying into the narrative peace hopes.
Trading is likely to stay subdued ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday. Neither the data calendar nor the earnings calendar contain any major market movers.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 331 points, or 1.0%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.9% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.7%. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield however rose 9 basis points, to 2.09%, against a backdrop of ongoing concern about inflation. It’s now at its highest since July 2019.
Stocks in focus may include all those who have suspended or abandoned operations in Russia in the last three weeks, after warnings from Moscow that those assets are likely to be put under state administration, a big step toward expropriation.
4. India moves to relieve the pressure on Russia
China isn’t alone in its support for Russia. Indian officials said on Monday that they are looking at ways to ensure India can continue to trade with the country despite Western sanctions. 
""Russia is offering oil and other commodities at a heavy discount. We will be happy to take that,” Reuters quoted one Indian government official as saying adding that issues surrounding tankers and insurance still need to be agreed.
Critics of the sanctions have argued that they will hasten the development of alternative international payment systems, ultimately eroding the dollar’s hegemon status in international trade.
India’s conduct is likely to have a strong influence on many less developed countries which depend on Russia in particular not just for their energy but also their grain imports.
Other countries, however, continued to add to the international pressure on Russia’s economy. Bermudan regulators, who oversee much of the world’s reinsurance market, said they will withdraw all the airworthiness certificates of Russian-operated aircraft due to an inability to enforce checks. The move will effectively end international flights by Russian airlines.
5. Oil falls on Chinese, Indian factors
Crude oil prices fell sharply, as the above-mentioned factors all forced a reappraisal of the global supply-demand balance.
By 6:25 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 5.4% at $103.47 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 4.2% at $107.98 a barrel.
Chinese lockdowns, in particular, are likely to have a noticeable impact on global demand, but any effort by China and India to ensure continued energy flows out of Russia are also likely to weigh on prices.
Those factors are outweighing developments in Iraq at the weekend, where strikes on U.S. and Israeli-operated sites by Iran and its proxies have dealt a blow to hopes of any swift resumption of talks on lifting sanctions on the Islamic Republic.",,,,,

Larger economic slumps and upheavals could not be ruled out either, he added, as the strength of the potential shock entailed high uncertainties for the modelling. 
In addition, he said, it must be taken into account that large parts of the industry have not yet recovered from the effects of the pandemic.

(Reuters) - Surging inflation is disrupting everything from carpools to the ability to quote prices on new business at already-strained U.S. factories.
At BCI Solutions Inc., a metal foundry in Bremen, Indiana, 14 workers quit in the last two weeks - over 7% of its total workforce and an unprecedented number compared with pre-pandemic times. BCI has long struggled to hold workers but never lost that many in such a short span.
Company chief executive officer J.B. Brown blames at least part of the sudden loss of workers on the spike in gasoline prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has roiled global energy markets and sent prices at the pump through the roof. Regular unleaded gas was a record $4.33 a gallon on Friday, according to AAA, up 85 cents in a month.
""When gas goes up, people want to work closer to home,"" he said, and with the jobless rate in the surrounding largely rural Marshall County under 1%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, those jobs are easy to find. In some cases, he knows workers who don't want to quit - but do so because the person they carpool with does.
The current wave of disruptions come as many manufacturers felt they were starting to untangle supply chain and labor problems created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Backlogs at major U.S. ports have declined in recent weeks, for instance.
And it remains too early to fully assess how much the crisis in Ukraine will slow a return to normal operations - or create new issues.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank would start ""carefully"" hiking interest rates at its upcoming March meeting as it balances the threat of high inflation and complex new risks posed by the war in Europe. He has also said, however, that the Fed would be ready to move more aggressively if inflation does not cool as quickly as expected.
Powell called the Russian invasion ""a game changer"" that could have unpredictable consequences.
NO PIG IRON
Some of those hard-to-predict things have already hit factory floors. At Gent Machine Co., in Cleveland, that includes disrupting work on a bid for new business.
Rich Gent, who runs the 50-employee company with his brother, said he has been working for five months with a customer who wants his factory to start producing a stainless steel part for its marine products. Stainless prices, as with most metals, shot up during the pandemic and supplies remain tight.
Earlier this week, when Gent called around to his five metal suppliers, none could give him a price estimate for the 5,000 pounds a month he needs. Production of stainless requires nickel, and with Russia a major nickel producer, prices have surged.
Two suppliers said they could only start shipping in two months and the price would be the spot price on shipping day. The others couldn't even commit to supplying metal. ""Their best guess was they could get me the material in November,"" he said.
Austin Ramirez, chief executive of Husco International Inc, said the crisis is also driving home just how intertwined global supply chains remain and the unpredictable fallout that can create. Waukesha, Wisconsin-based Husco makes auto and off-road machinery parts and has no business associated with Russia or Ukraine.
""But Ukraine supplies pig iron to Europe, and we buy from foundries that are now facing a shortage of pig iron,"" he said.
They also rely on parts that were formerly transported from China to Europe through both countries. ""My biggest concern now is that the confluence of Ukraine and the semiconductor shortages and everything else in global logistics will become a demand constraint,"" he said. While business remains strong, more customers are canceling orders because they can't get parts from other suppliers.

""So we go through all this work and expense to expedite material only to have orders drop out at the last minute because they can't get other parts to make the car or the excavator or whatever it is,"" said Ramirez.
For the first time since before the pandemic, he said he's started to worry about the economy dropping into a recession. ""Earlier this year, it felt like things were getting a little better - now, it feels like wind is blowing in our face again.""

Prices for goods have increased across the board since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, prompting sanctions that have isolated Russia economically and sent the currency to historic lows. Many of the world's top companies have suspended operations in the country and it is largely excluded from the international financial system. 
An ordinary Russian spent 21% more in the first week of March compared to the average for February, driven both by inflation and a rush to stockpile, state bank PSB said in a note after analysing credit and debit card transactions. 
PSB offers a wide range of services but has focused on state employees and the defence sector since it was bailed out by the central bank in 2017. 
Spending on electronic goods increased by 40%, pharmacy sales added 22%, and demand for clothes, shoes and spending in supermarkets increased by 16%, said PSB. 
Adjusting for inflation, demand for these types of goods increased by between 14% and 21%, PSB said. Russians also cut their spending in cafes and restaurants by 6%, it added. 
In a stressful environment, ""customers want to fix prices and to buy not only popular but also regular goods"", Dmitry Gritskevich, who leads financial and banking sector analysis at PSB, said in the note. 
Gritskevich expects demand to calm in the coming weeks as supply chains from China and India should be restored. 

Annual consumer inflation reached 10.42% as of March 4, according to the economy ministry, up from 9.05% as of Feb. 25.
Weekly inflation rose to 2.22% from 0.45% in the preceding week, its highest reading since 1998.

The comments by Yu, an influential economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely anticipated to hike interest rates later this week amid higher inflation, while some expect the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to cut the rate on medium-term loans on Tuesday. 
Yu, a former member of PBOC's monetary policy committee, told the newspaper that even as the Fed raises its benchmark rate to 2%, the U.S. real interest rates would remain negative due to high inflation, in contrast to positive rates in China.

In addition, China has policy tools to prevent severe capital outflows, while the yuan's flexibility can improve further to offset the impact on monetary policy independence from cross-border capital flows, Yu was quoted by the article as saying.
China, which faces economic headwinds including resurgent coronavirus cases at home, a sluggish real estate market and rising geopolitical tensions, has set a growth target of 5.5% for this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In what now seem the simpler days of December, when there was only a pandemic to worry about, Federal Reserve officials rallied around the view they could tame inflation with modest interest rate hikes while the economy and labor market thrived.
A war in Europe has now been layered on top of the health crisis, and when U.S. central bank policymakers meet this week they will have to decide just how much damage has been done to that rosy outlook, and whether their hopes for an economic ""soft landing"" have been diminished or dashed altogether.
The Fed is almost certain to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. More important will be projections showing just how far policymakers think rates will need to rise this year and in 2023 and 2024 to tame inflation that has blasted past their expectations.

If their outlook for the federal funds rate breaches what is regarded as a neutral level of around 2.50%, it means the mood within the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has shifted, and that its members see a need to eventually curb the economy - and run a higher risk of recession - to bring rising prices into line. As of December most Fed policymakers projected that rate would only need to rise to 2.10% by the end of 2024. 
""There is no doubt that the FOMC will start raising rates ... What everyone wants to know is what the Fed will do next?"" Roberto Perli and other analysts at Piper Sandler wrote. If new projections show the target federal funds rate exceeding 2.50% in coming years, it would ""signal that the majority of the FOMC is so worried about inflation that it doesn't care risking a recession in order to bring it down quickly. Needless to say, that would be a very hawkish development.""

THROWING POLICY INTO REVERSE
The Fed is scheduled to release its new policy statement and updated quarterly economic projections at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to hold a news conference half an hour later.
As of Friday afternoon, investors expected Fed rate hikes would top out just below the neutral level, so a shift higher could trigger a shock of sorts - perhaps even leading to an ""inversion"" of bond yields with short-term rates exceeding longer-dated ones. 
It will arguably be the central bank's most consequential moment since the spring of 2020 when officials pledged open-ended support for a pandemic-stricken economy by cutting the federal funds rate to the near-zero level and beginning massive bond purchases. Soaring unemployment was then the chief concern, and the Fed pledged to do whatever was needed to keep households and businesses financially stable through the crisis.
Unemployment has now plummeted to 3.8%, low by historic standards, and households are flush with cash from pandemic-related government aid programs.
Inflation, running at three times the Fed's 2% target and a hot-button political issue, has become the main threat, not only challenging the Fed's policymaking prowess but raising the specter of a 1970s-style predicament in which the central bank had to impose a punishing recession to get prices under control.

The Fed this week will not only throw its pandemic emergency measures into reverse, it will have to guide the public through the maze of competing economic and geopolitical considerations it is juggling as it does so, and make the case for why it can avoid killing the current economic expansion. 
Fed rate-hike cycles often come with their own particular guidance, with words like ""measured"" or ""gradual"" sprinkled into policy statements to convey the intended pace of rate increases. Powell recently has been using less-concrete terms like ""nimble"" for a policy expected to include steady rate increases this year, but which may have to either be sped up or slowed in response to fast-changing events and conditions.
""Neither the data nor fortune has favored the Fed"" in recent weeks, wrote Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors. 
'GAME CHANGER' 
The list of problems facing policymakers deliberating this week has indeed become lengthy.
Since the last policy meeting in late January, inflation has shown no clear sign of slowing, putting the current Fed stance further out of step with a growing economy. Longer-term inflation expectations, a particular concern for the central bank as a sign of whether it is losing public trust in its ability to contain prices, have begun to rise as well.

The war in Ukraine has no clear resolution and could stoke even more inflation through increased energy costs, further disruption to supply chains, or even a reordering of global trade and governance that could mean persistently higher prices.
On the flip side are signs of an easing in the pandemic that could add momentum to a strong recovery. Data released earlier this month showed a sharp rise in job growth in February that beat expectations and upward revisions for January and December. A pause in wage increases last month reduced fears that workers' pay and prices may start to ratchet each other higher.
Household savings remained high through 2021, recent Fed data showed, providing a savings buffer to help Americans absorb the costs of more expensive gas and food without reducing other areas of spending.
Powell, testifying to Congress early this month, made clear his focus is on inflation and that he was ready to move interest rates higher and in larger half-percentage-point increments should the price increases not slow down.

But he also acknowledged the world had gotten more complicated, in ways it may take time to understand. 
The war in Ukraine ""is a game changer and will be with us for a very long time,"" Powell told the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on March 2. ""There are events yet to come ... and we don't know what the real effect on the U.S. economy will be. We don't know whether those effects will be quite lasting or not.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia may default on its debts in the wake of unprecedented sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, but that would not trigger a global financial crisis, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Sunday.
Georgieva told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" program that sanctions imposed by the United States and other democracies were already having a ""severe"" impact on the Russian economy and would trigger a deep recession there this year.
The war and the sanctions would also have significant spillover effects on neighboring countries that depended on Russian energy supplies, and had already resulted in a wave of refugees compared to that seen during World War Two, she said.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”
The sanctions were also limiting Russia's ability to access its resources and service its debts, which meant a default was no longer viewed as ""improbable,"" Georgieva said.
Asked if such a default could trigger a financial crisis around the world, she said, ""For now, no.""
The total exposure of banks to Russia amounted to around $120 billion, an amount that while not insignificant, was ""not systemically relevant,"" she said.
Asked if Russia could access the $1.4 billion in emergency IMF funding approved for Ukraine last week if Moscow won the war and installed a new government, Georgieva said the funds were in a special account accessible only by the Ukrainian government.
An IMF official said that referred to the ""internationally recognized government of Ukraine.""
The IMF last year blocked access to Afghanistan's funds by the Taliban after they seized control of the government, citing lack of clarity over recognition of the Taliban rulers within the international community.
Georgieva last week said the IMF would downgrade its previous forecast for 4.4% global economic growth in 2022 as a result of the war, but said the overall trajectory remained positive.

Growth remained robust in countries like the United States that had been fast to recover from COVID-19 pandemic, she told CBS.
The impact would be most severe in terms of driving up commodity prices and inflation, potentially leading to hunger and food insecurity in parts of Africa, she said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia said on Sunday that it was counting on China to help it withstand the blow to its economy from Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine, but the United States warned Beijing not to provide that lifeline.
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said sanctions had deprived Moscow of access to $300 billion of its $640 billion in gold and foreign exchange reserves, and added that there was pressure on Beijing to shut off more.
“We have part of our gold and foreign exchange reserves in the Chinese currency, in yuan. And we see what pressure is being exerted by Western countries on China in order to limit mutual trade with China. Of course, there is pressure to limit access to those reserves,"" he said.
""But I think that our partnership with China will still allow us to maintain the cooperation that we have achieved, and not only maintain, but also increase it in an environment where Western markets are closing.""
Western countries have imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia's corporate and financial system since it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it calls a special military operation.
Siluanov's comments in a TV interview marked the clearest statement yet from Moscow that it will seek help from China to cushion the impact. 
But U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington was warning China not to provide it.
""We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing, that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions, evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them,"" Sullivan told CNN.
""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world,"" added Sullivan, who is due to meet China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome on Monday.
Russia and China have tightened cooperation in recent times as both have come under strong Western pressure over human rights and a raft of other issues. Beijing has not condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine and does not call it an invasion, but it has urged a negotiated solution.

Presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping met in Beijing on Feb. 4 and announced a strategic partnership they said was aimed at countering the influence of the United States, describing it as a friendship with no limits. 
China is Russia's top export market after the European Union. Russian exports to China were worth $79.3 billion in 2021, with oil and gas accounting for 56% of that, according to China's customs agency.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - A senior International Monetary Fund (IMF) official will be visiting Sri Lanka on Monday and Tuesday to brief President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on the fund’s assessment of the crisis-hit economy, Sri Lanka mission chief Masahiro Nozaki told Reuters.
""While the IMF has not received a request for financial support from Sri Lanka, the staff stands ready to discuss options if requested,"" Nozaki said.
The visit comes ahead of plans by Sri Lanka to hold formal talks with the IMF next month on how to help the country.

Sri Lanka is facing its worst financial crisis in years. With foreign exchange reserves standing at a paltry $2.31 billion, the country is struggling to pay for critical imports including fuel, food and medicines.
In a periodic review release earlier this month, the IMF called on the government to implement a ""credible and coherent"" strategy to repay debt and restore macroeconomic stability.

Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its first interest rate hike since 2018 on Wednesday as policymakers try to balance the twin threats of inflation, which is running at a four-decade high, and economic uncertainty arising from the war in Ukraine. The Bank of England is expected to hike rates again this week, while central banks in Japan, Turkey, and Brazil will also hold policy meetings. The massive rally in commodities looks set to continue, while stocks continue to struggle. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
The Fed has clearly signaled that it intends to deliver a quarter-point interest rate hike after its two-day policy meeting concludes on Wednesday, to combat soaring inflation, which at 7.9% is far above the Fed’s 2% target.
A larger half percentage point rate hike is no longer on the cards since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent commodity prices soaring and triggered major uncertainty in financial markets.
Massive rallies in commodities have added to pressure on global central banks to tighten monetary policy and curb inflation. But this has sparked concerns that higher interest rates will act as a drag on economic growth at a time when price increases are already weighing on consumers.
The Fed will be releasing its updated ‘dot plot’ which tracks projections for interest rates, with investors keen to see how the war is affecting the monetary policy outlook. Investors will also be on the lookout for any guidance on plans for the central bank’s almost $9 trillion balance sheet.
The BOE is expected to hike rates for the third time since December after its meeting on Thursday, but officials are expected to opt for another quarter percentage point increase, rather than a larger half-point move.
BOE Governor Andrew Bailey is expected to signal that more rate hikes are coming, with officials keen to mitigate against the risk of high inflation becoming entrenched.
Consumer price inflation in the U.K. hit an almost 30-year high in January at 5.5% because of higher energy costs and supply chain bottlenecks.
As with the Fed, investors will be watching for the bank’s assessment of how the war in Ukraine is affecting the outlook for interest rates.
Ahead of the BOE meeting, the U.K. is to release its latest employment report on Wednesday, with the earnings component likely to be in sharp focus as living costs escalate.
The recent massive rally in commodity prices could potentially be set to continue for an extended period with a quick resolution to the war in Ukraine in doubt.
The war and ensuing sanctions on Russia sent oil prices to 14-year highs and natural gas prices near records. Prices for wheat and copper stand near all-time highs, while a doubling of the price of nickel last week forced the London Metals Exchange to halt trading in the metal.
U.S. government officials have called on domestic and global producers to ramp up oil output to offset the supply shock and there is talk around potential supply additions from Iran, Venezuela, and the United Arab Emirates.
In the coming week, market watchers will be turning their focus to reports from the International Energy Administration and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The benchmark S&P 500 logged its second straight weekly decline last week while the Dow fell for a fifth straight week as uncertainty over the conflict in Ukraine weighed and attention turned to the upcoming Fed meeting.
Stocks have struggled this year as concerns about the Russia-Ukraine crisis have deepened a sell-off initially fueled by worries over higher bond yields with the Fed on course to tighten monetary policy. The S&P 500 is down 11.8% so far in 2022.
“While investors have accepted the Fed will likely begin raising rates next week, there is still a lack of clarity of how far and how fast the Fed moves from there,"" Lindsey Bell, Ally's Chief Markets & Money Strategist wrote in a note cited by Reuters on Friday.
""With the market taking action (in the form of volatility) and possibly reducing demand, the Fed may not have to move as quickly. Still, the pace of inflation will be the key driver of policy changes for the better part of this year."" 
The dovish Bank of Japan is not expected to announce any changes to monetary policy when its two-day meeting ends on Friday, with inflation still running far behind the rest of the world, for now.
In emerging markets, Turkey’s central bank is expected to keep its one-week repo rate on hold at 14% on Thursday despite inflation reaching a two-decade high of 54% in February. President Tayyip Erdogan’s unconventional approach to monetary policy favors looser rather than tighter monetary policy to combat inflation.
The Central Bank of Brazil also meets on Thursday and is expected to hike rates to 11.75%, in what would be the ninth straight increase in a row amid an annual inflation rate of 10%.
Russia’s central bank is to meet on Friday after having already doubled its interest rate to an all-time high of 20% following the invasion of Ukraine, in a bid to offset some of the impact from harsh international sanctions. Russia’s stock market will remain closed again this week.

Natsuo Yamaguchi, head of Komeito, the junior partner in Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's coalition, said the measures were among steps needed to prepare for a further rise in prices of oil, wheat and other goods as a result of Russia's war on Ukraine, a party spokesperson said, confirming media reports.
Yamaguchi also urged the government to curb retail fuel prices by invoking a ""trigger clause"" allowing it to cut the gasoline tax in addition to existing energy subsidies, the spokesperson said.

Russia has faced a slew of measures since launching its Feb. 24 invasion, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two. Those hit by Friday's sanctions include 10 people on the board of VTB Bank, the second-largest lender in Russia, and 12 members of the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement.
""Treasury continues to hold Russian officials to account for enabling Putin's unjustified and unprovoked war,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said.
Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was targeted on March 3. Friday's measures extend to his wife and two adult children. They lead ""luxurious lifestyles that are incongruous with Peskov's civil servant salary,"" the Treasury said in a news release.
The Kremlin did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. 
Four Novikombank board members, including chair Elena Georgieva, and ABR Management and four of its board members, including Bank Rossiya chair Dmitri Lebedev and Vice Governor of St. Petersburg Vladimir Knyaginin, were also targeted with sanctions, the State Department said. 
In mid-February, Russia's lower house of parliament voted to ask Putin to recognize two Russian-backed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent. 
Eleven members and speaker Vyacheslav Volodin were added to the sanctions list on Friday. 
""Today's designations further hold to account those actors who were directly responsible for Russia's illegitimate and unlawful recognition ... and facilitating the sham pretext used by Putin to justify the ... unprovoked war against Ukraine,"" the Treasury said. 

Justifying the move at the time, Volodin said: ""Kyiv is not observing the Minsk agreements. Our citizens and compatriots who live in Donbass need our help and support."" The Minsk agreements are a pair of accords signed in 2014 and 2015 in the hope of ending violence between pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and the Kyiv government.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

Russia's government said on Thursday it had proposed allowing foreign planes leased by Russian airlines to be registered as the airlines' property, and for them to be given Russian airworthiness certificates.
Western bans imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine give most leasing firms until March 28 to sever ties with Russian airlines - sparking a game of cat-and-mouse from Asia to Africa as lenders frantically try to seize aircraft. 
Russia is trying to get around this by re-registering the foreign-owned planes in Russia, said one source familiar with discussions on the issue this week by the U.N. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)'s governing council. 
Since most of the foreign-owned planes operated by Russian carriers under lease are registered in Bermuda, Russia will allow the aircraft to be dual registered, a second source said.
ICAO said in an emailed response to Reuters that dual registration would not be consistent with Article 18 of the 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation, known as the Chicago Convention, which says ""an aircraft cannot be validly registered in more than one state.""

Montreal-based ICAO said it has reached out to the Russian government requesting confirmation and more details but has not yet received a response. 
ICAO cannot impose rules on governments but sets standards overwhelmingly followed by its 193 member countries.

DENVER (Reuters) - A U.S. gasoline tax cut is among the options being considered to provide relief to consumers, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Friday, adding she was confident that the country's economy would perform well this year. 
""We're looking at a range of things that we might do to relieve consumers. The gas tax is one of the things on the list"", Yellen told reporters on Friday at a social services agency in Denver, Colorado. 
However, she added that she had concerns that cutting the gasoline tax could cause benefits to flow to oil companies and not to consumers. 
She also said that a tighter monetary policy to fight inflation could cause recession, but added that the Federal Reserve should be able to balance its dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability.
""I have confidence in the Fed to get inflation under control without causing a recession. And I see a good strong economy that, even with inflation and the problems that the Russia Ukraine situation is causing, I believe the economy will do well this year.""
Commenting on the U.S. dollar's reserve currency status, which has enabled powerful sanctions against Russia, she said there was no serious competitor the dollar.

""There really is no other currency that I think can rival it as its the reserve currency, and creates the ability to impose very strong sanctions"", Yellen said, when asked if the dollar could lose some of its global clout due to efforts by Russia and China to find alternatives ways to do business.
""China has engaged in searches, Russia has as well, but it's really not come close to inventing any kind of substitute for the dollar,"" Yellen said.

DENVER (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Friday the U.S. economy is better prepared to weather economic turbulence from Russia's invasion of Ukraine because of the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 aid package passed a year ago.
Yellen, speaking at a Denver social services agency on the first anniversary of the American Rescue Plan, (ARP) said the United States is now much better able to withstand unforeseen crises -- such as the war in Ukraine -- than it was a year ago.
""Our world is interconnected, and our ambition to ensure that Russia pays a high price for its unprovoked invasion has already impacted us at home,"" Yellen said, referring to a steep surge in energy prices.
""America is better able to handle these turbulent times because our economy is historically strong, and the American economy is historically strong because of the ARP and the resiliency of the American people,"" Yellen said.
The ARP provided direct payments to Americans, funding for schools and increased COVID-19 responses and rental assistance, as well as a $350 million fund to assist state and local governments. 
With congressional negotiations on the Biden administration's ambitious social and climate spending package stalled, state and local funding has emerged as the Biden administration's main social policy tool channeling funding to local programs aimed at achieving similar goals, such as child care, education and affordable housing. 

She said the program has provided overtime and premium pay for over 740,000 essential workers, supplementing their regular wages.
Yellen said that the ARP spending ""acted like a vaccine for the American economy, ensuring that we were inoculated from the possibility of new variants or unforeseen circumstances.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The cost of Russia's invasion of Ukraine will become a lot clearer next week, with a previously unthinkable sovereign default looming, more emergency central bank measures likely and a stock market crash guaranteed if it reopens.
Moscow's ""special operation"" in its former Soviet neighbour has cut Russia off from key parts of the global financial markets by the West, triggering its worst economic crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. 
Wednesday could mark another low. The government is due to pay $117 million on two of its dollar-denominated bonds. But it has been signalling it will not, or if its does it will be in roubles, tantamount to a default.
Technically it has a 30-day grace period, but that is a minor point. If it happens it would represent its first international default since the Bolshevik revolution over a century ago.
""Default is quite imminent,"" said Roberto Sifon a top analyst at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) which has just hit Russia with the world's biggest ever sovereign credit rating downgrade.
That state-run energy giants Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and Rosneft have made international bond payments in recent days and around $200 billion of still-unsanctioned government reserves does leave a sliver of hope that might not happen, though those odds look grim.
(Graphic: Russia international debt default looming, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgvomznxovd/Pasted%20image%201646220845544.png) 
Wednesday could be busy for other reasons as well. 
Russia's Vedomosti financial newspaper reported central bank and Moscow Exchange sources as saying this week that suspended local equity and bond trading could resume by then.
It would be chaotic at least in the short-term. Russia's big firms which also listed on the London and New York markets, have saw those international shares slump virtually to zero when the crisis broke out and have now been stopped.
""There are many financial institutions that are sitting on Russian assets that they want to get rid of but they can't,"" said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley. 
""They have no real option but to sit on them. But that means that when they are allowed to trade, the selling could be quite persistent.""

RECESSION
It will not finish there. Russia's central bank is scheduled to meet on Friday having already more than doubled interest rates to 20% and brought in widespread capital controls to try and prevent a full-blown financial crisis.
Western investment banks like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) now expect the economy to plunge 7% this year due to the combination of bank run worries, sanctions damage and the instant inflation surge caused by a 40% slump in the rouble.
That compares to predictions of 3% growth at the beginning on the year. It also means a peak-to-trough dive of around 12%, which would be larger than the 10% tumble in the 1998 rouble crisis, the 11% lost during the global financial meltdown and the 9% slump of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The CBR might hike rates a bit further, that would be safest assumption right now,"" said Arthur Budaghyan, chief emerging market strategist at BCA Research. 
The more crucial moves as this stage however could be further capital control measures to try and keep the financial system cocooned.

""Ensuring the banks can function, can still process payments and keep credit flowing to the economy so it can at least function in some capacity is much more important,"" Budaghyan said.

WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States, European Union and other allies on Friday escalated their economic pressure on Russia, moving to strip Moscow of privileged trade and economic treatment among other steps to punish it for its invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. President Joe Biden said the new actions collectively will further hobble a Russian economy already weighed down by previously announced international sanctions that have cratered the rouble and forced the stock market to close.
Referring to ending normal trade relations, Biden said: ""Doing it in unison with other nations that make up half of the global economy will be another crushing blow to the Russian economy that's already suffering very badly from our sanctions.""
The measures announced by the EU, the United States and other G7 allies amount to a fourth set of sanctions against Russia over the Feb. 24 invasion.
They include efforts seeking to end Moscow's ""most-favored nation"" trade status, opening the door to banning or imposing punitive tariffs on Russian goods and putting Russia on a par with North Korea or Iran.
They will also ban luxury goods from being exported from their countries to Russia, designed as a blow to Russian elites.
As a first step, the EU will prohibit imports of iron and steel sector goods from Russia. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was also working to suspend Russia's membership rights of leading multilateral institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and crack down on its use of crypto-assets.
A U.S. ban on luxury exports to Russia and its ally Belarus - including high-end watches, vehicles, clothes, alcohol and jewelry - takes effect immediately, the Commerce Department said.
The U.S. Congress would need to pass legislation to revoke Russia's trade status, and lawmakers have been moving in that direction. The United States also moved to shut down development funds while announcing a ban on imports of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds, too. The White House said Biden would ban U.S. investment in Russia beyond the energy sector.
Top U.S. imports from Russia included mineral fuels, precious metal and stone, iron and steel, fertilizers and inorganic chemicals, all goods that could face higher tariffs once Congress acts to revoke Russia's favored nation trade status.
The United States also imposed sanctions on more Russian oligarchs, leaders and elites, targeting members of the lower house of parliament and billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, among others. Those hit with the new sanctions include 10 people comprising VTB Bank's board, 12 members of the Duma and family members of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the U.S. Treasury Department said.
Russian forces invaded Ukraine last month in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Russia calls the action a ""special operation.""
""Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order,"" the White House said in a statement. 
The United States also imposed fresh North Korea-related sanctions, targeting Russian individuals and companies after U.S. and South Korean officials said Pyongyang had used its largest intercontinental ballistic missile system in two recent launches.

Meanwhile, Britain imposed sanctions on 386 members of the Duma and also said it would seek to ban the export of luxury goods to Russia. The EU has already sanctioned the same group of lawmakers.
Britain's announcement said the sanctions targeted those who had voted to recognize the independence of Ukraine's largely Russian-speaking breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in the run-up to the invasion.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's tax reform, a key plank of new President Gabriel Boric's economic plan, will focus on individuals, natural resources and environmental levies more than corporations, Finance Minister Mario Marcel told Reuters in his first interview in office.
Marcel, speaking hours after being sworn on Friday in along with the rest of Boric's first Cabinet, said the plan was to send a tax reform bill to Congress in the first half of the year, adding it was at the heart of the government's agenda.
""The focus is on the taxation of individuals, natural resources and also green taxes,"" he told Reuters. ""The truth is that there isn't much room left to increase the tax burden of firms without hitting the country's competitiveness.""
Investors are closely watching Boric's economic moves after the 36-year-old leftist leader won election last year pledging to ""bury"" Chile's market-orientated economic model, credited for driving decades of growth but also stoking wide inequality.
Boric, a former protest leader and lawmaker, has moderated his rhetoric since then, with the choice of respected former central bank chief Marcel to lead the economic portfolio being widely seen as a market-friendly pick.
Marcelo said the aim was to agree a longer-term ""tax pact,"" adding modifications could be separated into different packages ""to advance faster in Congress"". The government wants to increase tax collection by five points of GDP over four years.
Regarding closely watched plans for new mining royalties in the world's top copper producer and no. 2 lithium producer, Marcel said that he would look to build on bills already being discussed in Congress versus starting from scratch.
Marcel held off from offering updated economic growth targets, but said projections from the central bank in December of 1.5%-2.5% growth this year were a reasonable range.
""It seems reasonable for an economy that has to make a certain adjustment to reduce the inflationary pressures that we've seen in recent months,"" he said, adding that this will imply that domestic demand must ""slow down significantly"".

The minister said that although the conflict in Ukraine has little direct effect on Chile's economy, the impact it has brought on fuel and grain prices was a factor to keep an eye on.
""Without a doubt, it is a worrying situation, but fortunately the Chilean economy is a little further away from the conflict and also has mechanisms to absorb this type of shock,"" he said.

Biden also criticized voices in the United States clamoring for an active U.S. military presence in Ukraine or American backing of a ""no-fly zone"" to protect Ukrainians from Russian forces.
""The idea that we're gonna send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews ...that's called World War Three, OK? Let's get it straight here, guys,"" Biden told Democrats in Philadelphia.
""We will defend every inch of NATO territory, every single inch,"" including NATO members bordering Russia, Biden said. ""Granted, if we respond it is World War Three, but we have a sacred obligation on NATO territory ... although we will not fight the Third World War in Ukraine.""
Biden said the economic moves collectively will deliver ""another crushing blow"" to Russia's economy, already weighed down by global sanctions that have cratered the rouble and forced the stock market to close. Biden again put the blame on Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""Putin is an aggressor. Putin is the aggressor. And Putin must pay a price,"" Biden said at the White House, noting he had earlier spoke by phone to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
At the White House, Biden joined fellow Group of Seven leaders in calling for revoking Russia's ""most favored nation"" trade status, which would allow G7 nations to increase tariffs and set quotas on Russian products. The U.S. Congress would need to pass legislation to revoke the trade status, and lawmakers recently have been moving in that direction.
""We remain resolved to isolate Russia further from our economies and the international financial system,"" the G7 said in a statement. 
Trade made up about 46% of Russia's economy in 2020, much of that with China or linked to energy exports that European nations depend on for heat and electricity, making it unclear how deeply these moves will impact Russia's economy. 
Biden also banned the U.S. import of Russian vodka, seafood and diamonds.
He warned that Russia would pay a ""severe price"" should it use chemical weapons against Ukraine. The United States has expressed fears that Russia could be paving the way for a chemical weapons attack, without citing evidence.
White House spokesperson Andrew Bates told reporters on Air Force One that if Russia is targeting civilians in Ukraine ""that would be a war crime."" Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
Biden said the United States would add new names to a list of Russian oligarchs who are sanctioned, and ban the export of luxury goods to Russia.
In a separate statement, the White House said Biden would ban U.S. investment in Russia beyond the energy sector, and that G7 nations would move to block Russia from funds from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. 
""Those are the latest steps we're taking but they're not the last steps we're taking."" Biden said. 
The coordinated moves by the United States, Britain and other allies come on top of a host of unprecedented sanctions, export controls and banking restrictions aimed at pressuring Putin to end the largest war in Europe since World War Two.
Russia on Thursday banned the export of telecom, medical, auto, agricultural, electrical and tech equipment, as well as some forestry products, in retaliation. 
The United States is expanding sanctions on Russia to include executives of sanctioned banks and Russian banker Yuri Kovalchuk, as well as Russian lawmakers. 
""Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order,"" the White House said in a statement.
CAVIAR, HEAVY METALS
Stripping Russia of its favored nation status paves the way for the United States and its allies to impose tariffs on a wide range of Russian goods.
Russia is among the world's top exporters of oil, natural gas, copper, aluminum, palladium and other important commodities, and accounted for 1.9% of global trade in 2020. China is its biggest export destination. 
In the United States, removing Russia's ""Permanent Normal Trade Relations"" status would require congressional action but lawmakers in both chambers - and on both sides of the political aisle - have signaled their support. The White House will work with lawmakers on legislation to revoke Russia's status, administration sources said.
In 2019, Russia was the 26th-largest goods trading partner of the United States, with some $28 billion exchanged between the two countries, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's office.
The ban on U.S. luxury exports to Russia and Belarus - including high-end watches, vehicles, clothes, alcohol and jewelry - takes effect immediately, the Commerce Department said in a separate statement as part of the effort to further isolate Moscow and its allies.
A person familiar with the move said Biden's administration planned to ban the export to oligarchs of everything from cashmere and cosmetics to track suits, snow mobiles and sails. 

The United States imported $1.2 billion in Russian fish and shellfish in 2021, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, including sturgeon black caviar. America that year also imported from Russia $275 million worth of diamonds, and about $21 million in alcoholic beverages, according the Census Bureau.
Top U.S. imports from Russia included mineral fuels, precious metal and stone, iron and steel, fertilizers and inorganic chemicals, all goods that could face higher tariffs once Congress acts to revoke Russia's favored nation trade status.

COLOMBO (Reuters) -Sri Lanka will begin talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) next month on a plan to help the crisis-hit country, where a foreign exchange shortage has squeezed essential imports amid looming debt payments, three sources said on Friday.
Sri Lanka is facing its worst financial crisis in years. With foreign exchange reserves standing at a paltry $2.31 billion, the country is struggling to pay for critical imports including fuel, food and medicines.
The move to approach the IMF for help comes after months of resistance from Sri Lanka's government and central bank, despite calls from opposition leaders and experts to seek a bailout package.
Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa will travel to Washington in mid-April to present Sri Lanka's proposal to senior IMF officials, two sources with knowledge of the ongoing discussions told Reuters.
""We are taking our proposal and a plan,"" one of the sources said, declining to be named since the discussions are confidential. ""The government is serious about fixing things.""
In a tweet late on Friday, Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said the aim of the upcoming talks with the IMF was not restructuring Sri Lanka's debt.
""Meetings of Sri Lankan authorities with @IMFNews officials over the next few weeks are NOT for the purpose of #debt restructuring,"" he said.
Through repeated cycles of borrowing since 2007, Sri Lanka had piled up $12.55 billion worth of debt through international sovereign bonds (ISB), which make up the largest part of its external debt. 
The island nation has to repay about $4 billion in foreign debt this year, including a $1 billion ISB maturing in July.
""We will discuss options based on our plans,"" the source said.
Sri Lanka's finance ministry and the IMF did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.
'TOUGH SITUATION'
A combination of historically weak government finances, badly timed tax cuts and the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit the country's lucrative tourism industry and foreign remittances, have wreaked havoc on Sri Lanka's economy.
In a periodic review last week, the IMF called on the government to implement a ""credible and coherent"" strategy to repay debt and restore macroeconomic stability. 
""The country faces mounting challenges, including public debt that has risen to unsustainable levels, low international reserves, and persistently large financing needs in the coming years,"" the IMF said.
To find a way out of the crisis, the government will seek assistance with debt restructuring, the foreign exchange crisis, bolstering revenue generation and reforming state-owned enterprises, the source said.
""This is a tough situation,"" the source said, ""We want to see what support we can get from the IMF.""

In recent weeks, the country of 22 million has faced rolling electricity cuts. Bakeries have run out of gas and many fuel pumps have run dry. Soaring oil prices have added to the government's woes.
Late on Monday, the central bank implemented a flexible exchange rate for the rupee, triggering a devaluation of about 30% and driving up the prices of many essential items.

""Since the two sides opened up the door to each other (50 years ago), they should not close it, let alone decouple,"" Li said at a press conference after the close of the annual parliament meeting. 
In 1972, then-U.S. President Richard Nixon landed in Beijing in a historic visit to China that opened the door to diplomatic relations between the two countries. 
However, bilateral ties have worsened in recent years with China and the United States clashing over issues of trade, human rights, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Li said it was unavoidable for the two countries to have differences as they are different in terms of their social governance, history and development phase. 

""However, we believe cooperation should be the mainstream because world peace and development are dependent on that. Even if we are market competitors in economic and trade fronts, that should be benign and equal.""
Li said there was room for bilateral trade to expand if Washington loosened export controls against China.

The change will lead to restrictions on a wide range of exports to Russia from the United States, and imports from Russia.
The White House said the United States will:
Ban the export of luxury goods to Russia:
President Biden signed an executive order banning the export from the United States to Russia of items including high end-watches, luxury vehicles, high-end apparel, high-end alcohol, jewelry, and other goods frequently purchased by wealthy Russians. 
The U.S. export value of the products covered by these restrictions is nearly $550 million per year, the White House said.
The rule, which also bans the same exports to Belarus, takes effect when released in the Federal Register on Friday, the Commerce Department said. 
Ban U.S. import of some high profile products from Russia:
This includes seafood, spirits/vodka, and non-industrial diamonds. The White House said this could disrupt more than $1 billion in export revenues for Russia. 
The White House said the U.S. could impose additional import bans ""as appropriate"" in the future.
Ban on new investments in Russia:
The White House also announced a ban on any new investment in any sector of the Russian economy by Americans.

Ban on U.S. banknotes to Russia:
The White House also prohibited the exportation, re-exportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person of U.S. dollar-denominated banknotes to the Russian government or any person located in Russia.

VERSAILLES, France (Reuters) -European Union leaders pledged on Friday to cut their dependence on global suppliers of food, microprocessors, drugs, raw materials and digital technologies, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine added a new argument for the EU to be more self-reliant.
The 27-nation bloc has been considering how to become more independent in several strategic areas ever since the COVID-19 pandemic showed that a breakdown of global supply chains could leave the EU without access to pharmaceuticals or microchips.
The war in Ukraine only made that more clear, EU officials said, as Europe will now struggle to wean itself off Russian gas, oil, coal and raw materials and possibly find alternative suppliers of wheat.
""In the context of this crisis we are seeing how our food, our energy, our defence are all issues of sovereignty,"" French President Emmanuel Macron told journalists after hosting an EU summit at the Chateau of Versailles.
""We want to be open to the world, we want to choose our partners but not depend on any,"" he added.
European Commission head Ursula von der Layen said the commission would come up with a plan by mid May to phase out the EU's dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal in five years.
Meanwhile, to prepare for next winter, plans will be made to coordinate European countries' currently fragmented network of gas stocks. In the future underground stocks would have to be filled to at least 90% by Oct. 1 each year, von der Layen said.
INVESTMENT NEEDS
A joint declaration agreed at the summit said the EU would reduce its dependence on imported critical raw materials through strategic partnerships, stockpiling, recycling and resource efficiency.
In semi-conductors the EU wants to build its own factories and double its share of the global market to 20% by 2030, the declaration said. Semi-conductors are now mainly bought from Taiwan and the United States. 
The EU will also make more pharmaceuticals in the bloc rather than importing them from China, invest in research and development in the health sector and in digital technologies like artificial intelligence, Cloud and 5G mobile telephony deployment, the document said.
To become more independent in food, the EU will boost production of plant-based proteins, it said.
It said the leaders want to finance such policies through the European and national budgets, using public money to attract much bigger private investment. They also want to use the European Investment Bank, which is owned by EU governments, ""to catalyse investments, including higher risk-financing for entrepreneurship and innovation.""
France and Italy have been pushing for the EU to agree to new joint debt issuance for the expected increased outlays, modelled on the EU's 800 billion euros recovery fund, of which only 74 billion euros have been disbursed so far.
But others like Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries oppose that, arguing the EU should first use the cash already agreed before borrowing more.
Macron said countries first needed to agree on what and how much investment was needed before figuring out where it would come from. He said summits in March and May could be the opportunity to do that.

""When you agree on the objectives the instruments just follow,"" he said.
The leaders' joint declaration also said that their fiscal policy will have to give them leeway for more spending on defence, investment and dealing with the negative economic effects of the war in Ukraine.

ROME (Reuters) - International food and feed prices could rise by up to 20% as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, triggering a jump in global malnourishment, the United Nations food agency said on Friday.
The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said it was not clear whether Ukraine would be able to harvest crops if the war dragged on, while uncertainty also surrounded the prospects for Russian exports in the coming year.
FAO said Russia was the world's largest exporter of wheat and Ukraine was the fifth largest. Together, they provide 19% of the world's barley supply, 14% of wheat, and 4% of maize, making up more than one-third of global cereal exports.
Russia is also a world leader in fertilizer exports.
""The likely disruptions to agricultural activities of these two major exporters of staple commodities could seriously escalate food insecurity globally,"" FAO Director General Qu Dongyu said in a statement https://www.fao.org/director-general/news/news-article/en/c/1476480.
FAO's food price index hit a record high in February, and looks certain to climb further still in the months ahead as the consequences of the conflict reverberate around the world.
FAO said only part of the expected shortfall in exports from Russia and Ukraine could be met by other countries.
""Worryingly, the resulting global supply gap could push up international food and feed prices by 8 to 22% above their already elevated levels,"" it said.
Between 20% and 30% of fields used to grow winter cereals, maize and sunflower in Ukraine will not be planted or will remain unharvested during the 2022/23 season, FAO predicted.
FAO said 50 countries, including many of the least developed nations, depend on Russia and Ukraine for 30% or more of their wheat supplies, leaving them especially vulnerable.
""The global number of undernourished people could increase by 8 to 13 million people in 2022/23,"" FAO said.
The most pronounced rises would be seen in the Asia-Pacific region followed by sub-Saharan Africa, the Near East and North Africa.

FAO urged other countries not to impose export restrictions on their own produce. ""They exacerbate price volatility, limit the buffer capacity of the global market, and have negative impacts over the medium term,"" the agency said.
A number of countries worldwide have announced food export restrictions or are considering bans to protect their domestic supplies after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow terms a ""special operation"".

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Russian sovereign defaults evoke nervy times on Wall Street. 
Tremors from the Russian government's last rouble debt default in August 1998 contributed to what was, up to then, one of the biggest financial quakes - involving a near collapse and rescue of mega U.S. hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management. 
Would default in 2022 - even a technical foreign currency default as soon as next week - have similarly deep and far-reaching consequences?
Russia has coupon payments due on March 16 on two sovereign U.S. dollar bonds that don't have clauses allowing it to pay in roubles or any alternative currencies. But a decree from President Vladimir Putin last week bans the payment of foreign debts in anything other than roubles.
The upshot is that Russia could technically default on two regular interest payments on dollar-denominated bonds totaling $117 million, once a grace period of 30 days has passed.
Fitch Ratings agency says default is imminent and the World Bank's chief economist, Carmen Reinhart, says Russia is in ""square default territory."" 
If Russia does default, it will do so against the backdrop of widespread global market volatility since the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and near-unprecedented financial, trade and economic sanctions imposed upon Moscow as a result.
The global banking system was greatly strengthened after the 2008-2009 Great Financial Crisis and we know policymakers will do ""whatever it takes"" if faced with a serious financial crisis. Systemic risk must surely be low. 
But the global financial system, markets, and investment flows have never been more inter-connected. The risk of severe volatility, stress, or dislocation in certain areas - as seen in the global nickel market this week - must surely be high.
The only trouble is, there is almost no way of knowing where, in advance, with any certainty. Fear of contagion is likely to permeate investor thinking for months to come. 
Minds are cast back to August 1998 when Russia stunned the financial world by devaluing its currency and defaulting on some of its rouble-denominated debt. 
Coming so soon after the Asian financial crisis, contagion spread like wildfire. LTCM, at the time a huge and highly-leveraged fund betting on the convergence of a range of spreads, including Danish mortgage bonds, got badly burned just weeks later.

Graphic: US Financial Conditions Index - 1990s: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klpykbrbepg/USFCI.png  
The 1998 failure of LTCM, a subsequent $3.6 billion bailout coordinated by the Federal Reserve, and the scars it left - the dollar's 10% plunge against the Japanese yen over two days in October of that year is still the largest in almost half a century - are part of market folklore.
Willem Buiter was an external member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee at that time. He notes the clear and important differences between now and then, but warns there will be casualties.
""We always have the butterfly effect. The bad news is, we don't know a lot about the web of direct and indirect exposures of financial and non-financial entities to asset and commodity markets that are in so much turmoil right now,"" he said.
POOR VISIBILITY
The web runs deep and far.
Russia is the world's third-largest oil producer and joint top exporter; it is the second-largest gas producer and accounts for 40% of Europe's gas; Nornickel is the world's largest palladium producer and largest refined nickel producer; Russia and Ukraine account for a combined 29% of global wheat exports.
The prices of all these commodities have rocketed, in many cases by record amounts or to record levels. Good news if you are on the right side of the move, catastrophic if you are on the wrong side.
Some entities are reported to have suffered losses running into billions of dollars after being wrong-footed by the surge in nickel prices to more than $100,000 per tonne that prompted the London Metal Exchange to halt trading in the metal.
Charlie Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital, was cutting his teeth in the market in 1998. He warns that the magnitude of recent price moves and volatility mean the ripple effects could be felt where you least expect it. 
""Markets cannot price all of the implications of this. Who is owed money by the airline leasing companies that have 500 planes stranded on Russian soil? Which bank will be exposed? What about all these firms up to their necks in commodities trades? Which country will see a prime minister overthrown because of soaring food prices?,"" he ponders.
If that's not already enough cause for concern, a Russian default would likely add to the downward pressures already building on the world economy. According to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), global financial conditions are the tightest since 2009.
""It's a plausible scenario that we have a global recession within six months,"" Robertson posits.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazil's central bank announced tougher rules for fintechs on Friday, saying that payment institutions will be subject to regulations based on their size and complexity and raising standards for required capital.
The new framework, which will start taking effect in January 2023 with full implementation by January 2025, will extend the proportionality of regulatory requirements currently used for conglomerates of financial institutions to include financial conglomerates led by payment institutions.
The move is expected to affect companies such as credit card issuer Nubank, payment company PagSeguro, financial technology solutions firm StoneCo and digital wallet PicPay.
Listed in the United States, Nubank's shares were down 4.2% in early trading, while StoneCo lost 3.4% and PagSeguro fell 1.2%. 
The calculation of regulatory capital will disregard assets that have little or no value for payment institutions' functioning, said the central bank, noting that this will ensure companies have a greater capacity to absorb unexpected losses.
The changes, which the sector has been waiting for since a public consultation was opened on the subject in late 2020, will preserve easier entry for new competitors in the payments sector, ""in order to increase competition in the system and financial inclusion,"" the central bank said.
Fitch Ratings said the new framework is positive as it reduces systemic risk by raising the capital requirement for larger institutions. It added in a statement that many of the companies were already preparing for the change and no capital shortage is expected.
Traditional banks in Brazil had urged the regulator to bring rules for highly successful fintechs into line with their own, saying that many such firms had grown at a dizzying pace amid loose regulation.

The central bank views the new rules as necessary given the diversification and sophistication of payment institutions since 2013, when it put them under its supervision, paving the way for the nascent industry of financial start-ups using technology to simplify payments, transfers and borrowing.
""In this process, part of the segment created financial subsidiaries and started to assume new risks, without proportional prudential requirements,"" the central bank said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cash savers are between a rock and a hard place right now. 
Interest rates on typical places to stash money, like savings accounts, are near all-time lows.
Meanwhile, inflation rates are the highest they have been in decades – consumer prices in the United States surged in February to a 7.9% annual growth rate, according to the Labor Department.
That means the purchasing power of your savings is eroding bit by bit every month.
""We are certainly getting more questions about inflation,"" says Roger Young, director of thought leadership at Baltimore-based investment managers T. Rowe Price. ""We have had the luxury for many years of not having to worry about it, and this is a good reminder that inflation shouldn't be ignored."" 
Cash is the mainstay of short-term savings - perhaps an emergency fund of three to six months' worth of expenses to cover job loss or car repairs. You might also need money ready if you are saving for a down payment on a house.
But the harsh reality is that there are not a lot of great options for where to keep it. That said, some strategies are smarter than others. Here is what to do with that precious cash:
SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AND CDS
The Federal Reserve has signaled that higher interest rates are in our future to help tamp down inflation, so more attractive rates should start showing up in basic bank offerings like savings accounts. So far, the effects have been marginal.
When personal finance site Bankrate surveyed the best savings account rates for March, top results include Comenity Direct (0.60% annual percentage yield),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Online (0.55%), and Ally Bank Online (0.50%).
Certificates of Deposit offer slightly better returns, although they typically require locking up money for an extended period. The best two-year CDs at the moment include Pentagon Federal Credit Union (1.25%), Live Oak Bank (1.1%) and Popular Direct (1.1%), according to Bankrate.
SHORT-TERM BONDS
In eras of rising rates, long-term bond funds tend to get hit pretty hard. But short-term bond funds can be a useful place to keep your cash – generating more potential return than savings accounts, while offering less risk than longer-duration fixed income.
Among the funds with gold ratings from Chicago-based research firm Morningstar are Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond Index (VSTBX), T. Rowe Price Short Duration Income I (TSIDX), and PIMCO Enhanced Low Duration Active ETF (LDUR).
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), whose principal rises with the inflation rate, offer some shelter. ""TIPS are the best of a slew of poor options,"" advises Matt Bacon, a financial planner in Gaithersburg, Maryland.
DIVIDEND-PAYING STOCKS
Dividend-paying stocks are worth a look for better yields. The average yield on the S&P 500 is around 1.4%, although you can find many quality companies paying out more than 2 or 3% - many multiples of the rate you will find on savings accounts.
There are a couple of risks, though. The value of the underlying securities can decline at any time, so if you are forced to sell in the short term, you could be in a tight spot. And dividends can be cut by companies in times of trouble, so look to firms that have a long track record of maintaining and increasing payouts, like the so-called Dividend Aristocrats.
HIGH-INTEREST CREDIT CARD DEBT
If your emergency fund is covered, and you have additional cash, there is one place to get a guaranteed return: Paying off high-interest credit card debt. Get rid of a revolving balance on a card that is charging 15% annually, and you can look at it as making a 15% return.
It is a more complicated discussion when talking about paying off mortgages, car loans or student debt, which may be locked in long-term at attractively low rates. But for credit card debt that can spiral out of control, eliminating it with cash reserves is almost always a good idea.

While these are a few ideas to get slightly better returns on your savings, do not go overboard and take on too much risk – which defeats the purpose of having cash in the first place.
""No need to get too fancy with the cash piece of a portfolio,"" says financial planner Marco Rimassa of CFE Financial in Katy, Texas. ""Especially in this volatile investing environment, cash has a place in most asset allocations as a risk dampener - and is being productive exactly as it is.""

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine is hitting hopes of renewed growth in central Europe's car industry this year following the pandemic, stoking risks of sharper economic slowdowns.
The conflict in Ukraine has worsened supply snags and is also pushing up prices for materials like nickel or palladium, which will put more pressure on the car sector worldwide. The surge in energy costs is also seeping into supply chains.
The pain will be felt especially hard in central Europe, where the sector plays an important role and some disruptions are already seen since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has temporarily suspended production at two plants in Poland.
Another VW unit, Skoda Auto, which is the Czech Republic's biggest exporter, has stopped production of its electric ENYAQ iV model and warned other models' production was also at risk due to the unavailability of key wiring harnesses from Ukraine.
Production interruptions will take a toll, with the Czech car industry accounting for roughly a quarter of industrial output and exports. In Hungary, the car sector accounts for 28% of industrial exports. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Christian Wietoska estimated in a March 11 note that every week of complete car production disruptions - something seen when factories shut at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 - subtracted around 0.1 percentage points from gross domestic product in the Czech Republic or Hungary, more than in Poland or Romania.
Fresh interruptions could limit Czech car output at least into the second quarter, said Jiri Polansky, an economist at Erste Group Bank's Czech unit.
""This year could be tough for the Czech economy, at least the first half of it, and the automotive sector will be one of the most negative sectors,"" he said.
The region's economies posted robust recoveries in 2021, but have faced headwinds this year from high inflation that was starting to cool growth.
DOWNWARD REVISIONS
While analysts say forecasts on the total impact on the car sector are still tough to gauge with uncertainties high, signs are clear the conflict will hurt economies as industrial production is impacted and even higher inflation dampens consumer spending or company investment.
Czech National Bank Governor Jiri Rusnok told Czech Radio on March 9 that ""undoubtedly"" there would be a slowdown. The bank has previously forecast a 3% GDP rise this year compared with 3.3% in 2021.
Hungary's central bank deputy governor Barnabas Virag said this week the war in Ukraine created downside risks to economic growth.
The newest shock comes after two lean years for central Europe's car sector, first with factory shutdowns in 2020. Global chip shortages have held back production since last year, with the Czech sector producing up to 300,000 fewer cars than planned last year because of it.
Czech industry body AutoSAP said this week a third of Czech companies already report a lack of materials or components due to the Ukraine conflict. 
It had previously forecast a return to growth this year, but AutoSAP executive director Zdenek Petzl said reaching 2021 production levels of 1.1 million cars would be a success.
""The impact will be huge,"" he told Reuters. ""It is amazing that companies survived the storm of the last two years. But now it is questionable what will happen.""
In Romania, the economy minister has set up a task force to prepare for fallout in key industrial segments, like the car sector which is facing supply squeezes for some parts.

Peter Virovacz, an economist with ING in Budapest, said Hungarian output declines may only be half of those seen in 2020, but recovery would be much slower.
""The car sector will not be in a position to boost economic growth to the extent we would have seen without the war,"" he said.

FRANKFURT/VERSAILLES (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is working on a financial facility to let millions of Ukrainian refugees convert their savings into hard currency, to help them make a new start in Europe as they flee war at home, three sources with direct knowledge said. 
Over two million people have fled Ukraine since Russia's shock invasion last month and their numbers could swell to over five million within weeks. 
Many of them are struggling to buy even basic necessities as their savings in hryvnia are non-convertible across most of Europe, meaning they have no means to exchange them at reasonable rates. That in turn leaves them prey to unscrupulous traders offering ultra-low rates of exchange.
Several ECB policymakers, primarily from the bloc's east, asked ECB chief Christine Lagarde on Thursday for a joint solution and the bank is now scrambling to design a facility.
""This would be a humanitarian, goodwill effort, rather than a regular policy instrument, but we are still bound by laws so it's not like we could just say, come, we'll covert it for you,"" one of the sources said. 
""But we have days, not weeks to figure it out.""
The sources said that EU leaders were also pressuring the bank to act and had asked the ECB to speed up its efforts.
An ECB spokesperson declined to comment. On Thursday, Lagarde said the bank was exploring its options and hoped to have tools in the next few days ""to support the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian authorities"".
The problem is that any large-scale conversion is likely to lead to financial losses, raising the question of who should bear the cost.
In normal times, the ECB would open a direct link with the Ukrainian central bank via a swap or repo line to facilitate the conversion.
But such instruments require collateral that Ukraine's central bank is hardly in a position to put up. Without collateral the legality of an ECB facility could be doubtful, the sources said. 
An option being considered by European Union leaders at their summit in Versailles this week is for the EU to guarantee the facility and use the ECB as a facilitator of the transactions. 
The actual conversions would happen via commercial banks but under the auspices of the euro zone central bank and backed by common rules.
Part of the solution could be letting Ukrainians open bank accounts in Europe and allowing them to spend their hryvnia electronically up to a pre-set limit. 
Policymakers are under pressure to set an affordable exchange rate for such a scheme, which is likely to increase losses. Individual limits are under discussion, as is the size of the overall facility, the sources said.
DESPERATE
The problem is urgent because desperate refugees are falling victim to some of the few vendors willing to take their currency.
""Some traders offer a very unfavourable exchange rate, which can be seen as a kind of usury,"" the Polish Human Rights Ombudsman said in a statement last week. 
Poland, outside the euro zone, has seen the biggest influx of refugees from its neighbour, and its central bank has already said a conversion facility will be set up. 
Polish central bank governor Adam Glapinski said on Wednesday there will be a system introduced allowing Ukrainians to sell hryvnias, with two scenarios being considered. 

Either the Polish central bank would buy the currency and later sell it to the Ukrainian central bank or commercial banks would be involved, with the second option seen as more probable.
The Bulgarian central bank has also said it is working on a facility while in Romania, the local unit of Erste Bank lets Ukrainians convert around 400 euros worth of hryvnia.

(Reuters) - The Russian invasion of Ukraine threatens millions of tiny spring-time sprouts that should emerge from stalks of dormant winter wheat in the coming weeks. If the farmers can't feed those crops soon, far fewer of the so-called tillers will spout, jeopardizing a national wheat harvest on which millions in the developing world depend.
The wheat was planted last autumn, which, after a brief growing period, fell dormant for the winter. Before the grain returns to life, however, farmers typically spread fertilizer that encourages the tillers to grow off the main stalks. Each stalk can have three or four tillers, increasing the yield per wheat stalk exponentially.
But Ukrainian farmers - who produced a record grain crop last year - say they now are short of fertilizer, as well as pesticides and herbicides. And even if they had enough of those materials, they can’t get enough fuel to power their equipment, they add.
Elena Neroba, a Kyiv-based business development manager at grain brokerage Maxigrain, said Ukraine’s winter wheat yields could fall by 15% compared to recent years if fertilizers aren’t applied now. Some farmers warn the situation could be much worse.
Some Ukrainian farmers told Reuters their wheat yields could be cut in half, and perhaps by more, which has implications far beyond Ukraine. Countries such as Lebanon, Egypt, Yemen and others have come to rely on Ukrainian wheat in recent years. The war has already caused wheat prices to skyrocket - rising by 50% in the last month. 
The Ukrainian farming crisis comes as food prices around the world already have been spiking for months amid global supply chain problems attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. World food prices hit a record high in February, and have risen over 24% in a year, the U.N. food agency said last week. Agriculture ministers from the world's seven largest advanced economies were due Friday to discuss in a virtual meeting the impact of Russia's invasion on global food security and how best to stabilize food markets.
International food and feed prices could rise by up to 20%as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, triggering a jump in global malnourishment, the United Nations food agency said on Friday.
Ukraine and Russia are major wheat exporters, together accounting for about a third of world exports- almost all of which passes through the Black Sea.
Svein Tore Holsether, president of Norway-based Yara International (OTC:YARIY), the world’s largest maker of nitrogen-based fertilizers, said he is worried that tens of millions of people will suffer food shortages because of the farming crisis in Ukraine. ""For me, it's not whether we are moving into a global food crisis,” he said. “It's how large the crisis will be.""
Ukrainian officials say they are still hopeful the country will have a relatively successful year. Much of that hope rests with farmers in the west of the country, which, so far, remains distant from the shooting.
But officials are taking measures to protect domestic supplies to ensure Ukraine’s population gets fed - posing another possible hit to export shipments. Agriculture Minister Roman Leshchenko said on Tuesday the country was banning the export of various staples, including wheat. Leshchenko has acknowledged the threat to Ukraine’s food supply and that the government was doing what it can to help farmers.
“We understand that food for the entire state depends on what will be in the fields,” he said in televised remarks Monday.
Moscow says it is conducting a special military operation in Ukraine to demilitarize and capture dangerous nationalists. It has denied deliberately targeting civilians and civil infrastructure, despite documented attacks on hospitals, apartment buildings and railroads.
Grain exports are a cornerstone of Ukraine’s economy.
In the coming weeks, farmers should also start planting other crops, such as corn and sunflowers, but they are struggling to get the seeds they need, said Dykun Andriy, chairman of the Ukrainian Agricultural Council, which represents about 1,000 farmers cultivating five million hectares.
Andriy warned that the fuel is the critical problem now. Unless farmers can get diesel to run their equipment, spring farmwork will be impossible and this year’s harvests doomed. “Farmers are desperate,” he said. “There is a big risk that we don't have enough food to feed our people.”
Maxigrain’s Neroba said farmers are facing fuel shortages because military needs take priority.
Ukrainian farmer Oleksandr Chumak said little work is happening in his fields, some 200 km north of the Black Sea port of Odessa. He farms 3,000 hectares (about 7,500 acres) where he grows wheat, corn, sunflowers and rapeseed. Even if he had enough fuel to get his equipment into the fields, he said he had insufficient fertilizer for all of his crops and no herbicides.
“Usually we have maybe six to seven tons (of wheat) per hectare. This year, I think that if we get three tons per hectare, it will be very good,” Chumak said. He added he remains hopeful that Ukrainian farmers will find a way to grow enough food to feed their countrymen, but he does not expect much will be exported.
In northern Ukraine, he said friends of his have been reduced to skimming fuel from a ditch that was filled with diesel after a Russian attack on a train spilled fuel from several tankers. Other friends, in the occupied areas near Kherson, are scavenging diesel from ambushed and abandoned Russian tanker convoys, Chumak said.
Currently, he spends much of his time preparing for a Russian assault. “I live in Odessa. Every day I see rockets fly over my house.”
Val Sigaev, a grain broker at R.J. O'Brien in Kyiv, who evacuated last week, said it is unclear how much of the usual spring farming -- planting and fertilizing -- would be possible. High prices for natural gas - a major input for fertilizer - sent fertilizer prices up, so some farmers postponed purchases.
""Some people think we could plant as much as half of the crop,” Sigaev said. “Others say that only the West will see plantings and what is produced will be strictly for Ukrainian needs.”
The situation is especially dire in the southern port city of Kherson, the first Ukrainian city Russia captured after invading the country on Feb. 24. Spring-like weather adds to farmers’ urgency, if they don't tend to their fields now this year’s harvest will be a bust.
Andrii Pastushenko is the general manager of a 1,500-hectare farm just west of the city, near the mouth of the Dnipro River. Last autumn, they sowed about 1,000 hectares of wheat, barley and rapeseed. His farm workers need to get into those fields now, but can’t, he says, and they’ve lost access to fuel. “We’re completely cut off from the civilized world and the rest of Ukraine.”
Additionally, many of Pastushenko's 80 workers cannot come to work at the farm because they live a few miles to the north, across the front line. The manager's problems are compounded because the region is drier than other agricultural areas of the country and his fields need to be irrigated. And that too requires fuel.
Unlike many, Pastushenko has a 50-metric ton nitrogen-based fertilizer stockpile. With the fighting all around him, however, he’s not sure that’s such a good thing: Fertilizer is highly explosive. “If something drops from a helicopter, it could blow the whole place,” he said.
He said he fears the harvest will be poor. Last year, his wheat and barley fields yielded about five metric tons per hectare. If he doesn’t spray insecticide - which he says he can’t get - and spread fertilizer, he doubts he’ll get a third of that amount.
“I’ve no idea whether we’ll be able to harvest something,” he said. “Something will come off the ground, but it won’t be enough to feed our cattle and pay our staff.”
About 150 km west of Pastushenko’s farm is the Black Sea port of Odessa, which remains under Ukrainian control. In peacetime, much of Ukrainian agricultural exports find their way onto ships at the port, Ukraine’s busiest. Today, no ships are leaving and the city is besieged by Russian forces.
Much of Ukraine’s harvest was due to be exported to North Africa, the Middle East, and the Levant. According to the United Nations’ World Food Program (WFP), Ukraine supplies Lebanon with more than half of its imported wheat, Tunisia imports 42 % and Yemen nearly a quarter. Ukraine has grown to become WFP’s largest supplier of food.
For some countries, rising prices could hammer governments as well as consumers because of state food subsidies.
Egypt, which has become increasingly dependent on Ukrainian and Russian wheat over the past decade, heavily subsidizes bread for its population. As the price of wheat rises, so will pressure on the government to raise bread prices, said Sikandra Kurdi, a Dubai-based research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute.
The country’s food subsidy program currently costs the government about $5.5 billion annually. Currently, nearly two-thirds of the population can buy five loaves of round bread daily for 50 cents a month.
Other developing countries with similar subsidies will also struggle with rising wheat prices. In 2019, protests over bread price increases in Sudan contributed to the overthrow of the head of state, Omar al-Bashir.

For countries that provide large subsidies, rising food prices will mean that either governments take on more debt or consumers will pay higher prices, Kurdi said.

(Reuters) - Global financial conditions have reached their tightest since May 2009, according to a widely watched Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) index, a possible sign of a world economic slowdown. 
Financial conditions reflect the availability of funding in an economy and, perceived as strongly correlated with future growth, are watched closely by central bankers. How loose or tight they are dictates spending, saving and investment plans of businesses and households.
Goldman's index rose to 100.92 points as of Thursday, 130 basis points tighter than before Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine. 
Graphic: GS global financial conditions: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjpqkolojpx/KNQdg-global-financial-conditions-at-tightest-since-2009.png  
Conditions in emerging markets reached their tightest since December 2008 at 102.47 points, a 230 bps move since the invasion. 
Russian conditions are at the tightest on record at 128.83 points, the data showed, from around 98 at the start of February, the tightest on record in data going back to 2007. 
Graphic: GS Russia financial conditions: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xmpjoewelvr/aWMrB-russian-financial-conditions-tightest-on-record%20(1).png 
The tightening is an unwelcome development for a world economy already threatened by the knock-on effect of surging commodity prices and supply chain setbacks. 
Goldman Sachs, which uses metrics such as exchange rates, equity swings and borrowing costs to compile the most widely used financial conditions indexes, has in the past shown a 100-basis-point tightening in conditions crimps growth by one percentage point in the coming year.
Richard McGuire, head of rates strategy at Rabobank, expects conditions to tighten further. 
""Central banks are focused on inflation rather than growth so any hope of a concilatory stance reflective of the fact that demand is weakening is likely to be disappointed,"" he said.
The European Central Bank surprised markets on Thursday when it outlined plans to end its bond purchases in the third quarter, paving the way for rate hikes. Given the economic hit from the Ukraine crisis, many investors had expected it to refrain from making firm commitments. 
Commodity importers such as China, Turkey, Korea, Japan and India may be hardest hit by the price pressures resulting from sanctions against Russia, ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said. 
""You have to brace yourself for demand destruction either delivered by central banks, which in itself tightens financial conditions, or via eroded profit margins, negative real income growth without central bank growth,"" McGuire said.

That can cause further market selloffs, another channel through which conditions tighten, he added.
None of the metrics Goldman tracks signal relief. The dollar is near two-year highs, world stocks have fallen more than 10% this year and companies' borrowing costs are sharply higher as investors assess the hit to companies' profits.

235,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 09:47AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States, the European Union, Britain, Canada and Japan were due to move jointly on Friday to revoke Russia's ""most favoured nation"" (MFN) status over its invasion of Ukraine, people familiar with the situation told Reuters.
But what is MFN status and what does its removal mean?
MOST FAVOURED NATION STATUS
The World Trade Organization's 164 members commit to treating other members equally so they can all benefit from each other's lowest tariffs, highest import quotas and fewest trade barriers for goods and services. This principle of non-discrimination is known as most favoured nation (MFN) treatment.
There are some exceptions, such as when members strike bilateral trade agreements or when members offer developing countries special access to their markets.
For countries outside the WTO, such as Iran, North Korea, Syria or Russian ally Belarus, WTO members can impose whatever trade measures they wish without flouting global trading rules.
REMOVAL OF MFN STATUS
There is no formal procedure for suspending MFN treatment and it is not clear whether members are obliged to inform the WTO if they do so.
India suspended Pakistan's MFN status in 2019 after a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based Islamist group killed 40 police. Pakistan never applied MFN status to India.
WHAT DOES LOSING MFN STATUS MEAN?
Revoking Russia's MFN status sends a strong signal that the United States and its Western allies do not consider Russia a economic partner in any way, but it does not in itself change conditions for trade. 
It does formally allow the Western allies to increase import tariffs or impose quotas on Russian goods, or even ban them, and to restrict services out of the country. They could also overlook Russian intellectual property rights.
Ahead of MFN status removal, the United States had already announced a ban on imports of Russian oil and gas.
Canada said last week it was withdrawing MFN status for Russia and Belarus, which allowed Russian troops to move into Ukraine from its territory, setting a 35% general tariff on virtually all imports.
""Russia and Belarus will join North Korea as the only countries whose imports are subject to the general tariff,"" Canada said.
The European Union has already banned about 70% of all imports, such as tobacco, potash and products made of wood or steel, from non-WTO member Belarus. However, it is waiting for formal adoption of MFN suspension before taking similar action against Russia. 

Imports from Russia include mineral fuels, precious metals and stones, iron and steel, fertilizers and inorganic chemicals.
The MFN move comes on top of unprecedented sanctions, export controls and banking restrictions aimed at pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two.

236,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 09:21AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russia's government on Friday proposed a raft of measures, including some for suppliers of state-owned companies and its IT sector, as it seeks to weather the impact of Western sanctions on its economy.
Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said the government was actively working on a third package of measures to counteract the sanctions, which would seek to support small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as systemically important firms. 
One measure will give firms under Western sanctions the right to withhold the names of parties they are working with.
The finance ministry said suppliers to state-controlled companies would be absolved of fines if they fail to meet contractual obligations this year owing to Western sanctions. 
""Suppliers are experiencing difficulties fulfilling their contracts under earlier-agreed terms due to sanctions,"" the ministry said.
The digital ministry reacted to a mass exodus of Western firms by suggesting Russian IT companies begin urgent discussions with foreign firms about a phased transfer of technical support components, to limit disruption.
It asked firms to send it information about any foreign companies' products and services that they had contracted to receive or paid for.
And it said the heads of foreign companies' Russian offices should not be held liable for their companies' actions, acknowledging that they were not the final decision makers. 

""We are sure that if foreign companies that are suspending or stopping their activity do not resume their work in Russia, then the niches occupied by these companies will be quickly filled with Russian solutions, as well as by products of companies from countries that have not introduced corresponding restrictions,"" the digital ministry said in a statement. 
It said it was ready to consult with and assist foreign companies on issues including payments.

(Reuters) -The Russian attack on Ukraine may slow global growth and raise new economic risks, but top central banks are keeping their focus trained on an inflation fight that looks set to intensify as prices soar across the board, from fuel to food. 
While Europe may be the most vulnerable to a broader economic shock from the war, the European Central Bank made clear on Thursday the region could not turn its back on surging inflation in the euro zone.
Calling the war a ""watershed moment"" that could curb growth but boost inflation, the ECB agreed to stop pumping money into markets this summer - clearing the way for possible interest rate increases later this year, its first increase in over a decade.
""You can slice inflation any way you want and look at any core measure, it's above target and rising. We have a 2% mandate and we're failing it,"" said one ECB policymaker, who asked not to be named.
A similar narrative was emerging in other Western countries, including the United States, as officials weigh the potential damage on their economies from the war against the persistent rise in inflation.
Growth is expected to remain above trend in major economies, allowing them to focus on inflation running far faster than their common 2% percent benchmark.
The Bank of Canada raised interest rates earlier this month.
The Bank of England and the Federal Reserve are expected to do so next week. Each is expected to follow with more increases in coming months.
Even fiscal policy officials - more sensitive to the politics of economic developments and often cheerleaders of looser central bank policies - are keenly aware of the corrosive power of run-away price increases.
Inflation ""is of tremendous concern,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday. ""It hits Americans hard. It makes them worry about basic pocketbook issues.""
With U.S. consumer inflation hitting a 40-year high, investors now expect the Fed to raise the target federal funds rate to a level between 1.75% and 2% by year's end, a quarter point higher than they expected as of last week.
The ECB is actually a latecomer to tightening and will have to pay an price for this. The euro has weakened sharply in recent weeks on expectations the ECB would drag its feet in cutting stimulus and that will raise inflation further through higher import prices.
Euro area inflation is seen over 5% this year, more than twice the ECB's 2% target, taking until 2024 to fall back below that level. 
""The Fed will tighten quicker and the FX rate will reflect that,"" the ECB policymaker said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if there was more euro weakness after the Fed meeting next week. We have fallen behind the curve compared to other central banks.""
Economists tried to caution the ECB on Friday, warning that high commodity prices could actually drag the euro zone into recession but policymakers dismissed this view.
""Growth remain positive, there is no recession,"" French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau said.
ASIA OUTLOOK MURKIER
The outlier among major central banks is the Bank of Japan, which is expected to maintain ultra-loose monetary policy to support a still fragile recovery even as surging energy costs push up inflation toward its 2% target.
""If crude oil and commodity prices drive up inflation while wage growth remains slow, that would hit households' real income and corporate profits, and hurt the economy,"" BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Tuesday.
The monetary policy path is less clear in Asia, where many economies have lagged Western counterparts in scrapping harsh pandemic restrictions.
For some central banks in the region, such as New Zealand, South Korea and Singapore, deep worries about prices and imported inflation have already set off policy tightening.
Australia's top central banker on Friday cautioned borrowers it would be prudent to prepare for a rise in rates this year with inflation set to increase.

For most others in the region, the need to sustain a fragile recovery is likely to complicate deliberations.
Thailand's central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates any time soon despite inflation spiking to a 13-year high, as the war's effect to tourism and trade dent growth.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's sudden devaluation of the local currency and imposition of import limits on hundreds of items is likely to disrupt value chains and push up consumer prices that are already sky high, analysts and retailers warned. 
Sri Lanka's central bank earlier this week said it was fixing the upper limit on the rupee at 230 to the dollar, effectively devaluing it by almost 15%.
The finance ministry for its part on Wednesday limited imports of 367 non-essential items including fish, footwear, and wine and said only valid licence holders will be allowed to import these in limited quantities.
But experts and industry representatives cautioned that the steps - taken with the intent to boost exports, disincentivise imports and save foreign exchange for essential items like fuel and medicine - could inflict further pain on the economy. 
""More than 60% of imports are for value addition exports,"" an import sector representative told Reuters on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the issue. 
""It's been two years since the government started imposing import limits, but they haven't helped the economy. These limits only increase red tape, hamper trade and reduce government revenue.""
The government started imposing restrictions in March 2020 to prevent a drawdown on its foreign exchange reserves, which had fallen to a meagre $2.31 billion by the end of February this year with more than $4 billion in external debt repayments due during the remainder of 2022.
Devaluing the rupee, the Cabinet spokesman said, is expected to attract remittances while discouraging imports.
However, some complained the move came without adequate warning.
""The sudden floating of the rupee has caused mayhem,"" said Harpo Gooneratne of the Colombo City Restaurant Collective, warning increased costs will have to be passed onto consumers.
""Restaurants may not be able to bear the hit. Some are already looking at bulk ordering of items like flour, meat, butter and cheese but that is not sustainable.""

Gooneratne, who owns 10 restaurants in Colombo, warned import limits, including on cigars, beer and wine, could hit tourism, which the government has been aggressively promoting to boost foreign exchange earnings and economic recovery.
Sri Lanka's food inflation reached 25.7% in February, driven by higher global commodity prices and supply issues and analysts believe the moves by the government and central bank could have a further detrimental effect.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England looks set to lift interest rates to 0.75% on Thursday, its third rate rise in a row as it seeks to tame a dramatic surge in inflation that has been intensified by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
A quarter-point rate hike on March 17 would return the cost of borrowing to where it was before Britain was hit by COVID-19 two years ago, but is unlikely to be the BoE's last.
The BoE was the first major central bank to push up rates since the start of the pandemic with an increase to 0.25% in December. Alongside February's rise to 0.5% it also began to slowly reverse its 895 billion pounds ($1.17 trillion) of bond purchases.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to start to raise rates on Wednesday, and the European Central Bank this week announced it would stop its bond purchase stimulus in the summer.
Last month, before Ukraine was invaded, the BoE forecast consumer price inflation would peak at about 7.25% in April, when household energy tariffs are due to rise by more than half.
Now economists think inflation might exceed 8% later this year and reach its highest since the early 1980s. The cost of natural gas used to heat most British homes is 60% higher than before February's meeting.
Higher rates will not stop the short-term rise in inflation, and the surge in energy prices will squeeze British living standards, ultimately pulling down inflation.
But the BoE views raising rates now as necessary to reduce the risk that high inflation gets baked into longer-term expectations -- a costly problem the last time inflation got this high in Britain in the early 1990s.
""I think it's really tough for the Bank at the moment to get this right,"" said James Smith, a former BoE economist who is now research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank.
""If they go too slowly, you get the inflation shock. If they go too fast, it chokes off recovery. And then there is a recession risk on top of that.""
RATES AT 2%?
Investors are pricing in the BoE raising rates to 2% by the end of 2022.
Most economists think this is too aggressive - the BoE's own forecasts suggested inflation in 2-3 years' time would undershoot its 2% target if Bank Rate neared 1.5% in 2023.
Although Britain's economy regained its pre-crisis size in November, before the Omicron wave of coronavirus cases, output has not caught up with lost growth like in the United States.
Some economists such as Capital Economics' Paul Dales nevertheless think Britain's tight labour market -- job vacancies hit a record high in January -- could push the BoE to raise rates as high as 2% by next year. 
Policymakers were spooked last month by an in-house survey which showed businesses expected to raise pay by 5% this year.
Four of the BoE's nine Monetary Policy Committee members voted for a half-point rate rise in February, to 0.75% rather than 0.5% -- bigger than any hike the central bank has enacted since gaining operational independence in 1997.
Although soaring energy prices are likely to slow growth this year, Dales said this was unlikely to change most MPC members' view on the need for further tightening.
A BoE survey on Friday showed public inflation expectations for the next 12 months had jumped to the highest since 2008, though the rise in medium-term expectations -- which some MPC members think are more significant -- was less marked.

Financial markets are pricing in the highest inflation expectations in at least a decade.

The IRS also will create a new 700-person ""surge team"" to process new returns at its campuses in Kansas City, Austin, Texas and Ogden, Utah, the Treasury said.
As of Feb. 5 the National Taxpayer Advocate's office said the IRS had a backlog of some 23.5 million tax returns that still needed some form of manual processing, including 13.5 million from individuals, 7.2 million from businesses and 2.8 million from unspecified filers.
The backlog is due partly to delayed filing seasons over the past two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Treasury also blamed a decade of IRS budget cuts that has left the agency with a workforce the same size as in 1970 despite a 60% increase in the U.S. population and a more complex American economy. 

The IRS said it will hold job fairs at the Kansas City, Austin and Ogden locations to fill 5,000 open positions and 5,000 new positions.
The Treasury said the agency also is requiring mandatory overtime work for more than 6,000 employees processing original returns, and overtime pay also is available for some 10,000 other employees processing amended returns and taxpayer correspondence.

""In a sense, India's growth story remains as weak as it was at the time of the 2013 taper tantrum. The recent reverberations of war have in fact, tilted the balance of risks downwards,"" Patra said at an event organised by the IMC Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Patra said that though the third wave of the pandemic had a relatively minor impact as reflected in high-frequency indicators, gross domestic product for full year 2021/22 is expected to rise by only 1.8% from its pre-pandemic levels.
The government's thrust on capital expenditure in 2022/23 can be the gamechanger by enhancing productive capacity, crowding in private investment and strengthening aggregate demand amid the conducive financial conditions engendered by the RBI, the deputy governor said.
Patra said there are upside risks to the inflation projections made by the RBI's monetary policy committee on the back of recent geopolitical developments and the MPC will provide a thorough reassessment in its April meeting.
""But the focus of monetary policy on price stability with clear accountability and the government’s proactive responses to keep prices in check provides confidence that India will weather this storm,"" he added.
There is headroom for the government to further lower duties on fuel and that can help delay the passthrough of high crude to pump prices, Patra said.
""While the fallout of the geopolitical situation is being assessed and will be factored into our projections, it is reasonable to treat it as a supply shock at this stage in the setting of monetary policy,"" he added.

Since the onset of the pandemic, India has been encountering episodes of rising inflation but the headline number has stayed in single-digit and has tended to revert back to the target as each supply shock has receded, Patra said.
""Global spillovers are impacting core inflation on an ongoing basis and keeping it elevated,"" he added.

Sanctions have already cut off the supply of most aircraft and parts to Russia and forced its carriers to cancel many international flights for fear their aircraft will be seized by foreign lessors or banks.
An official at Russia's aviation authority said on Thursday China had refused to supply Russian airlines with aircraft parts, after Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus halted supply of components.
""Questions of supplies of spare parts from China and other Asian contries are being worked out,"" said Alina Malysheva, director of the transport ministry's legal support department, in a meeting with lawmakers from the Federation Council, the Russian parliament's upper house. 
She said 739 of Russia's 1,367 airplanes are currently registered abroad and that Russian aircraft may be able to be registered in Russia without being taken off foreign registers.
""A decision on buying (planes) has not yet been taken,"" Malysheva said. 
Russia on Thursday published a draft law that could prevent its airlines returning leased aircraft, raising the stakes in a showdown with Western finance over $10 billion of jets.

The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, passed the legislation on Friday at the first reading, which would offer relief to the transport sector in the face of sanctions.
The law seeks to preserve the fleet of foreign aircraft with Russian operators and allows for changes in the way airworthiness certificates can be issued.

Investing.com -- Russian forces are on the move again in Ukraine after being bogged down for a week. The humanitarian disaster there escalates, with the number of refugees now estimated at over 2.4 million. Oil jumps as talks to lift sanctions on Iran are paused, frustrating hopes for a quick increase in supplies of Iranian crude. Rivian stumbles after revising down its production guidance for this year. Chinese technology stocks are on course for their worst week in a year on revived fears of forced delistings from U.S. markets, and the company behind nickel's big short says it wants to keep the position open. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 11th March.
1. Summit ""possible"" but Russian war machine cranks up again
The Kremlin said a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky is possible, raising hopes of a diplomatic resolution to a war that is now in its third week. Such hopes had taken a knock on Thursday after a meeting between the two countries’ foreign ministers broke up without visible progress. 
Elsewhere, EU leaders called for a full withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, setting a high bar for anything resembling a lifting of economic pressure on Russia. It also promised another 500 million euros ($555 million) in military assistance for Ukraine.
On the battlefield, Russia stepped up airstrikes on western Ukraine, and its 40-mile long convoy that had been stuck north of Kyiv for the last week started moving again, dividing into two in what analysts said may be a prelude to an attack on the capital. Putin said he would deploy volunteers from Syria to fight in response to reports of foreign citizens seeking to join Ukrainian forces.
The humanitarian disaster in Ukraine’s other cities continued, with the residents of Mariupol having to dispose of their dead in mass graves, while Russian artillery – which targeted a maternity unit earlier this week - struck a psychiatric hospital, according to Ukrainian officials. The UNHCR estimates that some 2.4 million refugees have now fled the country, the biggest such movement in Europe since World War 2.
2. Oil jumps as Iran talks paused
Oil prices rose as the talks around lifting sanctions on Iran were paused followed by concerns in Western capitals, especially Washington, that the concessions offered on its nuclear program are too high a price to pay for an increase in supplies of Iranian oil to world markets.
The Biden administration has also sounded out Venezuela this week on ways to increase its supplies. Of more immediate concern, unwillingness – or inability – of U.S. shale companies to increase production, despite record-high prices. Baker Hughes’ rig count, which measures U.S. drilling activity, is due later.
By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), U.S. crude futures were up 2.0% at $108.43 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 2.3% at $111.84 a barrel.
3. Stocks set to open higher; Rivian in spotlight
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher Friday, in line with gains made in Europe on fresh hopes for diplomatic progress to the conflict.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 387 points, or 1.2%, while S&P 500 futures were up 1.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.6%.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include EV-maker Rivian, which announced a wider loss in the fourth quarter and was forced to lower its production guidance for the year late on Thursday. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock is also lower in premarket after its third-quarter earnings missed forecasts due to higher operating costs and a weak performance by its equity investments.
Also in focus will be Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) after news suggesting it will allow calls for violence against Russian officials and armed forces on its social media platforms, in breach of its usual policies.
4. Chinese tech stock selloff deepens after SEC warning
Chinese technology stocks are on course for their worst week in a year, after a notice from the Securities and Exchanges Commission on Thursday revived fears that they may be forced to delist from U.S. stock markets.
The SEC said ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR), fast-food giant Yum China,  BeiGene  (NASDAQ:BGNE),  Zai Lab  (NASDAQ:ZLAB) and HutchMed all risked being delisted in early 2024 unless they presented proper audit documents supporting their financial statements.
The NASDAQ Golden Dragon China index, which tracks Chinese ADRs, fell 10% on Thursday, with individual names such as Nio (NYSE:NIO),  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) losing between 8% and 20%. The index is now down some 68% from its high in February last year.
Back in China meanwhile, officially registered new cases of Covid-19 breached 1,000 for the first time in two years. China’s Prime Minister Li Keqiang also again expressed concern about Western sanctions on Russia, which look increasingly likely to cause a sharp slowdown in the world economy.
5. Nickel's big short wants to keep his position open
The London Metal Exchange Index said nickel trading will stay suspended through the end of the week as it struggles to deal with the backlash against its moves to protect its members.
Tsangshin, the Chinese company whose massive short position was the root cause of the spike that forced the LME to suspend trading, said it wants to keep the position open, which may be just as well given that there is no agreement over what price it can be closed.
Other base metals continued to push higher Friday amid continued uncertainty over the status of Russian supply. The chairman of mining giant Norilsk Nickel, Vladimir Potanin, warned that Russia’s current policies would take it back to 1917 – the year of the Bolshevik revolution.",,,,,

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Philadelphia is plugging a massive budget hole opened by COVID-19, avoiding layoffs and the closing of swimming pools. St. Louis is handing out $500 checks to 10,000 needy families. Denver has set aside $28 million for affordable housing units amid spiraling rental costs. 
With revenues still crimped by COVID-19, these U.S. cities can fund those initiatives thanks to a $350 billion bucket of coronavirus aid money for state and local governments enacted a year ago Friday.
As President Joe Biden's ambitious social and climate spending plans languish amid congressional resistance and Washington's shifting focus to the war in Ukraine, the American Rescue Plan's State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund is emerging as his administration's top poverty-fighting tool.
Allocated based on population, income and unemployment levels, some 70% of that money is already sitting in municipal treasuries. But many state and local governments are just now starting to spend it.
""It's going to allow us to not have layoffs,"" Philadelphia Chief Grants Officer Ashley Del Bianco said. ""It will also allow us to continue offering some really key city services. Parks, libraries, recreation centers in large part had major funding cuts.""
Philadelphia is devoting its entire $1.4 billion allocation to make up for lost revenue when suburban residents stopped paying the city's 3.45% wage tax during the pandemic while they worked from home instead of commuting to city offices, Del Bianco said.
The funds will add over $250 million a year to the city's $5.3 billion annual budget over five years. Should revenues recover more quickly, the city will consider other uses, she added.
GENERATIONAL WINDFALL
Many mayors and county executives have never seen this kind of cash windfall.
""This is a sort of once-in-a-generation level of investment in state and local governments,"" said Alan Berube, senior fellow with Brookings Metro, an urban policy think tank in Washington. 
Final rules issued by the Treasury in January expanded allowable uses, including premium pay for public sector workers, childcare, preschool programs and affordable housing projects in pandemic-hit communities.
Such needs were meant to be funded in Biden's $2 trillion ""Build Back Better"" spending package, which had proposed funding for childcare subsidies, education, job training and tax credits for green energy technologies.
Although the plan stalled after objections from Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, the Biden administration is still pushing for key elements, now marketed as ""Building a Better America."" But that, too, faces uncertainty as mid-term congressional elections loom and Russia's invasion of Ukraine diverts attention.
MONEY IN HAND 
In the absence of long-term national social funding programs, ""the American Rescue Plan becomes an even more important vehicle for poverty alleviation,"" Berube said.
Some cities late last year began to use ARP funds to set up cash payment programs for low-income residents, but without longer-term funding, it is unclear how these can be sustained.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said he views the money as a complement to Biden's social investment agenda, not a substitute. 
""They're both trying to address a similar set of challenges - a classic underinvestment in our human capital and the infrastructure that makes our communities run,"" Adeyemo told Reuters in an interview.
The ARP funding bridges a gap during COVID-19, but the administration will ""try to make longer-term investments that would deal with this challenge over time,"" he said.
NEW RULES, NEW SPENDING
Many local governments, particularly in smaller communities, had held off on committing funds due to lack of clarity on allowable spending and to see what they might get from Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure package and the social spending bill, said Vicki Vogel Hellenbrand, public sector practice leader at consulting group Baker Tilly.
""Based on our client base, unless they were going to spend the money on a pretty clear water project, people were waiting a little bit to see the final rules,"" Hellenbrand said.
She said the new rules ease documentation burdens on smaller towns by granting them an automatic ""allowance"" of up to $10 million - often more than their entire allocation - that can be used for revenue replacement.
In Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, small businesses from barbershops to childcare providers are receiving ARP-funded grants from Northampton County.

Michelle Thorpe, owner of Above and Beyond Learning Center, said she put her $10,000 grant towards buying a van for trips to parks and libraries. She plans to start looking for a larger space later this year.
""I want to grow because there's only 19 kids here. I have plans and I have dreams,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved legislation providing $1.5 trillion to fund the federal government through Sept. 30 and to allocate $13.6 billion to aid Ukraine.
The 2,700-page bill passed in a bipartisan 68-31 vote, one day after the House of Representatives approved the package.
President Joe Biden is expected to sign the bill into law, averting agency shutdowns ahead of the midnight Friday deadline when existing U.S. government funds expire.
""We're keeping our promises to support Ukraine as they fight for their lives against the evil Vladimir Putin,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, referring to Russia's president who has orchestrated a massive attack against its neighbor.
The aid for Ukraine is designed to finance ammunition and other military supplies, as well as humanitarian support.
The legislation's passage follows months of negotiations over the federal government's funding and therefore policy priorities. 
It also comes as lawmakers jostle to show support of Ukraine in its battle against Russian forces, with Democrats and Republicans saying the Biden administration must do more to help Kyiv.
On Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters that this Ukraine aid package likely would be followed by additional measures to help Kyiv battle Russia and rebuild from the destruction brought by Moscow's attacks.
On Thursday, ahead of the vote, Republican senators called for the Biden administration to send Ukraine the fighter jets the country's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had requested. The Biden administration has argued that providing combat aircraft, even if they were being supplied by Poland, would dangerously escalate the conflict.
The House also approved a bill that banned imports of Russian oil and called for reviewing Russia's participation in some international trade programs, including the World Trade Organization. 
That measure's fate in the Senate was unclear. Biden is expected to call on Friday for an end of normal trade relations with Russia.
Besides providing money for ammunition and other military supplies and humanitarian aid for Ukrainians, the legislation funds regular U.S. military programs and an array of non-defense operations through Sept. 30, including money for infrastructure projects authorized by an earlier bipartisan package.
Senator Richard Shelby, the senior Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, applauded the spending bill for increasing defense spending by nearly $42 billion over last year to total $782 billion.
Without passage of this legislation by midnight Friday, federal agencies would have had to begin laying off workers and suspending government programs deemed non-essential.

The Senate also passed a stop-gap bill extending existing federal funding through Tuesday so that congressional clerks have the time they need to process the sprawling ""omnibus"" legislation -- a chore that could go beyond Friday's midnight deadline. 
That ensures no interruption in government services before Biden receives the omnibus bill from Congress for signing into law.

The German government's most recent forecasts from late January predicted growth of 3.6% this year, up from 2.9% last year.
The IAB also sees inflation rising to 7% amid soaring energy prices, compared with the government's January forecast for 3.3%.

""Especially low-income households should receive support for energy costs,"" Enzo Weber, one of the authors of the study, told Reuters.
If, however, imports of Russian gas, oil and coal were stopped, the hit to economic growth would double and inflation would rise to 10%, he said.

247,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 02:56AM ET</span>","A look at the day ahead in markets from Julien Ponthus.
European markets are about to start trading with news emerging that Western nations are set to ramp up sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine by revoking its ""most favoured nation"" trade status. 
The move, not yet official, paves the way to slap tariffs on a wide range of Russian goods and adds to the overnight pressure of Wall Street's Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) announcing an orderly retreat from the country.
While global markets experienced brief jitters of hope for a diplomatic solution to the crisis this week, the mood has taken a firm step into the pessimistic camp this morning.
The U.S. dollar just hit a new five-year top versus the yen after a strong U.S. inflation report, while the euro struggled to hold its own as a hawkish turn from the European Central Bank was offset by growth risks emanating from the Ukraine crisis. 
There are many assets through which investors seek to gauge the market stress triggered by the war in Ukraine, from oil and grains to stocks and bonds but the euro is increasingly seen as this crisis' ultimate 'fear index'.
Europe's biggest security crisis since 1945 has sent the common currency on a roller coaster which took it to its worst week since the COVID-19 crash and its biggest daily jump since 2016 last week.
On that front, some investors may be disappointed to read that EU leaders gathered in Versailles, west of Paris, are considering more spending over the war in Ukraine but not yet ready to mention any new joint debt issuance.
In the meantime, futures for European stock markets are pointing towards gains of about 1% at the open which won't make for the 1.7% lost yesterday.
Oil prices, which also tend to expose sentiment across trading floors, are stabilising this morning and were on track for their biggest weekly drops since November as hopes of bringing more supply to the market seem to overcome, at least temporarily, fears of escalating bans on Russian oil. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday:
Norway's Orkla exits Russia following Ukraine invasion
German harmonised inflation +5.5% y/y in February
UK economy rebounds strongly in January
China vehicle sales rise 19% in Feb

Japan business mood sinks, eclipses household spending boost as Ukraine risks grow
U.S. university of Michigan inflation expectations

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's decision to keep on tightening despite fear of war and stagflation has been criticised as either bluff or error - but may just reflect a deliberate shift in Europe's economic policy mix. 
The ECB On Thursday was the first of the 'Big Four' central banks to meet since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the related energy price explosion, with markets on tenterhooks as to whether inflation or growth implications would take precedence.
Many investors were instantly surprised it opted so clearly for the former, accelerating a wind down of its main bond buying programme through the third quarter of this year and goosing market bets on interest rate rises by the end of the year. 
ECB policy and inflation https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgpdwaeykvo/One.PNG 
Euro sovereign bond yields and euro FX https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egvbkqwdmpq/Three.PNG 
Money markets now discount almost 45bps of ECB rate rises by yearend - bringing its deeply negative deposit rate back close to zero for the first time in eight years - compared with about 30bp of hikes just prior to the meeting. And the prospect of less bond buying along with an end to negative interest rates was enough to jar euro government bonds and send long-term borrowing costs across the zone surging.
The ECB's cover for its hawkish tilt was revised forecasts showing inflation back above its 2% target next year - a higher landing point from this year's record 5.1%. 
And yet it set the scene with loud caveats about Ukraine and sky-high energy prices that also saw it cut this year's growth forecast by half a point to 3.7% and providing an ""alternative"" worst-case scenario. ECB chief Christine Lagarde talked of ""huge"" uncertainty and stressed ""maximum optionality"" and ""maximum agility and flexibility.""
And this is where investors guessed a bluff of sorts.
Fidelity International's Anna Stupnytska insisted the energy shock around Ukraine could push the euro zone into recession in the second half of the year and market pricing was way off. 
""We do not expect the ECB to hike rates this year, despite change in market pricing,"" she said. ""The risk is skewed towards more QE, not less, especially if gas supplies from Russia to Europe are disrupted going forward.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management's Gurpreet Gill also doubted a 2022 rate hike, saying the prospects were ""limited.""
Others chimed in that there was a high chance this week's plan would be reversed.
""At a minimum, war-related uncertainty will ensure the ECB proceeds cautiously and gradually,"" Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI)'s Silvia Dall'Angelo said. ""In the worst-case scenario, it is possible the ECB will have to resort to a new emergency package of measures and delay lift off.""
NEEDLE AND COMPASS
The prospect of a climbdown reminded many of former ECB chief Jean Claude Trichet's two quickly reversed attempts to raise interest rates in the middle the 2008 banking crash and again as the euro sovereign debt crisis raged in 2011. His repeated excuse back then was that the ECB had a singular inflation focus and mandate.
""To be unkind, there was a whiff of Trichet's 'there is only one needle in our compass' in the actions today, a line that has become associated with central bank obstinance and ultimately policy error,"" Janus Henderson Investors' Andrew Mulliner said.
""Understanding precisely what the ECB were trying to achieve today, if not tighter monetary conditions, is a challenge.""
GAM Investments' Charles Hepworth was just as critical. ""It all feels like a déjà vu sense of continual policy mistakes by the ECB,"" he said
And yet many more sympathise with the plight of central bankers caught between a rock and a hard place right now, facing an unenviable mix of war and stagflation ahead.
""Make no mistake, if the conflict is prolonged and elevated energy prices weigh heavily on household consumptions and confidence, the ECB will find it immensely tough to raise rates this year,"" Principal Global Investors' Seema Shah said. ""Who would want to be a central banker in this situation?""
But for all the investor doubts, Reuters sources say that only a handful of the ECB's governing council were against ending the asset purchase scheme by the end of Q3.
What some suspect is that faced with the twin shock of energy-spurred inflation and demand destruction, European Union governments on an ""economic war"" footing and their main central bank will end up splitting the policy challenge more evenly than they over the past 12 years.
With inflation absent for so many years and Germany insisting on a tight rein on euro budgets through sovereign debt crises a decade ago, cyclical demand and credit management was left almost entirely to the ECB.
But as inflation returns, exaggerated by the oil and gas squeeze around Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the ECB may now see its main job as normalising monetary policy while governments more readily foot the bill to ease the pain on household incomes. 
And this week's EU summit in Versailles provides the counter punch to this week's ECB move. 
""It looks like the fiscal levers available at both the EU and national levels will have to do the heavy lifting in response to negative and possibly worsening consequences of the war in Ukraine,"" Dall'Angelo at Federated Hermes said.

The problem is that by emphasising a hard end to new asset purchases rather than the rise in policy rates ahead, the ECB has spooked the very bond markets needed to finance that fiscal offset. Who'd be a central banker indeed.

BERN (Reuters) - While the rest of Europe grapples with surging prices, in Switzerland inflation is so tame that some key costs are actually falling.
The price of healthcare - a big chunk of Swiss household budgets - dropped by 0.5% on the year in February, when overall inflation hit 2.2%. That was the highest inflation rate since 2008, but still only a fraction of the levels other industrialised countries face.
A combination of factors lies behind Switzerland's modest price pressures: consumers demanding better deals, an energy mix that leaves the country less exposed than others to soaring oil and gas costs, wage restraint, and some protection against import price inflation from the strong franc.
Certainly, part of the reason for low Swiss inflation is because the cost of living here is already so high.
""One of the aspects of Switzerland is that we tend to have high prices in practically everything when you compare it with our neighbours in Europe,"" said Nannette Hechler-Fayd'herbe, global head of economics & research at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Savvy Swiss consumers have found some workarounds.
An hour's drive from Zurich, just across the border into Germany, a cottage industry of 'delivery address' firms has sprung up, charging Swiss customers a small fee to hold goods they order at bargain German prices and later collect.
""People come here because they can buy at favourable prices,"" said entrepreneur Mandy Klein, a German who started her delivery address business from home in 2009 and now runs two depots in the picturesque lakeside German border town of Constance.
The brisk delivery trade in Constance shows Swiss households' drive to reduce their living costs wherever possible. Even so, Eurostat figures show the price level for household consumption expenditure was still 60% higher in Switzerland in 2020 than the euro area average.
The upshot is that consumer groups, fed up of Switzerland being a ""high-price island"", have lobbied for political action which resulted in two legislative changes from the beginning of this year to give households a better deal.
The first toughened up Switzerland's cartel law to impede businesses from marking up their prices for the Swiss market.
The second measure banned so-called geo-blocking, used by retailers to prevent online shoppers from buying cheaper products or services from sites abroad by, for example, diverting them to Swiss websites.
Prisca Birrer-Heimo, a lawmaker of the centre-left Social Democrats who co-led a 'fair price initiative' demanding reform, has seen an impact already.
""There is still potential, but we have noticed the enormous price differences are no longer as big as they were,"" she told Reuters.
MONEY SPINNER
Characteristics specific to Swiss markets, and the weight of certain key items in the consumer price index (CPI), also help explain why inflation is so low in Switzerland.
Healthcare, for example, which is provided by private firms, accounts for 17% of the CPI index, compared to 7% in the United States and 5% in Germany, OECD data show. The government has prodded health insurance companies to trim premia.
""This has been an area, which instead of creating inflation and price increases, has rather seen the contrary out of political pressure,"" said Hechler-Fayd'herbe at Credit Suisse.
Thanks to Switzerland's lakes, rivers and mountainous geology, hydropower accounts for around 57% of the country's energy production, the federal energy office says, leaving the Swiss far less exposed than others to spiralling oil and gas prices.
The resulting efficiencies mean energy makes up just 5% of the Swiss CPI basket, OECD data show, compared to 7% in the United States and 10% in Germany, where consumers are far more exposed to rising fossil fuel prices.
""Our best guess is that (average) inflation in 2022 in Switzerland is running at 1.8%, although the recent surge in oil prices raise the risk of a somewhat higher rate,"" said Hechler-Fayd'herbe at Credit Suisse. ""For 2023, we think inflation will average 1.0%.""
With wages already higher than in nearly all other European countries, there is less pressure for raises. Telecoms operator Swisscom is increasing salaries by just 0.9% this year.
The strong franc also helps. Seen as a safe haven, the franc this month briefly rose above parity with the euro and hit a seven-year high.
The currency's purchasing power gives Switzerland some protection against higher import costs and feeds into the stable domestic price environment, giving exporters an opportunity to gain an edge over foreign rivals facing higher inflation.

Jean-Philippe Kohl, vice director and head of economic policy at electrical and mechanical engineering industry group Swissmem, said half of the sector's exports go to the euro zone, where inflation is running close to 6%.
""Sooner or later, a Swiss company that manufactures a product here and sells it in the euro zone will be able to sell it at a higher price ... so you profit from it,"" he said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday he is confident of hitting this year's economic growth target, despite headwinds including the war in Ukraine, pledging to provide more policy support during a politically sensitive year.
Li, who confirmed that he is in the final year of his premiership, kicked off the annual session of parliament last Saturday by setting a growth goal of around 5.5%, which many economists say is ambitious given challenges including a property downturn, COVID-19 flare-ups and an uncertain global recovery.
""China's economy will be able to overcome the difficulties and achieve major full-year economic and social goals and tasks, and lay a solid foundation for the development of the country in the future,"" Li told a news conference after the close of the parliamentary session.
China rarely misses its economic growth target, but many economists believe the 2022 goal will require additional stimulus to ward off a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy that could undermine job creation.
""To achieve growth of around 5.5% ... will not be easy, and there must be corresponding macro policy support,"" Li said.
This year, stability is the priority in China, with President Xi Jinping poised to secure a precedent-breaking third term during a once-in-five-years Communist Party congress in the autumn. 
China's strong recovery from its pandemic-induced slump lost momentum in the middle of last year, weighed down by debt problems in the property market and anti-coronavirus measures that hit consumer confidence and spending.
Li, who will step down when his second five-year term expires in March, acknowledged renewed downward risks and challenges facing the economy which will require policy support, including tax and fee cuts for businesses. 
""China still has many problems to solve such as climate change, income disparity and debt, and all these issues need be forcefully dealt with over the medium and long term, including this year,"" he said.
China has set a target of creating more than 11 million new urban jobs this year, but Li said 13 million would be preferable, citing the need to create jobs for new college graduates and migrant workers.
""China set its 2022 growth target at the upper band of forecast range due to concerns about job stability and financial risks,"" said Tommy Xie, China economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore, adding that China usually hits the target.
""They need to work extra hard this time,"" he said in a note.
Li said China will also ramp up tax rebates for companies if current ones yield good results.
Li has said tax cuts and tax rebates will total around 2.5 trillion yuan ($395.22 billion) this year.

To spur growth, the central bank has cut interest rates and banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR), with more easing steps expected.

""This is the last year I will be premier,"" Li told a news conference. 
President Xi Jinping is expected to secure a precedent-breaking third term as party chief at a party meeting this autumn to elect leaders for the next five years.

253,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 09:10PM ET</span>",,,,,,"VERSAILLES, France (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday the war in Ukraine will require joint EU investments which may lead to a new bout of joint debt, but added he would prefer to talk about the goals first rather than what is needed to get there.
Some countries such as France and Italy want new jointly-issued EU debt to help cushion the shift from Russian energy imports, the impact of sanctions imposed on Moscow and the push for more independence from global food and microchip suppliers.
But Germany, the Netherlands and others strongly oppose such a move, saying there is plenty of still unused money in the EU's 800 billion euro pandemic recovery fund that the bloc is already jointly borrowing.
Asked whether EU leaders would launch a second EU recovery fund, Macron said he'd rather talk about the goals first rather than the tools to reach them. ""That's always been my way of doing things. It helps lift taboos and blockages,"" he told reporters ahead of an EU summit at the Palace of Versailles near Paris.
Macron had to win over former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the so-called ""Frugals"" group of fiscally conservative EU countries in 2020 to launch the first EU recovery fund and its unprecedented joint debt package.
""We will need a strategy for joint European investments. We've started that with the recovery plan of the summer of 2020. It's still useable in parts, by the way,"" Macron added.
""But depending on the goals we set ourselves, we'll need to decide whether to transform it, take new decisions. I don't want to preempt it,"" he said. 
However, Macron said EU leaders faced a historic moment that will call for historic decisions.

""Europe has changed in the face of the pandemic. It is going to change even more and faster in the face of war,"" he said.
Macron also said leaders will be giving the European Commission a mandate to draw up means to protect households from rising prices, adding that several technical proposals were in the works and could be finalised by the end of the month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending rose in January but the business mood sank in the first quarter as rising raw material costs squeezed corporate margins, leaving the country's resource-poor economy facing a hard grind ahead.
The results add pressure on policymakers to ramp up fiscal stimulus to support Japan's economy, which is likely to have stalled in the current quarter and faces fresh risks from soaring fuel prices blamed on the Ukraine crisis.
""While infection numbers are gradually falling, service consumption hasn't fully resumed. This heightens the chance Japan's economy contracted in January-March,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Households may keep their purse strings tight given the surge in energy costs and rising prices of daily necessities."" 
Household spending rose 6.9% in January from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, more than a median market forecast for a 3.6% gain. It followed a 0.2% drop in December.
The increase was largely due to the base effect of a slump in January last year, when COVID-19 state of emergency curbs were imposed.
Looser curbs to deal with a spike in new Omicron coronavirus variant cases remain in place in some areas of Japan, weighing on household spending.
UKRAINE RISKS
A separate government survey showed Japan's business sentiment sank in the first quarter with sectors vulnerable to rising raw material costs, such as food and transportation, taking a hit.
An index gauging big companies' sentiment stood at -7.5% in the current quarter, compared with a reading of +9.6 in the October-December period, the survey showed. It was the first negative reading in three quarters.
Small- and medium-sized companies' moods also soured in the first quarter, the data showed.
Japan's heavy reliance on imports for fuel and commodity makes its economy vulnerable to a rise in raw material costs, which has accelerated in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February.
Wholesale inflation hit a record 9.3% in February and analysts expect core consumer inflation to head near the Bank of Japan's 2% target from April, threatening to choke already weak consumer and business spending.
Some lawmakers are beginning to call for another spending package to cushion the blow from rising energy costs, with one opposition party executive proposing a package sized around 10 trillion yen ($86 billion).
Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Friday the government was not considering compiling a fresh stimulus package as it focuses on passing the fiscal 2022 budget through parliament.

Japan's economic growth likely ground to a near halt or may have contracted in January-March, a Reuters poll showed, as COVID-19 curbs and supply chain disruptions hurt consumption and factory output.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will stop pumping money into financial markets this summer, it said on Thursday, paving the way for an increase in interest rates as soaring inflation outweighs concerns about the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
With price growth in the euro zone at a record high even before Moscow began its assault on Feb. 24, the ECB was under pressure to at least stop adding fuel to the fire through its long-running asset-purchase programme. 
While a handful of policy doves at Thursday's meeting argued the war justified a pause for thought, they were outnumbered as worries about inflation, which hit a record 5.8% in February and is seen rising further, dominated the debate. [nL5N2VD6J3]
ECB President Christine Lagarde said the conflict was a ""watershed for Europe"", which would curb growth but boost inflation.
""The Russia-Ukraine war will have a material impact on economic activity and inflation through higher energy and commodity prices, the disruption of international commerce and weaker confidence,"" she said at a news conference.
But the waning impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy, improved labour market conditions and the prospect of an easing of supply chain bottlenecks all showed the euro area was in fundamentally healthy shape, Lagarde added.
While the bank announced modest growth downgrades for this year and next, it ramped up inflation forecasts more strongly and now expected price growth of 5.1% this year, 2.1% next year and 1.9% in 2024.
This fulfils the only outstanding condition that the ECB has set for its first rate hike in over a decade, namely that inflation is seen stable at its 2% target.
""Since the ECB now sees its inflation target effectively achieved, it is likely to raise its key interest rate twice this year, by 25 basis points each time,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG)'s chief economist, Joerg Kraemer, said.
Indeed investors ratcheted up their bets on rate hikes after the ECB's decision and now expect it to increase its rate on deposits by nearly 50 bps by the end of the year.
This would take it back to zero after eight years in which banks were charged for parking their idle cash at the ECB. 
WRAPPING UP 
The bank confirmed plans to wrap up its 1.85 trillion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme at the end of the month and said purchases under the older and stricter Asset Purchase Programme (APP) will be smaller than previously planned. 
It now expects APP purchases to total 40 billion euros in April, 30 billion euros in May and 20 billion euros in June. Previously it had set purchases at 40 billion euros in the second quarter, 30 billion euros in the third quarter and 20 billion euros in the fourth.
Bond buys in the third quarter will be ""data-dependent"", the ECB said, adding that the schedule could still be revised if the inflation outlook changes.
It said any adjustments in interest rates would take place ""some time"" after the end of asset buys, a change from the previous formulation that purchases would end ""shortly before"" a rate move. 
""Obviously 'some time after' is an open time horizon which is data dependent,"" Lagarde said, when asked repeatedly what that meant for the timing of a first rate hike.
In a Reuters poll, nearly two-thirds of respondents said the APP would be shut by end-September, with nearly half saying it would be in that month.
Yet the move still came as a surprise to many investors, who expected the ECB to make as few commitments as possible, keeping options open until there is more clarity about the war.
But ECB staff forecasts published on Thursday showed that even in a severe scenario where stricter sanctions are imposed on Russia, euro zone inflation would come in at 1.9% in 2024. 
""Contrary to the ECB staff, we can think of several adverse scenarios under which more ECB support will be needed,"" Pictet's strategist, Frederik Ducrozet, said.
The euro quickly firmed on the ECB decision, seen as a modest victory for conservative policymakers, and bond yields rallied. 
Ten-year German yields rose about 7 basis points on the decision while the euro was trading at 1.108 versus 1.104 before the decision.

Markets now see around 43 bps worth of interest rate hikes this year, up from around 30 bps predicted before the meeting.
""All in all, today's decisions are a good compromise, keeping maximum flexibility in a very gradual normalisation of monetary policy,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. ""A first rate hike before the end of the year is still possible.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The gusher of money the U.S. government poured into family bank accounts during the coronavirus pandemic, credited with speeding the rebound from the health crisis, may now help limit the economic damage from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and give the Federal Reserve more leeway in raising interest rates.
As analysts have begun parsing what sky-high oil prices and new uncertainty might mean, a common theme has emerged: U.S. consumers may get gouged at the gas pump but will likely be able to maintain much of their expected spending on other goods and services due to savings accumulated out of COVID-19 pandemic spending programs that have totaled about $5 trillion.
The war in Ukraine is a shock, they note, but one the United States may have unintentionally insured itself against.
""Household savings could help consumers maintain spending volumes in the face of related price increases,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Daniel Silver wrote this week, noting that each 10% increase in oil prices would cost consumers an additional $23 billion each year.
Households ""have accumulated about $2.6 trillion of 'excess saving' in recent years relative to the pre-pandemic trend, which all else equal could be enough to cover even a sustained 50% surge in oil and natural gas prices for many years to come,"" Silver wrote. 
Graphic: Oxford Economics Recovery Index : https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/OXFORDINDEX/jznvnyedlpl/chart.png 
U.S. consumer price data released on Thursday showed the pace of annual price increases jumped to 7.9% last month from 7.5% in January. The increase was driven by energy and food costs, but still did not reflect the brunt of commodity price increases seen in the two weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine.
The month-to-month pace of price increases among some key goods declined, a development Fed officials have been hoping for as they look for signs that overall inflation would begin to moderate. 
But given the uncertainty flowing from the conflict in Ukraine, the U.S. central bank is likely to keep a wary eye on inflation. Between the higher cost of oil and a consumer price index rising at the fastest pace since the early 1980s, investors now expect the Fed will raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by 1.75 percentage points this year. That would mean a quarter-percentage-point increase at each of its seven remaining policy meetings in 2022. The next meeting is March 15-16.
""The Ukraine/Russia conflict threatens to disrupt the Fed’s tightening plans this year,"" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. ""But ... The Fed cannot afford to wait and see how financial conditions respond to the geopolitical conflict."" 
The United States and its Western allies responded to the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine with punishing sanctions on Russia, the world's largest exporter of oil and oil products combined, adding to the updraft in oil prices. The price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude briefly hit $130 a barrel, from around $92 before the conflict, and was trading at $111 on Thursday.
The average U.S. price for regular unleaded gasoline has hit a record $4.25 a gallon, though that is about $1 a gallon below the inflation-adjusted peak.
While that indicates inflation likely has further to climb, it's less clear what it will mean both for the Fed, as it debates how fast to raise interest rates, and for the U.S. economy as it emerges from the pandemic.
Some prior oil shocks, such as the one in the 1970s, were associated with more persistent inflation that prompted the U.S. central bank to react with aggressive rate increases. Others, such as the brief spike during the Gulf War in the early 1990s, came alongside Fed rate cuts because underlying inflation was expected to ease.
SIGNS OF SUBSTITUTION, NOT PULLBACK
The U.S. economy may have some room to give. Growth entering the year was strong, and even if high oil prices slow things, the outcome for the year is still likely to be solid - not the weak growth and rising prices of a true ""stagflation.""
""The U.S. has become less sensitive to energy shocks,"" with a steady decline in the share of income spent on energy, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) economists wrote in a note. ""With Omicron cases fading, the reopening of the service sector has resumed ... Excess savings built up over the last two years can fund this rebound."" 
Graphic: Energy's share of U.S. consumer spending: https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/USA-CONSUMPTION/jnvwebrqwvw/chart.png 
Research on past oil shocks offers a sense of what to expect. Even as gas prices rise, fuel consumption and driving tend to remain steady, partly out of necessity - the daily commute, driving on the job, or family chores - as well as choice. 
Household budgets then adapt. One 2008 study of periods when gas prices were high found increased bargain shopping at grocery stores and substitution into cheaper brands.
One possible bellwether of such a move: Shares of discount retail chain  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG) have risen about 9% since the Ukraine war began, outpacing the broader market.
Nik Modi, a tobacco and household products analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said there was already evidence in late February before the invasion that smokers were trading down to cheaper cigarettes, a trend he expects to continue as gas prices rise. Pump prices had risen nearly 30 cents a gallon from the start of the year to when Russia invaded. They're up another 70 cents since.
Yet high frequency restaurant and travel data so far shows little evidence of consumers pulling back.
PANDEMIC BEHAVIOR CHANGES
Corporate officials who might otherwise expect fallout from higher gas prices said they were hopeful this time will be different.
Some studies have found rising gas prices cause families to at least delay larger purchases, but ""the effect of that might be somewhat more muted in this environment than maybe it has historically,"" David Denton, the chief financial officer of home improvement chain Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) Cos Inc's, said at the UBS Global Consumer and Retail conference on Wednesday.
""In the past, when gas prices have gone up, demand in this sector has kind of gone down a little bit,"" Denton said, but working from home in particular may have insulated consumers who previously commuted to work.
Other pandemic dynamics may also play out. Public transit use remains depressed but could be an acceptable option for former riders as COVID-19 infections decrease. Credit card balances are lower, giving financial space to consumers intent on spending now that social life has resumed more fully.
In addition, economists and officials have noted that higher oil prices now have some potential upside in the United States, with the hit to consumers offset by rising employment and investment in domestic energy production.
""Oil prices would need to rise much further from here to seriously threaten the consumer recovery,"" wrote Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics. ""For the broader economy, any hit to consumption should be mostly offset by greater investment in shale production.""

Pearce said there may even be some unintended benefits for the Fed. If rising gas prices do curb consumer demand for some goods and services, it could ease inflation by bringing demand closer in line with available supply. 
""To the extent this means domestic demand is weaker, we should be seeing less upward pressure on wages and services prices,"" Pearce said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan's wager that Turkey could ride out an inflation and currency shock with low rates and reserves has all but collapsed, after the fallout from the war in Ukraine left the economy uniquely vulnerable to soaring energy prices. 
Turkey's gas import bill alone is expected to jump to $40 billion this year, twice its estimated cost last year, a government official and two industry consultants told Reuters. 
That price tag dwarfs Turkey's $18 billion in net official foreign reserves, and it is only compounded by oil and grains https://tmsnrt.rs/3KqtOjM prices that have spiked as Russia's invasion of Ukraine entered a third week, bringing sanctions on Moscow and fallout for the global economy. 
Economists are now ratcheting up forecasts of a big current account deficit and as high as 70% annual inflation this spring as the beleaguered Turkish lira slides toward 15 to the dollar - about half its value this time last year.
For the big emerging market economy that imports almost all its energy needs, it is a second straight shock after Erdogan's own push for interest rate cuts triggered a currency crisis in December that sent inflation to 54% and rocked households. 
His government managed to stabilise the lira and regain some confidence in January with a combination of costly market interventions and deposit protections. But that ended when the invasion began, and the lira has since tumbled 6%. 
""The government is working on some relief measures, including tax relief, but the effects may be limited because fallout from the war is being felt... especially on inflation,"" said the official, requesting anonymity. 
Erdogan's office did not immediately comment on how it would address the energy shock and whether it upends existing economic policy. Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati said the government was determined to fight rising prices as a priority and monitoring risks from the conflict.
According to interviews with four Turkish officials, authorities have grown more alarmed each day that the war's repercussions mount that the unorthodox policy regime Erdogan adopted in the autumn is flailing. 
With a tight election looming, the president was betting that slashing rates to 14% would stoke exports and generate enough foreign income, including from tourism, to reverse chronic trade deficits. That in turn was expected to stabilise the lira and eventually cool inflation.
But that seems unlikely now, especially given Turkey's heavy reliance on Russian energy, trade and holidaymakers. 
""What we have seen strikes at the heart of Turkey's new economic model. Balancing the current account was at its crux, but now that is all but impossible this year,"" said Roger Kelly, lead regional economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 
""Fallout from Ukraine is... particularly bad for Turkey given it was attempting to control inflation without hiking rates,"" a policy that might be reconsidered, he added. ""Authorities have few remaining options and have to let the lira depreciate somewhat, but not so much that it hurts confidence.""
OUTSIDE SHOCK
Turkey is the only NATO member to oppose sanctions on Russia, even as it called the invasion unacceptable, and hosted on Thursday the first meeting of Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers since the conflict began. 
Erdogan's long-held aversion to high rates and influence over monetary policy has pushed Turkey's real yields to a gaping negative 40%, a red flag for investors and savers given the central bank's net reserves touched a two-decade low in January. 
The trade deficit soared to $18 billion in the first two months of the year, driven by a 212% jump to $17 billion in energy imports. The acceleration came after a year in which energy costs had already risen by 75% from 2020. 
Long-term contracts with Russia and other suppliers that expired and didn't fully roll over meant that BOTAS, the state importer, had to buy more expensive gas from spot markets, said Gokhan Yardim, partner of ATG gas consultancy. 
Turkey releases spot imports with a two month lag, but Refinitiv tanker data shows they have held steady in March. The central bank sold record hard currencies to BOTAS last month to cover its shortfalls.
Oil prices meanwhile shot to $130 a barrel this week, double their December low, straining Turkey's trade deficit that typically grows by $5 billion for every $10 rise in crude. Oil costs have risen more in lira than in most other emerging market currencies. 
A second Turkish official said deficit spending was likely the best way to relieve pressure on inflation and the currency. 
""The energy import costs have already breached government targets and price hikes are hitting inflation expectations,"" the official said. ""We may perhaps broach a supplementary budget. We need to hold the exchange rate steady."" 
Any lira depreciation potentially eats into public finances and central bank reserves after Ankara introduced a deposit-protection scheme in December that has attracted 550 billion lira ($37 billion). 
The government still forecasts the $15 billion current account deficit to deteriorate only slightly to $18.6 billion this year, whereas the latest Reuters poll sees it at $29 billion. 

""We are caught in one of the worst crisis with a fragile economy,"" Hakan Kara, former central bank chief economist, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""We are not at war, but we are bombarded on five sides: Foreign trade, tourism, risk premium, energy and food prices.""

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's tight COVID-19 bubble was once globally lauded but for local business, the strict border controls increasingly feel like a straitjacket as a lack on foreign workers and tourists squeezes the island nation's economy.
Meat processors have cut production, grapes are withering on vines and a dearth of international visitors has some tourism operators worried they will have to close shop by the time borders reopen later this year.
New Zealand's swift response to the pandemic, including the strict border controls, kept the country largely COVID-19 free until the end of last year, winning Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government strong praise at home and abroad.
But public anger over sustained domestic restrictions has since grown, reaching a climax last month during violent protests outside the nation's legislature in Wellington.
A closely watched poll on Thursday showed support for Ardern's Labour Party at its lowest since 2017.
That frustration has also broadened to the business community, who want the government to expedite its borders reopening.
""The government has done an exceptional job of getting us to where we are but people are tired and just want to get on with it,"" said Jude Cathcart, who runs a bike tour company, The Jollie Biker, in New Zealand's South Island.
Prior to the border closures, around 40% of Cathcart's customers were from Australia and she is keen to have them back.
Under a plan announced before the Omicron variant became widespread, a staggered easing of border controls would only see New Zealand fully open to vaccinated travelers in October.
But with Omicron now rampant in the community, business and agriculture see little value in staying shut off from the rest of the world and have increased calls to speed up the reopening.
""The situation is getting dire (for the tourist sector),"" said Lynda Keene, chief executive of the Tourism Export Council of New Zealand, saying while restrictions were once right, the world had moved on.
New Zealand now averages 20,000 cases a day, out of a population of 5 million.
While the infection rate has jumped, hospitalisations and deaths are still remarkably low by global standards.
Since the start of the pandemic, the country has reported 208,000 infections and fewer than a hundred deaths.
New Zealand derives much of its economic income from agriculture and tourism and the lack of foreign labour is a particular headache for those in the seafood, viticulture and horticulture sectors.
Sirma Karapeeva, chief executive for the Meat Industry Association, said abattoirs had already been facing labour shortages because they couldn't bring in staff from the Pacific Islands or the Middle East. New local COVID-19 outbreaks are now adding to those labour headaches with infected staff having to isolate.
""They can't source more labour,"" she said. ""They're having to work at lower capacity.""
EARLY RELAXATION?
Chris Hipkins, New Zealand's COVID-19 response minister, said on Wednesday he expected a decision would be made by the end of the month about easing border restrictions.
The closure of border isolation facilities -– used for returning citizens and residents –- will start in April as vaccinated New Zealanders are now only required to isolate at home.
More broadly, the challenges of COVID-19 in the community are starting to hit the economy, through supply-chain breakdowns, staff being forced into isolation and worried consumers. 
Logistical challenges, reduced food manufacturing capability and businesses having to take on more staff and pay for those off sick are adding to inflation pressures.

Electronic card spending in February fell 7.8% from January and consumer confidence has fallen to below its trough during the 2008 global financial crisis.
""It's the shock factor that you are likely going to get COVID in the next 12 months,"" said ANZ chief economist for New Zealand Sharon Zollner.

Republicans last month blocked a vote on the full Fed slate over objections to Raskin, a former Fed governor and Biden's pick to be the central bank's vice chair for supervision.
They worry Raskin would use her position to police climate change and make it harder for oil and gas companies to access credit. They have also raised questions about her actions as a director for a financial firm in 2017. 
Senator Pat Toomey, the panel's top Republican, says he would support a vote on the other four nominees, but not Raskin.
""If they’re willing to move four out of five? Take it and run with it. It’s a win,"" Manchin told Politico. Though Manchin is not on the Senate Banking Committee, his is a critical vote in the evenly divided Senate. 
The panel's chair, Sherrod Brown, and the White House are adamant that the five remain a package deal. 
""We believe all five nominees are eminently qualified and should be given an opportunity to be voted through the committee, where we ... absolutely have the votes,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters on Thursday.
""Republicans are just not showing up to get quorum for ... that vote to move forward,"" she told a briefing.
The nominees include Fed chief Jerome Powell, who was renominated for another four-year term and has bipartisan support. 

Next week he is expected to announce the first of what will likely be a series of interest rates hikes to battle high inflation.
""Newly released economic data makes it crystal clear: Republicans need to do their jobs and vote on these critical nominees so that we can tackle inflation and address our global economic uncertainty,"" a Brown spokesperson said.

Investing.com -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday that the Russia-Ukraine war is expected to add to the pace of red-hot inflation next month, but indicated she is confident in the Federal Reserve's ability to curb inflation and deliver a soft landing that would see the U.S. avoid a recession.  
""Inflation is a problem and it's one that we need to address but I don't expect a recession in the United States,"" Yellen said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday.  
The former Fed chair also said that she is expected the central bank will be able to bring down inflation without overshooting on monetary policy tightening, which has historically played a role in bringing about a recession. ""I think it's appropriate for them to take action, but a soft landing is what I expect,"" the Treasury Secretary said. 
The comments arrived just as investor focus on the Fed, ahead of the central bank's meeting next week, has intensified following data showing that inflation remains at its highest pace since 1982.
“The risk is that the inflation we are enduring now could become more entrenched, as it did in the 1970s. That is why the Fed is so wedded to raising rates starting in March,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
Inflation is set to remain red-hot as impact of the Russia-Ukraine war will boost the price of key commodities including oil, wheat and precious metals. 
""My guess is that next month we'll see further evidence of an impact on U.S. inflation as a result of Putin's war on Ukraine,"" Yellen said. ""[W]e're likely to see another year, in which 12 month inflation numbers remain very uncomfortably high.""
The Federal Reserve is expected to increase its benchmark rate for the first time in more than three years at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Mar. 15-16."

(Reuters) - A surge in U.S. retail gasoline prices to record highs has prompted governors and lawmakers in several states to consider slashing their fuel taxes and to ramp up pressure on the federal government to do the same.
The push reflects worries in state governments that the rapid spike in fuel costs could hurt motorists and chill local economies, and that federal efforts to keep prices down so far have been insufficient.
""Today I am announcing that, at this time of global uncertainty, we are working on an emergency suspension of the gas tax to help with the pain at the pump,"" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, said on Thursday in a Tweet. The state has a 36.9 cent per gallon gas tax.
Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, said earlier this week he was working with legislators to suspend the state's roughly 29 cent per gallon tax, citing ""a total failure of leadership in Washington"" to curb fuel prices.
Governors and lawmakers in California, Florida, Maine, Michigan, New York, Tennessee and elsewhere are making similar moves. Meanwhile, a coalition of six Democratic governors – from Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and Wisconsin – sent a letter this week to U.S. congressional leaders, asking them to support a bill to lift the nation’s 18.4 cent per gallon federal tax.
“Money saved at the pump translates into dollars back in consumers’ pockets for groceries, childcare, rent, and more,” they wrote.
U.S. consumer prices surged in February, culminating in the largest annual increase in 40 years, and inflation is poised to accelerate further in the months ahead.
Pump prices struck $4.38 on average nationwide on Thursday, according to motorist group AAA, driven in part by rising global demand and the disruption of Russian oil supplies since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, which announced a ban on Russian oil imports this week, has attempted to curb rising consumer energy prices by orchestrating the release of crude oil stockpiles from emergency reserves in concert with other consumer nations.
The White House has said it is studying additional moves to blunt the impact on U.S. fuel consumers, and administration officials have called on domestic and foreign energy producers to drill more oil quickly to stabilize the market.
Taxes, however, make up a significant chunk of prices at the pumps. They include the 18.4 cent federal gas tax, along with state and local levies that can vary broadly from below 10 cents to nearly 60 cents per gallon.
State and local governments collected a combined $52 billion in revenue from motor fuel taxes in 2019, according to the Urban Institute. Most of that money is diverted to transportation spending, including for road, bus and metro systems.
Florida lawmakers agreed on Wednesday to suspend the state's roughly 27-cent gasoline tax starting in October.
Michigan's legislature, meanwhile, announced its plans to vote on a six-month suspension of the state's 27.2 cent a gallon fuel tax. Michigan's Senate Majority leader Mike Shirkey, a Republican, estimated that the move would save drivers about $750 million. 

In New York, state lawmakers from both parties are calling for a suspension of the state's 48 cent per gallon gas tax. Governor Kathy Hochul said Monday she is speaking with her budget office about the potential budget impact.
California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, meanwhile, said Tuesday that his administration was developing a proposal to offer Californians a tax rebate to help cover the rising costs of fuel.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The war in Ukraine and massive sanctions against Russia have triggered a contraction in global trade, sending food and energy prices sharply higher and forcing the International Monetary Fund to lower its global growth forecast next month, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday.
The global lender had already lowered its economic forecasts for the United States, China and the global economy in January, citing risks linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, supply disruptions and U.S. monetary tightening.
At the time, it projected global economic growth would reach 4.4% this year, a downgrade of 0.5 percentage point.
Georgieva told reporters the unprecedented sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine had caused an abrupt contraction of the Russian economy and it faced a ""deep recession"" this year. She said a default by Russia on its debt was no longer seen as ""improbable.""
The chief economist of the World Bank told Reuters this week that both Russia and Belarus were squarely in ""default territory.""
Georgieva gave no detailed forecast for Russia or the global economy. The IMF is due to release its updated World Economic Outlook in mid-April.
In a separate interview with CNBC, Georgieva said the fund still expected ""a positive trajectory"" for the world economy, but said the duration of the war would play a crucial role in determining growth and the future of multilateral cooperation.
The IMF's executive board on Wednesday approved $1.4 billion in emergency financing for Ukraine to help meet urgent spending needs and mitigate the economic impact of the invasion.
Georgieva told reporters on Thursday that the IMF was preparing to present a ""funding mechanism"" that would allow others to help Ukraine, but gave no details.
She told CNBC that she expected mounting pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine given the spillover effects it is having on economies around the world, including China.
She said she had spoken on Wednesday with a Chinese central bank official who expressed great concern about the loss of human life and suffering in Ukraine.
""I wouldn't be surprised if we actually see a bit more pressure on Russia to stop the war, because of the spillover it has on ... all economies,"" she said.
Georgieva told reporters that China had more policy space to cushion the impact of the war, but it might find it hard to achieve its target growth rate of 5.5%.
She said the IMF had no program or policy relations with Russia at this point and its Moscow office was not operating. Members have condemned the war, which Russia calls a special military operation, but there has been no discussion about ending Russia's membership in the global lender.
Georgieva added that it was ""highly, highly, highly improbable"" that Russia would be able to find a central bank to exchange its IMF Special Drawing Rights into currencies.

She said the surge in inflation triggered by the war meant monetary tightening already underway in many countries would ""go faster and go further"" than expected.
It would also have serious consequences for Latin America, the Caribbean, some Middle Eastern countries like Egypt and many countries in Africa.

Argentina agreed on a 30-month extended fund facility (EFF) with the IMF late last week, replacing a failed 2018 program, which pushes repayments back until 2026-2034. It needs approval from the IMF board and Argentina's Congress.
""This is a matter for the Argentineans, but if they asked for my opinion, I would say that they accept the payment extension,"" Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference.

Defaulting on its debt would not ""help Argentina or the rest of the world's economies,"" said Lopez Obrador, an ally of Argentine President Alberto Fernandez.
""Honorable people know you received a bankrupt country because of your predecessor's irresponsible decision for Argentina to take on unlimited debt in complicity with foreign governments and financial organizations,"" Lopez Obrador said, reading from a letter addressed to Fernandez and dated March 5.

265,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 03:51PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - The rouble ticked up in both Moscow and international FX markets on Thursday after the first formal talks between Russia and Ukraine's foreign ministers, even though the meeting made no progress on a ceasefire.
The currency has lost as much as 50% of its value to the dollar this year, crippled by international sanctions after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month.
The rouble closed at 118.5 per dollar in Moscow or up 1.3% from the close on Wednesday, still down 36.5% from mid February. It hit a record intraday low of 121.5275 on the Moscow Exchange used by major Russian banks.
Against the euro the rouble closed at 125 in Moscow, up 1.6% for the session, after hitting a record intraday low of 132.4175. It is down 32.4% year to date.
In international markets bids were indicated at 127.75 to the dollar and 140.4 to the euro, slightly stronger on the day.
""We've had a bit of a reversal today, but that needs to be put in the context of everything going on and volumes are so much lighter that we don't read too much into that,"" said Christian Lawrence, senior market strategist at Rabobank.
The local stock market remains shut, as does bond trading.
Talks in Turkey on Thursday between top Ukrainian and Russian diplomats Dmytro Kuleba and Sergei Lavrov yielded little progress.
Kuleba said there had been no promise of a ceasefire to allow aid to reach civilians while Lavrov accused the West of inflaming the situation by providing weapons to Ukraine.
The impact of economic sanctions on Russia has weighed heavily on the value of Russian assets in global financial markets.
""There is a pretty wide spread between (Moscow Exchange) pricing and what you would see in the West, so that gives you very little confidence about the level,"" TD Securities' Head of Emerging Markets Strategy Cristian Maggio said. 
There were also more global sanctions and restrictions on Thursday.
Britain imposed sanctions on another list of wealthy Russians including Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, while the Bank for International Settlements - the main global central bank umbrella group - suspended Russia's central bank from all its meetings and services.
Markets are also keeping a close eye on debt repayments due, with the looming spectre of Russia defaulting on $40 billion of external bonds. It would be its first major such default since the years following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia will service its external obligations in roubles if foreign exchange accounts of the central bank and the government remain blocked by the western sanctions, according to Russia's TASS news agency.
But 5-year credit default swaps, the cost to insure exposure to Russia's sovereign debt, touched a record high of 3,176 basis points.

IFR reported that Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft paid back a bond in U.S. dollars on Wednesday while Norilsk Nickel, the world's biggest nickel and palladium producer, also made a payment on a U.S. dollar bond, according to sources.
Moscow must make $107 million in coupon payments on two hard-currency sovereign bonds on March 16.

266,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 03:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- As sanctioned Russian oligarchs’ assets are detained or frozen around the world, many free ports—vast warehouses used by the super-rich to store art and valuables, tax-free—have stayed largely below the radar, at least for now.
Might that change if the sanctions ring continues to tighten? “I assume [questions] will come eventually,” says Fritz Dietl, president and founder of Delaware Freeport LLC, who says he has yet to be contacted by law enforcement agencies of any kind regarding assets potentially owned by sanctioned Russians. “But when it comes, and if it comes through the proper channels, then we’ll answer the authorities.”
Free ports are not new. Ports Francs et Entrepôts de Genève, known both as Geneva Freeport and Free Port, is the world’s biggest; it capitalized on Switzerland’s neutrality to distribute Red Cross parcels to prisoners of war across Europe during World War II.
Such warehouses, often adjacent to rail lines or airports where goods are treated as not yet having been imported into the host country, really came into their own with the emergence of a globe-trotting elite in the jet age. Their numbers began to proliferate in the past decade as the art market boomed and wealthy collectors sought to cut the tax bills they pay to move their masterpieces around the globe. 
But for years, mentioning free ports in a conversation conjured up images of havens where shady transactions might occur away from the prying eyes of customs police. In reality, free ports are entirely legal ways to offer wealthy collectors a legitimate way to avoid paying duplicate import duties. “Most of our clients use free ports,” says Philip Hoffman, chief executive officer of Fine Art Group, an art advisory and investment company. “After they purchase something, they’ll send it to the free port in whichever jurisdiction suits them.”
A classic example might be a globe-trotting American art collector who bought a $20 million Picasso at Art Basel in Switzerland. The canvas might then be shipped to Geneva’s cavernous free port to save hundreds of thousands of dollars in import duties; once the collector has set up an appropriately attractive tax environment (that pied-à-terre in Rome might be a cheaper place to hang the painting than the apartment in New York), transport will be arranged to its final destination.
“Many of my clients have five houses,” Hoffman says, “so they’re thinking, ‘Where do I put this?’ There can be huge tax advantages of moving it out of New York or London, and you have to take it somewhere.”
Tarnished Reputation
A series of scandals involving stolen art—and even looted antiquities from the war in Syria—that turned up in Geneva’s free port has dented these warehouses’ reputations. The Swiss government, under pressure to strengthen governing rules, has tightened some, but significant loopholes remain. Swiss citizens can store art or other valuables for no more than 12 months inside, but foreigners face no time limit.
When asked if they’d been contacted by law enforcement, a receptionist at Geneva’s free port relayed the question to its director, who didn’t have an immediate response.Philippe Dauvergne, chief executive officer at the Luxembourg High Security Hub (until 2020 known as Le Freeport) says that anti-money laundering laws prohibit him from saying whether he’s been contacted by law enforcement.“I am convinced there will be checks,” he says, “and that’s very good.”
In Luxembourg, “all the objects that arrive here have to comply with anti-money laundering rules, regardless of their value,” says Dauvergne. Space is rented to a small number of licensed tenants, all previously checked by Luxembourg customs; they, in turn, rent out their space to private clients.
“The economic beneficiary is automatically known by these tenants,"" Dauvergne continues, ""and they, in turn, are in direct contact with the financial intelligence unit'' of Luxembourg.
In Switzerland and the U.S., disclosure of beneficial ownership (the name of the ultimate, physical owner), is not required. An owner can be a holding company or other legal entity, providing opportunity for a sanctioned individual to hide behind a shell company. So, while many shippers and free ports say they require a driver’s license or passport on file for whoever is authorized to move the artwork, that identification could, in theory, be that of a U.S. representative for an offshore corporation that is ultimately controlled by a sanctioned individual.
“An authorized signatory for a closely held company is exactly that: a shadow director who’s just paid to sign documents,” says Rena Neville, a founder of the art market anti-money laundering consultant Corinth Consulting. “Free ports know who signed for the storage, but they don’t know who’s owning or controlling the entity.”
It’s a concern raised by the U.S. Treasury Department in a study published last month on money laundering and terror financing through the art world.
“Shell companies can be used as financial conduits for the transfer and holding of funds and assets, allowing the ultimate natural person owner(s) to avoid giving their names to dealers who may screen for sanctions risk,” the report reads.
Nowhere to Go
Several experts say Russians sanctioned in response to the invasion of Ukraine are unlikely to take fresh advantage of free ports.
“Presumably, a person who’s hit the sanctions list would want to move their art out of harm's way,” says Thomas Danziger, a New York-based art lawyer who’s also a financial partner in Delaware Freeport. “But anyone who helps that kind of move, if it’s prohibited, would be crazy to be involved in it. You’re not going to get a shipper to help move the work, you’re not going to get a lawyer to help with the transaction; no insurance company will engage.” So, he continues, “you can probably take a minivan yourself and drive the art into the countryside, but that’s about it.”
Free ports, he adds, don’t make princely sums from storing priceless artworks. “They’re not getting millions to store a Monet, they’re getting paid a couple hundred bucks a month,” he says. “Why would they possibly risk criminal and civil penalties?”
There is, however, a high likelihood that Russians who already have work in storage will leave it, rather than attempt to move or sell it. “If you’re in a Swiss free port at the moment, I would absolutely not go anywhere near it,” says Neville. “Because it’s unlikely in your name. It’s a Secret Company LLC, owned by another Secret Company LLC, so no one’s going to know who it is.”
And unless an artwork is highly discounted, there aren’t usually collectors lining up to buy it from a sanctioned individual. “It’s not that easy to sell art in a week,” says Hoffman. “I know you can discount it very quickly and so on—and no doubt there will be one or two people thinking along those lines—but we haven’t seen anything like that or been made aware of it.”
Likely Targets
Instead, movement into free ports might appeal to individuals not yet on the sanctions list but who consider themselves likely targets. Their art, safely inside a tax-free warehouse in a country they’re not associated with, has a much higher likelihood of staying untouched. “The logical instinct—and self-preservation instinct—is to take anything that’s not stuck in an EU or U.K. jurisdiction and get it inside of a free port or a home” says Neville. 
Swiss customs said it cannot say “for tactical reasons” if it’s noticed an uptick in customs filings of valuables since Russia invaded Ukraine. Dietl, of Delaware Freeport, says he has no clients on the sanctions list and “less than a handful of clients with Russian-sounding names.”
Insiders are girding themselves for change. 
“I think it’s about to emerge from being a theoretical to a tangible problem,” says Nicholas O’Donnell, editor of the Art Law Report and a partner at Sullivan & Worcester LLP in Boston. This means that lawyers will have to be increasingly vigilant when representing clients in art deals.
“We’d be foolish not to have our guard up about the counterparty and who it might be,” says O’Donnell. “With the landscape of sanctions changing so rapidly, that person you do a deal with now may be on a sanctions list two weeks from now.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may be setting the stage for more gains in the dollar, upending investor expectations for a weaker greenback as geopolitical uncertainty and worries over European growth raise the U.S. currency’s appeal. 
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index, has surged 3% year-to-date to its highest level in 21 months, buoyed in part by investors seeking shelter from market volatility that has hammered stocks across the globe and fueled wild swings in commodity prices. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
How much further it runs may depend on the paths taken by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank in their efforts to normalize monetary policy. While investors are betting the Fed will likely push through several rate increases this year to fight surging inflation, many believe the ECB faces a tougher slog, with soaring raw materials prices posing a greater threat to Europe’s energy-dependent economy. 
Bets on a widening gap in yields between the U.S. and euro zone have helped drag the euro near its lowest level against the dollar in more than two years. The currency was down 0.8% against the dollar Thursday afternoon despite a surprisingly hawkish shift from the ECB at its monetary policy meeting.
""The view at the start of the year that the euro would appreciate after a couple of months of dollar strength has taken a bit of a setback,"" said Bipan Rai, North American head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.
The recent price action in the two currencies runs counter to what many investors had expected earlier this year, after a hawkish pivot Fed rhetoric helped the dollar rise 6.3% in 2021. Strategists polled by Reuters at the end of January broadly expected the dollar to tread water, while forecasting that the euro would rise by 1.5% over the next 12 months. 
""Everything that created that bullish case for the euro earlier this year now creates a very bearish case,"" said Eric Leve, chief investment officer at wealth and investment management firm Bailard. 
While Leve had started the year expecting the euro to strengthen at the dollar’s expense, he has now trimmed exposure to European equities and is looking to hedge euro currency risk.
A sustained rise in the dollar could have broad implications for markets and the U.S. economy. Though a strong currency tends to weigh on the profits of domestic exporters, it could also help the Fed tame inflation, which recently logged its largest annual increase in 40 years. Conversely, a weaker euro could exacerbate already high consumer prices in the euro zone. 
Markets are pricing the fed funds rate to rise by more than 165 basis points in the U.S. this year, starting with a widely anticipated increase at next week’s Fed meeting. ECB rate hike expectations firmed on Thursday, with markets pricing around 43 basis points' worth of interest rate hikes this year. 
The ECB on Thursday said it would end asset purchases in the third quarter and ramped up inflation forecasts, but also pared its growth outlook. 
Analysts at Nuveen said earlier this month that a Brent crude price of $120 per barrel would sap two percentage points from growth off the euro zone, compared to one percentage point from the United States, due in part to the country's greater domestic energy supply and lower taxes. 
""There is much more fear on this side of the pond, and I think that's going to reflect itself in the ECB,"" Aashish Vyas, investment director at Resonanz Capital, a Frankfurt-based hedge fund investment advisor. 
Robin Brooks, chief economist at Institute of International Finance, wrote earlier this week that the euro can fall below $1.00 as markets adjust to ""a major adverse shock to the euro zone."" The currency recently traded at $1.0987. 
Some believe dollar strength will moderate later this year.
Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), believes the Fed will deliver less rate hikes than expected and the war in Ukraine will ebb, leaving the euro at 
$1.14 by year-end.

But in the near term, there may be a little bit more pain for the euro, said Paresh Upadhyaya, director of fixed income and currency strategy at Amundi US. 
""Just north of parity is probably the trough in the euro,"" said Upadhyaya, who is maintaining a short euro position for now.

268,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 12:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. household net worth jumped to a fresh record in the fourth quarter on rising stock prices and higher home values.
Household net worth increased by $5.3 trillion, or 3.7%, after a more moderate gain in the third quarter, a Federal Reserve report showed Thursday. The fourth-quarter advance pushed net worth to more than $150 trillion.
The value of real estate held by households rose by $1.5 trillion and the value of equity holdings climbed $2.5 trillion.
While the omicron variant and related surge in Covid-19 infections dented economic activity in the final weeks of 2021, there was little effect on wealth in the quarter as the S&P 500 rose to new highs. More recently, stocks have slid on concerns about the economic impact from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Meantime, mortgage rates have risen to levels not seen since 2019, which could eventually lead to a cooling in the rapid price gains seen in the housing market. 
In an effort to tame inflation, the Fed next week is expected to raise interest rates for the first time since 2018.
Not everyone has benefited from the surge in home and equity prices. Survey data indicate just a little more than half of Americans own stocks, and millions of Americans rent. Separate data out Thursday showed rent of primary residence climbed in February by the most since 1987.
While pandemic aid programs like the advance child tax credit payments have since ended, elevated savings remain a key source of support for household spending. Net private savings grew at an annualized pace of $2.4 trillion in the fourth quarter, though the pace has been settling back since the start of 2021. 
Business debt outstanding increased at an annualized rate of $1.2 trillion from the prior quarter in the October-December period to a total of $18.5 trillion.
Federal debt rose at an annualized rate of 10.8% to $25.3 trillion. Government debt has surged over the past two years amid trillions of dollars in federal aid to workers, businesses and local governments during the pandemic.
Consumer credit outstanding not including mortgage debt rose an annualized $302 billion in the fourth quarter.

(Reuters) - The Russian government has banned exports of cars, airplanes and drones until the end of this year, the Russian TASS news agency said on Thursday.

The figures, coupled with a hot labor market, indicated Americans were in relatively healthy shape ahead of the war, which has caused the cost of commodities to surge at a time when U.S. inflation is already at a 40-year high.
Still, with real earnings lagging inflation and uncertainty on how long the jump in energy and other costs will last, it remains to be seen how much spending will be impacted. The report does not reflect the breakdown of gains by income, with lower-income households typically spending more of their income on gasoline and food.
Gasoline prices in the last week surged by the most in nearly 17 years, with consumers paying on average more than $4 for a gallon of unleaded gasoline. The costs of other goods like food are set to move higher as well given that Russia and Ukraine export more than a quarter of the world's wheat and Ukraine is a major corn exporter.
The household financial data, which covers the period from last October through December, showed that the majority of the increase in wealth came from a rise in the value of equities, which grew $2.5 trillion during a period when the S&P 500 index increased about 11%.
The still-booming housing market, which has been soaring since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, also contributed heavily. Real estate values added around $1.5 trillion to overall wealth. 
Household net worth was also upwardly revised to $145.0 trillion for the third quarter of 2021.
U.S. consumers overall have accumulated around $2.6 trillion in so-called excess savings in recent years compared to the pre-pandemic trend, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Daniel Silver noted earlier this week, in large part helped by $5 trillion in government aid packages over the past two years.
That aid was designed to blunt the impact of the pandemic on businesses and consumers and included more generous unemployment benefits and stimulus checks paid directly to people's bank accounts. Both programs ended last year.
The amount held in household savings deposits rose to $11.1 trillion in the fourth quarter from $10.7 trillion at the end of the third quarter. Balances in checking accounts increased to $4.1 trillion from $3.7 trillion in the third quarter, the report showed.

Elsewhere in the report, household debt rose at an 8.0% annual rate in the fourth quarter, from an unrevised 6.2% growth rate in the third quarter of the year.
Liquid assets held by non-financial firms were $7.1 trillion versus $6.9 trillion in the July-September period.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday that financial sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine were limiting China's ability to buy Russian oil, and Beijing was not ""meaningfully offsetting or lessening"" sanctions pressure on Moscow.
""My sense is that financial institutions in China that do business in dollars and in euros are worried about the impact of sanctions,"" Yellen said in a Washington Post Live interview.
Yellen said Russia was now experiencing a ""severe"" economic contraction because of the sanctions and while she declined to offer a specific forecast for Russian output, she said in the longer term, U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductors and other technologies will have a negative effect on Russian growth, ""degrading Russia's ability to project power and continue to threaten its neighbors.""

The U.S. Treasury was continuing to add names of Russian elites to its sanctions and asset freeze lists, and is working with Western allies to consider further sanctions, Yellen said.
But she said she would not expect most European allies to match the Biden administration's decision to ban all Russian oil imports, because they have fewer alternative sources of supply. The United States, as a net oil exporter, is less dependent on Russian energy, she said.

273,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 12:01PM ET</span>","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Russia's economy will contract in 2022 by some 15% due to the severity of sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine, and the rise in commodity prices will be both a tail- and a headwind across emerging markets, according to an analysis from the Institute of International Finance.
The IIF cut its 2022 GDP growth expectation for Russia by 18 percentage points, previously having had a 3% growth estimate.
""Further escalation of the war may bring more boycotts of Russian energy, which would drastically impair Russia's ability to import goods and services, deepening the recession,"" said the IIF in a note signed by a group of its economists.
The expectation is for the economic contraction to be twice as sharp as the Russian recession during the global financial crisis. 
However, said the note, given Russia’s relatively small economy and its own moves to isolate from global financial markets, the IIF does not expect a broad emerging market contagion.
""Instead, we think Eastern and Western Europe will be hit via their export exposure to Russia, something markets are only just beginning to price.""
Latin America would emerge largely unaffected, while the effects on Africa and parts of Asia, including China, would be moderate. The direct impact varies depending on each countries' exposure to commodity prices either as an importer or exporter. 
""Latin America stands to gain from improving terms of trade among its many commodity exporters,"" said the IIF note. 
""Meanwhile, adverse spillovers should hit mostly Eastern Europe via trade and importers of commodities via higher oil and wheat prices, with Turkey and Egypt in focus.""

Of note, Turkey stands out with oil prices a sharp negative for the energy importer. A barrel of oil has risen this year from around $78 to $114 in London markets.
""Every $10 rise in oil prices widens Turkey’s current account deficit in 2022 by 0.3 percentage points, raising its dependence on foreign capital inflows at a time when global risk appetite is unsettled,"" said the IIF.

(Reuters) - Euro zone sovereign bond yields soared and the euro dipped on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it plans to end its bond buying programme in the third quarter in a surprise move.
Bond yields in Italy, a key beneficiary of the ECB's bond buying stimulus, surged over 20 basis points and German bond yields surged to three-week highs -- more than unwinding falls since Russia's Feb.24 invasion of Ukraine. 
Europe's single currency rose initially, but that proved short-lived, and stock markets remained deep in the red. 
The move came as a surprise as investors had not anticipated any big policy announcements given the uncertainty unleashed by the war in Ukraine. 
The ECB said purchases during the third quarter under the conventional Asset Purchase Programme (APP), would be smaller than previously planned and would end in the third quarter depending on economic data. 
The bank raised its inflation projections while cutting its growth outlook given the rise in commodity prices.
The ECB noted that adjustments in interest rates will take ""some time"" after bond purchases end and would be ""gradual."" 
Germany's two-year yield, sensitive to interest rate expectations, rose more than 17 bps to -0.35% as traders ramped up bets on ECB rate hikes. 
Germany's five-year bond yield turned positive for the first time since Feb 28, and 10-year yields rose as much as 10 bps to 0.30%, the highest since Feb 16. 
Euro zone money markets moved to price in 45 bps of ECB hikes by December, versus 35 bps before the ECB decision and brought forward bets on a first, 10 basis-point hike to July, compared with September before the decision. 
""The fact that tapering is proceeding apace is a sign that the bar is high for the ECB to put normalisation off,"" said Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING, adding that ECB forecasts are consistent with the bank's policy rate rising to 0% next year from -0.50% currently. 
SELLOFF
The most eye-popping moves were in Italy, where two-year yields were last up 21 bps at 0.19%. They had been as low as -0.05% earlier on Thursday.
The closely-watched gap between Italian and German 10-year yields, effectively the risk premium on Italian debt, rose to as high as 162 bps from around 150 bps before the meeting. 
""Rates are right to jump, and in particular in the periphery where the (spread) tightening seen since the start of the war in Ukraine was premised on delayed ECB normalisation,"" Bouvet said. 
""This assumption has been proven wrong, we’re back on a widening path.""
A key market gauge of long-term euro zone inflation expectations dropped sharply after the decision, to as low as 2.05% from nearly 2.16% earlier on Thursday. 
""For the time being (the ECB) are choosing to look through some of the uncertainty created by the war. The more immediate impact will be the rise on inflation and we could get inflation above 6%, which means the risks of entrenched inflation expectations,"" said Marchel Alexandrovich, European economist at Saltmarsh Economics. 

The euro rebounded more than half a percent after the ECB statement, but slipped back. It was last down 0.5% at $1.10. 
Euro zone stocks fell to fresh session lows following the ECB statement and were down 1.7%, while a gauge of the bloc's banking stocks was 2.25% lower.

Economic output fell by 4.6% during the first coronavirus crisis year 2020. It expanded by 2.9% last year, but contracted over the last three month of 2021 due to new restrictions to fight the pandemic and supply chain disruptions.

The index for rent of primary residence increased 0.6% in February from the prior month, the most since 1987, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday. It was part of an acceleration across the broader shelter category, which accounted for more than 40% of the monthly increase in an index of consumer prices excluding food and energy.
Rents, which have been in rising in the U.S. for the past year, are reported with a lag in the CPI report. That means they’ll contribute even more to inflation going forward, which already stood at a 40-year high in February. Prices are set to climb further as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupts supply chains and availability of key commodities including oil.
“There’s still further strength to be seen,” Sarah House, senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., said of rent prices. “We don’t expect that to peak until maybe the third quarter of this year.”
Rents are surging especially in major cities like New York and Atlanta where landlords are regaining bargaining power after the early days of the pandemic. Nationwide, they’re increasing at a more modest rate, but the jump is still painful for many Americans whose wage gains are failing to keep up with inflation.
The data also showed just how much more Americans are paying for basics like food and gasoline. Those items, along with shelter, drove price increases overall in February.

277,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 10:51AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Thursday that it was introducing restrictions on local firms' access to foreign-currency cash for the next six months, the latest step to preserve precious hard currency in the face of sanctions imposed over Ukraine.
During the period of restrictions from March 10 to Sept. 10, local companies and entrepreneurs who want U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds and euros in cash can receive only up to $5,000 worth and only to pay for overseas work trips.
The Bank of Russia, whose gold and foreign currency reserves were frozen under the sanctions, added in a statement on its website that the $5,000 limit could be increased in special circumstances in consultation with the regulator.
Firms and individual businesspeople can access other foreign currencies in cash, without limits.
Earlier this week the central bank imposed restrictions on citizens' ability to access foreign currency, saying they would not be allowed to withdraw more than $10,000 until Sept. 9 and that banks could not sell hard currency in cash.
The sanctions imposed over Russia's invasion of Ukraine two weeks ago have triggered the country's worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

The central bank more than doubled its main lending rate to 20% and has provided extra liquidity to banks to try to cushion the blow, but the rouble and Russian assets have tanked. 
The central bank has restricted local stock trading since Feb. 25, the day after the invasion, which Russia's authorities refer to as a ""special operation"" to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ukraine's top government economic adviser Oleg Ustenko said on Thursday that invading Russian forces have so far destroyed at least $100 billion worth of infrastructure, buildings and other physical assets.
Ustenko, chief economic adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told an online event hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics that the war has caused 50% of Ukrainian businesses to shut down completely, while the other half are operating at well below their capacity.
He said the damage estimate is ""very approximate"" and includes roads, bridges, hospitals, equipment and other assets.
Asked how such a reconstruction effort could be financed, Ustenko said part of it could come from Russian assets that are frozen throughout the world, including Russian central bank assets held outside the country and immobilized by Western sanctions. The seized assets of wealthy Russian oligarchs could also be transferred to a reconstruction fund, he added.
Asked about the resilience of Ukraine's financial system, and bank payment operations, Ustenko said: ""Look, we are doing, I would say, OK under the current circumstances.""
He said Ukraine's fiscal reserves are currently at about $27.5 billion, down from about $30 billion before the invasion.

Despite some pressure on the hryvnia currency, Ukrainians in areas not occupied by Russian forces are able to access cash via ATMs and supermarket cashiers without the long lines seen in the first two days of the war, and credit card and other electronic payment systems are working normally, he added.
""Even in those cities surrounded by now by the Russian army...(residents) are able use their cards,"" Ustenko said.

279,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 10:32AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - The European Central Bank said on Thursday it would end asset purchases in the third quarter, as soaring inflation outweighed concerns about Russia's invasion of Ukraine for now.
The move surprised some investors who had expected the ECB to keep options open until there was more clarity about the impact of the war on the economy. But President Christine Lagarde said rates would not rise until some time after bond buying ends.
HIGHLIGHTS-Lagarde comments at press conference
Euro zone bond yields jump, euro cedes gains
Here are some comments from analysts and investors:
PIET CHRISTIANSEN, CHIEF ANALYST, DANSKE BANK
""Time will tell whether it's a policy error, however the price stability mandate weighs very hard in the monetary policy decision here with market-based expectations above the 2% target for the coming 10 years.
""(Lagarde’s) assessment of a robust growth outlook on domestic demand must have been enough to continue this path towards neutral. With Lagarde, key focus is on data dependency, all meetings are live and to sum up the presser in three words: they never pre-commit.""
ANTOINE BOUVET, SENIOR RATES STRATEGIST, ING
""The fact that tapering is proceeding apace is a sign that the bar is high for the ECB to put normalisation off --1.9% inflation in 2024 is consistent with tapering and with the deposit rate being raised to 0% next year I would say.""
SILVIA DALL'ANGELO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, FEDERATED HERMES
""At a minimum, war-related uncertainty will ensure the ECB proceeds cautiously and gradually. In the worst-case scenario, it is possible the ECB will have to resort to a new emergency package of measures and delay lift off, although it looks like the fiscal levers available at both the EU and national levels will have to do the heavy lifting."" 
OLIVER BLACKBOURN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, JANUS HENDERSON
""The ECB defied expectations and leant hawkish into the inflation headwind blowing in its direction. 
""The announcement came just ahead of a U.S. inflation print of 7.9% year-on-year, and the ECB is clearly worried about similar headlines. Reducing and potentially ending quantitative easing is not the same as raising interest rates, yet the consequences might be more wide reaching than the ECB would like. 
""The collateral damage is already appearing in peripheral European sovereign credit spreads, with Italian yields jumping more than the German equivalents.""
GURPREET GILL, MACRO STRATEGIST, GOLDMAN SACHS ASSET MANAGEMENT
""Tightening in European financial conditions are likely to weigh on growth over the coming year. For these reasons and given President Lagarde’s commitment to preserve ""maximum optionality in the face of maximum uncertainty"", we continue to see the prospect of a rate hike in Europe this year as limited, in contrast to market-implied pricing. 
""Indeed, the ECB’s inflation forecasts imply annual price rises will moderate from 5.1% in 2022 to 1.8% in 2023, suggesting modest scope for rate hikes over the coming year.""
ADRIEN PICHOUD, CHIEF EUROPEAN ECONOMIST, SYZ BANK
""Today's announcements...are a way to create as much flexibility as possible for the ECB’s monetary policy in the months ahead. With such flexibility, the ECB will be able to maintain very accommodative conditions if the impact of the war in Ukraine requires it, and to tighten financing conditions if made necessary by inflation developments. 
""In the short run, those decisions ensure that financing conditions remain extremely accommodative for the euro area, thus continuing to support economic growth, especially in the current uncertain context.""
ARNE PETIMEZAS, SENIOR ANALYST, AFS GROUP
""Lagarde may be claiming maximum optionality and that today's adjustments aren't tightening, but the actual message is hawkish. And what Lagarde is really saying is: 'we're going to hike, unless inflation is not too bad or something really goes wrong in markets.' And with that, they are opening the door wide for a hike of 25 basis points in September. 
""I also think they are taking it too easy on the risks to economic growth as a result of the war. They should have highlighted that a bit more because the outcome is very uncertain and rather binary.""
ANNA STUPNYTSKA, GLOBAL MACRO ECONOMIST, FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL
""The ECB is facing a huge dilemma over the next few months.
""We think as the growth shock becomes more evident in the data over the next few weeks, ECB's focus will likely shift away from high inflation focus towards trying to limit economic and market distress as the invasion of Ukraine and its consequences ripple through the system. 
""We do not expect the ECB to hike rates this year and we believe the risk is skewed towards more QE, not less especially if gas supplies from Russia to Europe are disrupted going forward.""
MARCHEL ALEXANDROVICH, EUROPEAN ECONOMIST, SALTMARSH ECONOMICS, LONDON
""For the time being they are choosing to look through some of the uncertainty created by the war. The more immediate impact will be the rise in inflation and we could get inflation above 6%, which means the risks of entrenched inflation expectations.
CHRIS SCICLUNA, HEAD OF RESEARCH, DAIWA CAPITAL MARKETS
""The statement was more hawkish then markets had priced in, which is why we have had a significant widening of BTP spreads. 
""The ECB has also given itself more wiggle room by suggesting rates will not rise soon after asset purchases end.""
SEEMA SHAH, CHIEF STRATEGIST AT PRINCIPAL GLOBAL INVESTORS 

""A faster winding down of the asset purchase program will perhaps come as a surprise to market participants who expected an ECB capitulation in the face of weaker growth forecasts. Yet, with inflation still drastically above their target, it is important that the ECB retains an air of unwavering commitment to price stability. 
""However, make no mistake, if the conflict is prolonged and elevated energy prices weigh heavily on household consumption and confidence, the ECB will find it immensely tough to raise rates this year.""

280,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 10:26AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russia sought on Thursday to retaliate against Western sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine by banning exports of certain goods and agricultural commodities.
Exporting telecom, medical, auto, agricultural, electrical and tech equipment, as well as some forestry products, will be banned until the end of 2022.
""These measures are a logical response to those imposed against Russia and are aimed at ensuring uninterrupted functioning of key sectors of the economy,"" the economy ministry said.
Further measures could include restricting foreign ships from entering Russian ports and allowing Russian airlines to register jets leased from Western firms as their own property, the government said.
Interfax news agency cited a source familiar with legislation being prepared as saying Russia may temporarily ban grain exports to a group of ex-Soviet countries forming part of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) from March 15 to August 31, as well as sugar exports outside the EEU area.
The measures come after Western sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine that threaten to cripple Russia's energy-dependent economy. 
Western companies have pulled out of Russia en masse as the United States, European Union and Britain imposed sanctions aimed at curbing Moscow's access to funding.

In response, a government commission on Wednesday approved the first step towards nationalising assets of foreign firms that leave the country.
The proposal to restrict foreign ships' entry into Russian ports comes after Britain last week banned from its ports all Russian-operated ships. The European Union has yet to provide clarity on the prospect of a similar ban by the bloc.

281,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 10:11AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's announcement on Thursday that it plans to end stimulus in the third quarter of 2022 shows that policymakers across the developed world remain laser-focused on inflation, rather than a potential growth hit from the Russia crisis.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has thrown a curve ball at central banks which were intent on dialling back post-pandemic stimulus, but are now watching oil prices soar to 14-years highs, dampening growth prospects.
But the ECB's hawkish surprise shows central banks plan to press ahead with rate-hike plans, though most concede events in Ukraine warrant caution. 
Here's a look at where policymakers stand on the path out of pandemic-era stimulus, ranked in terms of hawkishness.

1) NORWAY 
Norway started its rates lift-off in September and hiked its key rates again in December, to 0.5%.
Norges Bank is expected to hike again on March 24. Nordea expects four rate hikes this year. 
Graphic: Rates lift-off is underway: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjvqkoglnvx/RATES1003.PNG 
2) NEW ZEALAND 
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand last month raised its key rate by 25 basis points to 1% and forecast a higher peak in the tightening cycle. 
It has said more work needs to be done to control inflation and that it's too early to assess the impact, if any, of the Russian invasion on policy -- a reminder that the central bank is one of the most hawkish among developed countries.
Markets are confident of a 0.5% increase in April, and expect rates to hit 2.75% by year-end. 
Graphic: New Zealand's key rate rises to 1%: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgvomzwdevd/NZrates.PNG 
3) BRITAIN
The Bank of England meets next week and is seen raising rates by 25 bps to 0.75%, having kicked off its tightening cycle with hikes in December and February.
Inflation, exacerbated by surging oil prices, would normally encourage investors to bet on even tighter policy as policy makers try to show they are in control of the cost-of-living crisis.
But the BoE must weigh the commodity price spike against the likely hit to the economy from the Ukraine war -- markets no longer expect a 0.5% hike next Thursday. However, they still see rates rising to 2% by year-end. 
Graphic: UK inflation surge: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjeowwve/UKINFLATION.PNG 
4) UNITED STATES 
An aggressive half-point U.S. rate hike is off the table in March, given uncertainty stemming from the Ukraine conflict.
But Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell has pledged to ""carefully"" start raising rates. In other words, a 25 bps move at the March 16 meeting. 
Powell called Russia's invasion ""a game changer"" with unpredictable consequences, but stressed the Fed stands ready to move more aggressively if inflation does not cool as quickly as expected.

5) CANADA
On March 2, the Bank of Canada raised its key rate by a quarter point to 0.5%, the first rate rise since October 2018.
Global uncertainty is unlikely to sway it from its battle to contain inflation running at 30-year highs. BoC chief Tiff Macklem says there is ""considerable space"" left to hike rates this year and doesn't rule out a 50 bps move. 
GRAPHIC: Canada hikes interest rates: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwpkrlynnvm/CANADA0903.PNG 
6) AUSTRALIA
The Reserve Bank of Australia last week kept rates at a record low 0.1%, citing the Ukraine crisis as a new source of uncertainty.
After ending its bond-buying scheme last month, the RBA has pushed back against expectations for an early rate rise. Its dovish stance has been cemented by the war, even though the economy is growing faster than predicted. 
7) EURO ZONE 
The ECB plans to end asset purchases in the third quarter, accelerating its exit from extraordinary stimulus, as it predicted inflation to average 5.1% in 2022, more than double its target.
The Russia conflict is expected to have a ""material impact"" on economic activity, and the ECB noted that any interest rate adjustments will take place ""some time"" after the end of asset buys. They would be ""gradual"", it added. 
Markets price in 40 bps of tightening by year-end, equivalent to four, 10 bps hikes. 
Graphic: Russia's attack on Ukraine a headwind for Europe: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwvkrlqogpm/banks0803.PNG 
8) SWEDEN 
Sweden has pencilled in a rate hike only for late 2024 but minutes from the Riksbank's February meeting showed several policymakers dissented from this view. Deputy Governor Anna Breman was among those wanting to bring forward rate hikes. 
January core inflation at 2.5% undermined the argument that energy was the main driver of prices. The bank may agree in April to shrink the balance sheet this year and markets reckon rate rises will kick off well before 2024.
9) JAPAN
While spiking commodity prices may push inflation towards the Bank of Japan's 2% target in the coming months, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has ruled out tightening monetary policy to deal with any rise in inflation driven by soaring fuel costs.
The BOJ's dovish stance already makes it an outlier as more of its central bank peers eye rate rises. 
Graphic: Japan assets: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkplgakonvb/Japanassets.JPG 
10) SWITZERLAND 
The Swiss National Bank remains at the dovish end of the spectrum, seeing its stance as appropriate even with inflation hitting 2.2% in February, the highest since 2008.
Safety-seeking flows sparked by the Ukraine conflict have pushed the Swiss franc to its strongest levels against the euro since January 2015, when the SNB scrapped its currency peg. 

While franc strength helps contain inflation, the pace of the move is causing unease and the SNB on Monday made a rare verbal intervention about the franc.

Saade Chami also said the state's contribution to plugging the hole would be ""limited"" to ensure public debt sustainability, while a depositor contribution was inevitable, in reference to how the losses would be distributed in a financial recovery plan which the government has yet to agree.
Chami made the comments in remarks to an economic council on Wednesday, a copy of which he sent to Reuters. 
Lebanon has been mired in a devastating economic crisis since 2019, when the financial system collapsed under the weight of decades of state corruption, waste and mismanagement, paralysing the banking system.
Despite soaring poverty, Beirut has yet to come up with a financial recovery plan addressing the losses, or other steps seen as vital to plotting a path out of the crisis and making progress towards an IMF deal.
Agreeing how the losses should be distributed between the state, the banking sector and depositors is seen as one of the toughest issues: Prime Minister Najib Mikati last month called the recovery plan a ""Kamikaze operation"".
Chami said the government and IMF had agreed on the need to protect small depositors, but had not yet agreed on the ceiling for defining a small depositor. There were ""great difficulties"" in returning foreign currency deposits in full, he said. 
""The contribution of the state (in covering) the losses in the financial sector will be limited due to the necessity of ensuring public debt sustainability, likewise with the contribution of the central bank,"" Chami said.
Even if commercial banks lost all their capital of $12 billion, Chami said there must be a depositor contribution, and there were ""numerous formats"" for compensating depositors.
These included issuing government bonds, swapping deposits for bank shares, and the possibility of establishing a fund to manage state assets with part of the proceeds paid to depositors.

A draft plan seen by Reuters earlier this year proposed turning the bulk of $104 billion of hard currency deposits into local currency, with the financial hole covered mostly by depositor contributions. 
The plan was not approved by government.

""Any adjustment to the key ECB interest rates will take place some time after the end of our net purchases under the APP (Asset Purchase Programme) and will be gradual,"" Lagarde told a news conference.
""The path for the key ECB interest rates continues to be determined by the Governing Council's forward guidance and by its strategic commitment to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term.""
The bank said on Thursday it plans to end asset purchases in the third quarter, accelerating its exit from extraordinary stimulus in a surprise move, as soaring inflation outweighs concerns around Russia's shock invasion of Ukraine.
Markets are now pricing in around 43 basis points' worth of interest rate hikes this year, up from around 30 basis points predicted before the meeting.
On Wednesday, money markets had been pricing in a 30 basis point increase to the ECB's deposit rate by December, taking it to minus 0.2% from the current minus 0.5%. 
Investors have scaled back their bets on rate hikes since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. The conflict on the euro zone's eastern border is expected to slow growth and make the ECB more cautious about tightening its policy.
""The Governing Council expects the key ECB rates to remain at their present level until it sees inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of its projection horizon - and durably for the rest of the projection horizon,"" Lagarde said.
The ECB president had effectively opened the door to rate hikes at a Feb. 2 news conference by refusing to repeat her long-held view that such a move was ""very unlikely"" this year. 

The ECB pushed its deposit rate below zero in 2014, one of several aggressive measures taken to revive what was then sluggish price growth in the 19-country euro zone. 
The negative rate means banks are effectively charged for parking their idle cash at the ECB.

The ECB now sees inflation at more than twice its 2% target this year, with price growth holding above its objective next year too, ECB President Christine Lagarde told a news conference.
Inflation is seen averaging 5.1% this year, above the 3.2% predicted in December while in 2023, it is seen at 2.1%, above a previous forecast of 1.8%. 
The Russia-Ukraine war ""will have a material impact on economic activity and inflation through higher energy and commodity prices, the disruption of international commerce and weaker confidence,"" Lagarde warned. 
""The extent of these effects will depend on how the conflict evolves, on the impact of current sanctions, and on possible further measures.""
But she said the ECB Governing Council ""sees it as increasingly likely that inflation will stabilise at its 2% target over the medium term"".
As inflation exceeded the target in 2021, the projections suggest at least three years of overshoots, a reversal from the previous decade, when the bank struggled to rekindle anaemic price growth.
The ECB's projections have proved unreliable over the past year and policymakers have expressed doubts about the accuracy of its models as they failed to predict the spike in prices even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24. 
Sky-high commodity prices will be a drag on growth, however, holding back an economy which has barely recovered from a deep, pandemic-induced recession.

- A villa in Golfo del Pevero, on the island of Sardinia, worth approximately $19 million was seized by Italian authorities.
Suspended: 
- The $600 million Dilbar superyacht is sitting in a Hamburg shipyard with authorities saying they have no plans to deliver it to the owner.
- Everton F.C. suspended its $15 million plus naming rights deal with Usmanov's holding company USM. 
- Usmanov gave up his presidency of the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime, fencing's highest body, and said he would no longer play a role in the organisation.
- A Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) jet linked to Usmanov is one of a number of Russian planes reportedly stranded at the EuroPort airport, in the French Alsace, by Swiss airspace closures.
Sailing away:
- An Airbus A340 Prestige jet linked to Usmanov flew out of Munich, Germany to Tashkent, Uzbekistan on Feb. 28 and hasn't been tracked since, according to Radar Box data.
Softly, softly:
- The U.S. Treasury, while blocking Usmanov's personal assets, has left companies controlled by him off its list of sanctions in an effort not to raise the price of commodities.
ROMAN ABRAMOVICH
Roman Abramovich, 55, billionaire politician with an estimated $12.3 billion fortune was sanctioned by Britain on Thursday
Suspended:
- Abramovich's attempt to sell Chelsea Football Club was halted on Thursday when the British government announced its sanctions. Britain's asset freeze and sanctions bar the sale of players, new tickets and merchandise, but the team will be able to play matches. 
- British MP Chris Bryant had said Abramovich was trying to sell his 15-bedroom mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens to avoid sanctions. He bought the home in the area of London nicknamed ""Billionaire's row"" for 90 million pounds ($119 million) in 2011. 
- The Kensington home, along with other property and his stakes in steelmaker Evraz and Norilsk Nickel, is also subject to the British sanctions. It was not immediately clear if any assets had been seized.
Stranded:

OLEG DERIPASKA
Oleg Deripaska, 54, industrialist who founded aluminium giant Rusal was sanctioned by the United States in 2018 and added to a British sanction list on Thursday
Sanctioned:
- The fate of Deripaska's multi-million pound property portfolio in Britain remained unclear after the government said is assets would be frozen.
Swarmed, not seized:
- FBI agents raided a historic New York townhouse at 12 Gay Street, in Greenwich Village, and a Washington D.C. mansion connected to Deripaska in October. The tycoon responded on social media by saying nobody was living in those properties. 
- ""I have to ask: how much of Putin's money was found in those abandoned houses yesterday?"" he said, sarcastically inquiring whether investigators had discovered any mouldy jam or vodka in the cupboards.
- Through an LLC in the British Virgin Islands, Deripaska also owns a townhouse on 11 E. 64th Street, which he bought for $42.5 million in 2008, according to New York court records. 
- These properties have not been seized by the government, despite sanctions that prevent him from doing business or owning property in the United States. 
- Deripaska's British Virgin Islands holding company also owns 5 Belgrave Square in London. He bought the mansion in the exclusive Belgravia area for 25 million pounds ($33 million) in 2003, according to multiple media reports. 
Softened:
- U.S. sanctions were lifted against Rusal and its parent company En+ in 2019 when Deripaska reduced his stakes below a majority threshold to 44.95%. There are still concerns, however, that the Russian oligarch is pulling the strings of his business empire behind the scenes.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's sudden devaluation of the local currency and imposition of import limits on hundreds of items is likely to disrupt value chains and push up consumer prices that are already sky high, analysts and retailers warned. 
Sri Lanka's central bank earlier this week said it was fixing the upper limit on the rupee at 230 to the dollar, effectively devaluing it by almost 15%.
The finance ministry for its part on Wednesday limited imports of 367 non-essential items including fish, footwear, and wine and said only valid licence holders will be allowed to import these in limited quantities.
But experts and industry representatives cautioned that the steps - taken with the intent to boost exports, disincentivise imports and save foreign exchange for essential items like fuel and medicine - could inflict further pain on the economy. 
""More than 60% of imports are for value addition exports,"" an import sector representative told Reuters on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the issue. 
""It's been two years since the government started imposing import limits, but they haven't helped the economy. These limits only increase red tape, hamper trade and reduce government revenue.""
The government started imposing restrictions in March 2020 to prevent a drawdown on its foreign exchange reserves, which had fallen to a meagre $2.31 billion by the end of February this year with more than $4 billion in external debt repayments due during the remainder of 2022.
Devaluing the rupee, the Cabinet spokesman said, is expected to attract remittances while discouraging imports.
However, some complained the move came without adequate warning.
""The sudden floating of the rupee has caused mayhem,"" said Harpo Gooneratne of the Colombo City Restaurant Collective, warning increased costs will have to be passed onto consumers.
""Restaurants may not be able to bear the hit. Some are already looking at bulk ordering of items like flour, meat, butter and cheese but that is not sustainable.""

Gooneratne, who owns 10 restaurants in Colombo, warned import limits, including on cigars, beer and wine, could hit tourism, which the government has been aggressively promoting to boost foreign exchange earnings and economic recovery.
Sri Lanka's food inflation reached 25.7% in February, driven by higher global commodity prices and supply issues and analysts believe the moves by the government and central bank could have a further detrimental effect.

Investing.com -- The European Central Bank speeded up its plans to tighten monetary policy Thursday after admitting that the war in Ukraine would drive inflation higher and hit growth for the next couple of years. 
The Frankfurt-based central bank cut its growth forecasts through 2024, and now sees growth of only 3.7% this year, down from 4.2% previously. It sees inflation, meanwhile, at 5.1% this year, rather than the 3.2% it previously forecast. 
As a result, the ECB said that it will stick to its plans to end pandemic-driven bond purchases this month and phase out all of its asset purchases in the summer if inflation fails to come down fast enough. 
At her regular press conference, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the sharp rise in energy prices caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine is helping inflationary pressures to spread to a much broader cross-section of prices. She added that further increases in inflation - which hit a euro-era high of 5.8% in February - are likely in the near term.
As expected, the ECB said it will temporarily boost the bond purchases under its long-running Asset Purchase Program, which predates COVID-19, to 40 billion euros ($44 billion) in April, falling to 30 billion in May and 10 billion in June. That will cushion the impact of stimulus withdrawal. Thereafter, it said, ""the calibration of net purchases for the third quarter will be data-dependent and reflect its evolving assessment of the outlook.""
""If the incoming data support the expectation that the medium-term inflation outlook will not weaken even after the end of our net asset purchases, the Governing Council will conclude net purchases under the APP in the third quarter.""
Lagarde said in her press conference though that the new position didn't reflect an acceleration of the bank's tightening plans. She stressed the high level of uncertainty and stressed that the bank will continue to be guided by economic data.
The euro initially rose nearly a cent against the dollar on the news, which took a tougher line on inflation than expected. Many had expected the ECB to signal greater willingness to tolerate high inflation in the short term, given the uncertainty over the economic outlook caused by the war in Ukraine and the West's response to it.
However, Lagarde's subsequent comments led the euro to pare its gains. By 9 AM ET (1400 GMT), it was back at $1.1060, half a cent below its intraday high.
The ECB stuck by its previous guidance on its key interest rates, the main one of which remains at -0.5%.
Despite hints by Lagarde at her previous press conference that she was open to the possibility of raising rates later this year, the bank said after its policy-setting meeting that it still expects rates “to remain at their present levels” until it’s confident that inflation can stay durably around its target level of 2% in the medium term. Under the ECB's new forecasts, which take into account the possible impacts from the Ukraine war, inflation will fall to 2.1% next year and 1.9% in 2024.
""Welcome to 'team stagflation',"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski via Twitter, noting Lagarde's comments that risks to growth were now skewed to the downside, while those to inflation were skewed to the upside.
""The bottom line is that inflation worries dominate,"" said Pictet Asset Management analyst Frederik Ducrozet via Twitter. ""Forget about the details, forget about changing the sequencing, the hawks want to stop QE when inflation is edging towards 7%.""
The news was badly received by Eurozone bond markets. The benchmark 10-year Italian bond yield rose 20 basis points to 1.90%, widening the spread over its German equivalent to 163 basis points. Analysts are concerned the end of asset purchases will put fresh stress on governments with the biggest debt loads.
The ECB's statement did contain some comfort, however, for other European central banks. The Frankfurt-based institution said it will extend existing euro swap lines with them until January 2023, providing an important backstop in the event of pressure on central European currencies that have come under particular pressure due to their proximity to Ukraine. That wasn't enough to stop the overall hawkish tone of the release from pushing the euro higher against the Polish zloty, the Romanian leu and the Hungarian forint, however. 
The euro had hit an all-time high against the Polish zloty earlier in the week amid fears for the Polish economy as a consequence of the conflict. That was despite another 25 basis-point increase in the National Bank of Poland's key rate to 3.5%."
291,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 06:56AM ET</span>","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's BGA trade association said on Thursday a survey of its members showed most expected an economic slowdown as a result of the Ukraine conflict, but that business nonetheless backed the government's sanctions against Russia.
Supply chain bottlenecks, which the conflict has aggravated, mean that some economists' forecasts from the beginning of the year for 3-4% economic growth in 2022 were ""waste paper"", BGA President Dirk Jandura said in a statement.
""Companies are holding the line and supporting the German government's stance in the sanctions against Russia,"" Jandura added. ""The current sanctions are also having an effect on us ... And nevertheless, the sanctions are right.""
Some 62% of several hundred BGA member firms surveyed expected a slowdown as a result of the conflict and 32% feared an interruption of the economic recovery, the association said.
Increased pressure on suppliers stemming from the conflict meant that a decline in inflation from around 5% could not be expected in the medium-term, Jandura said.
Although Russia accounted for only 3% of Germany's foreign trade, the impact of the Ukraine conflict is rippling through a globally networked economy with changes to flight routes, for example, leading to delayed and more expensive goods.
The BGA cited aluminium producers and the food trade as areas that could be affected by bottlenecks, along with toilet paper and kitchen roll, and chemical cleaning agents.
Transport problems were exacerbated by higher fuel costs and a shortage of Ukrainian truck drivers, it said.
Germany's BGL Federal Association for road haulage, logistics and waste disposal said the logistics sector in Europe was suffering from the loss of more than 100,000 Ukrainian truck drivers due to conscription orders.

To address record-high fuel prices, the BGL called for a crisis summit with the government and tax relief for the logistics sector.
""Companies are really desperate,"" said BGL chief Dirk Engelhardt. ""That's why we as an industry are calling for temporary support from the state.""

Investing.com -- Peace talks between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers break up without visible progress, ending the euphoria of Wednesday. The U.K. expands its sanctions list to include Roman Abramovich and Oleg Deripaska.  Aluminum prices rise sharply as Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) severs links with its joint venture partner Rusal. Oil prices are also up again. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announces a stock split and a big buyback. U.S. inflation is expected to hit a new 40-year high in February, while the European Central Bank concludes its regular policy meeting. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 10th March.
1. Peace talks break down without progress
Global market euphoria cooled as negotiations between the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia broke down without any notable progress after a mere two hours.
Ukraine’s Dmytro Kuleba emerged saying that Russia wanted its complete surrender, while Russia’s Sergey Lavrov said that Ukraine seemed to want meetings for the sake of having meetings. He added for good measure that “we didn’t attack Ukraine.” In response to the attack on a maternity unit in Mariupol, Lavrov said Russia had told the UN three days ago that it had been evacuated and taken over by Ukrainian military personnel. Ukraine says 3 people, including a six year-old chid, were killed by an airstrike on the building.
Elsewhere, the U.K. finally expanded its sanctions list to include oligarchs including Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, as well as Oleg Deripaska, former chief executive of aluminum giant Rusal (HK:0486). Rusal was hit a double blow as its joint venture Rio Tinto said it would no longer supply bauxite to a key refinery in Ireland. Aluminum Mini Futures rose over 5% in response.
2. U.S. inflation set to hit new 40-year high; House passes spending bill
U.S. inflation is expected to have hit 7.9% in February, a new 40-year high, with the promise of more to come, given the surge in energy and commodity prices so far this month. The data will be released at 8:30 AM ET along with weekly jobless claims numbers.
On Wednesday, the House of Representatives finally passed a $1.6 trillion bill that will keep the Federal Government funded for the rest of the year.
The Ukraine emergency and the desire to win bipartisan support meant a last-minute increase in defense spending from what was set to be its lowest (as a percentage of GDP) since World War 2, while a raft of spending lines related to pandemic issues was cut.
The package also earmarked $13.6 billion in financial aid for Ukraine.
3. ECB wrestles with stagflation problem
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will hold her regular press conference at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), after the bank’s latest policy-setting meeting.
The ECB is widely expected to stick to its previously announced intention of ending the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program this month, while increasing asset purchases under a different program to cushion the impact of stimulus withdrawal. More important will be any change to Lagarde’s guidance at the press conference, a month after she appeared to open the door to interest rate hikes by the end of the year.
The ECB is facing an increasing risk of stagflation, as record energy prices threaten to keep inflation above target for much longer than previously thought.
A European Union summit is also taking place at the same time. Reuters reported there was not enough support for a French plan to extend joint borrowing to cover future spending needs on defense and energy.
4. Stocks set to open lower; Amazon's buyback, Oracle earnings eyed.
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower, as the euphoria over prospects for a quick end to the war in Ukraine faded.
By 6:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 288 points, or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 0.9% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 1.2%. The three main cash indices had gained between 2% and 3.6% on Wednesday on the news of the Lavrov-Kuleba meeting.
Stocks in focus later are likely to include Amazon, which announced a $10 billion buyback and a 20-for-1 stock split after the close on Thursday, as well as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Ulta Beauty, which report after the close. Amazon's news softened the blow of fresh regulatory trouble with the Department of Justice
The exodus from Russia continued meanwhile, with Europe’s second-largest brewer Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) saying it would carve out its local operations into a separate company and stop selling its namesake brand. Japanese-owned fast-fashion giant Uniqlo also reversed course and said it will stop operations in Russia.
5. Oil rebounds as UAE rows back comments on output increase
Crude oil prices rose sharply again as the prospect of an early peace faded, and the United Arab Emirates appeared to backtrack on comments that it may break with the OPEC+ pact on production discipline.
Iraq’s Energy Minister also repeated his country’s adherence to the pact, which had been criticised for not raising output quickly enough to accommodate the recovery in global demand after the pandemic. U.S. inventories fell again last week as record high gasoline prices failed to make a noticeable dent in consumption.
By 6:25 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 3.4% at $112.40 a barrel, while Brent crude was up 4.3% at $115.89 a barrel.",,,,,

VERSAILLES, France (Reuters) - European Union leaders will prepare the ground on Friday for possible unexpected spending over the war in Ukraine, but will stop short of mentioning any new joint EU debt issuance, draft summit conclusions showed.
Leaders of the 27-nation EU meet in Versailles, near Paris, to discuss more defence spending after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv's bid to become an EU member and ways to make Europe strategically independent of global suppliers in energy, microchips and food.
Emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, which added a lot of public debt across the EU, governments had planned to gradually withdraw the emergency fiscal support that had been necessary to keep economies going during the lockdowns.
But Russia's invasion of Ukraine forced the EU to re-think that approach because of an expected sharp raise in spending on defence and on investment in renewable sources of energy to facilitate a shift away from Russian gas, oil and coal.
""Our national fiscal policies will need to take into account the overall investment needs and reflect the new geopolitical situation,"" the draft summit conclusions said.
""We will pursue sound fiscal policies, which ensure debt sustainability for each Member State, including by incentivising investments that are growth-enhancing and key for our 2030 objectives,"" the conclusions said.
JOINT DEBT
Some countries such as France want new jointly-issued EU debt to help cushion the shift from Russian energy imports, the impact of sanctions imposed on Moscow over Ukraine and the push for more independence from global food and microchip suppliers.
But Germany, the Netherlands and others strongly oppose such a move, saying there is plenty of still unused money in the EU's 800 billion euro recovery fund that the bloc is already jointly borrowing to finance many of the challenges.
Only 74 billion euros of the total EU fund have so far been disbursed as national governments have to prepare projects that will be financed with the grants and ultra cheap loans.
""We have other instruments (than new joint debt), let's use them first,"" one euro zone official said.

The draft conclusions showed that EU leaders want to find money for the challenges ahead by leveraging public funds to attract private capital and making innovative projects easier.
""We will use the budget and the potential of the European Investment Bank Group to catalyse private investments, including higher risk-financing for entrepreneurship and innovation,"" they said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain imposed sanctions on Chelsea soccer club owner Roman Abramovich and Igor Sechin, the chief executive of Russian oil giant Rosneft, hitting them with asset freezes and travel bans because of their links to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The two billionaires plus businessman Oleg Deripaska and four other Russian oligarchs are the most high-profile figures to be added to the British sanctions list since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and follows criticism that Britain has been acting too slowly.
The action puts on ice Abramovich's plans to sell the Premier League club, the current European champions, although the government said the team could still carry on playing. 
""There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin's vicious assault on Ukraine,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.
""Today's sanctions are the latest step in the UK's unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies.""
There had been loud calls from British lawmakers for action to be taken against Abramovich and other Russian oligarchs, with criticism that Johnson's government was not moving fast enough compared to the European Union and the United States.
Sechin, who Britain described as Putin's right hand man, was already on the U.S. and EU sanctions lists and last week French authorities seized his yacht.
15 BILLION POUNDS
The others added to the list were Oleg Deripaska, who has stakes in En+ Group, Dmitri Lebedev, chairman of Bank Rossiya, Alexei Miller, the chief executive of energy company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), and Nikolai Tokarev, the president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft.
In total Britain said the seven figures added to the sanctions list had a collective net worth of 15 billion pounds. ($19.74 billion).
Thursday's action means Abramovich is banned from carrying out transactions with British individuals and businesses, and cannot enter or stay in Britain. His spokeswoman declined immediate comment.
Last week, he announced that he would sell Chelsea and donate money from the sale to help victims of the war in Ukraine. 
Abramovich is the biggest shareholder in London-listed Russian steelmaker Evraz. It fell 16% after the sanctions were announced.
The entry on Britain's sanctions list described Abramovich, who Britain said was worth 9 billion pounds, as ""a prominent Russian businessman and pro-Kremlin oligarch"". It said he had enjoyed ""a close relationship for decades"" with the Russian president.
It said this association with Putin had brought Abramovich a financial or material benefit from either the Russian president directly, or the Russian government.

""This includes tax breaks received by companies linked to Abramovich, buying and selling shares from and to the state at favourable rates, and the contracts received in the run up to the FIFA 2018 World Cup,"" the website said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -The European Central Bank is likely to make as few policy commitments as possible on Thursday as the shock of Russia's invasion of Ukraine up-ends its expectations for the economy and leaves policymakers grappling with new realities. 
With inflation in the euro zone at a record high even before Moscow began its assault on Feb. 24, policymakers had been expected to announce an end to years of money-printing stimulus, opening the way for an interest rate hike late this year. 
But the war has shattered that consensus and the 25-member ECB Governing Council will go into the meeting divided, raising the chances of a policy surprise -- and the risk of an error. 
""No one can seriously expect the ECB to start normalising monetary policy at such a moment of high uncertainty,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.
The safest route would appear to be for the bank to confirm an earlier decision to continue reducing bond purchases next quarter while leaving all other commitments, including an end-date for the buys and the timing of a rate hike, up in the air. 
""We believe the ECB will aim to buy some time by proceeding with the previously planned gradual tapering in April ... while increasing flexibility in the forward guidance to allow more room to act once the immediate fog lifts,"" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) economist Anatoli Annenkov said.
To do so, the ECB is likely to remove a stipulation that a rate hike would come ""shortly"" after bond purchases end. It is also expected to drop any reference to a rate cut in its guidance.
Some policy hawks are nevertheless likely to push the ECB to curb stimulus and return policy at least to a ""neutral"" setting, so the bank could signal the end of bond buys in the coming months, a decision that would raise the chances of -- but not cement -- a 2022 rate hike.
Inflation across the 19 countries that use the euro could be three times the ECB's 2% target this year and is likely to remain elevated next year, too. 
A rebound in economic growth and the tightest labour market in decades should also be pushing the ECB to abandon its ultra-easy policy stance and end a nearly decade-long experiment with unconventional stimulus.
The Federal Reserve is sticking to its plans to raise U.S. interest rates next week, heralding a string of increases to borrowing costs as inflation rises.
But the conflict in Ukraine, the unprecedented sanctions slapped by Western countries on Russia and soaring commodity prices will all raise uncertainty, dampen growth, and sap households' purchasing power, adding to the case for caution.
Indeed, economists polled by Reuters expect the ECB to wait until the last months of this year for its first interest rate rise in over a decade. [POLL/]
Money markets price in a 30-basis-point increase to the ECB's rate on deposit by December, which would take it to minus 0.2%. 
The ECB has kept its deposit rate below zero, effectively charging banks to park their idle cash, since 2014 to fight what was then sluggish inflation in the euro zone.
STRUCTURAL WORRIES
Even if Thursday sees the can kicked down the road, high inflation makes the removal of stimulus almost unavoidable, but the real issue is how a changed world order will impact prices further out, a time horizon more relevant for the ECB. 
High energy prices will lower growth and could be a drag on inflation in the longer term as families have less to spend on other items and firms postpone investments.
This is why the ECB's inflation projection for 2024 is unlikely to be wildly different from the 1.8% it predicted three months ago.
These forecasts have been so unreliable in recent months that policymakers are now openly questioning them, making them less relevant in decision-making. 
War in Ukraine is also likely to set in motion economic forces that could boost prices further out.
Increased defence spending, as outlined by several euro zone members, and a quicker green transition to wean the bloc off Russian gas are both likely to boost government spending and inflation.

These may also be backed by joint European Union debt issuance, and the bloc would be likely look to the ECB to keep its cost of borrowing down. 
It is next to impossible to quantify the inflation costs of these long term decisions, however, so ECB projections will not reflect them, even if policymakers are likely to raise them in the debate.

The subdued outlook comes as the industry is lobbying aggressively for Congress to extend subsidies that have been critical to its growth. If solar tax credits are not renewed, the report by energy research firm Wood Mackenzie and industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association warned, the nation will not meet President Joe Biden's goal of decarbonizing the electricity sector by 2035. 
Solar accounted for nearly half of all new U.S. generation capacity last year thanks to robust demand for clean energy from utilities, homeowners and businesses, according to the report. 
In total, the industry installed 23.6 gigawatts of projects, of which nearly three quarters were large installations for utilities and other big customers. But that market segment is expected to decline 14% next year as developers cancel or delay projects due to higher costs and supply constraints stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.
The cost of solar projects has soared 18% in the last year, the report said, a major about-face for an industry that had experienced dramatic price declines over the last decade that have enabled it to compete with fossil-fuel-fired projects.

A 30% tax credit for solar projects, which the industry wants Congress to keep in place for 10 years, would expand the industry's capacity to 700 gigawatts by 2032, compared with 464 GW without those incentives, the report said.
Texas was the top state for new solar installations in 2021, followed by California, Florida, Virginia and Georgia.

While South Korea will probably maintain sound economic growth this year amid pandemic uncertainties, inflation is expected to stay above the BOK’s target of 2% for some time, the central bank said in a quarterly report. The BOK will therefore appropriately adjust the degree of accommodation of its monetary policy, it added.
The report comes after the bank held its benchmark interest rate at 1.25% last month as it paused to assess the impact of its three hikes since August. The latest policy statement suggests the BOK is on track for a potential quarter percentage point hike in April or May to tamp down inflationary pressures.
The report noted growing concerns about energy supplies amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine and highlighted rising crop prices as irregular weather hurts production globally.
The bank said it doesn’t rule out the chance of an extended period of high inflation as rising wages and consumer prices feed each other amid growing inflation expectations.
The BOK will seek to stabilize inflation around its target as it safeguards an economic recovery from the pandemic, it said.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian retail inflation likely slipped marginally in February, thanks to lower food prices, according to economists in a Reuters poll who still warned that surging oil prices will push inflation much higher in the coming months.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, crude oil prices have skyrocketed - in March alone, they have surged about 35% - which will in turn push up fuel, transport and other related components of inflation this month.
Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), likely slipped to 5.93% in February on an annual basis, from 6.01% in January, the March 3-9 poll of 36 economists predicted.
Forecasts for the data, due for release on March 14 around 1200 GMT, ranged between 5.70% and 6.40%. Over one-quarter of respondents expected inflation to have remained above the RBI's 6.0% upper threshold.
""I'm expecting the headline moderation in February to be led primarily by the food and beverages component, where adjusted monthly gains have softened from their recent peaks,"" said Miguel Chanco, chief emerging Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
""Storm clouds have been brewing for a while...the best way to describe the inflation numbers from around Q2 onwards is that when it rains, it pours.""
Petrol prices at fuel stations, where Indians will feel the effect from higher crude oil prices most acutely, have barely moved but are overdue a rise in coming weeks.
""Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) increase in prices post the announcement of election results and its pass-through to transportation costs would push inflation higher,"" said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), referring to elections across five Indian states over the past month including the most populous one, Uttar Pradesh. 
Asia's third-largest economy expanded 5.4% in the October-December quarter, slower than the 6.0% predicted by economists in a separate Reuters poll.

Focusing on growth, not inflation, the Reserve Bank of India has held its interest rates steady at record lows for nearly two years but is due to increase borrowing costs next quarter.[ECILT/IN]
The latest poll also showed industrial output likely expanded 1.5% in January from a year ago, compared with 0.4% in December.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - A flattening yield curve and slumping consumer confidence have been warning for months that U.S. recession risks are rising, but the alarm bells are suddenly being amplified by a rare quirk in the interest rate futures market.
In technical terms, the June 2023-December 2023 Eurodollar curve has inverted. In plain English, traders are beginning to price in Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in the second half of next year, before the tightening cycle has even started.
This inversion had previously been seen further out the curve, into 2024. But that was before war in Europe, eye-watering surges in oil, gas, and commodities prices, and cratering global markets radically shifted the dial.
To be sure, the Eurodollar curve is not a pure snapshot of the Fed's expected policy path. It can be distorted by perceived credit risk and strong hedging demand from a wide range of players, including overseas sovereigns.
But as Joseph Wang, a former trader on the Fed's trading desk points out, it is unusual, and merits attention.
""This is rare, but we have rare events going on. There is a huge amount of uncertainty,"" Wang said. ""The core of the financial system, banks, will be fine. But there is definitely concern about contagion and there could be reverberations that people are not familiar with.""
FCI, 6-YEAR HIGH
Could the U.S. economy fall into recession next year, or even this year? Economists are lowering their 2022 growth forecasts closer to 3% from 4% at the start of the year, with risks still to the downside in large part due to oil. Average gas prices at U.S. pumps are now the highest ever.
Annual growth of 3% would be nowhere near contraction. But global geopolitical and financial developments are unfolding so quickly there is precious little visibility for the coming weeks, never mind the rest of the year and beyond.
Global financial conditions are now the tightest in six years, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)'s Global Financial Conditions Index. Higher long rates, wider credit spreads, lower equities have all contributed to the rapid tightening this year.
The U.S. economy's direct exposure to Russia, Ukraine and Eastern Europe is small. The euro zone, for example, will be hit much harder by the raging conflict and energy prices.
But U.S. consumer confidence has plummeted to a 10-year low, and the 10-year Treasury yield is only 20 basis points away from going below the two-year yield. Every U.S. recession in the past 40 years has been preceded by a big fall in consumer confidence and an inversion of the yield curve.
BEAR MARKET
While high and rising inflation was on everyone's radar at the start of the year, no one had recession in their 2022 play book.
""Markets should focus on the growth outlook and the rhythm of its deceleration rather than on inflation risk, which is already priced into the bond and commodities markets,"" Unigestion's Guilhem Savry wrote on Tuesday.
A rosy growth outlook at the turn of the year was one of the pillars on which the equally bullish and broad-based 2022 equity market consensus was built.
A cursory look back through Wall Street banks' 2022 outlooks shows the 'R' word was hardly mentioned. Yes, earnings growth might slow and valuations looked a bit rich, but as long as the economy avoided recession Wall Street would climb another 10% or so.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) research highlights the extent of investors' economic optimism and market bullishness back in January: the gap between bullish equities and bearish bonds sentiment was historically wide, only 7% of investors expected recession this year, and less than a third expected a bear market this year.
More astonishing of all, BofA found that a record $949 billion flowed into global equity funds last year, more than the past 20 years combined.
Even assuming some of that flow naturally evaporates as Wall Street heads lower - the Nasdaq became a bear market this week - and most of it stays invested, there is still potential for huge relative value shifts or reallocation into safer assets.
""We are firmly in the grasp of a bear market that is incomplete in both time and price,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s equity strategists wrote on Monday, adding: ""As such, we recommend staying defensively oriented by running less risk than normal.""

301,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 09:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) -The risk of a Russian debt default is turning attention to the insurance policies known as Credit Default Swaps (CDS) that investors take out for this kind of situation. 
Here is how CDS work and why the situation in Russia means the situation might be more complicated than normal.
WHAT ARE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS? 
CDS are similar to an insurance contract, providing the buyer with protection against specific risks. 
Investors often buy them for protection against a default on a specific bond they have bought, but they are flexible and can be customised to cover various scenarios, timeframes or multiple countries, companies or banks all at once.
HOW DO YOU BUY A CDS?
CDS are sold by many of the world's big investment banks as investors want to hedge their risk when they buy a bond. The cost depends on risk of not getting paid back. 
WHEN DO THESE INSURANCE POLICIES PAY OUT?
The process starts with a market participant, usually an investor who has bought a CDS, asking a group known as the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee https://www.cdsdeterminationscommittees.org/about-dc-committees(DC), to look at whether a default or 'credit event' has happened.
There are five DCs https://www.cdsdeterminationscommittees.org/about-dc-committees/current-dc-membersdc-members-april-2021-to-april-2022/#EMEA for different parts of the world. They can have up to 15 voting members https://www.cdsdeterminationscommittees.org/about-dc-committees/current-dc-membersdc-members-april-2021-to-april-2022/#EMEA made up mainly of the big banks and investment funds that use or sell CDS such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), PIMCO and Citadel.
Their role of the DC is to apply the definitions of what constitutes a default to the specific circumstances, and make ""factual, evidence-based determinations"".
There are five commonly-established scenarios where non-payment occurs. Those are bankruptcy, a failure to pay, a debt restructuring, an obligation acceleration of default - where a payment might be triggered by a default on another bond, and finally a repudiation or moratorium - where the borrower is effectively refusing to pay.
WHAT HAPPENS THEN?
If it is agreed that a non-payment event has happened, the CDS contract should pay out, the investor has the right to hand over their bond to the CDS seller and receive 100% of the bond's 'par' value in return. 
In case the investor didn't actually have the bonds, they need to buy them from someone who does. That process is facilitated by what is known as the CDS bond ""auction"" when participants look at the bond markets and try to work out what the defaulted assets are worth. 
A cash settlement instead of physical settlement is normally an alternative if it proves tricky. 
WHY IS THIS SITUATION COMPLICATED?
There is a potential snag in that key 'settlement' part of the process.
That's because six of out Russia's 15 dollar- or euro-denominated international market bonds have legal fine print which allows the government to make its bond payments in roubles if ""the Russian Federation is unable to make payments of principal or interest (in whole or in part) in respect of the bonds in U.S. dollars"".
If Moscow uses that 'fallback' option it will create headaches as Western sanctions make it hard to convert the roubles back into dollars or euros at the moment. Further sanctions that banned Russian bond trading altogether would make it impossible for bondholders to deliver their defaulted bonds to the CDS sellers, meaning the sellers could argue they shouldn't have to pay out.
WHEN MIGHT RUSSIA DEFAULT AND KICK ALL THIS PROCESS OFF?
Russia's next 'hard currency' bond payments are two 'coupon' or regular interest payments due on March 16. They have what are known as 30-day grace periods, which means a default would formally happen on April 15.
The CDS determinations committee has already, however, been asked to look at what could happen for those bonds with the rouble fallback option.
HOW MUCH MONEY IS AT STAKE?

Investment bank JPMorgan estimates there is roughly $6 billion worth of outstanding CDS that would need to pay out.
For investors though that bought the insurance for their Russian bonds it is likely to avoid a huge hole in their pockets. Some could even make a profit as the fact the risk of default was seen as extremely low before this crisis meant that CDS were cheap.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Soaring energy and food prices triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine could exacerbate existing food security concerns in the Middle East and Africa, and may fuel growing social unrest, World Bank chief economist Carmen Reinhart said.
Germany will host a virtual meeting of agriculture ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies on Friday to discuss the impact of the invasion amid growing concerns about stabilising food markets.
""There will be important ramifications for the Middle East, for Africa, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, in particular,"" which had already been experiencing food insecurity, Reinhart told Reuters in an interview. 
""I don't want to be melodramatic, but it's not a far stretch that food insecurity and riots were part of the story behind the Arab Spring,"" she said, adding that successful and unsuccessful coups had increased over the past two years.
The Arab Spring refers to a series of pro-democracy protests and uprisings that took place in the Middle East and North African beginning in 2010, beginning in Tunisia and spreading to five other countries: Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain.
Sudden spikes in food prices can lead to social unrest, as happened in 2007-2008 and again in 2011, when global food price increases were associated with riots in more than 40 countries.
Agricultural commodities were already 35% higher in January, compared with a year ago, and are expected to rise further due to the war since Russia and Ukraine are both major exporters of wheat, maize, barley and sunflower oil, the World Bank reported last month, days after the Russian invasion began.
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
Surging energy and food prices could also push policymakers to implement more subsidies, experts say, adding to the heavy debts of many low-income countries, of which about 60 are either already in or near debt distress.
The bank last month warned the impacts could be particularly harsh in the Middle East and North Africa, where countries like Egypt import up to 80% of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia. Mozambique is also a large importer of wheat and oil.

Reinhart said Central Asia countries also faced significant economic challenges, given their close economic and trade ties to Russia, which the International Monetary Fund expects to tip into a recession this year as a result of Western sanctions.
""It's hit their currencies, and there are signs already of runs on banks, confidence issues, coupled with the food insecurity, and the (drop in) remittances,"" she said, alluding to potential refugee flows as a further complication.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia and Belarus are edging close to default given the massive sanctions imposed against their economies by the United States and its allies over the war in Ukraine, the World Bank's chief economist, Carmen Reinhart, told Reuters.
The specter of Russia defaulting on $40 billion of external bonds - its first major such default since the years following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution - has loomed large over markets since a raft of sanctions and countermeasures by Moscow have largely cut the country out of global financial markets. 
""Both Russia and Belarus are in square default territory,"" Reinhart said in an interview. ""They're not rated by the agencies as a selective default yet, but mighty close.""
Fitch on Tuesday downgraded Russia's sovereign rating by six notches further into junk territory to ""C"" from ""B,"" saying a default is imminent as sanctions and trade restrictions have undermined its willingness to service debt. 
Reinhart said financial sector repercussions had been limited thus far, but risks could emerge if European financial institutions were more exposed to Russian debt than assumed.
Around half of Russia's sovereign hard-currency bonds are held by foreign investors and Moscow must make $107 million in coupon payments on two bonds on March 16. Russian corporates have just under $100 billion in international bonds outstanding. 
Foreign banks have exposure of just over $121 billion to Russia with much of that concentrated in European lenders, according to data from the Bank of International Settlements. 
""I worry about what I do not see,"" Reinhart said. ""Financial institutions are well-capitalized, but balance sheets are often opaque ... There is the issue of Russian private sector defaults. One cannot be complacent.""
China also rapidly expanded its lending to Russia after its 2014 annexation of Crimea, she said.
UKRAINE'S DIFFICULT SITUATION
Analysts say Ukraine will also need debt relief this year given its massive war-related outlays and a heavy debt burden of $94.7 billion at the end of 2021, although the country has vowed to service its debt on time and in full.
Reinhart said it was reasonable to expect Ukraine to seek cash-flow relief, and expressed confidence that creditors would be receptive given the current situation. Ukraine could also miss an upcoming coupon payment, at least during the grace period, without its credit rating suffering, she said.

""Ukraine has and will have open doors given its very difficult financial situation,"" she said. ""You’re not declared in default as long as you’re still within the grace period.”
Ukraine's sovereign debt includes $1.6 billion owed to Paris Club creditors, and $4.9 billion to non-Paris Club creditors, most of which is held by China, according to debt experts.

Colombia's consumer prices rose 1.63% in February, taking the 12-month inflation figure to 8.01%, far from the central bank's annual target of 3%.
""The inflation figure...in February took practically everyone by surprise and it certainly took me by surprise,"" Steiner said during a virtual conference. ""It is a figure worse than we expected, and we were expecting a high figure.""
The spike in inflation follows international supply-chain pressures as well as the crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, added to local impacts including protests in Colombia in 2021 and a 10% hike in the minimum wage. 

""Forecasts (for inflation) are rising, it is cause for concern,"" Steiner said, adding that sharply rising oil prices ""will have repercussions that aren't favorable for the Colombian economy.""
Analysts forecast that Colombia's inflationary pressures will push the central bank to step on the gas in raising its benchmark interest rate, with forecasts pointing to a 125 basis-point hike, which would take the rate to 5.25%, from a current 4%.

305,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 04:46PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's government is planning to allow port costs to be excluded from tax calculations to lower the cost of imports, three Economy Ministry sources told Reuters, in a measure backed by the country's industry lobby.
At the same time the government is mulling cutting the tax levied on shipping freight, two of the officials said.
The moves are prompted by the surge in commodity prices and higher shipping costs caused by the war in Ukraine.
The expense of unloading containers and moving goods within port areas is part of the base for calculating import and other taxes such as the IPI industrial tax, the ICMS state tax
and the PIS/Cofins sales tax.
The three sources, who took part in drafting the measures, did not detail their fiscal cost to the Treasury, but said it was very low. 

The Economy Ministry said it would not comment on the planned changes that are ready to be applied in a few days.
The National Confederation of Industry (CNI), Brazil's top industry lobby, said in a 2020 study that ending the inclusion of port expenses in taxation on importers could add 134.5 billion reais to the economy over 20 years by expanding the flow of trade and direct investment in the country.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan is unlikely to slide into stagflation, a condition where rising inflation and shrinking economic growth co-exist, a senior central bank official said on Wednesday.
With the Ukraine crisis triggering sharp rises in energy and commodity prices, consumer inflation will ""clearly accelerate"" as firms pass on the costs to households, said Seiichi Shimizu, head of the Bank of Japan's monetary affairs department.
""But we don't expect Japan to face a stagflation-like situation, defined as a combination of rising inflation and a contraction in economic growth,"" he told parliament.
""We expect Japan's economy to recover as the hit to service consumption from the coronavirus pandemic eases,"" adding to support from solid external demand, he said.
The remarks, which come ahead of the BOJ's policy meeting next week, suggest the central bank will stick to its projection of a moderate economic recovery but acknowledge rising inflationary pressure from the recent surge in energy prices.

Under an assessment made in January, the BOJ currently projects consumer inflation to ""accelerate"" as companies ""gradually"" pass on rising raw material costs to households.
While rising commodity and grain costs will push up energy and food prices in the short-term, it will hurt the economy in the long run through declines in household income and corporate profits, Shimizu said.

The central bank said it would continue supporting banks with refinancing loans to prevent their insolvency.

MILAN (Reuters) - European bank stocks have lost a fifth of their value over the past month amid the Ukraine crisis. 
Western sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine have upended the financial sector, but the main hit to banks are the threats to the global economic outlook and the prospect of higher interest rates.
Investors worry banks will again need to hike loan loss provisions, which had been declining after the pandemic-driven spike in 2020. The crisis is also reducing the chances of higher interest rates, which would have boosted income from lending.
Some banks, however, are also directly exposed.
Italian and French banks have the largest Russianexposure, representing just over $25 billion each at the end ofSeptember, followed by Austrian banks with $17.5 billion, Bank of International Settlements https://stats.bis.org/statx/srs/table/b4?c=RU&f=pdf data shows.
U.S. bank exposure totals $14.7 billion, BIS data shows.
Following are some banks with significant Russianexposure.
EUROPEAN BANKS
UNICREDIT
Italy's second-biggest bank said a full write-off of its Russian business, including cross-border and derivatives exposure, would cost around 7.4 billion euros ($8.1 billion), pushing its core capital ratio to around 13% from 15.03%.
UniCredit said it would still pay cash dividends for 2021 in the worst-case scenario where it zeroed its exposure, while plans for a 2.6 billion euro share buyback are contingent on its core capital ratio remaining above 13%.
UniCredit said its Russian client cross-border exposure stood at 4.5 billion euros, net of guarantees of around 1 billion euros.
It has also a direct exposure of 1.9 billion euros (net of currency hedges) to UniCredit Bank Russia, its local arm and Russia's 14th largest lender.
UniCredit could also potentially suffer an up to 1 billion euro loss on derivatives if the rouble's value fell to zero. 
RAIFFEISEN BANK INTERNATIONAL (RBI) 
RBI has operated in Russia since the collapse of the SovietUnion and its business there contributed almost a third of its net profit of 1.5 billion euros last year.
RBI's Russian business holds 2.4 billion euros in capital, or 18% of consolidated equity. Russia's 10th-largest bank by assets, it employs around 8,700 staff.
RBI's said its overall Russian exposure totalled 22.85 billion euros file:///C:/Users/u8018106/OneDrive%20-%20Thomson%20Reuters%20Incorporated/Desktop/2022-02-02%20Presentation%20RBI.pdf at the end of last year, more than half relating to the corporate private sector.
The overall figure comprises 11.6 billion euros in customerloans (or 11.5% of group), more than 80% in roubles.
Cross-border exposure to Russia is only 1.6 billion euroswith no parent funding from Vienna. RBI also holds 2.2billion euros in loans to Ukrainian customers.
SOCIETE GENERALE
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), which controls Rosbank, had 18.6 billion euros https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/2022-02/Q4-21-Financial-Results-Presentation.pdf of overall exposure to Russia at the end of last year - or 1.7% of the group total.
More than 80%, or 15.4 billion euros, is held locally by Rosbank while cross-border exposure amounts to 3.2 billion euros, including 600 million euros in off-balance sheet items.
The French bank, which started doing business in Russia in 1872, left in 1917 and returned in 1973, said its Russian activities in 2021 represented 2.7% of group net income.
Last week it said it could withstand an extreme scenario where its Russian business is confiscated, which would shave only half a percentage point off its core capital.
Of SocGen's Russian exposure, 41% is to retail and 31% to corporates. Exposure to Russian sovereign entities stands at 3.7 billion euros.
CREDIT AGRICOLE
The French bank said its overall exposure to Russia, including both onshore and offshore items, was 6.7 billion euros, or 0.6% of its total commercial lending portfolio as of Dec. 31.
That comprises 2.9 billion euros of offshore exposure to 15 large Russian corporates, notably producers and exporters of commodities.
Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) operates in Ukraine and Russia through two fully-owned subsidiaries. Crédit Agricole Ukraine holds 226 million euros in equity. That of Russian arm CACIB AO, a subsidiary of Crédit Agricole CIB, stands at 150 million euros.
Credit Agricole said it was monitoring closely its exposures to Russia, but there would be no impact on its 2021 dividends.
BNP PARIBAS
The French bank unveiled on Wednesday a total exposure of around 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) to Russia and Ukraine, sticking to its previously announced 2025 financial targets. 
INTESA SANPAOLO
Italy's biggest bank has financed major investment projectsin Russia, such as the Blue Stream gas pipeline. It handles more than half of all commercial transactions between Italy and Russia. 
Intesa's loan exposure to Russia was 5.57 billion euros atend-2021, or 1.1% of the total. 
Its subsidiaries in Russia and Ukraine have assets, respectively, of 1 billion and 300 million euros, which together represent just 0.1% of the group total.
Intesa has said it was conducting a strategic review of its Russian presence.
ING 
The Dutch bank has around 4.5 billion euros in outstandingloans with Russian clients and around 600 million euros withclients in Ukraine, out of a total loan book worth more than 600billion euros.
UBS
The Swiss bank said on Monday its direct country risk exposure to Russia accounted for $634 million of its total emerging market exposure of $20.9 billion at end-2021.
U.S. BANKS
CITIGROUP
Citi said last week its total exposure to Russia amounted to nearly $10 billion and it was working to bring it down.
That comprises third-party exposures worth $8.2 billion, of which $1.0 billion in cash at the Bank of Russia and other financial institutions and $1.8 billion of reverse repos.
Citi also has $1.6 billion of exposures to additional Russian counterparties outside of its Russian subsidiary that are not included in that $8.2 billion.

By comparison, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reported last month $293 million in net exposure to Russia, as well as a total of $414 million of market exposure as of December 2021.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - There is a high risk the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by half a percentage point sometime this year, according to economists polled by Reuters who also upgraded their inflation outlooks and said they may have to do so again.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent the price of crude oil up by about 25% and pushed the average U.S. price for regular unleaded gasoline to near a record high this week, with little chance of any respite soon.
With the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate at the near-zero level and U.S. consumer price inflation already surging at its fastest pace in 40 years, most economists say the Fed needs to take action soon.
In testimony to Congress last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell made it clear the central bank was likely to lift its federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the end of its March 15-16 policy meeting. Prior to Powell's comments, some investors had expected a 50-basis-point rate hike might be delivered then. 
All 69 economists in the March 4-9 poll agreed that the smaller rate hike was in the cards this month, and nearly all expected the Fed to continue raising rates in 25-basis-point increments. 
But 20 of 37 respondents to an extra question in the poll said the risk of a half-percentage-point rate rise this year was high, including five who said it was very high. Respondents were split nearly evenly on whether that would happen in the second or third quarter.
""The bigger takeaway in our view was Powell's openness to larger than 25-basis-point hikes at future meetings,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), who expects the Fed to deliver a 50-basis-point hike in May.
""It almost seemed to imply that 50 basis points may well have been the decision taken at the March 16 meeting if not for geopolitical developments."" 
The Fed has not raised interest rates by half a percentage point since 2000.
The federal funds rate, which was lowered to the 0-0.25% range in early 2020 in response to the economic damage from the COVID-19 pandemic, was expected to reach at least 1.25%-1.50% by the end of this year, 48 of the 67 economists polled said.
That compares with interest rate futures forecasting a slightly higher 1.50%-1.75% rate by the end of 2022.
More than a quarter of poll respondents expected it to go at least that high by the end of the year. The highest end-year forecast provided in the survey, 2.00%-2.25%, was higher than in the previous poll, as was the lowest forecast, 0.75%-1.00%.
""We continue to think that risks to inflation, the pace of rate hikes later in 2022, and the terminal range of policy rates are all skewed to the upside,"" Citi's Hollenhorst added.
Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was forecast to average 7.7% this quarter, compared to the 7.1% predicted in February. This year's average forecast was lifted for a 10th straight month, to 6.1% from 5.0%.
The U.S. labor market was also expected to continue tightening, with wage growth set to average 5.0% this year, up from the 4.9% predicted in last month's poll.
The unemployment rate was seen falling further to 3.4% - below its pre-pandemic level - by the end of this year from 3.8%. 
Twenty-eight of 35 economists said there was a high risk of a further upgrade to their medium-term inflation forecasts in the coming months, with four saying there was a very high risk. 
Only seven said the risk was low, but these were economists who had already upgraded their forecasts.
Some economists are already beginning to worry the world's biggest economy is set to slow sharply this year. 
""If we have persistent disruption to energy and food supplies, that's going to put upward pressure on inflation,"" said Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
""That ... means consumers will have less income to spend on other goods and services, and that typically is what slows the economy and presents recession risks.""
A widely expected snapback from the economic slowdown tied to the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in the first quarter already looks weaker. Gross domestic product is forecast to grow 1.6% in the January-March period, but growth forecasts for subsequent quarters were downgraded to 3.5%, 3.0%, and 2.5%, respectively, from estimates of 3.8%, 3.2% and 2.6% in last month's survey.

Economic growth was expected to average 3.6% this year and 2.4% in 2023, down from the 3.7% and 2.5% estimated in February.

PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union announced fresh sanctions against Russia and its ally Belarus on Wednesday but EU leaders are set to rebuff Kyiv's appeal for accelerated membership of the bloc when they meet on Thursday to discuss Russia's war in Ukraine.
The 27-nation EU blacklisted 14 more oligarchs and froze ties with Belarus' central bank and top lenders there, the executive European Commission said on the 14th day of a war that has sent two million Ukrainians fleeing abroad. 
Speaking ahead of the leaders' summit on Thursday and Friday at Versailles, near Paris, an EU official left no doubt that Kyiv's appeal to be admitted swiftly to the bloc was a no-go. 
""Membership could take a long time,"" said the official, who is involved in preparing the Versailles talks, adding the leaders still wanted to strengthen ties with Ukraine.
They will discuss boosting Kyiv's links to the EU single market and to Europe's energy grid under ideas for enhanced partnership or ""association plus plus"", the official said.
That is bound to disappoint Ukraine, which is seeking more Western financial, military and other help as it battles Russia. 
""The leaders are unlikely to offer Ukraine candidate status. It is more likely that there will be more cooperation within the association agreement,"" said a second EU official.
""Offering more is impossible because this is a country that is now engulfed by war, partially under Russian occupation, and maybe at some point even completely under occupation.""
Ukraine signed its association agreement with the EU after mass street protests in 2014 overthrew a Russia-allied president who had sought to revive closer ties with Moscow. 
In response, Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine and backed armed separatists in the east of the country, triggering Western sanctions on Russia's energy, banking and defence sectors. 
MORE SANCTIONS
The sanctions announced on Wednesday targeted 160 individuals, including parliamentarians and 14 more oligarchs, among them the head of Russia's national carrier Aeroflot.
Altogether, EU restrictions apply to 862 people and 53 entities linked to the invasion of Ukraine. The EU also banned exports of maritime technology to Russia and sought to prevent crypto assets being used to circumvent the sanctions.
The new measures prohibit transactions with the Central Bank of Belarus and exclude three Belarusian banks from the SWIFT banking system: Belagroprombank, Bank Dabrabyt, and the Development Bank of the Republic of Belarus. The bloc has already slapped such measures on seven Russian lenders.
EU leaders will also discuss on Thursday ways of weaning their countries off a heavy reliance on Russian energy imports.
But they are split over how hard to press Russia and also over EU enlargement, with France and the Netherlands prominent sceptics about taking in more members, a process that requires unanimity.

The accession process usually takes years and requires meeting far-ranging economic, political and other criteria.
Western European governments have become more wary of enlargement because ex-communist states such as Poland and Hungary, which joined in 2004, have turned increasingly eurosceptic while benefiting from EU financial aid.

TESANJ, Bosnia (Reuters) - Bosnian businesses, already grappling with domestic instability and anaemic economic growth, fear further turmoil from potential fallout from the war in Ukraine as Western-led sanctions against Russia threaten to shut out an important market.
Bosnia has been going through its worst political crisis since the end of the Balkan wars of the 1990s, with Bosnian Serbs challenging state institutions as part of their longtime bid to secede, emboldened by at least tacit support from Russia.
Although it lies hundreds of miles from Ukraine, NATO and the European Union - which has doubled its peacekeeping troops in Bosnia as a precaution - have warned that the war may bring more instability.
A slowing economy, forecast by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies to grow at 2.5% this year, down from 4.8% in 2021 and the lowest in the region, risks being undermined further as sanctions against Moscow start to bite.
""Almost 35% of our rawhide production that was aimed for the Russian market through our Italian partners is now stopped,"" said Adisa Karahodzic, the general manager of the Koteks textile and leather producer in the northern town of Tesanj.
Karahodzic said that her company was already experiencing a slowdown in production since January, after foreign partners were spooked by a militarised police parade marking an illegal holiday in the Bosnian Serb region on Jan. 9.
    ""They have been calling and inquiring about a possible war, and some managers had postponed scheduled visits to approve new orders fearing they could get stuck if something happened,"" she said. ""After the coronavirus pandemic, we just go from one crisis to another."" 
    Calls for sanctions on the country's autonomous Serb Republics following Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik's threats of pulling the region out of the national military, tax system and judiciary as part of his secession bid are stoking businesses' fears. 
    The EU, which is Bosnia's largest trade partner, has warned that 600 million euros ($656.5 million) worth of projects that were already agreed for Bosnia's Serb Republic will be halted unless the Serbs resume work in state institutions.
    ""My hair goes up when (EU) sanctions are even mentioned,"" said Dragutin Skrebic, who owns footwear producer Skrebic Company in the town of Teslic, which exports all its products to European buyers.
    He said he was already struggling with rising prices of raw materials and unreliable transportation in the wake of the Ukraine war.
""We absolutely have no clue as to where this is going, we need a prophet,"" he told Reuters.

Washington vowed last month to commit more diplomatic and security resources to the Indo-Pacific to push back against what its sees as China's bid to create a regional sphere of influence and become the world's most influential power. 
The 12-page strategy overview reiterated U.S. plans to launch an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework in early 2022, an initiative the administration hopes will at least partially fill a big gap in engagement with the region since 2017 when then- President Donald Trump quit a multinational trade framework.
Speaking to an online event organised by the Brookings Institution, a U.S. think-tank, Taiwan's chief trade negotiator John Deng said democratically governed Taiwan was a dependable and stable partner both politically and economically.
""Taiwan is very willing to support the U.S. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework,"" he said.
""I would like to urge the U.S. government, and I hope all the audience participating in the seminar today can help us convey this message to the U.S. government, that Taiwan would like to be a full member of this framework."" 
Supply chain cooperation between Taiwan, a major semiconductor producer, and the United States was vital for both, Deng added.
China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has condemned the U.S. Indo-Pacific push, saying Washington is creating ""exclusive clubs"". 
Any Taiwanese participation in the economic section would likely further strain Sino-U.S. ties with Beijing angered by any shows of support from Washington for the island.
Asked about Deng's remarks, a U.S. administration official told Reuters the United States was engaging with Indo-Pacific partners as it was developing the framework, but didn't currently have ""membership"" details to announce.
""That being said, the U.S. is committed to deepening our trade and investment relationship with Taiwan,"" the official said. 
A senior U.S. diplomat said last month his country had ""no intention"" of engaging with China in its Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.

Deng said China had been using subsidies and unfair trade practices to boost its economic power in recent years, something Beijing routinely denies.
""China's political and military ambitions also let the world understand that they pose a threat to the world order,"" he added.

""We are thinking about it, it's the start of a discussion about a plan to speed up and increase joint investments in defence, energy and climate transition,"" the official said ahead of the two-day summit starting early Thursday evening.

The official said the aim was to identify the economic impact of the crisis, determining countries' financial needs as a result of it and then considering what instruments could be used.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who has resisted such joint financial initiatives in the past, said earlier on Wednesday that the European Union should first make full use of existing instruments before rolling out new EU funds.

314,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 11:56AM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill to ban Russian energy imports and review that country's status at the World Trade Organization has excluded a proposal to revoke its permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status, according to the text of the bill slated for a U.S. House of Representatives vote later on Wednesday.
Revoking Russia's PNTR status would allow Washington to raise tariffs on Russian imports above levels pledged to all World Trade Organization members. The move had been proposed on Monday by the bipartisan leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee as a way to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
But the text of the ""Suspending Energy Imports from Russia Act,"" released early on Wednesday, includes no reference to PNTR or tariffs beyond a ban on Russian energy imports. 
Instead, it directs the U.S. Trade Representative to ""use the voice and influence of the United States at the WTO to --
1) condemn the recent aggression in Ukraine;
2) encourage other WTO members to suspend trade concessions to the Russian Federation; and
3) consider further steps with the view to suspend the Russian Federation’s participation in the WTO.""
A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office could not immediately be reached for comment on why the PNTR provision was excluded or what steps USTR Katherine Tai will take to implement the legislation.
Options to suspend Russia's WTO are limited, as the organization does not have a specific provision for expelling member countries and its consensus-based decision-making structure is not well suited to making such a major change.

On Tuesday, President Joe Biden issued an immediate ban on Russian oil and energy imports.
Russia has called its action in Ukraine a ""special operation.""

United Russia added in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that the commission on lawmaking activity had supported a bill allowing for firms more than 25% owned by foreigners from ""unfriendly states"" to be put into external administration. 
""This will prevent bankruptcy and save jobs,"" it said.
Corporate actions to censure Russia over its invasion of Ukraine vary widely, with some firms like U.S. carmaker Ford temporarily shutting down factories but others like British energy company BP (NYSE:BP) promising to exit the country.

United Russia said according to the proposed bill companies who had announced they were leaving Russia could refuse to go into administration if within five days they resumed activities or sold shares, providing that the business and employees remained.
Otherwise, a court would appoint a temporary administration for three months, after which the shares of the new organisation would be put up for auction and the old one would be liquidated, it added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amid the devastation of World War Two, the United States and its allies created the institutions that have governed the post-war global economic order, focused on rebuilding Europe, fighting poverty and bringing rivals together to work out trade disputes peacefully.
But as the first major European war since 1945 rages, some Western countries are discussing strategies to oust Russia from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Bank and other development lenders as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine. 
If successful, such moves would reverse a decades-old doctrine that engaging former communist states in these institutions produces better outcomes than shunning them. But some officials and diplomats say that Russia's actions in Ukraine are so abhorrent that Moscow no longer deserves to help shape global economic development.
Russia insists it is engaging in a ""special operation"" in Ukraine.
Here are the main efforts to eject or suspend Russia from major institutions designed for a world at peace and without clear mechanisms for punishing combatants.
IMF
Some European Union officials are examining ways to curb Russia's influence at the global crisis lender, which the Soviet Union helped create but never joined after World War Two. 
Both Russia and Ukraine joined the IMF in 1992, a year after the Soviet Union collapsed. 
The IMF's Articles of Agreement https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/aa/pdf/aa.pdf contain no provisions regarding armed conflicts, which many members have launched in the past, including the United States.
A process for expelling Russia would require a finding that Moscow violated the Articles, such as failing to furnish the IMF with required economic data on reserve assets, balance of payments, trade and foreign exchange operations.
If a violation were found and not corrected, members holding 70% of the IMF's voting power after ""a reasonable period"" could suspend Russia's voting rights. After another ""reasonable period,"" an 85% voting majority could force the country to withdraw from Fund membership.
In a more symbolic but easier move, Western governments could strip Russian Executive Director Aleksei Mozhin of his honorary title as dean of the IMF's Executive Board. The informal role as that board's most senior director carries little power other than chairing board meetings in the absence of the IMF's managing director.
WTO
The United States and its European allies are also examining ways to suspend Russia's ""most favored nation"" trade status, which would allow them to impose tariffs well above global rates they have pledged to all WTO members.
Under U.S. law, revoking Russia's trade status would require an act of Congress. However, a budget bill and legislation to ban Russian energy imports, which are slated for votes on Friday, excluded a provision to revoke permanent normal trade relations with Russia. Instead, the legislation authorizes a review of Russia's WTO membership.
Expelling Russia, which joined the WTO in 2012 after 19 years of negotiations, would be extremely difficult as there is no specific expulsion process. The WTO would need a two-thirds majority to create such a process and a three-fourths majority to remove Russia. But the body typically reaches decisions by consensus among its 164 member countries - a non-voting structure that has largely stymied significant changes for decades.
There is a better chance of denying Russian ally Belarus' bid to join the WTO, a process that has languished in negotiations since 1993. Western nations have accused Belarus of facilitating the invasion of Ukraine.
WORLD BANK GROUP
The World Bank last week halted all of its program work in Russia and Belarus over the invasion of Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine both joined the global lender in 1992.
The move stops disbursements to Belarus on active loan projects https://financesapp.worldbank.org/countries/Belarus totaling some $511 million through 2025 and loan commitments to Belarus for its emergency COVID-19 response.
The last World Bank loan to Russia was approved in 2013, before Moscow's annexation of the Crimea region in 2014, but the lender paid out $3.6 million in December 2021 for a meteorological project.
If Russia were to fail to meet its obligations in the World Bank's Articles of Agreement https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/722361541184234501-0330022018/original/IBRDArticlesOfAgreementEnglish.pdf, a voting majority of shareholders could suspend Moscow's membership, a move that would result in automatic membership termination if not reversed within a year.
EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), launched in 1991 to support former communist countries in Eastern Europe, said on March 1 that its board of directors voted ""in large numbers"" to suspend Russia and Belarus indefinitely from access to its financing.

The EBRD's governors now have 30 days to vote on the proposal, which requires a two-thirds majority to pass.
The organization had already stopped investing in Russia after the Crimea annexation and imposed a moratorium on new investment in Belarus following that country's disputed 2020 election.

Countries around the globe face a challenge in replacing supply of commodities from Russia and Ukraine that has been cut off by the war and should remove restraints to production, according to the World Bank chief.
Nations could look at easing constraints such as the Jones Act in the U.S. -- which requires that ships moving between ports be built and registered in the nation and crewed by Americans -- and the mandate that ethanol be mixed into gasoline, said David Malpass, president of the Washington-based development lender.
Advanced economies must avoid hoarding of supplies such as gasoline to make sure that the poorest nations aren’t affected, Malpass said. Focus should be placed on quickly ramping up output from alternative suppliers such as Indonesia for nickel and the U.S., Canada and Mexico for food and energy.
“This is a huge problem for developing countries in general, and especially the poorest ones,” Malpass said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Wednesday with Lisa Abramowicz, Jonathan Ferro and Tom Keene. “The Russia situation right now doesn’t look like it will be a temporary one. It’s a longer-lasting set of problems for the world in interacting with Russia on oil, on wheat, on basic minerals, and there need to be supplies elsewhere.”
Emergency financing of more than $700 million for Ukraine announced by the World Bank, Netherlands and partner countries this week will help with food and doctors as the development lender works on a larger aid program, Malpass said.

(Reuters) - Global financial conditions are at their tightest since early 2016, driven by soaring energy prices, sliding stocks and market turmoil stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Financial conditions reflect the availability of funding in an economy and, perceived as strongly correlated with future growth, are watched closely by central bankers. How loose or tight they are dictates spending, saving and investment plans of businesses and households.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which uses metrics such as exchange rates, equity swings and borrowing costs to compile the most widely used financial conditions indexes, has in the past shown a 100-basis-point tightening in conditions crimps growth by one percentage point in the coming year, with an equivalent loosening giving a corresponding boost.
The current bout of tightening is an unwelcome development for a world economy that, despite historically loose monetary conditions in developed markets, is already threatened by the knock-on effect of oil prices at over $120 a barrel and supply chain setbacks caused by sanctions on Russia and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Goldman Sachs' global financial conditions index (FCI) stood at 100.7 points at Tuesday's close, a level last reached in February 2016 that is 70 basis points (bps) tighter than the index's long-run average of 100 points and 110 bps tighter than prior to Russia's invasion.
The rise has been led by the Russian FCI, which soared to 123 from around 98 at the start of February, the tightest on record in data going back to 2007, driven by the rouble losing a third of its value and a doubling of interest rates.

'STAGFLATION SCENARIO' 
If current dynamics push inflation steadily higher, and ""if the central banks take their mandates seriously, you will see a further (tightening) in financial conditions,"" said Rene Albrecht, strategist at DZ Bank. 
""Economic dynamics will slow down further, inflation will be high nonetheless and you will see second-round effects and then you get a stagflation scenario,"" he added, referring to a combination of rising inflation and slower economic growth. 
The war in Ukraine has taken an emerging markets FCI to its tightest since 2009. 
""Commodity price pressures will likely lead to currency depreciation and heightened inflation, through imported inflation, in some emerging market countries, which will tighten financial conditions and weaken growth,"" ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said in a recent report. 
""The magnitude of the effects on individual countries will depend on whether they are net commodity importers or exporters,"" Moody's said, expecting importers such as China, Turkey, Korea, Japan, India and Indonesia to take the biggest hit. 
Graphic: Russian financial conditions GS: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkvlgakznpb/aWMrB-russian-financial-conditions-tightest-on-record.png 
Euro zone moves are sizeable too. Conditions in the bloc, heavily reliant on Russian energy, are at the tightest since November 2020.
They have moved 60 bps tighter since the start of February, driven also by the European Central Bank (ECB) opening the door to interest rate hikes this year. The ECB is expected to make as few policy commitments as possible at a meeting on Thursday as it waits to see how events in Ukraine play out. 
Should it proceed with unwinding bond purchases followed by rate hikes, as expected before the invasion, financial conditions could tighten to levels seen at the height of the pandemic or even the bloc's sovereign debt crisis a decade ago, Viraj Patel, global macro strategist at Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research, said. 
U.S. conditions have tightened to a lesser extent. 
The indicators Goldman uses to calculate its indexes signal no relief.

Safe-haven flows are boosting the dollar, which is near two-year highs, world stocks have fallen over 12% this year and U.S. investment-grade corporate bond risk premia have widened 50 bps year-to-date as investors assess the hit to companies' profits.

A near-vertical rally in inflation wagers in Europe is boosting the likelihood of a hawkish surprise from the European Central Bank on Thursday, a move that could knock extremely bearish euro bets out of the water.
Investors were the most bearish on the euro in more than a decade, according to risk reversals, a barometer of market positioning and sentiment, with the market bracing for further downside as traders expect officials will point to the economic headwinds from the war in Ukraine.
On the other hand, swap rates that gauge the outlook for price increases leave less room for dovish messaging, with markets pricing inflation above the ECB’s 2% target even after the initial shock from the conflict. 
Indeed, were the ECB’s inflation projections to follow inflation swaps which roughly cover the policy-relevant horizon for the central bank, officials would actually have to increase rates immediately, according to researchers at Commerzbank. While that’s clearly not going to happen, there’s room for officials to signal strongly they will move to tame price pressures.
“The communication will be challenging,” Christoph Rieger, head of fixed-rate strategy at the German lender, wrote in a note to clients. “The market has made up its mind that the ECB would look through this latest energy-induced spike in consumer prices.”
The European economy’s proximity to Russia means it is feeling the reverberations of sanctions against the nation, with Russian gas meeting about a third of Europe’s demand. That has simultaneously sent market-based inflation expectations surging while economists predict a hit to economic growth. Talk of stagflation risks is common.

To be sure, while the surge in short-term inflation gauges makes sense given the rally in commodity prices, the move in medium- to long-term markets has caught many off guard as it suggests expectations for price increases becoming embedded. Some strategists argue it is not a true reflection of investor sentiment and likely a function of technical factors.
“The surge in HICP swaps is likely positioning and liquidity rather than a reassessment of long-term fundamentals,” Citi strategists, including Puja V Sawant, wrote in a note. “Sudden ECB credibility loss does not feel like a satisfactory explanation.”
Bond Issuance
The ECB’s policy outlook might also be impacted by the prospect of more joint European Union bond issuance. It could convince policy makers in the coming months that financing conditions will be kept in check, even if they pursue a tightening path. The euro rallied Tuesday after a Bloomberg report on the plans.  
“If the ECB is not willing to hike rates this year to defend the euro, we will likely revise our forecasts lower,” said George Saravelos, Deutsche Bank’s global head of currency research, in a note to clients. An EU joint-bond issuance program “to deal with the immediate impact of the crisis on growth would be most relevant for the ECB reaction function in the near term.”

Investing.com -- Global markets brighten up on first signs of compromise from the Russian and Ukrainian governments (but the fighting goes on, regardless). Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) moves into the market for high-end desktops, at the same time as relaunching its cut-price iPhone SE. Nickel trading remains halted as a major Chinese producer faces an $8 billion loss. Russia's central bank bans foreign currency sales, pushing the ruble lower again. The Labor Department publishes its monthly job openings survey and U.S. oil inventory data will show the impact of record-high gasoline prices. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 9th March.
1. Markets up on signs of diplomatic shift in Russia, Ukraine
The mood in global markets brightened after Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia has no intention of occupying Ukraine or overthrowing its government, a clear step away from its previous position of wanting to ‘de-Nazify’ the country.
The comments came a day after Ukraine’s democratically-elected (and Jewish) President Voldymyr Zelensky said he had “cooled” on the idea of joining NATO, the prospect of which was a prime factor behind Russia’s invasion.
European stock markets rose as much as 5%, while the euro rebounded 0.8% to $1.0985 by 6:15 AM ET (1115 GMT).
As ever, diplomatic rhetoric shifts according to its audience, and is often at odds with events. Zakharova also said that Russia’s actions aren’t aimed at Ukraine’s peaceful population – despite widespread evidence of repeated shelling of refugees trying to flee through 'safe' corridors it had guaranteed. Zelensky, meanwhile, told the British parliament that Ukraine would fight on “to the end” on Tuesday.
2. Russian economic crisis worsens as exodus continues, central bank restricts stops FX sales
Russia’s economy continues to lurch into chaos. The Central Bank late on Tuesday stopped banks from selling foreign currency for six months, a move that suggests it expects the current sanctions regime to last at least that long. The dollar rose another 12% on local exchanges to 118.07 rubles.
Vladimir Putin signed a decree late on Tuesday restricting the export of raw materials, in an attempt to appear still in control of an economic situation largely driven by external forces. The U.S. and U.K. both said they will ban Russian oil imports on Tuesday, while the EU outlined plans to cut its imports of Russian gas by two-thirds within a year.
The list of private companies exiting Russia continued to lengthen: McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, both said they will suspend operations. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have all done the same within the last 24 hours.
3. Stocks set to open higher; Apple, JOLTS eyed
U.S. stock markets are set to join the global bounce later, with dip-buying trading algorithms making the most of the shift in sentiment.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 468 points, of 1.4%, while S&P 500 futures were up 1.7% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 2.0%. That’s considerably more than what they lost on Tuesday.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Apple, which announced plans to expand in the high-end desktop computer market late on Tuesday, offsetting some fears about cannibalization of its iPhone business with the relaunch of its iPhone SE product. Also in focus will be electric vehicle makers, as the consequences of the turmoil in nickel futures continue to ripple through markets. Oatly is arguably the most interesting of the few companies reporting earnings, while Adidas’ figures released earlier went some way to making up for recent volatility.
The Labor Department's monthly job openings survey leads a thin data calendar.
4. Nickel market remains shut as Chinese producer faces $8 billion loss
Nickel trading remained closed in both Shanghai and London as the two exchanges made slow progress in unwinding the massive loss-making short position held by Tsingshan, a Chinese nickel producer.
Tsingshan faces losses of some $8 billion on its position, according to various reports.
The London Metals Exchange has been fiercely criticised for its decision to cancel some trades made earlier in the week, which it said was due to the threat to the viability of some its members.
“The ability of the financial system to get that money to the members in London and then into the exchange I think would have been significantly stressed,” LME CEO Matt Chamberlain told Bloomberg.
5. Oil eases off highs; U.S. inventories eyed
Crude oil prices eased off recent highs, in a further reflection of the slight improvement in global market sentiment.
By 6:20 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 2.3% at $120.92 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 1.7% at $125.75 a barrel.
The upward pressure on oil has also been relieved by realizations that the ban announced by the U.S. and U.K. on Russian oil imports will have a largely symbolic character, owing to the small volumes affected. U.S. imports from Russia were running at less than 100,000 barrels a day so far this year, according to government data.

(Reuters) - An oil-driven inflation shock triggered by the war in Ukraine is forcing Asia's policymakers to rethink their assumptions for 2022, with the risks of weak growth coupled with surging prices adding unwanted complexity to monetary setting plans.
Having largely lagged their Western counterparts in scrapping harsh pandemic restrictions, Asian economies, among the largest consumers of global commodities, now face the threat of crippling inflation.
For some central banks in the region, such as New Zealand, South Korea and Singapore, deep worries about prices and imported inflation have already set off aggressive policy tightening cycles. For most others, however, the need to sustain a fragile recovery from the pandemic slump is likely to complicate deliberations.
Matt Comyn, chief executive at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY), the country's largest retail bank, said his customers are already talking about surging input costs for their businesses.
""Raising interest rates doesn't necessarily help that - it's a different funding proposition for central banks,"" he told a conference this week. ""They're taking extreme steps because extreme steps are warranted in light of what's happening in Ukraine and Russia.""
Analysts worry the Ukraine crisis could upend the region's economy through various channels including slowing trade, though the biggest hit will likely come from soaring energy costs.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) expects the energy shock to knock 0.3-0.5 of a percentage point off China's economic growth by boosting output costs, curbing consumption and dampening external demand.
Soaring fuel costs will deal a severe blow to the economy of resource-poor Japan, forcing the central bank to keep monetary policy ultra-loose even as inflation creeps up towards its elusive 2% target.
Fending off the hit to growth from high fuel costs appears to be the priority for many other Asian central banks.
Even though rising fuel costs and the risk of abrupt capital outflows keep pressure on them to tighten policy, many emerging Asian central banks appear to prefer going slow in raising interest rates.
BIGGER RISK IF WAR PERSISTS
Thailand might miss the government's forecast of 3.5-4.5% economic growth this year due to the impact of the Ukraine crisis on tourism, trade and domestic consumption, its finance minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith said on Tuesday.
While inflation is already at a 13-year high, Thailand's central bank won't hike rates any time soon, analysts say.
""If we acknowledge that the root of inflation is from a supply shock rather than excessive demand, it is prudent to keep monetary policy accommodative,"" said Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital markets research at Kasikornbank.
The Philippines' central bank warned that under a worst-case scenario of oil prices reaching $120-$140 a barrel this year, inflation would average between 4.4% and 4.7% - above its 2.0-4.0% target band.
But Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno said in a statement on Sunday the country has sufficient buffers, signaling that it won't resort to imminent rate hikes to counter capital outflows.
Australia's central bank chief said on Wednesday the Ukraine conflict was a major downside risk for the global economy, with the biggest impact coming through inflation.
However, he noted underlying inflation in Australia was still well below levels seen in the United States and Britain.
""The recent lift in inflation has brought us closer to the point where inflation is sustainably in the target range. But we are not yet at that point,"" Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe said on Wednesday.
""We can be patient in a way that countries with substantially higher rates of inflation cannot,"" he said in a sign the RBA will carefully assess the impact of the crisis before likely raising rates later in the year.
Some analysts, however, warn of bigger challenges for Asian policymakers if the war and rising fuel costs persist, particularly for those reliant on fuel imports.

""Inflation has been fairly subdued in many Asian emerging economies, allowing central banks to maintain easy monetary policy,"" said Toru Nishihama, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo.

Washington is threatening to add companies to a trade blacklist if they skirt new export curbs against Russia, as it ramps up efforts to keep a vast array of technology out of the country that invaded Ukraine last month.

(Reuters) - Japanese investors in February sold the most overseas debt in a month in nearly two years on concerns over monetary tightening by the world's major central banks and an escalation in Russia-Ukraine conflict.
According to Japan's Ministry of Finance data, domestic investors sold a net 3.2 trillion Japanese yen ($27.64 billion)in overseas bonds, the biggest since April 2020.
Meanwhile, the data showed they bought foreign equities worth 322 billion yen.

""It’s also true that Japanese bonds bear-steepened a lot in February and reduced relative attractiveness of foreign bonds as there are growing concern over policy change at the BoJ,"" said Naka Matsuzawa, chief Japan macro strategist at Nomura.
The total sales of foreign bonds and equities in the first two months of this year stood at 2.46 billion yen, already surpassing last year's entire sales of 1.5 trillion yen.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Tuesday ruled out the chance of tightening monetary policy or withdrawing stimulus, despite rising expectations that consumer inflation will approach the central bank's 2% target as early as next month.

Meanwhile, data from Bank of Japan showed that Japanese investors purchased U.S. bonds worth 172 billion yen in January but sold U.S. stocks worth 282 billion yen. In the European Union, they purchased 1.19 trillion yen worth of bonds during the same time, and sold 199 billion yen in equities.

Georgieva told a forum hosted by the Financial Times that the funding came on top of $700 million disbursed to Ukraine by the IMF in December, and $2.7 billion in emergency reserves it received as part of an IMF allocation in August.
She said IMF staff were engaged in daily discussions with the Ukrainian authorities to help them manage the economic crisis triggered by the Russian invasion and mobilize financial support and resources.
The IMF chief said the war had delivered a shock to the world economy, sending energy and food prices higher, displacing millions of people and eroding business confidence.
""The unthinkable happened with Russia’s attack on Ukraine,"" she said. ""It is tragic, and it is also consequential.""
The global lender was looking at how best to support some of Ukraine's immediate neighbors, including Moldova, which is seeking help, Georgieva said.
She said it was too early to predict the impact on the global economy of the war and the sweeping sanctions that the United States and its allies have imposed on Russia.

It was unclear how much the Russian economy could shrink, but a recession was ""a very likely outcome,"" she said.

The most cited downside risk to Singapore's growth outlook was a sharper-than-expected pickup in inflation and an associated acceleration in monetary policy tightening by top central banks, the survey of 23 economists by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) showed. 
Trade-reliant Singapore has registered near decade-high inflation rates recently, driven mainly by higher food and energy prices.
Core inflation - the central bank's favoured price measure - is expected to come in at 2.7% this year, the survey showed, in line with the central bank's forecast and up from 1.8% in the last survey in December.
Headline prices are expected to rise 3.6% this year, the survey showed, slightly higher than central bank's forecast of between 2.5% and 3.5%.
Both headline prices and core inflation are expected to ease in 2023, said the survey.
Singapore has yet to release its official gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for 2023. 
Singapore's economy is expected to grow 4% this year, the survey showed, in line with an official forecast of 3% to 5%.
In the first quarter of this year, the economists expect GDP to grow 3.7%.

MAS tightened its monetary policy settings in January this year, in its first out-of-cycle move in seven years as global supply constraints and brisk economic demand increased inflation pressures across the region.
The survey of the views of 23 economists ""who closely monitor the Singapore economy"" was conducted after the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine on Feb. 24, MAS said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The crisis in Ukraine is giving the Bank of Japan a headache not facing other major central banks, forcing it to maintain a more dovish stance on monetary policy despite rising inflationary pressures and a dearth of tools to combat another economic downturn.
Unlike other advanced economies, Japan is still shackled by COVID-19 curbs that are delaying an economic recovery from the pandemic, with growth seen stalling this quarter.
The recent spike in oil and grain prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine also deals a particularly heavy blow to resource-poor Japan, while a projected slowdown in global growth threatens to cripple its export-reliant economy.
That means while inflation is set to approach or even exceed its 2% target in coming months, the BOJ will be forced to focus on risks of renewed economic weakness - a prospect policymakers are discussing, say four sources familiar with its thinking.
""It's a huge risk to Japan's economy that may push down growth this year,"" one of the sources said of rising fuel costs.
""For the BOJ, the near-term focus would be on the damage to the economy, which means it has no reason to withdraw stimulus"" even if inflation briefly hits its target, another source said.
MONETARY POLICY 'POWERLESS'
The BOJ's dovish stance makes it an outlier as the Federal Reserve and other major central banks eye raising interest rates to combat quickening inflation.
Some policymakers see similarities to Japan's situation in 2008, when core consumer inflation exceeded 2% for three months due to soaring energy and commodity prices. The burden on households pushed the economy into stagnation, even before the collapse of Lehman Brothers jolted global markets.
What's different this time is that the BOJ has no effective tools left to prop up growth and must swim against the tide of global central banks dialing back crisis-mode stimulus measures.
And the dilemma facing the BOJ could get even more complex.
Analysts expect core consumer inflation to approach 2% in April when the effect of cellphone fee cuts, which kept inflation at 0.2% in January, dissipates.
With prices soaring for various materials and a weak yen inflating the cost of imports, consumer inflation may stay around 2% for longer than in 2008 - when it slid back to around zero in three months.
While the government's fuel subsidies may moderate the rise, SMBC Nikko Securities expects core consumer inflation to hit 2.4% in April and stay above 2% for the rest of this year.
Uncertainty over the fallout from the war may give Japanese firms an excuse to forgo wage hikes, which may hit consumption as households curb spending to make up for rising living costs.
""There's not much to cheer about inflation reaching the BOJ's target,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. ""If inflation stays near 2% and doesn't slow much, household sentiment will sour and hit consumption.""
Unlike its peers which can slow or pause hikes if Ukraine hits growth, the BOJ has no levers to pull with interest rates below zero and its huge asset-buying programme maxed out.
Its short-term rate target is now at -0.1%, much lower than +0.5% in 2008.
While rising risks to growth may embolden doves in the BOJ board, they, too, are cautious of ramping up stimulus partly due to the rising cost and diminishing return of prolonged easing.
Years of heavy asset buying failed to fire up inflation to its 2% target, while ultra-low rates crushed bank margins and forced the BOJ to take a range of steps to ease their strain.
After peaking at 1.80% in 2007, the average interest domestic banks earn from new loans fell to 0.65% as of December last year, BOJ data showed.
Regional banks likely won't be able to cover credit costs with operating profits if another shock to the scale of the Lehman crisis hits, according to a BOJ report released in September.
That means deepening negative rates may backfire by sapping banks' ability to weather market turbulence, analysts say.

""Monetary policy is powerless to deal with situations like now, where inflation is spiking more on supply factors than strong demand,"" said Nobuyasu Atago, a former BOJ official who is now chief economist at Ichiyoshi Securities.
""The BOJ can't tighten policy but can't ease, either. Having used up all its tools, there's not much it can do.""

""The war has aggravated those uncertainties in ways that will reverberate across the world, harming the most vulnerable people in the most fragile places,"" Gill said.
""It's too soon to tell the degree to which the conflict will alter the global economic outlook.""

Gill said estimates from a forthcoming World Bank publication suggest that a 10% oil price increase that persists for several years can cut growth in commodity-importing developing economies by a tenth of a percentage point.
Oil prices have more than doubled over the last six months.
""If this lasts, oil could shave a full percentage point of growth from oil importers like China, Indonesia, South Africa, and Turkey,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Middle Eastern and Chinese sovereign wealth funds are likely to avoid new deals in Russia for now after its invasion of Ukraine, said the author of a report published on Wednesday that showed record investment last year by funds around the world.
Russia attracted the sixth-highest number of sovereign wealth deals from October 2020 to December 2021, according to the Sovereign Wealth Funds report, a collaboration between IE University's Center for the Governance of Change and ICEX-Invest in Spain.
Investors and companies have rushed to announce they are getting out of Russia, after the United States, the European Union and their allies imposed harsh sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine, sparking a raft of countermeasures from Moscow.
""We have seen Western funds pulling out (of Russia) ... What is interesting is to see whether Middle East and China funds will decide to do the same or remain or maybe increase because there is less competition,"" said Javier Capape, the report's author.
""Probably, I assume, given their typical prudence, particularly in the Middle East, we will not see new agreements until this clarifies a little bit.""
Three times as many deals were done as in the previous period, worth about $120 billion, the report said, with the United States the top destination, attracting 129 deals, or 28.8% of the total, followed by India and China. 
The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which had $10 billion under management in February, had prominently cited its record in attracting international co-investments into Russian companies on its website, which is now down, Capape said.
There were 14 sovereign wealth investments in Russia in the October 2020-December 2021 period, worth $2.6 billion, his research found.
Half were made by the RDIF in conjunction with Abu Dhabi's investment fund Mubadala or the China Investment Corporation, four by just Mubadala and three by the RDIF on its own.

Gulf Arab states have so far taken a neutral stance in the crisis between Western countries and Russia, with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) calling for de-escalation, restraint and diplomacy to end the war in Ukraine.
China has refused to condemn Russia's attack on Ukraine or call it an invasion. China's foreign minister on Monday described the country's friendship with Russia as ""rock solid.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Recession in Europe and North America may be the inevitable price for defending freedom, resisting aggression and upholding international law in Ukraine.
U.S. and European leaders now face an unpleasant choice as they decide how aggressively to use economic sanctions in response to Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine.
The moral imperative is to exert maximum economic pressure rapidly on Russia to end the fighting in Ukraine as quickly as possible and repel Russian forces, which Moscow says are involved in a ""special operation"" with no plans for occupation.
But the economic imperative is to protect businesses and employment at home, minimise the fallout for lower income households and sustain support for sanctions policies.
In mid-February, top policymakers appeared to have thought they could reconcile these objectives through a carefully controlled sanctions escalation strategy exempting oil and gas trade.
But that plan has broken down as a result of Russia's slow progress on the battlefield and immense diplomatic and public pressure on U.S. and European leaders to maximise sanctions swiftly.
U.S. and European policymakers must choose between imposing maximum pressure on Russia by cutting off oil and gas purchases or a more modest approach that will avert recession.
RECESSION INDICATORS
Even before the invasion, the rapid economic rebound after the pandemic was beginning to decelerate, price increases were accelerating and interest rates were set to rise.
The flattening U.S. Treasury yield curve indicated a heightened probability of a mid-cycle slowdown or end-of-cycle recession in the next year.
Russia's invasion and the sanctions that have followed super-charged these trends, disrupting supply chains, sending energy and food prices soaring and flattening the yield curve further.
The financial crisis in 2008/2009 and the pandemic in 2020/2021 were demand-side shocks that could be offset by lowering interest rates, buying bonds, cutting taxes and boosting unemployment insurance.
But the invasion and sanctions are a supply-side shocks that have cut the global economy’s production capacity so they cannot be offset in the same way.
Boosting demand by more bond buying, cutting taxes or increasing government spending would simply worsen the production-consumption gap and fuel even faster inflation.
The crisis threatens to disrupt global trade in critical raw materials and industrial components ranging from aluminium, nickel and noble gases to car parts, ocean shipping and overland rail freight.
But the biggest and most immediate impact is being felt in petroleum and natural gas, where Russia is one of the world’s top exporters, and grain, where both Russia and Ukraine are major global suppliers.
Energy and food prices, which were already rising before the invasion, are now climbing at the fastest rate for 50 years, at a time when wages are increasing slowly, putting pressure on businesses and household finances.
Lower income households in advanced and developing economies will be hit particularly hard since they spend a much higher share of their income on food and fuel and have fewer options to modify spending patterns.
UNCONTROLLED ESCALATION
Top U.S. and European policymakers seem to have been alert to the risks when threatening to impose unprecedented sanctions in an effort to deter Russia’s invasion.
U.S. and European sanctions were carefully crafted to exclude trade in oil, gas and other energy items from the embargo and to permit energy-related financial transactions.
Planning had assumed that sanctions would be intensified progressively and measures targeting oil and gas flows would be imposed last, if at all.
The controlled escalation strategy was designed to deter and punish Russia while limiting costs for motorists, households and energy-intensive industries in the United States and Europe.
But both sides of the conflict appear to have miscalculated the resolution of the other and underestimated what it would take to bring the conflict to a swift end.
For Russia, that meant misjudging its ability to deliver a rapid victory before sanctions plunged its economy into turmoil.
The United States and Europe, meanwhile, seemed to have assumed incremental sanctions could deter an invasion or bring it to a quick halt before the wider economic fallout was felt.
For the West, the result is now broader sanctions that could last longer than anticipated, increasing economic disruption.
LIMITING DISRUPTION
U.S. and European policymakers seem to have calculated they could take a strong public line on sanctions while letting oil and gas traders to continue purchasing Russian fuel.
But most traders have concluded that the legal and reputational risks are too great and have shunned Russian exports, bringing oil flows to a halt.
Shell (LON:RDSa) felt the impact acutely. It purchased a Russian crude cargo on March 4, only to be met with such a public outcry that on March 8 it apologised and said it would stop spot purchases immediately.
Now political pressure is mounting in the United States, and to a lesser extent in Europe which is far more reliant on Russia, for a complete ban on Russian oil and gas imports.
The possibility that the United States and Europe might initiate an embargo has already sent oil and gas prices surging to levels that will be unaffordable for many households and firms if sustained for an extended period.
In response, Russia has indicated it could cut oil and gas exports if economic warfare continued to escalate, a move that would trigger an immediate full-blown energy crisis.
There is no way the United States and Europe can replace Russian oil and gas exports fully within the next 12 months or absorb the consequences of a further price spike without entering recession.
European economies, with much bigger economic exposure to Russia, are particularly at risk of heading into a downturn.
PHASED SANCTIONS?
U.S. and European policymakers may try to announce that they will progressively reduce oil and gas purchases from Russia according to a fixed timetable over the next two to three years.
Such a phased reduction in Russian oil and gas purchases every six months would be similar to previous progressive sanctions on Iran's oil exports.
Such a move would give more time to secure replacement supplies from others including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, Venezuela and the U.S. shale industry over the 12-36 months.
It could also give U.S. and European policymakers negotiating leverage with Russia while reducing, if not eliminating, the immediate upward pressure on energy prices.
Progressive sanctions might even prove more effective if they limit the economic fallout in North America and Europe, and make them more economically and politically sustainable in the medium term.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than $25 billion from the U.S. Treasury Department's Emergency Rental Assistance program has been spent or obligated over the past year through January 2022, Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said on Tuesday.
In prepared remarks at a housing agency in Memphis, Tennessee, Adeyemo said that he expects the ""vast majority"" of the remaining funds in the $46.6 billion COVID-19 relief program to be deployed to households or paid to local grantee agencies by the middle of 2022.
The program was funded by two COVID-19 relief acts passed by Congress - a $900 billion aid package in December 2020 under former president Donald Trump and the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan signed into law a year ago this week by U.S. President Joe Biden, marking his first major policy victory.
In January, the Treasury said that about $1.95 billion was spent on rent, utilities and arrears to 431,717 households. That represents a slight decline from December 2021, when 559,280 households received $2.44 billion in assistance.
The program's monthly payouts peaked in the fall of 2021 and have tapered off since then as U.S. employment has recovered.
In Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee, Adeyemo said that the program has made some 16,000 payments totaling $43.1 million to keep families in their rented homes. The city and county partnered with local courts and non-profit groups to divert eviction cases to the rental assistance program.
Adeyemo said the Treasury also was encouraging state and local governments to use their share of another federal funding source - the $350 billion State and Local Fiscal Relief Fund - to invest in building more affordable housing. New guidance from the Treasury issued in January clarified affordable housing projects as a qualified use for those funds. 

Adeyemo said increased supply of affordable housing can offset recent increases in rent and other prices in the economy.
""The American Rescue Plan provided a historic sum of money to state local governments that we're hoping that they will use to help address the challenges of affordable housing because they're core to solving and addressing challenges we face in communities all over the country,"" he said.

335,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 03:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Any increased capital spending by U.S. oil and gas producers in response to the surge in crude price should help soften the blow to the economy from an expected pullback in consumer spending. It just won’t be anytime soon.
Americans in the last week have witnessed an unprecedented weekly surge in gasoline prices, now up to $4.17 a gallon based on American Automobile Association data. Prices are likely to go up even more as President Joe Biden details plans to ban imports of Russian energy. 
Economists at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc say that’ll incentivize greater domestic production, which should help alleviate some of the economic fallout. 
“We do believe that higher oil prices will lead to increased domestic energy production which could help offset higher oil prices or any potential U.S. embargo on imports of oil from Russia,” said Michael Gapen, managing director and head of economic research at Barclays. 
At the same time, “increases in domestic oil production are likely to take time and most producers are exercising greater capital discipline than before. It may take six to nine months to see a more meaningful increase in U.S. shale output,” Gapen said.
Before the start of war in Ukraine, producers were gradually adding to rig counts amid shareholder demands of capital discipline and government policy geared toward green energy. Moreover, supply and labor constraints have also been headwinds to a faster pace of production.
Production may ramp up in response to higher prices, according to Credit Suisse. While investment in energy makes up a smaller share of gross domestic product than consumer spending, which accounts for about two thirds, investment “already had significant upside even before the current shock,” economists Jeremy Schwartz, Xiao Cui and Justin Guo said in a note.
A sustained 1% contraction in global oil supply boosts prices by about 8%, representing a $15 billion hit for U.S. consumers, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) economist Peter McCrory said in a March 4 note. As a result, the firm lowered its estimate of gross domestic product by 0.25 percentage point annualized in each of the first two quarters of the year.
“Overall, we see higher oil prices as posing a modest drag on GDP growth, which we still expect to be above-trend this year,” McCrory said in an interview.
Barclays economists said in a March 3 note that consumption growth could be about 0.5 percentage point lower by the fourth quarter as consumers generally absorb higher fuel prices by cutting back spending in other areas. 
Still, since the U.S. exports just about as much petroleum as it imports, and given the enhanced development of U.S. shale production, the country has the ability to ramp up its own production, the economists said. That’ll help offset the drag on reduced household spending, they said.
“The U.S. economy has become much more resilient to changes in oil prices versus decades past; the share of gasoline in U.S. household spending remains near all-time lows and the revolution in shale has changed persistent net petroleum deficits to small net surpluses in recent years,” Barclays economists said in the note.
While boosting domestic production would bolster energy security for the U.S. and its allies, it’s not without challenges. For one, exploration and production firms have been trying to hold the line on expenditures and return more cash to shareholders. Second, supply and labor constraints may be standing in the way of a big production push.
The Permian Basin is suffering from labor shortages, according to Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub. Companies also don’t have enough rigs to support strong growth, and they’ve already used up most of the drilled-but-uncompleted wells that provided a quick uplift in growth in previous up cycles.
“The call for increased production from the U.S. at this point, especially with supply-chain challenges, can’t happen at the level that’s needed,” Hollub said Tuesday during CERAWeek by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), one of the energy industry’s biggest annual gatherings.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“The Biden administration has a powerful tool that could both maximize the cost to Russia for invading Ukraine and lower domestic inflation, and it’s not sanctions. We estimate that increasing U.S. shale production could replace U.S. oil imports from Russia, and even a substantial share of Russia’s exports to Europe.”
-- Anna Wong, economist

Also, a larger push toward domestic oil production runs contrary to the Biden administration’s efforts to shift away from fossil fuels. Toby Rice, chief executive officer at shale driller EQT Corp (NYSE:EQT). said Monday on Bloomberg Television that there has been no direct dialogue between the White House and U.S. producers.
“It’s now time to build those channels of communication, and it has to come from the government reaching out in a non-confrontational way,” energy historian Daniel Yergin said in a Bloomberg TV interview Monday at CERAWeek.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of more than 140 U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday urged leaders in Congress to approve $52 billion in government subsidies for semiconductor chips production and research.
The U.S. House of Representatives on Feb. 4 narrowly passed a bill aimed at increasing American competitiveness with China in part by allocating $52 billion to boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.
The funding will ""help prevent future shortages that cause GDP drag, job losses, more expensive consumer goods, and national security vulnerabilities,"" said a letter https://matsui.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/matsui.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/20220308%20-%20CHIPS%20letter_0.pdf signed by lawmakers, including Representative Doris Matsui and Senator Mark Warner, both Democrats, and Republican Representative Michael McCaul and Senator John Cornyn.
The lawmakers urged Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to ""immediately begin negotiations to allow votes in the House and Senate as soon as possible.""
President Joe Biden is set to hold an event on semiconductor chips on Wednesday to meet with business leaders and again push for quick passage.
Last month, 22 governors also urged quick action on chips funding.
A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some firms to scale back production.
The Senate voted 68-32 to pass its own bill in June, which includes $52 billion for chips and authorizes $190 billion for U.S. technology and research to compete with China.
The funding includes $2 billion to incentivize production of ""mature node"" semiconductors used by the auto industry and in medical devices, agricultural machinery and some national defense applications.
There are key differences on China provisions in both bills.

The House bill includes a number of trade provisions and would impose additional sanctions on China for its treatment of Uyghurs and offer refugee status for qualifying Hong Kongers. 
The House measure reauthorizes and revises Trade Adjustment Assistance programs, which help workers whose jobs or pay is hurt by imports, and reforms the Generalized System of Preferences, a preferential tariff system for imports.

LISBON/BERLIN (Reuters) - Already struggling with rising living costs, Europeans now face an even deeper hit to their livelihoods as the conflict in Ukraine pushes fuel and food prices higher and threatens to undermine a fragile economic recovery. 
The surging price of crude oil on world markets has led to the biggest ever weekly jump in gasoline prices at some service stations around Europe, pushing them in some cases above 2 euros for a litre ($8.25/gallon) of unleaded fuel. 
""The problem is not the price it will be tomorrow, but how much it (gasoline) will cost 15 days from now, we think that it is going to cost much more. I think bad times are ahead of us,"" 76-year-old Madrid pensioner Alejandro Oterino said.
That fear of prices spiralling out of control is precisely what the European Central Bank must allay at its meeting on Thursday. ECB chief Christine Lagarde will aim to prove it can keep a lid on euro-area inflation that had already leapt to a higher than expected 5.8% ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
""There is a natural pressure on central banks to keep (inflation) expectations low via communication but at the same time they risk losing credibility,"" said Gunther Schnabl, economics professor at Leipzig University.
In Portugal - western Europe's poorest country with 10% of the population on a minimum wage of 705 euros - motorists have been rushing to fill tanks before any more price hikes come in. A diesel car with a 50-litre tank costs 91 euros to fill up.
""If the prices keep rising, I might have to resort to social services to eat and drink,"" said 56-year-old Uber (NYSE:UBER) driver Antonio Dias in Lisbon.
""If this continues it will not make sense to continue doing this type of work,"" he said, urging the government to cut fuel taxes which currently amount to some 50% of gasoline end-prices.
Knock-on impacts are being felt already. Teresa Soares, who sells food products to restaurants in the Portuguese capital, said she had no alternative to her car for making deliveries, so would just have to shoulder the extra cost on her business.
""If this was my private car, I would probably put it aside and not drive it,"" said Soares, 53.
German motoring organisation ADAC estimated that diesel prices had spiked a massive 28% in six days from March 1. Heating oil prices are also rising as homeowners are stepping up purchases of the oil, still used by many Germans to heat their houses.
""Many users fear supply bottlenecks due to the war between Russia and Ukraine and are now filling their (heating oil) tanks while we are still in winter, which they usually don't do,"" it said.
""STAGFLATION"" SPECTRE
For now, increases in the end-prices of food have been less dramatic. But with Ukraine and Russia both exporters of grain, and Russia a major supplier of fertilisers, concern is growing that this will add to inflationary pressures as the war goes on.
Some Spanish supermarkets including market leader Mercadona are restricting sales of sunflower oil, which mostly comes from Ukraine, after detecting what the ASEDAS supermarket sector body called ""atypical consumer behaviour"". 
Spain's Agriculture Ministry urged calm and said there were no shortages for now.
The fear now is that this will hit consumer spending even harder, especially among the low-income households who fared worst during pandemic lockdowns in which they did not benefit from furloughs or faced other hits to their livelihoods.
In Britain, the Resolution Foundation think tank estimated the conflict would lead to wider inflation, shaving 4% off the real level of typical household incomes over the coming year, the sharpest fall in nearly half a century.
Italy's Economy Ministry said in a report on Monday that ""the surge in energy prices and the consequent rise in inflation represent a strong risk for citizens' economic wellbeing.""
This is all raising the spectre of ""stagflation"", the combination of inflation and economic slowdown commonly associated with the early 1970s and which central banks and governments find so difficult to cure.
In light of the conflict, ECB policymakers are tussling over whether to pause moves to wind down the unprecedented amount of stimulus they have used to prop up the euro economy over the past decade - a period in which the euro zone slowly emerged from a global recession only to land up in a new pandemic-era collapse.

University of Leipzig's Schnabl said that with governments now inevitably having to pump more support into the economy to help the worst-hit, the only way to avoid a vicious circle of more inflation was for the bank to pursue its tightening path.
""The very important policy consequence from my point of view is to stop central bank-financed government expenditure,"" he said. ""And that will only work based on a very slow but really decisive monetary policy tightening process.""

LVIV (Reuters) - Ukraine will service its debt on time and in full, bolstered by financing from allies and international institutions who have rushed to Kyiv's aid since the Russian invasion, the finance ministry told Reuters on Tuesday.
""We continue honouring our debt even in these extraordinary conditions,"" the ministry said in a written comment.
Ukraine paid almost $698 million of its external obligations in the first two months of the year and faces a further $3.7 billion in March-December, including peaks of $499 million in May and $1.73 billion in September.
The ministry said Ukraine has access both to concessional and commercial financing. It has issued so-called ""war bonds"" on the domestic market after borrowing on the overseas market became expensive. 
""We are working to maximize the funding from both sources to meet all the budget needs including debt repayments,"" it said.
Kyiv expects to receive 300 million euros from the European Union and $350 million from the World Bank this week. The U.S. government offered $1 billion of loan guarantees last month.
The International Monetary Fund said its board was expected to consider Ukraine's request for $1.4 billion in emergency financing in the coming days. Ukraine also has $2.2 billion available through June under an existing stand-by arrangement.

""The IMF, the World bank, the G7 countries and other partner countries announced their financial support to Ukraine and some of it has already been disbursed,"" the ministry said.
Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, shelling cities and hitting Ukrainian military installations and causing more than 2 million people to flee.

Russia's financial markets have been thrown into turmoil by severe economic sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. 
The central bank has more than doubled its key interest rate to 20% and provided extra liquidity to banks, and the government has rolled out some support measures, but the rouble has tanked and securities like bonds have sold off heavily.

(Reuters) - The U.S. economy could get a $1 trillion boost over the next 10 years if female labor market participation grew to the levels seen in other developed economies, a report on gender equality said on Tuesday.
Published on International Women's day by Moody's (NYSE:MCO), the report said women had been particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic as economic lockdowns disrupted schooling, child care and female-dominated industries like education and healthcare.
While that hit women globally, more left work in the United States and Canada than in the UK, Germany, Sweden and Australia, partly due to a lack of family-friendly policies such as guaranteed paid family leave and child-care subsidies, it said.
In the United States, the participation gap between prime-age women - women during their most productive years aged 25-54 - and men in the same age group stood at 11.4% in 2021 compared with a 6.6% gap in the UK and 4% in Sweden, the report added.
If new policies helped prime-age women join the labor market at the same rate as in other developed countries, Moody's said real U.S. gross domestic product would grow 4% above its baseline forecast over the next decade.
The report comes as policymakers and investors, particularly in Europe, increasingly take a deeper look at the degree to which companies consider gender and other forms of diversity when hiring and promoting staff.
Moody's, which provides credit ratings, said its data showed higher credit ratings not only correlated with greater board-level gender diversity, but also with a higher percentage of women in executive-level roles.

""We consider the presence of women on boards – and the diversity of opinion they bring – as being supportive of good corporate governance, which is positive for credit quality,"" it said.
Amid the growing interest in diversity, Moody’s said it expected more debt issuers to link gender equity targets into their financing, helping issuance for green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked (GSSS) bonds to hit a forecast $1.35 trillion globally in 2022.

Investing.com -- It would be an exaggeration to say that the European Central Bank has the hardest job in Europe this week, but the war in Ukraine has made an already tricky balancing act much trickier.
The bank has to steer between two increasingly frightening risks. The invasion, and the Western sanctions against Russia that it triggered, have sent energy prices through the roof, threatening to push inflation – which was already running at a euro-era high in February – higher for longer. That could easily start a wage-price spiral of a kind not seen in Europe for over 30 years.
On the other hand, moving now to tighten financial conditions risks adding inflicting further pain on a Eurozone economy that is only just emerging from the pandemic, sapping confidence among both businesses and households.
“No one can seriously expect the ECB to start normalizing monetary policy at such a moment of high uncertainty,” said ING economist Carsten Brzeski in a note to clients at the weekend. But given the movement in energy prices – and the lack of obvious short-term ways to bring them back down – Brzeski warned that “the eurozone is facing a high risk of stagflation.”
Inflation shot up to 5.8% in February, due largely to energy price movements and apparently not – in contrast to the U.S. and U.K. – supported by any real upward shifts in wages and wage expectations. For the last decade or more, energy - which represents just under 10% of the basket of goods and services that Eurostat uses to determine its inflation figures - has been little more than a distraction for the ECB: volatile from month to month, but essentially in the same grinding downtrend as Eurozone prices more broadly.
All that has changed in recent months. There has been mounting evidence that rising prices have been caused by long-term structural changes – the results of poor planning and policy rather than cyclical effects that are usually corrected by the market before central banks need to worry about them.
Prices this year have reflected not just an incipient war premium, but also longer-running issues affecting energy markets: environmentally-friendly policies that have stunted growth in fossil fuel supply, the inability of OPEC and its allies to satisfy the fuel demand of a recovering global economy, and increasingly acute availability problems at France’s ageing fleet of nuclear reactors.
If things looked bad in February, they have worsened drastically since. Benchmark prices for natural gas, which had bumped along around 15 euros a megawatt-hour since the start of the pandemic, have soared as the Continent has woken up to the awful reality that is dependent for its energy on a repressive, expansionist country that appears determined to assert itself. Futures continued to trade at over 205 euros/MWh on Monday, some 14 times their recent average.
Crude oil prices, meanwhile, which pootled around $60 a barrel in the years before the pandemic, have doubled to over $120 a barrel. Should prices stick around that level for any length of time, consumers will inevitably be hit hard. Money spent on heating the house and getting to work is money that can’t be spent on other goods and services.
Even ECB chief economist Philip Lane – a noted ‘dove’ – said last week that “it is essential to avoid that a spell of temporarily-high inflation pressures – even if arising from a supply shock – becomes entrenched by permanently altering longer-term inflation expectations.”
In the U.S., fluctuations in energy prices tend to redistribute wealth within the country, between regions that are net producers and net consumers. But in Europe, which imports nearly all its energy needs, high energy prices mean a net transfer of wealth out of the region: lower profit margins for companies, less disposable income for consumers.
As a result, says Mark Dowding, chief investment officer of BlueBay Asset Management in London, the hit to Eurozone growth this year is likely to be between 1% and 1.5%, while inflation likely to overshoot previous expectations by the same amount.
The degree of uncertainty is still so high that there seems little it can do except hold tight and wait to see whether high energy prices create more inflation than they destroy growth. Holger Schmieding, head of research at Berenberg Bank, argues that the ECB – unlike the Fed – can afford to hold fire because the Eurozone’s pandemic stimulus created nowhere near the same degree of excess demand.
As such, Brzeski expects Christine Lagarde and her troops to keep to their plan of ending the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program this month, while shifting some of its bond purchases to a more tightly regulated Asset Purchase Program to avoid withdrawing too much stimulus at once.
By contrast, expectations of interest rate hikes already by the fall – which were raised by Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot and others last month, now seem rather charmingly dated.
ING’s Brzeski reckons that “if everything goes well, net asset purchases can still end in the third quarter and interest rates can be hiked for the first time before the end of the year.”
That may be. But the last two weeks have left few people willing to assume that everything will go well. Inflation expectations are unlikely to stay in check unless something – anything – is done to bring energy prices down. And that remains as far out of the ECB’s hands as ever."

MILAN (Reuters) - European bank stocks have lost a fifth of their value since Russia invaded Ukraine last month. 
Western sanctions against Moscow have upended the financial sector, but the main hit to banks are the threats to the economic outlook and the prospect of higher interest rates.
Investors worry banks will need to again hike loan loss provisions, which had been declining after the pandemic-driven spike in 2020. The crisis is also reducing the chances of higher interest rates, which would have boosted income from lending.

Some banks, however, are also directly exposed.
Italian and French banks have the largest Russianexposure, representing just over $25 billion each at the end ofSeptember, followed by Austrian banks with $17.5 billion, Bank of International Settlements data shows.
U.S. bank exposure totals $14.7 billion, BIS data shows.

Following are some banks with significant Russianexposure.
EUROPEAN BANKS
RAIFFEISEN BANK INTERNATIONAL (RBI) 
RBI has operated in Russia since the collapse of the SovietUnion and its business there contributed almost a third of its net profit of 1.5 billion euros last year.
RBI's Russian business holds 2.4 billion euros in capital, or 18% of consolidated equity. Russia's 10th-largest bank by assets, it employs around 8,700 staff.
RBI's said its overall Russian exposure totalled 22.85 billion euros at end of last year, more than half relating to the corporate private sector.
Russia's central bank accounts for 8% of RBI's exposure tothe country, sovereign entities 4%. 
The overall figure comprises 11.6 billion euros in customerloans (or 11.5% of group), more than 80% in roubles.
Cross-border exposure to Russia is only 1.6 billion euroswith no parent funding from Vienna. RBI also holds 2.2billion euros in loans to Ukrainian customers.
SOCIETE GENERALE
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), which controls Rosbank, had 18.6 billion euros of overall exposure to Russia at the end of last year - or 1.7% of the group total.
More than 80%, or 15.4 billion euros, is held locally by Rosbank while cross-border exposure amounts to 3.2 billion euros, including 600 million euros in off-balance sheet items.
The French bank, which started doing business in Russia in 1872, left in 1917 and returned in 1973, said its Russian activities in 2021 represented 2.7% of group net income.
Last week it said it could withstand an extreme scenario where its Russian business is confiscated, which would shave only half a percentage point off its core capital.
Of SocGen's Russian exposure, 41% is to retail and 31% to corporates. Exposure to Russian sovereign entities stands at 3.7 billion euros.
UNICREDIT
The Italian bank's overall exposure to Russia totalled 14.2 billion euros as of mid-2021. That includes 8 billion euros in loans extended by its Russian arm.
The rest are off-balance sheet items and cross-border loans mainly granted by UniCredit to large companies outside Russia.
UniCredit's subsidiary, AO UniCredit Bank, ranks as Russia's 14th largest bank. Its 2.3 billion euros in equity account for 3.7% of the group's total. 
A complete write-off of the Russian business would cost UniCredit around 1 billion euros, knocking about 35 basis points off its core capital ratio.
UniCredit has said its Russian franchise accounted for just 3% of group revenues and provisions covered 84% of its local non-performing exposures.
CREDIT AGRICOLE
The French bank said on Monday its overall exposure to Russia, including both onshore and offshore items, totalled 6.7 billion euros, or 0.6% of its total commercial lending portfolio as of Dec. 31, 2021.
That comprises 2.9 billion euros of offshore exposure to 15 large Russian corporates, notably producers and exporters of commodities.
Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) operates in Ukraine and Russia through two fully-owned subsidiaries. Crédit Agricole Ukraine holds 226 million euros in equity. That of Russian arm CACIB AO, a subsidiary of Crédit Agricole CIB, stands at 150 million euros.
Credit Agricole said it was monitoring closely its exposures to Russia, but there would be no impact on its 2021 dividends.
INTESA SANPAOLO
Italy's biggest bank has financed major investment projectsin Russia, such as the Blue Stream gas pipeline and the sale ofa stake in oil producer Rosneft. It handles more thanhalf of all commercial transactions between Italy and Russia. 
Intesa's loan exposure to Russia was 5.57 billion euros atthe end of 2021, or 1.1% of the total. 
Its subsidiaries in Russia and Ukraine have assets, respectively, of 1 billion and 300 million euros, which together represent just 0.1% of the group total.
Intesa has said it was conducting a strategic review of its Russian presence.
ING 
The Dutch bank has around 4.5 billion euros in outstandingloans with Russian clients and around 600 million euros withclients in Ukraine, out of a total loan book worth more than 600billion euros.
U.S. BANKS
CITIGROUP
Citi said last week its total exposure to Russia amounted to nearly $10 billion and it was working to bring it down.
That comprises third-party exposures worth $8.2 billion, of which $1.0 billion in cash at the Bank of Russia and other financial institutions and $1.8 billion of reverse repos.
Citi also has $1.6 billion of exposures to additional Russian counterparties outside of its Russian subsidiary that are not included in that $8.2 billion.

By comparison, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reported last month $293 million in net exposure to Russia, as well as a total of $414 million of market exposure as of December 2021.

Oil and other commodity prices have sky-rocketed and markets have been heavily volatile since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month.
""If the tensions are prolonged or escalate further, the markdowns to this year's growth outlook may need to be denominated in percentage points,"" Citigroup analyst Nathan Sheets wrote in a note. 
The loss to GDP growth would be limited to several tenths of a percentage point, with the brunt of it felt in Europe, Sheets added.
China on Saturday stressed on economic stability as its top priority, as the world's second-largest economy targeted economic growth of around 5.5% this year. 
Citigroup believes this level to be ""solid by any metric"", even if slow compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Increasing expansion in emerging Asian markets along with a strong U.S. labor market are also factors that will support global growth, the brokerage added.

U.S. private employers hired more workers than expected in February and data for the prior month was revised sharply higher to show strong job gains instead of losses, aligning with other reports that have painted an upbeat picture of the labor market
In order to balance the global economy, inflation and commodity supply shock, Sheets wrote central banks, ""will opt to be somewhat more gradual than they would have been otherwise"" regarding their interest rate hikes.

Investing.com -- Nickel prices go crazy as stress builds in the world's commodity markets. The European Union will publish new ideas on how to wean itself off Russian energy, a prospect that sent the ruble down another 4% to a new record low. U.S. stocks are seen posting a dead-cat bounce after Monday's carnage, while the Treasury will sell 3-year notes into a weakening market.   Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL), Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) join the exodus from Russia. Oil stays well bid as Shell (LON:RDSa) self-sanctions but gas prices ease off after Germany plays down a Russian threat to stop current supplies. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to show new cut-price iPhone. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 8th March. 
1. Nickel goes crazy
The stress in global financial markets as a result of Russia’s war in Ukraine is becoming ever more obvious.
The London Metals Exchange was forced to suspend trading in Nickel and took the rare step of saying it may adjust or cancel some trades retroactively after a violent short squeeze took the main contract to over $101,000 a ton. That’s about seven times where it was trading before the pandemic and more than twice its previous peak, hit in 2007.
The sharpness of the move appears to have been caused by an industrial client of China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF), which needed to be given extra time to meet its margin calls on Monday.
Nickel is mainly used by the auto and construction sectors for stainless steel but demand has mushroomed in recent years due to its use as a battery metal in electric vehicles. The average Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) model uses 45 kilograms of the metal.
2. Oil stays bid as Shell self-sanctionsr; natural gas prices ease  in Europe; STEO, API eyed
Crude oil prices stayed above $120 a barrel as Shell confirmed it would no longer buy Russian oil or gas through either spot or long-term markets. That reinforces the ‘self-sanctioning’ dynamic visible in the market for the last two weeks.
By 6:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 2.7% at $122.61 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 2.9% at $126.76 a barrel.
Benchmark European natural gas futures, however, eased off after German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he didn’t expect Russia to follow through on a threat to stop gas supplies to Europe through existing pipelines.  
The extreme level of prices will add spice to the U.S. government’s Short-Term Energy Outlook, which is released at 12 PM ET (1700 GMT). The American Petroleum Institute’s weekly inventory report, meanwhile, is due at 4:30 PM ET, as usual, and market participants will be sensitive to any further signs of high prices causing demand destruction. National average gasoline prices hit a record high of $4.17 a gallon on Monday.
3. Stocks set to open with unimpressive bounce; Adidas, Estee Lauder, Adobe join the Russian exodus
U.S. stocks are set to open with a modest rebound later, after another day of heavy losses caused by the war in Ukraine and the Western measures to punish Russia for it.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 75 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.1%. The three main cash indices had lost between 2.3% and 3.6% on Monday, with the Dow becoming the latest benchmark index to enter correction territory.
At 1 PM ET, the U.S. Treasury will auction three-year notes in the first of three big debt sales this week. Yields hit their highest in two weeks on Monday as initial flight-to-quality flows faded under pressure from ongoing fears about inflation.
Stocks in focus later are likely to include Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL), Adidas (DE:ADSGN) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), the latest big names to join the exodus from Russia.
4. EU to get serious about cutting energy dependence? 
European bonds and central European currencies rallied after a Bloomberg report saying that the European Union will consider issuing joint debt to finance spending deemed necessary to strengthen Europe’s defenses and wean itself off Russian energy supplies.
The move would be a further radical step towards a common fiscal capacity for the EU, adding to the Next Generation EU debt that was launched to finance the rebuilding of the economy after the pandemic.
The Polish zloty, Hungarian forint and koruna, all of which have underperformed sharply in the last two weeks, bounced strongly.   
The European Commission is due later to issue a new strategy document detailing how it intends to cut the EU’s dependence on Russian gas, fresh evidence of the profound change in strategic thinking caused the invasion of Ukraine. The ruble, meanwhile, fell another 4% against the dollar to a new record low.
5. Apple expected to show new cut-price iPhone
Apple is widely expected to preview a new cut-price version of its iPhone at a corporate event on the West Coast later.
The move appears to suggest a greater degree of price sensitivity at the company for its flagship product than was evident in the last two years, when it took advantage of record high demand for hardware upgrades to raise prices substantially for its new models.",,,,,

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission has prepared a new package of sanctions against Russia and Belarus over the invasion of Ukraine that will hit additional Russian oligarchs and politicians and three Belarusian banks, three sources told Reuters on Tuesday.
The draft sanctions were adopted by the EU executive on Tuesday morning and will be discussed by EU ambassadors at a meeting starting at 1400 GMT, one source said.
The draft package will ban three Belarusian banks from the SWIFT banking system and add several more oligarchs and Russian lawmakers to the EU blacklist, the sources told Reuters.
The package also bans exports from the EU of naval equipment and software to Russia and provides guidance on the monitoring of cryptocurrencies to avoid their use to circumvent EU sanctions, the sources said.
Moscow describes its actions in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to disarm its neighbour and arrest leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis"". Ukraine and its Western allies call this a baseless pretext for an invasion to conquer a country of 44 million people.
EU diplomats have so far approved sanctions proposed by the EU Commission against Russia and Belarus without any changes.
The EU has already excluded seven Russian banks from SWIFT, but had not included Belarusian banks.
The sources declined to name the new lenders to be sanctioned.
One source said the package also listed oligarchs and members of Russia's Federation Council, which is the upper house of the Russian Parliament.
So far EU sanctions have hit hundreds of members of the lower house, the Duma, who voted in favour of Russia's recognition of the self-proclaimed people's republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.

The EU will also expand its ban on EU exports of advanced technology to Russia, mostly supporting the ban on the export of maritime technology, the sources said.
The ban on the export of naval equipment and software to Russia is mainly meant to hit its shipping sector, one source said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Fines on companies that send workers from low-pay EU states to richer member states and fail to comply with the latter's red-tape should be proportionate, Europe's top court said on Tuesday.
The issue of so-called 'posted' workers employed on contracts that need only guarantee the host country's minimum wage has divided EU states for years. 
The case before the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) arose after an Austrian court sought guidance on a 54,000 euro ($58,708.80) fine levied by an Austrian administrative authority on a Slovakian company that had sent workers to Austria.
The administrative body said the Slovakian company had failed to comply with Austrian labour law obligations to retain wage and social security documents for the posted workers.
CJEU judges said penalties should not be disproportionate.
""Posting of workers: national courts must ensure that penalties for non-compliance with administrative obligations are proportionate,"" the Court said.
""National courts may apply a national system of penalties contrary to the directive concerning the posting of workers as long as it ensures proportionality of the penalties.""
The case is C-205/20 Bezirkshauptmannschaft Hartberg-Fürstenfeld.

A rich-poor divide over the issue of posted workers prompted the European Commission to adopt rules four years ago that limit the right of citizens from poorer member states to work in richer ones on a low salary.

The newly added sanctions target 20 Russians including deputy chiefs of staff for President Vladamir Putin's administration, deputy chairmen of the state parliament, the head of the Chechen Republic and executives of companies with close ties to the government such as Volga Group, Transneft and Wagner.
It also includes 12 Belarusian government officials and business people, as well as 12 organisations in Russia and Belarus. 
Payment and capital transactions with those on the list must require government permits from now on, the ministry said in a statement.

Japan is also banning exports of Russia-bound oil refinery equipment and Belarus-bound general-purpose items that could be used by its military, the ministry said.
It will ban exports to the Belarusian defense ministry, armed forces and police organisations, and a Minsk-based company JSC Integral.

351,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 08:45PM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) -Fitch became the second major credit rating firm to suspend its commercial operations in Russia with immediate effect on Monday, saying its analysts outside the country would provide its coverage instead.
Ratings firms are facing the twin pressures of Western sanctions that ban transactions with targeted Russian firms and a new law passed in Russia last week that threatens jail terms of up to 15 years for spreading what the Russian government describes as ""fake"" information. The law makes it illegal to report any event that could discredit the Russian military.
Fitch and Moody's (NYSE:MCO), which also suspended its commercial operations in Russia at the weekend, downgraded Russia's sovereign rating by a record-equalling six notches earlier this month, warning the West's sanctions had raised the risk of a default.
Both firms, along with the other main rating agency, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), have also withdrawn or suspended ratings on a number of the most heavily-sanctioned Russian and Belarussian banks, including VTB, Promsvyazbank (PSB) and Sovcombank. 
""Fitch Group has decided to suspend its commercial operations in Russia with immediate effect,"" Fitch said in a statement, saying that involved credit ratings and some other services it provides.
It added it would comply with ""all applicable sanctions"", support its Russia-based staff and ""continue to provide the market with its independent analytical views through ratings coverage undertaken outside of Russia.""
Russia's financial markets have been in a turmoil due to the sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.

The conflict, which Russia calls a ""special operation"", has triggered a blizzard of drastic rating moves and dire warnings from top investment banks about the impact on Russia's economy. 
S&P has downgraded its Russia rating by an unprecedented 9 notches since Moscow launched its assault. The firm did not reply to emailed questions or reply to calls on whether it would also suspend its commercial operations in Russia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -With inflation at a four-decade high, a U.S. government report shows corporate America has used its clout in the labor market to keep wages 20% lower than they should be, the White House said on Monday.
The report, prepared by the Treasury Department with help from the Justice Department, Labor Department and Federal Trade Commission (FTC), found companies had the upper hand in setting wages because they generally knew more about the labor market than workers do.
Further, workers may not be able to move or to afford an extended job search in order to find better-paid work.
""These conditions can enable firms to exert market power, and consequently offer lower wages and worse working conditions, even in labor markets that are not highly concentrated,"" the report said.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told a White House forum highlighting the report that workers are often at a disadvantage due to required non-compete or non-disclosure agreements; collusion between employers to keep wages low; or a lack of transparency that keeps workers unaware of prevailing wage rates.
""Ultimately these conditions cumulatively yield an uneven market where employers have more leverage than workers,"" she said. ""This is what economists mean when we refer to monopsonistic power"" among buyers of labor.
The White House event featured several workers who complained about unfair employment practices at prior jobs.
One of the speakers was a temporary worker at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Shannon Wait, who said she was let go from her $15 per hour job for complaining on social media about a broken company-issued water bottle.
Google officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Wait eventually won a settlement with Google which allows workers to discuss working conditions, according to the Communications Workers of America.
The report discusses ways that firms can hold down wages, including conspiring with other companies to avoid hiring each other's workers and requiring employees to sign non-compete agreements that prevent them from leaving for higher wages.
The report cited a paper that found one-in-five workers is currently covered by a non-compete agreement, meaning they cannot leave to work for a competitor. 
""A careful review of credible academic studies places the decrease in wages at roughly 20% relative to the level in a fully competitive market. In some industries and occupations, like manufacturing, estimates of wage losses are even higher,"" the report said.

The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.8% in February but hourly earnings were flat, partly because the return of workers to lower-paying industries offset wage increases in some sectors as companies competed for scarce workers.
Antitrust enforcement efforts usually focus on prices companies charge for goods and services. Antitrust enforcers have brought labor antitrust cases in the past, and the Trump Administration's Justice Department brought one against a no-poach agreement between rail equipment suppliers in 2018, but they remain rare.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Monday threw his weight behind measures to tamp down domestic fuel prices after the Ukraine conflict sent oil prices to their highest levels since 2008, adding to pressure on state-run oil company Petrobras.
A government official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the Bolsonaro administration is studying a fuel subsidy program. The economy ministry is against such a measure, the source said, but is not involved in deciding the pricing policy of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the state firm is officially known.
The mines and energy ministry said its staff was meeting with presidential aides and economy ministry officials later on Monday to discuss what can be done about fuel prices.
The economy ministry declined to comment on potential fuel subsidies. Petrobras and the president's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation,"" has sent global crude prices soaring, adding to double-digit inflation in Latin America's largest economy ahead of a presidential election in October.
Petrobras shares fell almost 8% in Sao Paulo, as the benchmark stock index slid around 3%.
In a radio interview earlier on Monday, Bolsonaro called for the end of a fuel pricing policy in which Petrobras, which holds about 80% of Brazil's refining capacity, aims for local parity with global prices.
Bolsonaro called the rules whereby Petrobras sets local fuel prices based on international energy and currency markets ""wrong laws designed a long time ago that cannot continue."" 
Last week, he said that Petrobras, which in 2021 smashed its all-time record for annual profit and dividend payouts, should reduce its profit to soften the blow of soaring oil prices.
LEADERSHIP CHANGE
Bolsonaro's criticism adds to pressure on Petrobras, where minority shareholders have pressed for a free hand in setting fuel prices. The company racked up huge losses under previous governments when forced to import and sell fuel at a discount.
Over the weekend, Brazil's government appointed former Petrobras executive Rodolfo Landim to chair the oil producer's board, replacing Admiral Eduardo Bacellar Leal Ferreira who told Reuters on Saturday that he planned to step down as chairman of the company ""to spend more time with my family.""
The pressure to hold prices down was a factor in Ferreira's decision to step down, two people close to pricing discussions told Reuters. Petrobras was planning to seek government approval this week to raise prices at its Brazil refineries, the people said.
Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo was the first to report on Monday that the government was mulling fuel subsidies, saying that a plan to compensate Petrobras for keeping down wholesale prices could be announced this week. 
The newspaper, citing unnamed participants in the discussions, reported that dividends from Petrobras could be used to fund the subsidies. 

Proposals to subsidize fuel prices with government funds have met resistance from the economy ministry, which sees little benefit from a subsidy program that could threaten compliance with key fiscal rules.
Brent crude briefly hit $139.13 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose to $130.50 on Monday, their highest levels since July 2008, as the United States and European allies eyed a Russian oil import ban and prospects for a return of Iranian crude to the global market dimmed.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine bonds fell on Monday as a new $45 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) started to move through Congress, with the crisis in Ukraine hitting investor sentiment as well as doubts about the country's economic outlook.
Argentina agreed on a 30-month extended fund facility (EFF) with the IMF late last week, replacing a failed 2018 program, which pushes repayments back until 2026-2034. It needs approval from the IMF board and Argentina's Congress.
Economy Minister Martin Guzman addressed lawmakers on Monday, warning that blocking the bill would be ""destabilizing"" for Argentina and lead to default to the IMF.
""It would generate a situation of deep exchange rate stress with inflationary and negative consequences on economic activity, employment and poverty,"" he said.
Opposition lawmakers have indicated they will support part of the bill to refinance the debt, though have threatened to vote against the economic plan. It is unclear whether that would be acceptable to the IMF, which wants broad support for the deal.
""We have a point of agreement, not to push the country into default,"" an opposition legislator told Reuters, referring to the center-right opposition coalition. He asked not to be named.
""We also agree on endorsing the refinancing of the debt with the IMF but we don't endorse the economic program.""
Most analysts still expect Congress to approve the bill despite the pushback, which would help Argentina avert a default on billions of dollars of repayments to the IMF due this year amid soaring inflation and low reserve levels.
However, bonds have dropped steadily since late last week, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine compounding investor concerns that the grains-producing country will not be able to meet the economic targets from the deal and revive its embattled economy.
The South American country's bonds were down on average 1.2%, with some bonds like the Bonar 2030 30 cents on the dollar, a reflection that many investors are pricing in a future default.
""Investors first want to see that the economic goals can be met. Then we'll see about bond prices recovering,"" said Antonio Aracre, an analyst at Syngenta, citing Argentina's mottled history of some 22 IMF bailouts.
Local brokerage StoneX said in a note that capital outflows from emerging market funds had also impacted Argentine debt, ""nullifying the positive effect of the IMF staff agreement"".
'LIGHT DEAL'
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note that the agreement should help reduce pressure on parallel currency exchange rates, where dollars are around twice as expensive as the official rate, and overall uncertainty about policy-making.
""But it is not an inflation stabilization plan, and is unlikely to deliver reserves accumulation,"" it added.
Delphos Investment said that the deal would help lay the foundations for a gradual process of fiscal consolidation and accumulation of reserves, though added it was ""not very ambitious"" in terms of more lasting structural changes.
""Now we know the details of the agreement with the IMF, there is little doubts that it is a light deal. Nonetheless, it will not be easy to meet the terms of the agreement,"" said Roberto Geretto of local investment firm Fundcorp.
The deal comes with an economic plan that sets out targets for growth, slowly lowering inflation, moving towards positive interest rates, building up foreign currency reserves and cutting central bank funding to the Treasury.
""There are reforms that are intended to improve economic growth and reforms that are intended to improve fiscal solvency,"" said Daniel Artana at the FIEL Foundation.
""The government has not advanced on either of the two fronts, beyond the fact that it has made a commitment to reduce subsidies for electricity and gas rates.""

(Reuters) -Russia's invasion of Ukraine has dashed any hope U.S. consumers might have had for relief from sky-rocketing inflation, with gasoline prices in the last week surging by the most in nearly 17 years and costs of other goods like food ready to march higher as well.
Even before the invasion, the U.S. inflation report for February was set to show prices rising at their fastest pace in 40 years. The data, due to be released on Thursday, will likely show only a preliminary impact from the swelling in U.S. oil prices, which briefly climbed above $130 a barrel on Monday, but the spike is expected to drive overall inflation higher in coming months.
""There had been expectations that February would be the high point for year-over-year headline inflation, but the Ukraine shock is already sending gas prices higher in March,"" said Tim Duy, an economist at SGH Macro Advisors.
The development also comes at a perilous time for the Biden administration, already under fire for soaring costs for rents, electricity and food as the economy grapples with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which demand has outstripped supply.
Federal Reserve policymakers will also be keenly watching the reading, which will arrive just under a week before they gather for their next policy meeting. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on March 16 as it begins a tightening cycle meant to bring down inflation without derailing the economic expansion.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank will act cautiously given the uncertainty of the impact of the war in Ukraine, but persistently high inflation will weigh as policymakers sketch out their forecasts at their meeting for the path of rate hikes in the months ahead.
Economists polled by Reuters forecast the Consumer Price Index to have climbed 7.9% on a year-on-year basis in February, up from 7.5% in January. The monthly rate is forecast to have risen 0.8% after increasing 0.6% in the prior month.
Gasoline prices increased nearly 6% in February, which would add around 0.2 percentage point to the headline number last month, but the bigger effects are still to come.
The average U.S. price for regular unleaded gasoline on Monday was $4.065 a gallon, according to automobile club AAA, only about 5 cents shy of the record high. The increase over the last week of about 45 cents a gallon was the largest since 2005, it said.
Russia is the world's biggest exporter of oil and gas and a mooted ban on oil imports from that country pushed the price of Brent crude briefly above $139 a barrel on Monday.
By Oxford Economics' estimates, the surge in oil prices would add around 0.6 percentage point to the March inflation reading, but that could be easily outstripped in the coming months.
Powell said last week that the Fed estimates as a rule of thumb that every $10 increase in the price of oil adds 0.2 percentage point to inflation and subtracts 0.1 percentage point from economic growth. 
Investment banks say crude prices could approach $200 a barrel this year if Russian supply evaporates, with dire consequences for the global economy.
NIGHTMARE SCENARIO
This week's inflation reading could show a temporary softening in food inflation in February compared to January, but any let-up is set to be short-lived.
A pickup in demand for hospitality services as the economy rebalances after the disruption from the Omicron variant of COVID-19 could drive services prices higher, including for restaurants and other food-away-from-home categories, economists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) noted, while the worsening war in Ukraine will now also disrupt supply chains.
Russia and Ukraine export more than a quarter of the world's wheat and Ukraine is a major corn exporter. Supply chain disruptions could add between 0.2 to 0.4 percentage point to headline inflation in developed economies in the next few months, according to Capital Economics, with higher costs for food-at-home categories persisting through the year.

All of it could add up to the Fed's nightmare scenario of inflation expectations becoming unanchored just as the central bank is being blown off course from the faster pace of rate hikes that were anticipated before the Russian invasion.
""The tentative peaking of inflation expectations could be at risk, with this oil price shock possibly spilling over into higher inflation expectations in the coming months,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) economists said. ""Along with a broadening of price pressures and a tight labor market leading to accelerating wages, a renewed rise in inflation expectations could add to concerns that elevated inflation pressures are likely to prove to be far more persistent.""

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Beaten-down Russian assets are looking attractive to some, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategists touting the bonds of Russian companies with significant international operations as the best way to profit from distressed pricing, while two banking sources said that loans of Russian corporates had been offered at a steep discount.
Russian bond prices have fallen to record lows since Moscow invaded Ukraine as investors fret over their ability to pay as a result of coordinated Western sanctions. The United States has led the sanctions to limit the flow of Western money and to damage Russia's economy, while Ukraine has called for the boycott of Russian energy exports. 
Russia's hard-currency sovereign bonds mostly traded well above par until mid-February, as investors shrugged off Moscow's troop build-up on Ukraine's border and U.S. warnings that an invasion was imminent. The decline since has been rapid, with longer-dated issues now indicated at around 20 cents in the dollar, although trading has all but ground to a halt.
The Ukraine crisis has raised the spectre of Russia's first major default on foreign-owned sovereign bonds since the years after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. Russia said on Sunday that payments would depend on Western sanctions.
But in a March 4 note to clients a team of JPMorgan's strategists led by Zafar Nazim said their top pick was Lukoil bonds, because the energy giant had substantial standalone international operations, which generated $3.5 billion in earnings in 2021, and relatively low foreign debts. 
In the note, titled ""If Ifs-And-Buts-Were-Candy-And-Nuts Recovery Analysis"", the JP Morgan strategists said investors could make huge returns should the company repay its debts.
Two banking sources said there was some activity in the secondary market for some distressed Russian corporate loans last week, with some market participants trying to trade the paper at a discount. 
While sanctions make it virtually impossible to trade in any sanctioned Russian entity and in rouble-denominated assets, Western investors can still trade in the bonds of Russian companies not on the sanction list and which have dollar bonds.
Lukoil bonds were quoted at a mid-price of 32 cents in the dollar on Friday, with bid/ask spreads of around 10 cents pointing to a highly illiquid market. JPMorgan strategist said they could recover to 100 cents on the dollar.
They also upgraded bonds issued by Novolipetsk Steel, saying current prices did not reflect the recovery potential, as well as steel giant MMK's 2024 bond.
""Our analysis is based on recovery from international operations, supplemented by potential claim on international receivables,"" the strategists wrote.
Russian companies are not currently prohibited from making payments to overseas owners of their debt, and many earn sizeable foreign exchange from export sales. 
But that could change if Russia's government imposes restrictions, or if the companies' financial conditions worsen or if they become unwilling to pay, potentially leading to an ""event of default (EoD)"".
""An EoD by Russian issuers is a high risk though some issuers with substantial international operations (e.g. Lukoil) could continue servicing debt,"" the strategists said.

JPMorgan's strategists added that repayment of bonds currently due, including one from gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), would not necessarily mean other borrowers would repay too.
An investment firm, which held some of Gazprom's $1.3 billion bond maturing on Monday, has received its full payment due in U.S. dollars, a person at the firm said.

(Reuters) - Global financial conditions, perceived as strongly correlated with future growth, are at the tightest in two years, driven by soaring energy prices, sliding stocks and the market fallout from the Ukraine-Russia conflict.
Financial conditions is the umbrella phrase for how metrics such as exchange rates, equity swings and borrowing costs affect the availability of funding in the economy. 
How loose or tight conditions are dictate spending, saving and investment plans of businesses and households. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which compiles the most widely used financial conditions indexes, has in the past shown a 100-basis-point tightening crimps growth by one percentage point in the coming year, with an equivalent loosening giving a corresponding boost.
The tightening is an unwelcome development for a world economy already threatened by the fallout from $120-a-barrel oil prices and supply chain setbacks caused by sanctions on Russia. 
(Graphic: GS global financial conditions, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgpdwaqwwvo/KNQdg-global-financial-conditions-tighten-to-pandemic-levels.png) 
If these drive inflation steadily higher, and ""if the central banks take their mandates seriously, you will see a further (tightening) in financial conditions,"" said Rene Albrecht, strategist at DZ Bank. 
""Economic dynamics will slow down further, inflation will be high nonetheless and you will see second round effects and then you get a stagflation scenario,"" he added, referring to a combination of rising inflation and slower economic growth. 
Goldman Sachs' global financial conditions index (FCI) is at 100.2, 60 basis points (bps) tighter than prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a level last seen in March 2020, when the pandemic first hit. 
The rise was led by its Russian FCI, which rose as high as 114.8 from around 98 at the start of February to the tightest since the 2008 crisis, driven by a doubling of interest rates and a market implosion. 
The Russian move has taken an emerging markets FCI to the tightest since 2016. 
(Graphic: GS Russia financial conditions, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwpkrlqrevm/aWMrB-russian-financial-conditions-tighten-to-gfc-levels-nbsp-.png) 
Euro zone moves are sizeable too. Conditions in the bloc, heavily reliant on Russian energy, are at the tightest since November 2020, having moved 50 bps in February, driven also by the European Central Bank (ECB) opening the door to rate hikes this year. 
Viraj Patel, global macro strategist at Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research, said financial conditions would take on even more importance for the ECB, which meets on Thursday.
Should it proceed with the unwinding of bond purchases followed by rate hikes as expected before the invasion, financial conditions could tighten to levels seen at the height of the pandemic or even the bloc's sovereign debt crisis a decade ago, he added. 
U.S. conditions have tightened to a lesser extent. 
But the indicators Goldman uses to calculate its indexes signal no relief; safe-haven flows are boosting the U.S. dollar, which is near two-year highs, and world stocks have fallen 11% this year, led by a near-20% fall in euro zone equities. 
U.S. investment-grade corporate bond risk premia have widened 40 bps year-to-date as investors assess the hit to companies' profits. 
With conditions historically loose in developed markets, policymakers may not be too perturbed yet. On an inflation-adjusted basis, borrowing costs have fallen sharply, hitting a record low -2.5% in Germany on Monday. 

Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho, said that gives central banks ""more room to speak hawkishly and for those that are on the brink of acting hawkishly, acting hawkishly.""

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration is threatening to add companies to a trade blacklist if they skirt new export curbs against Russia, as it ramps up efforts to keep a vast array of technology out of the country after it invaded Ukraine last month.
The U.S. Department of Commerce, which oversees export controls, is mobilizing staff around the globe to halt illicit shipments of computers, aircraft parts, marine equipment and other technology to Russia, partnering with allied countries and U.S. law enforcement agencies like the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to crack down on the newly illegal trade, according to U.S. officials.
The goal is to enforce sweeping new restrictions on shipments to Russia of both U.S. and foreign commodities, technology and software, if produced with U.S. equipment, technology or software. The restrictions also apply to Belarus.
Matthew Axelrod, the Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement, told Reuters in a statement on Monday the United States will ""bring the full force of the law to hold accountable those that knowingly violate the new rules, including by placing additional parties on the Entity List,"" a U.S. trade blacklist. 
Already some of the biggest names in tech, like  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), have announced they will halt shipments to Russia.
U.S. exports to Russia were under $5 billion in 2020, according to the Commerce Department but, a senior official has said, multilateral cooperation means more than $50 billion in key inputs to Russia may be curbed.
Axelrod said the Commerce Department has begun ""robust engagement with U.S. exporters and other partners to ensure they understand the new rules,"" which aim to keep chips and other items made at home and abroad from Russia.
He also noted that 91 parties in 10 countries were added to the Commerce Department's Entity List last week for supporting Russian military, security services, and defense sectors.
The mostly Russian companies added to the list are barred from buying goods without licenses, which will be denied.
The measures, coupled with tough banking sanctions and the targeting of Russian oligarchs, have not deterred Moscow, whose forces have seized Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in Ukraine and besieged and bombarded several cities as residents desperately try to flee the most devastating European conflict since World War Two.
But export controls have more of an impact over time, not in days or weeks.
As part of the highly coordinated responses to the invasion, foreign partners must either abide by U.S. restrictions on items made with American equipment, or impose similar rules.
Former Commerce Department official Bill Reinsch, noting the small universe of people who profit by creating entities to disguise and send shipments to restricted companies, said there is no way to completely cut off the illicit trade.
""If your goal is to make sure they get a third of what they need and it takes them three times as long and costs 10 times as much, that's attainable,"" Reinsch said. 
Don Pearce, a former Commerce Department enforcement official who served as export control attache in Moscow from 2004 to 2007, said the United States could rely on allies. 
""It is going to depend especially on those partner nations that have land borders with Russia, because so much of the stuff ends up going to say Helsinki and is driven over the border,"" he said. 
Pearce also pointed to U.S. shipping companies, whose decision to avoid Russia has already put the squeeze on.  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), two of the world's largest logistics companies, have said they are halting delivery service to the country. 

The Commerce Department does not have an export control officer in Russia, anymore, but export control officers are posted in other strategic locations -- including Germany, China and Turkey -- and will be on the lookout for illegally diverted goods, a current U.S. official said. They conduct pre-license checks and post-shipment verifications, ensuring the company that would get the goods is not a drop box, for instance.
    The department will also keep an eye out for anomalies in trading patterns and for new parties and will check licensing and shipping documentation in an effort to catch companies illegally shipping items to Russia, another official said.

LONDON (Reuters) - It will be years before the full impact of Brexit on Britain's financial sector is fully known as more activity could leave London for the bloc or other centres like New York, Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said on Monday.
Britain left the EU's orbit on Dec. 31, 2020, ending the financial sector's unfettered access to the EU and about 7,500 financial jobs have left London for the bloc, a fraction of what was predicted by some consultants.
""What the impact will be I think will play out. It's not finished yet, there is still a transfer of business potentially going on,"" Cunliffe told the House of Lords' European Committee.
""It will be a number of years before you see the impact.""
The full impact on finance, which accounts for about 10% of Britain's economy, partly hinges on the extent to which the EU will shut out Britain's derivatives clearing houses to EU customers after June 2025, Cunliffe said.
A European Central Bank review of trading desks and trade booking models may also require banks to shift more staff from London to their EU operations in the bloc.
The ECB review could also change the economics of banking business models and trigger further, more strategic shifts in activity, and not necessarily to the EU, Cunliffe added.
Some London-based derivatives trading has moved to New York rather than the EU, and Britain should not keep its rules aligned with the bloc in the hope of unfreezing market access, he said.
""I think dealignment will happen just with the natural evolution of regulation,"" Cunliffe said, referring to reviews of UK insurance and market rules now underway.
Brussels has yet to approve a new forum for British and EU financial regulators to discuss upcoming rules because of clashes over how Britain is implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Cunliffe said that in the longer term the bloc has no reason not to trust the quality of UK financial supervision or think that Britain would discriminate against EU firms in a crisis.

PARIS (Reuters) - As Emmanuel Macron launches his campaign for a second term in April's presidential election, he can count on an economic boom that French voters have not seen the likes of in a generation to boost his bid.
With economic growth surging and unemployment falling, Macron can point to a barrage of data to show he has rebooted the euro zone's second biggest economy, though the fallout from the Ukraine crisis risks distracting from his economic record.
Announcing last Thursday that he would run for re-election, Macron will need to convince voters that the economic gains are trickling down despite surging inflation, which is likely to climb higher as the Ukraine conflict boosts energy prices.
Even if the finance ministry estimates households' gross disposable income has improved twice as much under Macron as during the previous two presidencies, polls suggest that voters' top worry is dwindling purchasing power.
Within months of taking office in 2017, the former investment banker cut taxes on investors and the wealthy while relaxing hiring and firing rules long deplored by employers.
By the time the COVID-19 pandemic erupted, the French economy was outperforming many European peers and, as the crisis has begun to ease, bounced back even more strongly with growth last year reaching a 52-year high of 7%.

Stubbornly high unemployment fell to the lowest level since just before the 2008-09 global financial crisis. More important, economists say, is an uptick in the employment rate - the share of people available to work who are actually in jobs.
While France still lags countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, the improvement matters because high youth unemployment and early retirement have long weighed on France's employment rate.

Macron's 2017 labour reform was only possible because the largest union - the moderate CFDT - did not oppose it. But even the CFDT recently said labour relations within companies have suffered as a result.
Employers are now less squeamish about hiring on long-term contracts that are hard to break when firms need to downsize, data on payroll welfare contributions indicates.

Macron has appeared most in his element as salesman-in-chief pitching the French economy to foreign investors at annual dinners for CEOs of some of the world's biggest multinationals. 
Foreign direct investment data suggests the effort has paid dividends, hitting record levels before the pandemic, even if it temporarily collapsed as the coronavirus spread globally.

A recent flood of foreign investment has made France's tech scene red hot and promises Macron made in 2019 to transform France into a ""start-up nation"" no longer look far-fetched.
Dressed in a black turtleneck like former Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO and guru Steve Jobs, Macron recently feted France's 25th unicorn - a start-up valued at more than a billion dollars - ahead of his own target of 2025.
Beyond tech, there is some evidence of a broader entrepreneurial spirit taking hold, with new business registrations hitting record levels, even if in part due to self-employed delivery workers riding the online-shopping boom.  
Graphic: New company registrations in France - https://graphics.reuters.com/FRANCE-ELECTION/MACRON-ECONOMY/zjvqkaerbvx/chart.png 
Where Macron is most exposed is the public finances. Conservative candidate Valerie Pecresse accuses him of burning through cash during the crisis and pushing the national debt to a record of some 115% of GDP.
The central bank says it will take a decade to get debt back down to pre-crisis levels below 100% and a break with the soft-touch management of public expenditures seen in the previous decade. 
Graphic: COVID crisis lifted debt burdens - https://graphics.reuters.com/FRANCE-ECONOMY/akvezmwzrpr/chart.png 
Public spending remains among the highest in the world, and promises to shrink the civil service headcount by 50,000 were quietly scrapped.
Meanwhile, Macron's scrapping of France's wealth tax early in his presidency in favour of a tax on real estate did not unleash a desired wave of investment, according to a report last October from the Conseil d'Analyse Economique think-tank, which is part of the prime minister's office.
The move did however reverse a flood of wealthy taxpayers moving abroad and helped boost dividend payouts to households, the study found.
Macron paid a high political price, however, with opponents and ""yellow vest"" protesters branding him a ""president of the rich"".
Desperate now to keep an inflation scare from denting his economic success, Macron's government is spending more than 15 billion euros to cap gas and power price surges hitting many consumers.
There is another glaring blemish on Macron's economic record in the form of France's abysmal trade deficit, which reached a record 3.4% of GDP last year.
Although strong import demand and high energy prices can be partially blamed, even Macron's finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, says it is just as much a symptom of France's still weak international competitiveness.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks need to be given more guidance on how to sever ties with Russia because they have never before had to process sanctions on a country so integrated with the West, industry officials said on Monday.
Britain, the European Union, the United States and other G7 countries have agreed on sanctions to sever the Russian economy's links to the international financial system.
""We are in uncharted territory in using sanctions against a country so integrated with the West,"" said Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants more sanctions, including the disconnection of more Russian banks from the global payments messaging system SWIFT.
Keatinge told Britain's parliamentary Treasury Select Committee that governments cannot introduce ""sanctions on the hoof"" and then rely on the private sector to implement them without proper guidance.
While the United States is the ""gold standard"" for providing guidance on sanctions, Keatinge said Britain's sanctions office OFSI has been faced with an unprecedented workload for a new, post-Brexit body.
The lack of detail has led to most market participants simply putting a ""red line"" through anything linked to Russia to be on the safe side, Keatinge said.
""We need detail, we cannot continue to have generalisations ... There is quite a lot of self-sanction,"" he added.
Justine Walker, head of global sanctions and risk at the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists said the ambiguities made it harder for banks and asset managers to quickly close Russian positions worth billions of pounds.
""There are a whole lot of unknowns everyone is trying to work through,"" she said, adding that some would need more time.
Natasha De Teran, a payments policy expert and former head of corporate affairs at SWIFT, told lawmakers that banks excluded from the messaging system would find workarounds, such as using fax machines to instruct a payment. But those would be risky and cumbersome, she added. 
Some Russian banks, such as its biggest lender Sberbank, are not being disconnected from SWIFT for now because it plays a key part in handling payments for Russian energy, Moscow's biggest export, on which some EU countries are heavily dependent.

""... If you were to remove Sberbank from messaging and expect energy to carry on working, that would be very compromised,"" De Teran said.
Keatinge said it has become a ""very unhelpful metric"" that Britain's performance on sanctions was being judged by the number of oligarchs it was targeting, but added that ""the UK is not progressing well in contrast to our peers"".

Liang said in remarks to an Institute of International Bankers conference that strains are showing up in wider bid-ask spreads and slightly higher term unsecured funding costs.
""Investors are meeting elevated margin calls without delay. Moreover, investors show little concern about solvency or liquidity stresses at domestic financial institutions,"" Liang said her prepared remarks.
Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Monday as the prospect of a U.S. ban on oil imports from Russia sent crude prices soaring to their highest levels since 2008. The Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 were both down over 1.25%.
One widely watched measure of unsecured funding stress late last week hit its highest since May 2020 and remained elevated on Monday.
Nonetheless it remains well below levels seen earlier in the spring of 2020 when the emergence of COVID-19 triggered a global market panic that required extensive intervention by the Federal Reserve and others.
Liang said the Treasury and regulators that make up the Financial Stability Oversight Council are closely monitoring the market situation and talking to financial regulators in other countries.
""We will continue to be alert to fallout from the recent events,"" added Liang, a former longtime Federal Reserve economist.
Liang also said U.S. regulators have worked over the past decade with global policymakers to establish regulatory and supervisory frameworks to ensure that financial systems are resilient and can support economic growth despite unexpected shocks.
""Clearly, the system now is much more resilient than when these efforts started,"" she said. ""Regulators will need to be nimble in their approaches to ensure the financial system continues to be resilient as some key emerging risks look to be different from those in the past.""
Liang said the benefits of stronger financial regulation since the 2008-2009 financial crisis became apparent at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, with banks and clearing counterparties performing relatively well, with support from some extraordinary Federal Reserve measures to support money market mutual funds.

She said FSOC has called for additional reforms to money market funds and is evaluating the liquidity mismatch in open-end mutual funds and the leverage of hedge funds.
""Regulators also are evaluating possible reforms to address the surprising liquidity stresses in Treasury markets during March 2020,"" Liang said. ""The Financial Stability Board also is looking at these same issues on a global basis.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department last week launched a task force aimed at choking off assets that Russian oligarchs own in the United States, part of Washington's efforts to pressure Moscow to cease its invasion of Ukraine. 
Here's how federal prosecutors could seize property belonging to allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin within the United States and use civil forfeiture laws to confiscate their assets permanently.
WHAT IS NEEDED TO SEIZE PROPERTY? 
Law enforcement officials who believe an asset such as a home, a yacht, or an investment account was used to commit a crime or represents the proceeds of illegal activity may request a warrant to seize the property. 
A judge would grant the warrant if there is ""probable cause"" to believe the property is linked to a crime in the United States. Certain crimes committed overseas - including public corruption and drug trafficking - provide U.S. prosecutors with grounds to seek civil asset forfeiture.
That would bar the owner from selling or transferring the property, said Stefan Cassella, a former federal prosecutor focusing on money laundering and asset forfeiture. 
IS THAT THE END OF THE PROCESS? 
No. For property exceeding $500,000 in value, prosecutors are required to file a civil asset forfeiture complaint in court seeking to permanently confiscate an asset. The case would be brought by federal prosecutors in the jurisdiction in which the assets were located.
""If the allegation were this money is derived from bribing Vladimir Putin, then you could commence a civil forfeiture action,"" Cassella said. 
Cassella added that it was not enough to prove the owner of the property committed a crime: prosecutors must also show that the particular asset they are targeting was linked to the criminal activity. 
Frequently, assets are owned through anonymous companies and the property owner does not wish to appear in court, said Sarah Krissoff, a partner at law firm Day Pitney LLP and former federal prosecutor.
""There are certainly circumstances where civil litigation is filed and the government is successful by default because the people on the other side of the aisle do not want to actually identify an interest in that property,"" Krissoff said.
HOW LONG DOES THE PROCESS TAKE?
It can take years. For example, in July 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed civil forfeiture complaints to recoup more than $1 billion in assets linked to the looting of Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB. The DOJ reached a $700 million settlement with a Malaysian financier accused of being the mastermind of the scheme more than three years later. 
HOW DOES CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE DIFFER FROM CRIMINAL PROSECUTION? 
Prosecutors may charge oligarchs criminally and seek asset forfeiture as part of a potential punishment, but Russian oligarchs are unlikely to set foot in the United States to face trial. Civil claims can take place against U.S. property even without the property owner present in the country.
""A lot of these bad actors are not available to be prosecuted in the United States,"" said Duncan Levin, managing partner at Tucker Levin PLLC and a former federal prosecutor. 
HAS CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE BEEN USED TO SEIZE PROPERTY BEFORE? 
Yes. While the launch this week of the new 'KleptoCapture' task force means more resources will be devoted to tracing Russian oligarchs' assets, the DOJ launched a broader initiative focused on overseas klepocrats' ill-gotten gains in 2010. 

That unit in 2013 reached a settlement with the vice president of Equatorial Guinea that required him to hand over more than $30 million in assets he obtained through corruption, including a Malibu mansion and Michael Jackson memorabilia. The same unit was behind the 1MDB settlement.

(Reuters) -Western allies’ sanctions against Russia have started to blow back in the form of large potential losses for their own banks, companies and investors, often in unexpected ways. In the past, such fires have been precursors to financial crises.
But some market participants say they aren’t seeing panic in the market, at least not yet.
""We haven’t had any of those ‘holy shit’ phone calls,” said David Schamis, co-founder of financial services-focused private equity firm Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Merchant Capital, while heading out of town for his daughter’s hockey tournament over the weekend.
""There is so much more capital in the system. Russia is not that big. Risk management is better,” Schamis said, comparing the situation now to the financial crisis in 2008 when he had a front-row seat as someone with capital to invest.
Indeed, banks have fat buffers this time around. In a sign of how much extra cash is sitting around with nowhere to go, the Federal Reserve said on Friday financial institutions placed more than $1.4 trillion overnight with it for almost no returns. It shows there is enough capital in the financial system to absorb losses from the Ukrainian invasion. 
Still, the sinkhole of potential losses is rapidly growing.
From Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA and BP (NYSE:BP) Plc in Europe to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) in the United States, Western companies have tallied up billions of dollars in exposure to Russia, money that they could lose. By one major U.S. bank's estimate, the West’s exposure through its companies as well as its dealings with the Russian central bank could be around $400 billion.
The shock is being felt in unexpected places. In Germany, the debt office has had to increase the size of a bond to ease conditions in euro zone overnight lending markets, a crucial source of credit for banks and other financial institutions. 
Bunds are used as collateral in the market but there has been a shortage. The Germans have said they suspect some of the bonds are held by sanctioned entities that cannot trade.
In Russia, internet companies Ozon Holdings Plc and  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) NV could face nearly $2 billion in unexpected bills after trading in their U.S. listed shares was suspended after the sanctions. That could trigger a clause in their debt agreements that makes some of their bonds redeemable. Yandex said it doesn’t have the money to pay investors.
The disparate nature and the geographical spread of these fires are some of the hallmarks of financial contagion, the idea that losses can quickly barrel through a deeply interconnected system in ways that no one can fully predict. At some point as losses spread, market participants panic and withdraw, freezing credit and precipitating a broader financial crisis.
Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Timothy Massad was deeply involved as a Treasury official in the U.S. government’s handling of the 2008 financial crisis. Echoing Schamis, he believes that the system is well able to absorb the shock and he hasn't noticed anything that raises serious concerns about financial stability.
Even so, the situation is rapidly evolving. “I don’t think this is a stable situation,” said Massad. ""What concerns me the most is how long this goes on and whether something happens in the war that triggers a much bigger shock or triggers panic.""
The attack Friday on Ukraine's nuclear plant wastroubling, he noted. 
Some signs of stress have started to appear in markets, with investors shedding riskier assets. Banks are getting nervous about lending to each other and hoarding dollars, which are getting more expensive for foreigners to procure. But these indicators are well below the peaks seen during full-blown crises and the market's plumbing is holding up.
Russian assets are in purgatory. Moscow abruptly ordered brokers to reject 'sell' orders by foreigners for Russian securities on Feb. 28. That meant any orders to sell rouble-denominated Russian government bonds that had not settled by then were stuck. By one estimate, hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of proceeds might be frozen, but even then market participants say the hit to portfolios is not large enough.  

For now, the word on the Street is more of confusion than panic. People are working through what the raft of sanctions against Russian banks, assets and individuals means for their dealings and holdings, market participants say. 
""The danger comes from the fact that you have long intermediation chains that make it difficult to know what exactly the exposure and the risks are,"" Massad says.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering loosening state aid rules for companies affected by EU sanctions against Russia over Ukraine and the bloc's competition regulators are looking at various support measures, the European Commission said on Monday.
The EU executive set a precedent two years ago by relaxing some state aid rules for businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic, allowing individual member states to pump billions of euros into their companies.
""The Commission is closely monitoring the situation and is ready to use the full flexibility of its state aid toolbox in order to enable member states to support companies and sectors severely impacted by the current geopolitical developments,"" Commission spokeswoman Arianna Podesta said in an email.
""We are looking at all tools at our disposal – permanent and temporary,"" she said.
The Commission will seek feedback from EU countries before implementing any measures.

From airlines to banks to automakers, thousands of European companies are expected to be hit hard by the sanctions as they close their Russian businesses and cut dealings with Russian counterparts.
The European Central Bank's chief economist Philip Lane has told fellow policymakers that the Ukraine conflict may reduce the euro zone's economic output this year.

Investing.com -- Oil and natural gas prices surge to new highs as the U.S. floats a full ban on purchases of Russian energy. The euro slumps in the face of a stagflationary shock and the threat of global instability driven by high food prices increases as wheat prices hit new all-time highs. Stocks are set for a rough ride. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 7th March.
1. Oil surges as Blinken moots Russian energy purchase ban
Global stock markets tumbled as crude oil prices leaped again to their highest since 2008, after U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that the U.S. is actively looking at closing the sanctions loophole that allows Western buyers to keep buying Russian oil and gas.
U.S. crude prices rose as much as 10% to hit $130.33 a barrel, while Brent futures rose as high as $130.89 a barrel, before both retraced to be up just over 6% on the day by 6 AM ET (1100 GMT). Prices of other commodities where Russia is a key exporter, such as Nickel, Palladium and wheat (see below), also hit new highs.
Blinken’s comments represented a shift in U.S. policy, after initial hesitation on the part of President Joe Biden, who is reluctant to push domestic gasoline prices higher. Pump prices are now over $4 a gallon in many states, while wholesale futures topped $3.70 a gallon in overnight trading.
A tightening of official sanctions would reinforce the ‘self-sanctioning’ already evident in oil markets, which saw one Russian export tender after another find no buyers last week. Shell (LON:RDSa), which broke ranks to buy a cargo of Russian crude at $28/barrel below benchmark prices on Friday, was pressured by public outrage into saying on Sunday it would divert all profits from the trade to a charity helping victims of the war.
2. Euro slumps on growth, inflation fears; Swiss National Bank steps in
The economic shock of the war, and the latest rise in energy prices, is glaringly asymmetric: it will hit Europe much harder than the U.S., because Europe relies so much more on Russian energy.  Germany has resisted pressure for a full ban on Russian energy imports, but other voices in the EU, notably in former Soviet bloc, have said they think the security concerns trump the economic pain. Benchmark European Natural Gas Futures exploded to hit 345 euros ($374) a megawatt-hour before retracing after a German government spokesman said his country wouldn't be part of such sanctions.
The euro fell to as low as $1.0807, extending its worst 3-day streak since 2020. It’s now lost nearly 4% against the dollar in the last week, amid growing belief that the European Central Bank will put on ice any plans it had for tightening monetary policy, despite the high current level of inflation.
Meanwhile, the Swiss National Bank said it was ready to intervene to stop the Swiss franc – one of the world’s favorite funding currencies – appreciating further. The message was enough to make the franc stay below parity with the euro.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies, hit a fresh 22-month high. Other havens were also in demand: Gold Futures topped $2,000 an ounce. 
3. Stocks set to open sharply lower; Cohen adds to his turnaround portfolio
U.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower as the prospect of higher oil prices stokes fears of an inflationary shock and a growth slowdown at the same time. That’s despite a monthly labor market report on Friday that showed the U.S. economy in rude health and fast closing in on replacing all the jobs that were lost in the first year of the pandemic.
By 6:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 528 points, or 1.6%, while S&P 500 futures were down 1.6% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 1.7%.
With earnings season having run its course, the focus is shifting to ad hoc news, notably in merger and acquisition activity. Stocks likely to be in focus later include North Dakotan shale drillers Oasis and Whiting, which The Wall Street Journal reported to be in merger talks on Sunday.  Also in focus will be Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) after Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) founder Ryan Cohen amassed a stake in the troubled retailer (apparently turning GameStop (NYSE:GME) around isn’t enough of a challenge).
4. Russian economy creaks as debt defaults loom 
In Russia, meanwhile, the economic situation continues to deteriorate sharply. The dollar gained another 12.8% against the ruble in Moscow on Monday, and the Russian currency has now lost half its value since the invasion started.
Over the weekend, some 4,300 people were arrested at anti-war rallies that followed the near-total ban imposed on independent media on Friday. American Express, Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) announced further restrictions on their services (although they will continue to work for payments by Russians within Russia), while Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and accounting giants EY, KPMG and PwC all suspended their services in the country.  
The first of what will be many defaults on international debt will probably be confirmed Monday, as oil company Rosneft and gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) appear likely to make use of a new Russian central bank dispensation allowing them to service their foreign currency debt with ruble payments. That will breach the covenants in their respective bond prospectuses unless holders agree to the move, which seems unlikely given the ruble's sharp depreciation.
Gazprom in particular is one of the biggest corporate debt issuers in dollars and euros, and any formal default would send shockwaves through emerging debt markets.  
5. World grain crisis looms; Wheat hits new ATH
Wheat Futures were again suspended, limit up at a new all-time high of $1,294.12, on the CME as fighting in Ukraine continued to disrupt supply from two countries that supply nearly 30% of the world’s most important grain.
Analysts are increasingly concerned about the impact of the war on global food prices, given the key role played by Russia and Ukraine in other agricultural commodities such as corn and sunflower oil and fertilizer. The fighting is already putting an end to sowing in most of parts of Ukraine, locking in reduced harvests this year from the affected regions. Lower fertilizer availability will depress yields further.
High food prices were one of the factors that contributed most to the Arab Spring in 2010/2011, and are already causing concern in Egypt, a country of 105 million people that imports over 80% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine and which subsidizes bread prices extravagantly."

TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan may downgrade its economic assessment at next week's policy meeting as a spike in Omicron COVID-19 infections dealt a bigger-than-expected blow to consumption, said four sources familiar with its thinking.
The central bank may also warn of heightening economic risks from the Ukraine crisis, which threatens to dent consumption and corporate profits through soaring energy costs, they said.
""After recovering late last year, consumption seems to have slumped as Omicron and coronavirus curbs kept people home,"" said one of the sources, a view echoed by three more sources.
""The economy didn't do well in the first quarter,"" and may struggle to gain momentum due to the fallout from the war in Ukraine, a second source said.
At the two-day meeting ending on March 18, the BOJ will thus consider offering a bleaker view on the economy and consumption compared with its previous meeting in January, the sources said.
In January, the BOJ said the economy and consumption were ""showing clearer signs of pick-up"".
The central bank, however, is likely to keep monetary policy steady next week and put off until a subsequent meeting in April a decision on whether to maintain its forecast that the economy is on track for a recovery, the sources said.
""There's simply too much uncertainty now to gauge the impact on Japan's economic outlook,"" a third source said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to speak publicly.
The persistent drag from the pandemic and rising commodity costs from the Ukraine crisis have cast doubt on the BOJ's view the economy is likely to improve thanks to continued strength in global demand and an expected rebound in consumption.
Longer run, the BOJ expects robust corporate profits to boost capital expenditure and wages - a view also under threat as soaring raw material costs squeeze corporate profits.

After expanding an annualised 5.4% in October-December last year, Japan's economic growth will likely grind to a near halt this quarter as COVID-19 curbs and supply constraints weigh on a fragile recovery, a Reuters poll showed.
The BOJ will conduct a quarterly review of its growth and inflation projections at its April 27-28 meeting.

371,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 04:58AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -In bright sunshine, a long queue of shoppers snaked outside an IKEA store near Moscow late last week. Similar scenes were repeated across Russia as families rushed to spend their fast-depreciating roubles at the Swedish retailer which is exiting the crisis-hit country.
Russians are bracing for an uncertain future of spiraling inflation, economic hardship and an even sharper squeeze on imported goods. 
The rouble lost around a third of its value last week, after unprecedented Western sanctions were imposed to punish Russia for invading Ukraine. The moves froze much of the central bank's $640 billion in reserves and barred several banks from global payments system SWIFT, leaving the rouble in free-fall.
Cities across Russia were outwardly calm, with little sign of the crisis devastating financial sector and markets. Except for the lines of people looking to stock up on products – mostly high-end items and hardware – before shelves empty or prices climb further.
""The purchases that I planned to make in April, I urgently bought today. A friend from Voronezh also told me to buy for her,"" shopper Viktoriya Voloshina told Reuters in Rostov, a town 217 kilometers (135 miles) from Moscow. 
Voloshina said she was looking for office shelves and tables and also shopping on behalf of a friend from another town. ""My heart is breaking,"" she added.
Dmitry, another Moscow resident, lamented rapid price rises.
""The watch I wanted to buy now costs around 100,000 rubles, compared to 40,000 around a week ago,"" he said, declining to give his surname.
But the spending burst may peter out.
While there is no palpable sign of panic, the wipe-out of rouble savings and the doubling of interest rates to 20% will squeeze mortgage holders and consumers. 
Financial conditions -- reflecting availability of credit in the economy -- have tightened brutally this year, which Oxford Economics predicted would shrink domestic demand by 11% by year end and raise unemployment by 1.9 percentage points in 2023. 
Zach Witlin, an analyst at Eurasia Group, notes sanctions are already hitting consumers via prices hikes and digital payments disruptions. 
While consumers are not directly targeted, ""fear and caution are exaggerating the impact,"" with the exit of foreign brands such as IKEA creating a ""snowball effect,"" he added.
IMPORTS TO ISOLATION
Cars, machinery and car parts comprised nearly half of Russia's $293 billion imports last year, according to the Federal Customs Service.
The government's strenuous import cutbacks in recent years mean 2021 imports remained 7% below 2013 levels, before the first sanctions following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.
It has also beefed up trade with China, which is the only country to boost exports to Russia since 2014. 
But further declines look inevitable as the rouble plunges, insurers refuse cover to businesses exporting to Russia and shippers back away from Russian ports whether to export or to import.
While only a few Russian companies are targeted by sanctions ""all of them will feel the chilling effect,"" said Matt Townsend, sanctions partner at law firm Allen & Overy. ""This is why sanctions are a very effective measure to isolate a country.""
The immediate economic shock will cause a 35% GDP contraction in the second quarter and a 7% decline in 2022, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) predicted. But ""growing political and economic isolation will curtail Russia's growth potential in years to come,"" it added.
That may come about if restrictions ""limit the acquisition of technology needed to support Russia's highest value industries,"" RBC Global Asset Management warned. 
The Biden administration is preparing rules to curb Moscow's ability to import smartphones, aircraft parts and auto components. 
But multinationals, from tech firms Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to consumer goods producers  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and  Diageo  (LON:DGE), have severed links with Russia, meaning shoppers will have limited access to the consumer goods they have grown accustomed to over three decades.
Chinese companies, so far staying put, could grab some market share but they too could fall prey to secondary sanctions as many of their products such as smartphones use U.S. origin technology.

How much more pain is about to hit Russia's economy? Can oil rise even higher? U.S. inflation data is due on Thursday, the same day the European Central Bank holds a crucial policy meeting. 
Here's your week ahead in markets from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Tommy Wilkes, Julien Ponthus and Dhara Ranasinghe in London.
1/ RUSSIAN PAIN
After a barrage of Western sanctions, Russia's economy will see a sharp economic contraction and spiking inflation. Debt default risks are on the rise. 
Aside from the rouble, which has hit record lows, most Russian markets have been shuttered since the West imposed tougher sanctions after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Foreign investors are scrambling to pull money out of Russia -- if they can. They have found their assets frozen as the sanctions, Russian-imposed restrictions and a lack of liquidity make it impossible to exit. 
It's also been tough to work out the full extent of the damage. Asset managers will be hoping for more clarity on just how little their Russian investments are worth, if anything.
Many will also be bracing for Western sanctions to go even further and target Russia's energy industry. Expect more jaw-dropping moves in the rouble and oil prices if they do.

2/ WHEN'S THE PEAK?
Expect data on Thursday to show U.S. inflation surged again in February, confirming what we all know already: the Federal Reserve will likely hike rates in March.
Economists forecast headline inflation at 7.8% year-on-year, surpassing January's four-decade high 7.5% print. 
War in Ukraine has tempered expectations for aggressive Fed rate hikes but a stronger-than-expected inflation print might rekindle chances of a more hawkish stance. That would hurt risk assets, already rattled by Ukraine-linked uncertainty.
The Fed says it's focused on containing price pressures. Its credibility could be at risk if inflation worsens, eroding household spending power and distorting investment and spending decisions. Friday's University of Michigan consumer sentiment index could provide a sense of how consumers are faring.

3/ ROCK, HARD PLACE, ECB
Before Russia invaded Ukraine, the European Central Bank's March 10 meeting was expected to accelerate its exit from ultra-easy policies. Inflation at a record high 5.8%, more than double its 2% target, strengthens that case.
Here's the problem. The war, by sparking a fresh surge in energy prices, is causing upward pressure on inflation. At the same time it hurts consumption and economic growth.
ECB plans are in turmoil and big decisions on Thursday appear unlikely. President Christine Lagarde may be pressed on whether she expects a rate rise, having last month walked back on a pledge not to lift rates this year. 
That was before war broke out in Europe, leaving the ECB between a rock and hard place. 
Money markets scale back ECB rate hike bets https://graphics.reuters.com/EUROPE-MARKETS/gdpzybkonvw/chart.png  
4/ TRIPLE WHAMMY 
The Russian invasion is a triple whammy for euro zone banks, with no immediate fix on the horizon. Western sanctions on Russia hit banks exposed to that country's companies or hold assets there. It begs the question of whether multinational groups such as Austria's Raiffeisen or France's SocGen will divest, or be stripped of their units in the country, and at what cost? Second, ECB rate-hike expectations -- which banks were benefiting from -- have been revised down sharply. Finally, banking shares are cyclical stocks that investors tend to dump first when the macroeconomic environment sours.
The sector has lost over a quarter of its market value in about three weeks. Even if the coming week brings stability, that is a bitter pill for investors who had bought into what was the consensual buy trade entering 2022.

5/ IT'S THE ECONOMY, COMRADE And in China, it's the National People's Congress that hogs the headlines.
The annual session of China's rubber-stamp parliament runs from Saturday for about a week, setting the main economic and policy goals for the year. The key word is stability. On Saturday, China said it would target slower economic growth of around 5.5% this year.
Beijing is keen to put its slowing economy back on track heading into an even more important event later this year -- the twice-a-decade Party Congress at which President Xi Jinping is almost certain to secure an unprecedented third term as leader. That means stepped-up fiscal stimulus, increased tax cuts and continued easy monetary policy, while any plans for painful reforms - such as a long-awaited ""prosperity tax"" – put on the back burner. 

Don't expect any comment on Ukraine either: China has not condemned Russia's attack and says Western sanctions on Russia are unfair.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's plans to dial back stimulus have been upended by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Policymakers meeting on Thursday must now grapple with the prospect of inflation, already at record highs, rising yet further just as a new crisis threatens the economy.
""Of all the major central banks, the ECB has the biggest dilemma on its hands,"" Principal Global Investors chief strategist Seema Shah said.
Here are five key questions for markets. 
1. What will the ECB do this week?
Policy decisions remain wide open and subject to Ukraine developments. Big commitments appear unlikely.
Hawks, such as Germany's Joachim Nagel, have argued for a faster tapering of bond buys, but appear to have toned down their public rhetoric. Board member Fabio Panetta believes policy moves should be postponed.
The ECB was already due to cut bond buying over the coming quarters, but aimed to keep the purchases open-ended.
It could still hint at the possibility of ending asset purchases later this year and drop a reference to rates rising ""shortly"" after bond buying ends.
""It makes no sense to commit to anything right now,"" said Pictet Wealth Management strategist Frederik Ducrozet. 
Title: ECB's bond-buying exit complicated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbpgnzwdzvq/ECBMar4.PNG 
2. Will the ECB hike rates this year?
Markets think so and ECB President Christine Lagarde last month appeared not to rule out a move higher this year. Whether she still holds to that will be watched closely.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says the Fed will stick with plans for a March rate rise. The Fed's dilemma is less acute, given Russia-linked growth setbacks are less likely in the United States. 
""Before the war, we were expecting the ECB to raise rates in September and December for a total of 50 bps,"" said Generali (MI:GASI) Investments senior economist Martin Wolburg. ""The first-rate hike is more likely in December."" 
Title: Money markets scale back ECB rate hike bets, https://graphics.reuters.com/EUROPE-MARKETS/gdpzybkonvw/chart.png 
3. How does Ukraine impact the economy?
It could reduce euro area economic output by 0.3%-0.4% this year in one scenario outlined by ECB chief economist Philip Lane.
Europe relies on Russia for around 40% of its natural gas. Surging gas and oil prices could dent consumer spending power and corporate profits. UBS Global Wealth Management economist Dean Turner estimates a 10% rise in energy prices takes roughly 0.2% off euro zone GDP. 
The bigger hit may in the short-term come via inflation, already running at 5.8%, well above the ECB's 2% target. But the crisis is negative for growth and inflation longer term, a more relevant horizon for the ECB. 
Another headache is tighter financing conditions, mainly due to falling share prices since mid-February. 
Title: Another headwind for Europe's economy, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egvbkqlwepq/ECB22.PNG 
4. Are the ECB's inflation forecasts still relevant?
The ECB gives its latest economic projections on Thursday and big upward revisions to the 2022 inflation forecast are certain. 
While important for markets, estimates may not fully reflect the impact of surging oil -- Brent crude has jumped 20% to nearly $120 a barrel since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Chief economist Philip Lane says the latest inflation data will be taken into account, noting a temporary rise in inflation should be tolerated given a supply shock. 
Generali's Wolburg expects euro zone inflation in 2022 at 5.5%, versus a previous forecast of 4.5%. 
Title: ECB set to revise up inflation forecasts, https://graphics.reuters.com/EUROPE-MARKETS/egvbklzzmpq/chart.png 
5. What happens if markets wobble?
The ECB will likely stress it stands ready to take any measure necessary to stabilise financial markets.
European banks have been knocked by Western sanctions on Russia and the exit of Russian banks from Europe, but signs of funding stress appear contained. Euro area sovereign bond spreads are relatively stable.

Further falls in the euro, trading at 21-month lows, are a worry.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) says the euro is becoming increasingly negatively correlated to oil and gas prices -- a potential inflationary spiral that adds to the ECB's troubles.

CORFU, Greece (Reuters) -It took one electricity bill to crush Dimitris Diavatis' hopes that his Greek summer resort could bounce back to its pre-pandemic health this year, even with bookings pouring in.
The amount was more than double what he paid this time last year when the hotel was not even open. After two sluggish summers, the irony was not lost on him: ""We won't make a profit in a good year,"" he said. ""It'll be eaten up by inflation.""
Greece - like the other tourism-dependent economies on the euro zone's Mediterranean fringe – is seeing signs of a much-needed recovery in visitor numbers in 2022 after two largely lost years. As in Spain, Portugal and Italy, the sector is a huge employer and contributor to state revenues.
But across the region, the pandemic has changed the face of tourism. Hotels were already grappling with higher fuel bills and inflation which a further energy price surge in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine will only make worse.
The dislocation of labour markets caused by COVID-19 has left entrenched staffing shortages, while Italian tourist officials concede that pandemic-era holidaying – with its emphasis on hygiene, cleanliness and space – is a big challenge for its ageing infrastructure.
Meanwhile, a market for more modest, small-scale vacations is opening up: In Spain and Portugal, a reluctance among many tourists to travel far is accentuating the trend for stays in rural areas in tents, campers or motorhomes.Industry and government officials in Greece are forecasting revenues will reach 80-90% of the record seen in 2019, when 33 million tourists brought in 18 billion euros in revenues, worth a fifth of national output.
Yet a bumper season is unlikely to offer much relief to struggling businesses which emerged from a decade-long financial crisis in 2018 only to have the pandemic bring global travel to a halt two years later.
So acute is the problem of soaring heating oil, gas and electricity prices that the president of the Greek tourism confederation SETE, Yiannis Retsos, wrote to ministers in January urging them to provide financial support, saying it was ""objectively impossible"" for year-round hotels to the cover their costs, especially after the quieter winter months.
The highly indebted countries of Europe's south were also bracing for the European Central Bank to remove the stimulus that has kept their borrowing costs down. 
Although the Ukraine war has left the interest rate outlook uncertain, the southern fringe still badly needs its tourism sectors to get back to work given the economic hit the conflict is set to deliver.
Speaking a day after the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special operation"", Greece's Retsos said it was too early to gauge its impact on the tourism sector.
More than a week into the conflict, there has been no noticeable increase in cancellations across the region.
Russian tourists only make up a very small proportion of the sector in southern Europe - 2% of revenues in Greece in 2019 and around 1% of nightly hotel bookings in Portugal. Turkey - outside the European Union - is a more popular destination. 
But with European gas prices already at record highs, and this likely to feed into inflation globally, the concern in countries like Greece is the conflict will only worsen an already bleak outlook, further crimping guests' spending power and increasing providers' costs.
NO END TO COSTS
Even hotels that were shut during winter worry they will not be able to shoulder the extra burden, having already agreed prices with tour operators last summer, said Babbis Voulgaris, head of the Corfu hoteliers' association.
Resort owner Diavatis, who also owns a year-round boutique hotel and a waterpark complex on the island, agreed.
""This will be a real crisis for us,"" he said. ""I won't say it's worse than the pandemic because at least we're open. But we didn't lose money then. Now we're heading towards losing money.""
The Greek government has spent over 42 billion euros in pandemic support measures since 2020 to keep businesses and households afloat and about 2 billion euros since September to subsidise power bills through March. For hoteliers, the support does not go far enough.
""In the summer, with the air-conditioners working, the refrigerators, the kitchen, everything - I don't how when this will end,"" said Costas Merianos, who owns a small family-run hotel on Corfu's Ionian coast.
Across the sea in Italy, lockdowns and energy prices have forced many hotels to shut for good, said Marina Lalli, president of the Federturismo industry association.
And while Lalli was hopeful tourism could inch closer to 2019 levels this year, Italy faces the additional problem of being ""a mature tourist destination with mature hotel structures that need to be renewed,"" she said.
""In the post-COVID era, tourists are even more attentive to quality, they want a guarantee of cleanliness and want to feel safe.""
SOMETHING DIFFERENT
Greece said it was opening its tourism season as early as March 1 this year to meet demand but, like in Italy, Spain and Portugal, the season will not begin in earnest until the Easter break in April, a litmus test before the vital summer months.
Both Greece and Italy are racing to fill job shortages as the pandemic forced workers abroad for better paying jobs or into different sectors with less uncertain prospects.
In Greece, the tourism minister even appealed to refugees fleeing Ukraine, offering them residence and work permits to fill 50,000 job gaps in hospitality.
Demand for Spanish holidays was looking very strong this year, according to the vice-president of industry association Exceltur, Jose Luis Zoreda, thanks to Spain's high vaccination rates and the easing of pandemic restrictions in its big markets, the UK and Germany.
""There is a strong, accumulated travel appetite in Europe,"" Zoreda said, forecasting an ""explosion"" of tourism from Easter onwards, but also lower profit margins due to inflation and energy prices.
Exceltur, however, also found tourists were seeking a different experience. In 2021, campsite rentals were up 19.2%, flat rentals were up by 16%, rural homes by 11%. Hotel usage fell by 8%, a decline also driven by fewer business trips.
In January, new motorhomes and camper vans sales were up 34.1% on an annual basis, according to the Spanish Association of the Caravanning Industry and Trade (ASEICAR).
""The 'all-in-one' holiday model has been left behind,"" Yescapa, an online motorhomes and camper vans rental company, told Reuters.
Nico Aro, who rents out a camper van on the island of Tenerife, says he has not been able to enjoy it himself since he bought it last March because requests keep coming in from Italy, France and Belgium. His biggest problem is that he cannot find another one to buy because they are in great demand.
""I have benefited from the pandemic,"" he said.
The appetite for ""slower"" tourism has also grown in Portugal, where the sector played a crucial role in its recovery from the 2010 debt crisis. Tourism stood at about 15% of GDP in 2019 but fell to 8% in 2020.
""There's an increasing number of people looking for places with fewer people,"" said Helder Martins, president of Algarve's main hotel association. ""I don't believe that they will return to just wanting the sun and the beach."" 
The centuries-old ""schist villages"", built from the stone of a mountainous region clad in pine trees, are roaring back to life after being abandoned over the years by young Portuguese seeking work elsewhere.
""This summer is filling up fast,"" said Sonia Cortes, who owns a small five-room hotel in the Janeiro de Cima schist village, where construction workers are rebuilding traditional houses.
""The beginning of the pandemic was really difficult for those who lived off tourism,"" she said. ""(But then) those in bigger cities looked for villages like this one where they could feel safe.""
There was a 30% increase in the number of night stays at schist villages from 2019 to 2020-21, said Bruno Ramos, who works for an agency promoting tourism there.

Still, back in Greece, Merianos, the Corfu hotel owner, has a more sober view of the months ahead.
""I'll be happy if at the end of the season I don't owe my staff, I don't owe the state, I don't owe the energy provider - even if I'm left with 10 euros in my wallet,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) -U.S. and European economies are facing a heightened risk of a recession this year as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine severely disrupts supply chains and causes inflation to accelerate to the fastest rate since the 1970s.
Yields on U.S. government debt maturing in two years’ time are trading less than 30 basis points below notes maturing in ten years, the narrowest spread since the pandemic erupted worldwide in early 2020.
Yield-curve flattening has been one of the most reliable indicators of an impending recession in recent decades since it measures the current stance of monetary policy relative to long-term interest rate expectations.
The current spread is in the 77th percentile for all months since the start of 1990, up from 58th percentile at the end of December and the 33rd percentile this time last year, indicating an elevated risk of recession.
In the last three decades, whenever the spread has narrowed this much it has heralded either a significant mid-cycle business slowdown or an end-of-cycle recession (https://tmsnrt.rs/3HFAGIr).
Even before the invasion, prices for energy, raw materials, industrial components, consumer products and freight were rising at the fastest rate since the early 1980s.
But the conflict and sanctions imposed in response by the United States and its allies have now sent prices for oil, gas, coal and other commodities surging even higher.
Severe disruptions have been reported in ocean shipping, international passenger and cargo aviation and the global supply chains for chemicals and automakers, among other sectors.
The result is equivalent to a massive loss of global production capacity, a supply-side shock that is simultaneously intensifying inflation while likely to depress output and employment.
Businesses grappling with sanctions, supply chain problems and the rapidly escalating cost of their inputs are less likely to undertake risky investment expenditures.
Households hit by higher bills for gas, electricity, motor fuels, cars and other durable items will have to trim expenditure on other goods and services.
Recessionary forces are intensifying rapidly across North America and Europe as global supply chains are stretched to breaking point.
POLICY DILEMMA
The U.S. Federal Reserve is impaled on the horns of dilemma, trapped between its dual goals to maximise employment and maintain price stability.
The central bank is simultaneously under pressure to raise interest rates faster to restrain inflation but leave them lower to offset the heightened uncertainty arising from the conflict.
For the time being, senior U.S. policymakers have indicated the need to restrain inflation outweighs other considerations and they plan to start increasing interest rates from this month.
Based on the fed funds futures market, traders expect the central bank to raise interest rates by six quarter-points (or equivalent) by the end of the year to bring inflation under control, though that is down slightly from seven anticipated increases before the invasion.
In the past similar contradictions between policy goals have created conditions for a sharp slowdown in the business cycle or a recession.
Top policymakers and economists like to say that economic expansions do not die of old age, they are murdered. In other words, they do not end naturally and inevitably but when the Fed tightens policy too much.
But that is not quite true. Policymakers do not deliberately “murder” expansions. Engineering a recession is rarely if ever the explicit aim of monetary policy.
Instead, expansions end and recessions arrive when policymakers are forced to sacrifice (temporarily) their long-term goal of supporting growth to some more urgent and pressing goal such as lowering inflation.
In 2022, the poisonous cocktail of supply disruptions, rapidly rising prices, heightened business and household uncertainty and slowing growth in output and employment presents policymakers with precisely this problem.
Recession risks are even greater in Europe because region’s economic integration with Ukraine and Russia and greater exposure to surging international gas prices will magnify the size of the supply shock.
Even before the invasion of Ukraine, the Fed and other central banks were confronted with the tricky task of engineering a soft-landing to control inflation rather than a hard landing that would bring a recession.
The conflict and its massive impact on supply chains has made that task very much harder and increased the probability that the attempt at a soft landing will turn into a hard one.

BENGALURU/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will wait until the last months of this year for its first interest rate rise in over a decade, with fewer economists in a Reuters poll taken after Russia's invasion of Ukraine now expecting an earlier move. 
That consensus from a slight majority of forecasters, 27 of 45, polled March 1-4, comes despite news that inflation in the euro zone hit 5.8% in February, defying the central bank's own expectations for a decline.
Only six economists expected the first hike to come sooner, in the third quarter, down from 16 in a poll last month.
Of the 33 of 45 respondents who expected the deposit rate to rise from a record low of -0.50% this year, 18 saw it at -0.25% at year-end, nine had it lower than that and six saw it higher. 
That fragmented view underscores the central bank's communications challenge at its March 10 policy meeting. 
Indeed, expectations for ECB rates stand in stark contrast with other major central banks, which are likely to have delivered several hikes by year-end. The Bank of England has already lifted rates twice in its last two consecutive meetings.
Like those other economies, the euro zone has weathered the Omicron variant of the pandemic relatively well and is in full recovery mode. Euro zone unemployment is a record low. But its economy is more exposed to the armed conflict on the continent.
""The war hasn't really changed the difficult combination of inflation and growth risks, it has only exacerbated it. Therefore, logically, it should not fundamentally change the ECB's plans to cautiously and gradually withdraw some accommodative policies,"" wrote Rabobank economists in a recent client note.
""What has changed is the near-term uncertainty. We believe this may tip the balance towards a short delay in the ECB's normalisation timeline but - crucially - not a full stop.""
There was no strong consensus either on which month the ECB would end its Asset Purchase Programme (APP). The central bank is currently purchasing 20 billion euros worth of bonds a month and is set to carry on even after its pandemic-related separate programme ends in March. 
These bond purchases are set to double in the second quarter. But nearly two-thirds of respondents said the APP would be shut by end-September, with nearly half saying in that month. All but one economist said it would be shut by end-year. 
In the meantime, rising energy prices and further supply chain disruptions since the Russian invasion are likely to keep inflation higher for longer.
As the conflict in Ukraine intensified, and with the ECB unlikely to raise rates until later in the year, the euro fell below $1.10 for the first time since May 2020 on Friday, raising the prospect of additional imported inflation pressure.
""The war has clearly increased the risk of a stagflation scenario for the euro zone, where you will have a stagnating economy and much higher inflation on the back of high energy prices,"" said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING.
""The worry is we might see a squeeze of the euro zone economy from both sides. On the supply side, it will impact production due to supply chain disruptions and on the demand side in the form of higher energy prices and lower purchasing power.""
Forecasts for inflation this year have risen for the ninth consecutive survey - up 0.3 and 0.6 percentage points for the first and second quarters to 5.4% and 5.3% respectively, more than double the ECB's 2.0% target.
Economic growth in the bloc was expected to peak at 1.0% next quarter and then slow to 0.8% and 0.6% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. This is a downgrade from 1.2%, 1.0% and 0.7% predicted just a few weeks ago.

On an annual basis, it was expected to grow 3.8% this year and 2.5% next, from 3.9% and 2.5% predicted last month.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia said on Sunday that sovereign bond payments will depend on sanctions imposed by the West over the invasion of Ukraine, raising the spectre of its first major default on foreign bonds since the years following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
Russia's finance ministry said it would service and pay sovereign debts in full and on time but that payments could be hampered by the international sanctions.
""The actual possibility of making such payments to non-residents will depend on the limiting measures introduced by foreign states in relation to the Russian Federation,"" the finance ministry said in a statement.
That raises the possibility of a technical default on debt by Russia after much of its $640 billion in reserves were frozen by the West after President Vladimir Putin ordered what Russia describes as a special military operation in Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
From now on, Russia will use roubles to make payments to residents on bonds denominated in foreign currency, the ministry said. 
The finance ministry in Moscow also explicitly said that Russia might not be able to make bond payments because of restrictions imposed by the Russian government.
Russia in 1998 defaulted on $40 billion in domestic debt and devalued the rouble under President Boris Yeltsin because it was effectively bankrupt after the Asian debt crisis and falling oil prices shook confidence in its short-term rouble debt.
This time, Russia has the money but can't pay because the reserves - the world's fourth largest - that Putin ordered be built up for just such a crisis are frozen by the United States, European Union, Britain and Canada.
It could be Russia's first major debt default in more than a century. Even when the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia assumed its foreign debt. 
In 1918 Bolshevik revolutionaries under Vladimir Lenin repudiated Tsarist debt, shocking global debt markets because Russia then had one of the world's biggest foreign debt piles.
With the bonds worth nothing, some holders of the Tsarist notes used them as wallpaper. The Soviet Union under Josef Stalin stopped servicing loans to the United States and Sweden after World War Two. 
RUSSIAN DEFAULT
While Russia has only $40 billion in international bonds outstanding across 15 dollar or euro-denominated issues, its corporates have built up vastly more foreign debt.
The eurobonds have been issued with a mix of terms and indentures. 
Notably, bonds sold after Russia was sanctioned over its 2014 annexation of Crimea contain a provision for alternative currency payments in dollars, euros, British pounds or Swiss francs, with the rouble listed as an alternative currency option for bonds issued since 2018.
On March 16 Russia is due to pay $107 million in coupons across two bonds, though it has a 30-day grace period to make the payments. The next full 'principal' repayment is a $359 million 2030 bond on March 31 and then a larger $2 billion maturity on April 4.
Russian gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) has a $1.3 billion dollar bond due for repayment on March 7.
According to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), the OFZ bond market totalled 15.5 trillion roubles, or about $200 billion at January rouble rates, with foreigners holding a little less than a fifth of the bonds. 
Earlier on Sunday, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) cut Russia's credit rating to Ca, the second-lowest rung of its ratings ladder, citing central bank capital controls that are likely to restrict payments on the country's foreign debt and lead to default.
Moody's said its decision was driven by ""severe concerns over Russia's willingness and ability to pay its debt obligations"".
The ratings agency said default risks had increased and that foreign bondholders are likely to recoup only part of their investment.

Moody's and its peers Fitch and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) had scored Russia at investment-grade levels of Baa3/BBB as recently as March 1. All three have since cut their ratings by several notches, sending Russia's sovereign debt deep into so-called ""junk"" territory.

For Maxim Potimkov of Ukraine's state arms exporter and importer, standing alone amid his country's armoured vehicles, sales were the farthest thing from his mind.
""I came for this show because there has to be someone here and we have so much equipment here,"" he told Reuters. ""There was expected to be 50-plus people from Ukraine.""
Potimkov, from Kyiv, was travelling to Ukraine from a trade show in the United Arab Emirates when Russia launched its invasion last week, and he had to cancel his plans. Now back in the Middle East, he staffs a booth to promote Ukraine's Kozark 7 and Kozark 2M tactical armoured vehicles and anti-drone systems.
Meanwhile, in an adjacent hall, Russian weapons makers were displaying Moscow's hardware, including anti-aircraft weapons and air defence systems. Russian industry representatives, when approached by Reuters, declined to discuss economic sanctions imposed by the West in response to the war. 
Hundreds of visitors at the defence show in Riyadh, including regional government, military and corporate officials, surveyed this exhibition of might from nations around the world even as residents of the Ukrainian coastal city of Mariupol experienced the dread power of such hardware at first hand.
Efforts to evacuate people from Mariupol - which has endured days of Russian shelling that has trapped people without heat, power and water - failed for a second day in a row on Sunday after a ceasefire plan collapsed.

Many arms-producing nations vie for influence and contracts from wealthy Gulf Arab countries, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have moved to diversify their defence partners and want to develop their own industries..
Saudi Arabia leads a military coalition, which includes the UAE, that has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen for seven years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Recession concerns are showing up more prominently in the U.S. Treasury yield curve, as soaring commodity prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine fuel worries over inflation and slower growth.
The closely watched gap between yields on two- and 10-year notes stood at its narrowest since March 2020 on Friday, a signal that some investors may be anticipating that economic growth will slow from its current robust pace.
On a two-month rolling basis, the 2s/10s flattening has been its most extreme since 2011, said Jonathan Cohn, head of rates trading strategy at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Market participants watch the yield curve for insight into the U.S. economy. An inverted curve, where rates on short-term government debt exceed those on longer-term debt, has reliably predicted past recessions. 
Investors said the most recent moves appear driven by worries that prices for oil and other raw materials, which have spiked after the invasion of Ukraine by commodity-export giant Russia, will add to already-high inflation, forcing the Fed to tighten interest rates even if growth slows.
While expectations of a 50 basis-point hike this month have been all but priced out in recent weeks, markets still expect over 150 basis points of tightening by next February. [FEDWATCH]
""If central banks prioritize fighting inflation in 2022, having failed the world on that front in 2021, then hiking into a stagflationary environment likely means they are accepting some sort of recession is necessary to sort the whole mess out,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst, Asia Pacific, at OANDA, referring to a blend of weak growth and strong inflation.
Brent crude oil prices approached $120 a barrel on Thursday, their highest level since 2012, after a fresh round of U.S. sanctions that targeted Russia's oil refining sector and raised concerns that oil and gas exports could be impacted next.
At the same time, growth appears strong for now: the U.S. unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.8% in February, the Labor Department's closely watched employment report showed on Friday, raising optimism that the economy could withstand mounting headwinds from geopolitical tensions, inflation and tighter monetary policy.

Still, the curve flattening suggests that may not last.
""Flattening has accelerated as the Fed is seen prioritizing inflation moderation over backstopping risk appetite,"" said Cohn of Credit Suisse.

Investing.com -- The war in Ukraine will continue to dominate market sentiment in the week ahead and last week’s huge rally in commodity prices looks set to continue, adding to already high inflation. U.S. inflation numbers for February will be closely watched ahead of a looming rate hike by the Federal Reserve on March 16. The European Central Bank is to hold its first meeting since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while data out of the U.K. and Canada is expected to underline expectations for further interest rate hikes. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Geopolitical worries will continue to cloud the outlook for U.S. equities, even as concerns over soaring inflation and higher commodity prices, stoked by sanctions against Russia, curb expectations for how aggressively the Fed will hike rates.
""The stock market has been buoyed by expectations for a less aggressive Fed and lower yields in aggregate. The threat of higher interest rates has receded somewhat,"" Brad Neuman, director of market strategy at Alger told Reuters.
""The Fed will be less aggressive now that Russia has invaded Ukraine in the near term, but the problem that the Fed faces has not been ameliorated,"" Neuman said. ""In fact, it has been exacerbated.""
Soaring commodity prices have raised fears of even greater inflation, which could prompt the Fed to hike interest rates more aggressively.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week he would support a 25-basis-point interest rate increase at the central bank's upcoming meeting next week but added that he would be ""prepared to move more aggressively"" later if inflation does not subside as quickly as expected.
Data on Thursday is expected to show U.S. inflation surged again last month, with economists forecasting an increase of 7.9% year-on-year, after January's four-decade high of 7.5%.
While the war in Ukraine has tempered expectations for aggressive Fed rate hikes a higher-than-expected CPI number could fuel expectations for faster action. That would hurt risk assets, already rattled by Ukraine-linked uncertainty.
Consumer sentiment data from the University of Michigan on Friday will give investors an insight into how households are faring as rising price pressures erode spending power.
There are no scheduled appearances by Fed officials during the week as the central bank enters its traditional pre-meeting blackout period.
The Biden administration is looking at cutting imports of Russian oil, the White House said on Friday, as the Senate fast-tracks a bill that would ban Russian energy imports entirely.
The White House could rely on the legislation to ban imports, a move that would help share the blame for any price spikes that would add to already decades-high inflation.
""While U.S. oil imports from Russia are small in a global context,"" UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo told Reuters, crude prices rallied late Friday because ""some market participants might be concerned that other countries might follow that step.""
Oil prices posted their largest weekly gains since mid-2020 last week, with the Brent benchmark up 21% and U.S. crude gaining 26%.
Delays to the conclusion of talks on Iran's nuclear deal could also push oil prices higher in the coming week.
Besides oil, prices of grains and metals have also soared to multi-year highs since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as Western sanctions on Moscow disrupted exports from major producer Russia and threatened a growing global supply crunch.
The ECB has been laying the groundwork for its exit from ultra-easy policies, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has thrown its plans into disarray.
Eurozone inflation is running at a record high 5.8%, almost three times the ECB’s 2% target and the war, by sparking a spike in energy prices, is causing upward pressure on inflation. At the same time, it is clouding the outlook for global economic growth.
The ECB on Thursday is expected to stick to its plans to end asset purchases under its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP), while doubling asset buying under its longer running Asset Purchase Program in the second quarter.
ECB President Christine Lagarde will hold a post-policy meeting press conference at 8:30 AM ET (1.30 GMT). She may be pressed on plans for rate hikes, having last month walked back on a pledge not to lift rates this year.
The U.K. is to release GDP data for January on Friday, which is expected to point to a modest rebound of 0.2% after contracting by the same amount in December.
Despite the war in Ukraine, financial markets still expect the Bank of England to raise rates from 0.5% to their pre-pandemic level of 0.75% on March 17 amid rising price pressures.
Canada is to release its February jobs report on Friday, after the Bank of Canada hiked rates for the first time in over three years last week.
BOC Governor Tiff Macklem did not rule out a rare 50-basis-point rate hike in the future if needed to curb soaring inflation.
Meanwhile, Russia is to release February inflation data on Wednesday, with CPI expected to tick up to 8.8% as the impact of Western sanctions begin to take effect.

383,"<span>Mar 06, 2022 07:05AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) -Moody's cut Russia's credit rating to Ca on Sunday, the second-lowest rung of its ratings ladder, citing central bank capital controls that are likely to restrict payments on the country's foreign debt and lead to default. 
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said its decision to cut Russia's rating was ""driven by severe concerns around Russia's willingness and ability to pay its debt obligations"".
Russia's economy has been plunged into crisis as a result of harsh sanctions imposed by the West which include freezing assets of the central bank held overseas and severing several Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments systems. 
The central bank last week put a temporary halt on payments and on Wednesday said it had barred coupon payments for foreign investors holding rouble-denominated sovereign debt, known as OFZs. It did not say how long the curbs would be in place. 
On Sunday, the central bank said Russian creditors and those from countries that had not joined in with sanctioning the country would be paid in roubles at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of payment. 
Creditors could also be paid in the currency in which the debt was issued if they obtained special permission, it said.
For creditors from other countries, payments would be deposited in roubles into a special account which would be governed by rules set by the central bank, it added. 
After local OFZ holders received coupon payments, withheld from non-residents last week, focus has shifted to March 16 when Russia must pay $107 million in coupons across two Eurobonds.
Moody's said default risks had increased, and that foreign bondholders were likely to recoup only part of their investment.
""The likely recovery for investors will be in line with the historical average, commensurate with a Ca rating,"" it said. ""At the Ca rating level, the recovery expectations are at 35 to 65% (of face value)."" 
Moody's and its ratings agency peers Fitch and S%P Global had scored Russia at investment-grade levels of Baa3/BBB as recently as March 1. All three have since cut their scores several notches, putting the sovereign deep into ""junk"" territory. 

S&P rates Russia at ""CCC-minus"" while Fitch has it on B, with a negative outlook, meaning a further downgrade is likely. 
Moody's only ratings rung lower than Ca is C, which equates to Selective or Restricted Default under the Fitch and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) classifications.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea will implement export controls against Belarus for ""effectively supporting the Russian invasion of Ukraine"", Seoul's foreign ministry said on Sunday.
The ministry did not detail what measures would be taken, but said they will be applied in a similar way to moves already taken by South Korea against Russia. It condemned Moscow as having launched an ""armed invasion"" of Ukraine.
South Korea said last month it would tighten export controls against Russia by banning shipments of strategic items and join Western countries' moves to block some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system.
""The Korean government decided today to implement export control measures against Belarus as well, judging that Belarus is effectively supporting the Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" the ministry said in Sunday's statement.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"". Last month Russia's Ambassador to South Korea Andrey Kulik expressed regret at the sanctions, blaming ""strong outside pressure"" on Seoul from the United States and its Western partners.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The International Monetary Fund on Saturday said it expected to bring Ukraine's request for $1.4 billion in emergency financing to its board for approval as early as next week and was in talks about funding options with authorities in neighboring Moldova.
In a statement, the global lender said the war in Ukraine was already driving energy and grain prices higher, and had sent a wave of more than 1 million refugees to neighboring countries, while triggering unprecedented sanctions on Russia.
""While the situation remains highly fluid and the outlook is subject to extraordinary uncertainty, the economic consequences are already very serious,"" the IMF said in a statement after a board meeting chaired by Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.
""The ongoing war and associated sanctions will also have a severe impact on the global economy,"" it warned, noting that the crisis was creating an adverse shock to inflation and economic activity at a time when price pressures were already high.
It said price shocks would be felt worldwide, and authorities should provide fiscal support for poor households for whom food and fuel made up a higher proportion of expenses, adding that the economic damage would increase if the war escalated.
Sweeping sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States, European countries and others would also have ""a substantial impact on the global economy and financial markets, with significant spillovers to other countries.""
IMPACT ON UKRAINE, MOLDOVA
In addition to the human toll, Ukraine was experiencing substantial economic damage, with sea ports and airports closed and damaged, and many roads and bridges damaged or destroyed.
""While it is very difficult to assess financing needs precisely at this stage, it is already clear that Ukraine will face significant recovery and reconstruction costs,"" it said.
The board was expected to consider Ukraine's request for $1.4 billion in emergency financing as early as next week. Ukraine also has $2.2 billion available through June under an existing stand-by arrangement, the IMF said last week.

Moldova and other countries with close economic ties to Ukraine and Russia were at ""particular risk"" of scarcity and supply disruptions, the IMF said.
It said IMF staff were actively discussing funding options with Moldova, which has requested an augmentation and rephasing of its existing $558 million IMF loan program to help meet the costs of the current crisis.

ROME (Reuters) -Italian police have seized villas and yachts worth 143 million euros ($156 million) from five high-profile Russians who were placed on sanctions lists following Moscow's attack on Ukraine, the government said on Saturday.
The luxury properties were sequestered in some of Italy's most prestigious retail estate locations - the island of Sardinia, by Lake Como and in Tuscany - while two superyachts were grabbed at their moorings in northern ports.
The police operations were part of a coordinated drive by Western states to penalise wealthy Russians and try to force President Vladimir Putin to withdraw his troops from Ukraine.
A list issued by Prime Minister Mario Draghi's office showed the most valuable asset now in police hands is a 65 metre (215 ft) yacht, the ""Lady M"", which has a price tag of 65 million euros and belonged to Russia's richest man, Alexey Mordashov.
It was impounded in the port of Imperia.
A second luxury vessel, the Lena, was seized in the nearby port of Sanremo. It was worth some 50 million euros and was owned by Gennady Timchenko, whom Putin has described as one of his closet associates.
Billionaire businessman Alisher Usmanov had a villa worth 17 million euros seized on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia, while Oleg Savchenko, a member of the Russian parliament, had his 17th century house near the Tuscan city of Lucca, worth some 3 million euros, taken from him.
An undisclosed number of properties valued at 8 million euros were confiscated in Como from state TV host Vladimir Soloviev, who reportedly complained https://tinyurl.com/2p8994kf on Russian television when he found out last month he risked losing his Italian villas. 
""But you told us that Europe has sacred property rights,"" he was quoted saying by The Daily Beast.
Russian oligarchs have bought numerous villas in choice Italian settings over the past 20 years and sources have said more assets are expected to be seized in coming days. 
Uzbekistan-born metals and telecoms tycoon Usmanov is well known in Italy for owning multiple properties on Sardinia, while Italian media say Mordashov owned a villa worth some 66 million euros ($72 million) on the same island.
Taking into account the assets of his whole family, Forbes magazine estimates that Mordashov had an estimated net worth of $29.1 billion before sanctions hit.
Mirko Idili, a coordinator of the CISL union in Sardinia, has warned that the sanctions and a reduced presence of rich Russians this summer could negatively affect the island's economy and put more than 1,000 jobs at risk.

Italian banks were instructed by the Bank of Italy's financial intelligence division on Friday to urgently let it know of all measures taken to freeze the assets of people and entities placed on the EU list.

387,"<span>Mar 05, 2022 10:20AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - Russia's escalating war in Ukraine has sent commodity and energy prices soaring, boosted safe havens and hammered Europe's common currency and its stock markets. 
Below are six charts showing the recent dramatic market moves:
EURO IN THE DOLDRUMS
The euro fell below $1.10 on Friday for the first time in almost two years, having shed over 3% against the dollar this week for its biggest weekly fall since March 2020.
The single currency was nursing even bigger losses against the Swiss franc. It is down almost 4% over the week in its biggest such fall since January 2015, when Switzerland abandoned the franc's three-year-old cap against the euro.
Worries that Russia's invasion of Ukraine will deal the economy a fresh blow, especially as energy prices soar, explain why the currency is one of the week's biggest losers. Graphic: The euro takes a beating, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/akvezxnlepr/euroforkarin.PNG 
GRAINS & METALS 
Prices of raw materials from wheat to various metals have soared to multi-year highs as Western sanctions have disrupted air and sea shipments of commodities produced and exported by Russia.
Russia and Ukraine are two of the world's biggest exporters of wheat, which scaled a 14-year peak on Friday, having gained nearly 40% since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Russia is also a supplier of metals. Aluminium hit a record high on Friday while copper, where the country supplies 3.5% of world supplies, was also flirting with a fresh all-time peak.
Graphic: Grains and metals, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgpdwaakxvo/Wheat%20and%20commodity%20prices.PNG ENERGY & GAS 
Brent crude prices rose another 21% over the week, closing at their highest since 2013, with buyers and shippers increasingly shunning Russian oil supplies which total up to five million barrels per day (bpd).
Neither the possibility of a million bpd of Iranian crude coming on tap in case of a revived nuclear deal with the West nor developed countries' deal for a coordinated release of 60 million barrels made a dent.
European gas prices notched an astonishing 120% weekly gain, to hit 208 euros per megawatt hour -- a record high. Graphic: Brent crude and European gas prices, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbpgnzzgjvq/Brent%20crude%20and%20European%20gas%20prices.PNG 
EUROPEAN BANKS PUNISHED 
European banks had another gruelling week, hit by a triple whammy of Western sanctions on Russia, a scaling back of rate hike expectations and a worsening macroeconomic environment. 
The moves reverse all the gains made earlier this year when it appeared that economic recovery would allow central banks to raise interest rates, benefiting banks. 
A European banking stocks index fell around 16%, its worst week since March 2020, bringing year-to-date losses to 20%. Shares in Russia-exposed lenders such as Austria's Raiffeisen and France's SocGen fell around a third over the week. Graphic: European banking stocks down over 16% this week, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdvzybngwpw/banks%20for%20karin.PNG 
LOVING BUNDS 
Turmoil in European markets, heightened uncertainty over the economic outlook and a scaling back of rate-hike bets meant investors were keen to snap up safe-haven bonds.
In Germany -- the euro area's benchmark bond issuer -- 10-year bond yields fell 30 bps this week in their biggest one-week fall since the euro debt crisis in 2011.
At -0.08%, German Bund yields are back in negative yield territory. In other words, investors are willing to pay Germany's government to hold its bonds in an uncertain environment. That was not the case a week ago, when Bund yields stood at 0.22%. Graphic: Bund yields below zero, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgpomzjqrpd/Bund%20yields%20back%20below%20zero.PNG 
ROUBLE DISCONNECT 

Russia's rouble has tumbled more than 30% in offshore trade - its worst week on record - and around 20% in Moscow trade. Bid-ask spread are very wide - a sign of evaporating liquidity.
The divergence between onshore and offshore trade illustrates just how disconnected Russia has become from global financial markets after severe sanctions and countermeasures.

388,"<span>Mar 05, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - In bright sunshine, a long queue of shoppers snaked outside an IKEA store near Moscow this week. Similar scenes were repeated across Russia as families rushed to spend their fast-depreciating roubles at the Swedish retailer which is exiting the crisis-hit country.
Russians are bracing for an uncertain future of spiraling inflation, economic hardship and an even sharper squeeze on imported goods. 
The rouble has lost a third of its value this week after unprecedented Western sanctions were imposed to punish Russia for invading Ukraine. The moves froze much of the central bank's $640 billion in reserves and barred several banks from global payments system SWIFT, leaving the rouble in free-fall.
(Graphic: Russia's currency reserves have surged more that 75% since 2015, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgpdwxzkxvo/Pasted%20image%201644935695631.png) 
Cities across Russia were outwardly calm, with little sign of the crisis devastating financial sector and markets. Except for the lines of people looking to stock up on products – mostly high-end items and hardware – before shelves empty or prices climb further.
""The purchases that I planned to make in April, I urgently bought today. A friend from Voronezh also told me to buy for her,"" shopper Viktoriya Voloshina told Reuters in Rostov, a town 217 kilometers (135 miles) from Moscow. 
Voloshina said she was looking for office shelves and tables and also shopping on behalf of a friend from another town. ""My heart is breaking,"" she added.
Dmitry, another Moscow resident, lamented rapid price rises.
""The watch I wanted to buy now costs around 100,000 rubles, compared to 40,000 around a week ago,"" he said, declining to give his surname.
But the spending burst visible this week may peter out.
While there is no palpable sign of panic, the wipe-out of rouble savings and the doubling of interest rates to 20% will squeeze mortgage holders and consumers. 
Financial conditions -- reflecting availability of credit in the economy -- have tightened brutally this year, which Oxford Economics predicted would shrink domestic demand by 11% by year end and raise unemployment by 1.9 percentage points in 2023. 
Zach Witlin, an analyst at Eurasia Group, notes sanctions are already hitting consumers via prices hikes and digital payments disruptions. 
While consumers are not directly targeted, ""fear and caution are exaggerating the impact,"" with the exit of foreign brands such as IKEA creating a ""snowball effect,"" he added.
(Graphic: Russian financial conditions have tightened, https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/RUSSIA/dwpkrlknrvm/chart_eikon.jpg) 
IMPORTS TO ISOLATION
Cars, machinery and car parts comprised nearly half of Russia's $293 billion imports last year, according to the Federal Customs Service.
The government's strenuous import cutbacks in recent years mean 2021 imports remained 7% below 2013 levels, before the first sanctions following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.
(Graphic: Russian imports and exports, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjexzqve/Pasted%20image%201646418036290.png) 
It has also beefed up trade with China, which is the only country to boost exports to Russia since 2014. 
(Graphic: China's trade with Russia, https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/xmvjoerqapr/chart.png) 
But further declines look inevitable as the rouble plunges, insurers refuse cover to businesses exporting to Russia and shippers back away from Russian ports whether to export or to import.
While only a few Russian companies are targeted by sanctions ""all of them will feel the chilling effect,"" said Matt Townsend, sanctions partner at law firm Allen & Overy. ""This is why sanctions are a very effective measure to isolate a country.""
The immediate economic shock will cause a 35% GDP contraction in the second quarter and a 7% decline in 2022, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) predicted. But ""growing political and economic isolation will curtail Russia's growth potential in years to come,"" it added.
That may come about if restrictions ""limit the acquisition of technology needed to support Russia's highest value industries,"" RBC Global Asset Management warned. 
The Biden administration is preparing rules to curb Moscow's ability to import smartphones, aircraft parts and auto components. 
But multinationals, from tech firms Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to consumer goods producers  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and  Diageo  (LON:DGE), have severed links with Russia, meaning shoppers will have limited access to the consumer goods they have grown accustomed to over three decades.
Chinese companies, so far staying put, could grab some market share but they too could fall prey to secondary sanctions as many of their products such as smartphones use U.S. origin technology.
Some Russians are not staying to find out. Lidia, a freelance worker from Rostov said the money transfer curbs were complicating receiving payments from abroad.

""The sanctions have hit me very hard. Prices are already up around 20%...It's a fact that you already can't buy some medicines. Things will get worse,"" she said. 
""Today my family and I are leaving Russia.""

BEIJING (Reuters) -China on Saturday targeted slower economic growth of around 5.5% this year as headwinds including an uncertain global recovery and a downturn in the country's vast property sector cast a pall on the world's second-largest economy. 
As economic conditions soften, the central bank has started cutting interest rates, local governments have expedited infrastructure spending and the finance ministry has pledged more tax cuts. 
There were few surprises in Premier Li Keqiang's annual work report to the annual session of parliament, as China puts a premium on stability in a politically sensitive year during which President Xi Jinping is expected to secure a precedent-breaking third leadership term in the autumn.
""We must make economic stability our top priority,"" Li told delegates gathered at the cavernous Great Hall of the People on the west side of Tiananmen Square.
Amid coronavirus curbs, this year's parliamentary meeting will be the shortest ever at 6-1/2 days. 
""The world economic recovery lacks drive, and commodity prices remain high and are prone to fluctuation. All of this is making our external environment increasingly volatile, grave and uncertain,"" Li said. 
While the government vowed to ensure supply of key agricultural products including grains, the agriculture minister said on the sidelines of parliament China's current wheat crop-growing condition could be the worst in history.
Li said that maintaining steady export growth is getting harder, and supply of energy and raw materials remains inadequate.
Also weighing on the economy is a property downturn triggered by a government campaign to control borrowing among highly indebted developers. An ensuing tightening in liquidity squeezed the sector and chilled buyer sentiment. 
Still, China left its consumer price index target unchanged at around 3%.
Last year, China's gross domestic product grew 8.1%, beating the government's target of over 6%, helped by robust exports to economies hit by COVID-19 and a low statistical base in 2020, when the pandemic began to spread worldwide. 
Some analysts said this year's goal is tougher to reach.
""It may be a bit difficult to achieve the target, and we need to take some measures to achieve it,"" said Zong Liang, chief researcher at Bank of China.
'OVERSEAS RISKS'
While investing abroad under China's Belt and Road initiative, China must guard against ""overseas risks"", Li said, in contrast to his push last year for outbound investment and cooperation.
He did not mention the war in Ukraine, in which China has refused to condemn Russia's attack or call it an invasion. As usual, Li's report was primarily focused on economic issues.
Apart from the pandemic, implications from the Russia-Ukraine conflict for supply chains and price volatility also cloud China's near-term outlook. 
Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said Li's caution reflects potential geopolitical risks. ""The Ukraine crisis and the sanctions imposed by many countries on Russia have made such risks clear,"" he said.
China faces defence challenges on several fronts, from Chinese-claimed Taiwan to U.S. naval and air missions in the disputed South China Sea, and a separate budget report on Saturday said defence spending will rise 7.1% this year, more than last year's increase.
China remains committed to the Communist Party's policy of ""resolving the Taiwan question in the new era"", Li said. 
JOB TARGETS
Guo Tianyong, an influential economist at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing, told Reuters that hitting 5% growth is crucial. ""If growth is lower than 5%, it could affect job creation,"" he said. 
The government set a target to create at least 11 million urban jobs, unchanged from last year's goal.
China targeted a budget deficit around 2.8% of gross domestic product, narrowing from last year's goal of around 3.2%, while the quota for local government special bond issuance was set at 3.65 trillion yuan ($578 billion), flat from last year. 

The budget deficit ratio was lowered to boost fiscal sustainability, Finance Minister Liu Kun said on the sidelines of parliament. [L2N2V805Z]

Investing.com -- Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell confirmed plans this week to back a 25-basis point rate increase at the March meeting, but a quarter-point hike risks the Fed falling even further behind in its efforts to curb inflation.
“A 25 basis points rate hike at the March meeting would be a no decision as opposed to a decision … and it’s not going pull the handbrake on the inflation momentum that arguably is being further fueled [by the Russia-Ukraine conflict], Johan Grahn, head of ETF Strategy at Allianz told Investing.com in an interview on Monday, ahead of Fed chairman Jerome Powell’s remarks earlier this week.
In testimony before Congress, Powell said he would support a 25-basis point, or 0.25%, rate hike in March, though added that he was ""prepared to raise by more than that in a meeting or meetings"" if inflation doesn’t subside later this year as expected.
Powell also flagged the “highly uncertain” impact to the economic outlook from the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
But while uncertainty appears to be the only certainty concerning the outcome of the Ukraine crisis, the Fed still has a job to do. That job, the dual mandate job, is to maximize employment and ensure stable prices.
In 2020, the Fed tweaked the framework it used to react to changes in inflation and labor market trends.
Under this new framework, “employment is an important driver of policy decisions when there's excess slack in the labor market, but it drops out completely once the unemployment rate dips below 4%...,” Jefferies said in a report earlier this year.
With the unemployment rate running below 4%, the Fed’s dual mandate has arguably become a one-dual mandate to curb the pace of inflation now running at a 40-year high of 7.5%.
Fresh inflation data due next week ahead of the Fed's March 15-16 meeting, is expected to show that inflation rose to nearly 8% last month, and is likely to remain elevated as ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine has caused significant swings in commodity prices, which will no doubt exert upward pressure on inflation in the coming months,"" according to Jefferies.
Earlier this week, Powell confirmed what the market has known for a while: the Fed is well behind the curve on inflation, and it's pretty much an inside job as the central bank was too slow to react to signs of elevated price pressures.   
""We would have engaged our tools earlier,"" Powell said earlier this week after conceded that the central bank's expectations for supply-side problems to dissipate at a faster pace failed to materialize. 
In the wake of the Ukraine crisis that threatens global growth and is set to ramp up the pace of inflation, the Fed unfortunately finds itself between a rock and hard a place.
Hike rates too aggressively slowing an economy that is already expected to decelerate amid red-hot inflation, increases the risk of stagflation ahead. But hike cautiously, and there’s little room for flexibility to save the economy in the event of a significant slowdown.  
“If you don't have a way to treat the patient down the road … this could be in two, three, or maybe five years, it becomes really dangerous, and now we're talking about a much longer secular type of [stagflation] problem.
“In my view, it’s so critical that the Fed stay on point as we are off an already delayed rate hike cycle,” Grahn added."

BEIJING (Reuters) -China will spend 7.1% more on defence this year, outpacing last year's hike and the government's modest economic growth forecast as Premier Li Keqiang seeks to safeguard the country's sovereignty, security and development interests.
Li pledged to enhance military training and combat readiness for the People's Liberation Army, which is developing an array of weapons from stealth fighters to aircraft carriers.
The spending figure, set at 1.45 trillion yuan ($229.47 billion) in the national budget released on Saturday, is closely watched by China's neighbours and in Washington as a barometer of how aggressively the country will beef up its military.
This year's 7.1% hike marks the seventh consecutive single-digit increase, but is the fastest pace since the 7.5% proposed for 2019.
It also comes in above targeted slower economic growth of around 5.5% amid domestic headwinds for the world's second largest economy, including a downturn in the country's vast real estate sector and lacklustre consumption.
China is nervous about challenges on several fronts, ranging from Chinese-claimed Taiwan to U.S. naval and air missions in the disputed South China Sea near Chinese-occupied islands and a festering border dispute with India.
Li, in his state-of-the-nation address to the largely rubber-stamp legislature, said this year the government would move faster to modernise the military's logistics and asset management systems, and build a modern weaponry and equipment management system. 
""We will continue the reform of national defence and the military and step up innovations in defence science and technology,"" he added. 
""Government at all levels must give strong support to the development of national defence and the armed forces, so unity between the military and government and between the military and the people will remain rock solid.""
The budget gives only a raw figure for military expenditure, with no breakdown. Many diplomats and foreign experts believe Beijing under-reports the real number.
China's reported defence budget in 2022 is less than a third of proposed U.S. spending.
ARMS RACE?
Takashi Kawakami, a professor at Japan's Takushoku University, said the spending increase was ""significant.""
""We will see how the U.S. responds to the increase in the defence budget, and how much China will increase its defence budget next year, but it looks like it will result in an arms race.""
President Joe Biden is expected to ask Congress for a U.S. defence budget exceeding $770 billion for the next fiscal year as the Pentagon seeks to modernize the military, sources told Reuters last month.
China has long argued that it needs to close the gap with the United States. China, for example, has two aircraft carriers, compared with 11 in active service for the United States.
Beijing routinely says that spending for defensive purposes is a comparatively low percentage of its GDP and that critics want to demonize it as a threat to world peace.
Kuo Yu-jen, a security expert at Taiwan's National Sun Yat-sen University's Institute of China and Asia-Pacific Studies, said Beijing was being forced to spend more on research and development in light of the China-U.S. technology war.

""Costs for China's third and fourth aircraft carriers are going up, too,"" he added.

Western allies have moved to isolate Russia's economy and financial system since its invasion of Ukraine, including sanctioning its central bank and oligarchs who amassed fortunes and political influence under Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Bank of Italy division, known as UIF, said in a statement that all notifications from banks had to give details of the subjects involved and the value and nature of the assets, and to be sent ""as soon as possible"".
Its request comes after the Italian Treasury's financial security committee met on Thursday to review what had already been done as well as the planned actions to freeze the assets, the finance ministry said in a separate statement.
The Treasury added the committee had intensified activities to ensure the effectiveness of the sanctions, which apply to both real estate and financial resources.
French authorities said on Thursday they had seized four cargo vessels and a luxury yacht linked to oligarchs, while in Germany a nearly $600 million palatial pleasure craft owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, also on the EU's sanctions list, was sitting in a Hamburg shipyard.

Uzbekistan-born metals and telecoms tycoon Usmanov is well known in Italy for owning properties on the island of Sardinia.
Mirko Idili, a coordinator of the CISL union in Sardinia, said sanctions and a reduced presence of rich Russians could negatively affect the island's economy and put more than 1,000 jobs at risk.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia’s takeover of Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine should spur companies and policymakers to be more careful in plans to build reactors to fight climate change, nuclear safety experts said on Friday.
Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Friday after heavy fighting sparked a huge blaze in a training building at the site. The fire was extinguished and officials said the facility was safe.
But the seizure, a week after Russian troops took over Ukraine's defunct but still radioactive Chernobyl plant, triggered global alarm about vulnerabilities of nuclear energy to wartime attacks that could unleash deadly radiation. 
""You have to take more seriously the need to ensure protection in nuclear plants, not only for natural disasters, but also for manmade ones,” said Edwin Lyman, the director of nuclear power safety at the Union for Concerned scientists.
Linda Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Friday that the attack on Zaporizhzhia was ""incredibly reckless and dangerous. And it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe.""
The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine called the Russian assault on the plant a ""war crime"". 
Henry Sokolski, head of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, a nonprofit group, said the attack struck a blow to the nuclear power industry as a whole: 
""The nuclear reactor in Ukraine didn't take a hit last night as big as nuclear power will if officials factor in the military vulnerability of these machines,"" he said. 
RACE TO NUCLEAR
Plans to develop nuclear power, which generates electricity while emitting virtually no greenhouse gases, have accelerated in recent years as governments pledge to fight global warming. 
There are now 58 reactors under construction and 325 proposed around the globe, according to the World Nuclear Association. Many proposed plants are in Eastern Europe.
The White House said in November that U.S. company NuScale Power LLC had inked plans with Romania to build a small modular reactor (SMR) plant, adding the agreement positioned ""U.S. technology to lead in the global race for SMR deployment.""
Last month NuScale, majority owned by construction and engineering company  Fluor Corp  (NYSE:FLR), signed an agreement with Polish company KGHM Polska to build another small modular reactor plant in Poland by 2029 as part of an effort to reduce dependence on coal, which emits large amounts of carbon dioxide and lung-damaging soot when burned.
NuScale also signed an agreement in December with Kazakhstan Nuclear Power Plants LLP (KNPP) to explore the deployment of the power plants in that country. 
Diane Hughes, a NuScale spokesperson, said the Zaporizhzhia ""incident once again highlights the fact that nuclear energy plants have robust, resilient and redundant safety features"" and that its technology is even safer. 
And in January, Westinghouse Electric Co signed cooperation agreements with 10 Polish companies for the possible construction of six AP1000 conventional nuclear reactors. It also signed a memo with Rafako SA on the possibility of developing nuclear plants in Ukraine, Slovenia and the Czech Republic.
Cathy Mann, a Westinghouse spokesperson, said ""nuclear energy is a safe, carbon-free source in Ukraine and around the world.""
Third Way, a Washington-based think tank that supports nuclear power, said the severity of climate change means the world must rapidly increase nuclear energy in the next few decades despite the risks.
""No energy source is entirely without risk,"" said Josh Freed, the group's senior vice president for climate and energy. ""If (Russia President Vladimir) Putin wants to kill countless people by blowing up a dam or attacking a nuclear plant, he could do it. But the fact is ... nuclear plants are incredibly safe,"" Freed said.
Others disagree.
Lyman from UCS dismissed as ""glib talk"" contentions that new nuclear reactors will be ""so safe and they can be deployed, essentially anywhere in the world with minimal protection.""
The Nuclear Energy Institute, the U.S. industry group, told Reuters it believes nuclear reactors are safe and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine only reinforces the need for Europe to expand its nuclear energy capacity. 

Russia is currently a major supplier of natural gas to Europe’s power plants.
""We expect that the tragic events of the past weeks will only increase interest in working with the United States on next-generation nuclear energy deployment,"" said John Kotek, senior vice president of policy development and public affairs at NEI.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina has sealed a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $45 billion program, which will push looming debt payments down the road while tying the country to an agreed economic program.
That agreement still needs approval from Argentina's Congress and the IMF board.
WHY DID ARGENTINA NEED THIS DEAL?
Argentina, which has had 22 huge bailouts from the IMF, agreed to a record $57 billion program in 2018 under then-President Mauricio Macri. That deal failed to head off economic crisis and the country slumped into recession with high inflation.
Unable to pay back its debts, the country revamped over $100 billion in bonds with private creditors in 2020 before turning its attention to the over $40 billion outstanding with the IMF.
The country faces some $17.5 billion of payments under the 2018 agreement this year which it cannot pay.
""The agreement was necessary in order not to default with the IMF,"" said economist Roberto Geretto of Fundcorp.
WHAT'S THE NEW SCHEDULE?
Once fully approved by Congress and the IMF board, the fund is set to make disbursements of the $45 billion over a 2-1/2 year period, much of which will go towards repaying the debt from the 2018 program. Each payment will come after a review.
Those payments from the IMF would be heavily front-loaded, with over three-quarters of it to be handed out in the first six payments of a total 11 planned disbursements, according to the government's letter of intent to the lender.
Argentina will have to start making repayments from 2026, which should be completed by 2034.
""This allows extending the terms for the country to carry out reforms, normalize its situation and be able to return to the international capital markets,"" said Eugenio Marí, an economist at the Fundación Libertad y Progreso.
WHAT'S IN THE ECONOMIC PROGRAM?
The deal comes with an economic program that includes targets to hit a primary fiscal balance by 2025, rein in inflation currently running at an annual rate of over 50% and reduce central bank financing of the treasury.
Argentina will also have to cut by 0.6% of GDP huge energy subsidies that the government uses to keep bills low. Those subsidies amounted to around $11 billion last year.
The program, progress on which will be reviewed on a quarterly basis, will also include targets to deliver real positive interest rates, bolster foreign currency reserve levels and spur net exports.

BUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Argentine sovereign bonds tumbled some 2.3% on Friday, a day after the government struck a $45 billion staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund, a painful reminder that investors remain wary of the country's economic outlook.
The government and IMF announced the agreement on Thursday for a 30-month extended fund facility, including a program to tame high inflation, reduce money printing to finance the fiscal deficit, and deliver positive real interest rates.
That deal, which needs approval from Congress and the IMF board, has already come under fire from some opposition lawmakers and some hard-left members of the ruling Peronist coalition, with doubts raised as to whether it can be implemented.
""This is not enough to solve Argentina's problems,"" said Buenos Aires-based Camilo Tiscornia from consultancy C&T. ""We are going to have to comply with the agreement, which will not be easy, so there we will have a very significant challenge.""
The tightly controlled peso currency edged down on Friday, though it strengthened in popular alternative markets. The S&P Merval stock index dropped over 2.5%, while a JP Morgan Argentina country risk index climbed.
Bonds, including 2046 and 2035 maturities, sunk below 30 cents on the dollar, territory that reflects investor fears over potential defaults in the future despite the IMF breakthrough, though the wider global market context didn't help either.
""The war in Ukraine took some of the air out of the good news of the deal,"" one analyst said.
Armando Armenta, New York-based senior economist for AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB), said the deal had already been priced in after a pre-agreement was announced in January, but it nonetheless remained a positive for the country.
""Yesterday's announcement confirms our long-held view that Argentine authorities understand the dire consequences of falling into arrears with the IMF,"" he said.
""We expect that the agreement will be ratified by Congress, although by a slim margin, as radical members of the government coalition and the opposition would try to distance themselves from the agreement.""
Congress is expected to start scrutinizing and debating the IMF agreement next week. It formally arrived in Congress on Friday.
Economy Minister Martin Guzman told local radio on Friday that the government hoped that the bill would be approved before a $2.8 billion payment to the IMF comes due on March 21, which would allow the country to pay it with newly received funds.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Friday the Biden administration's economic agenda will not only expand the productive capacity of the U.S. economy, but can propel faster growth by reducing economic and racial disparities.
In remarks to a Stanford University economics conference, Yellen provided more details on the approach she has branded ""modern supply-side economics,"" which incorporates the key elements from the Biden administration's ""Build Back Better"" agenda: investments in child care, education, job training, infrastructure and healthcare.
Despite a strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, Yellen said sluggish growth forecasts in coming decades due to an aging population mean that a model is needed.
""These facts suggest the need for a policy approach that fosters greater equity across places and races while, at the same time, propelling faster aggregate growth,"" Yellen said.
She said her modern supply-side economics concept - a new twist on the Reagan-era term associated with ""trickle-down"" economics driven by tax cuts - aims to expand U.S. growth potential through investments in boosting productivity, such as more research funding, coupled with an expanded workforce, through better education and child care funding to draw more women into the labor force.
Yellen introduced the concept in January during the World Economic Forum.
But instead of having those benefits flow to a limited number of booming cities and wealthy communities, she said the Biden administration's plans would ensure that ""disadvantaged communities and racial groups receive an adequate share of investments in both physical and human capital.""
""Such an approach yields larger aggregate gains under the basic economic premise that returns to investment exhibit diminishing returns,"" Yellen said. ""In the context of investments in people, directing public resources to children and to workers who have received less education and training can yield the largest bang for the buck — and a return that can last decades."" 
Key Biden proposals that can help achieve greater equity include child care subsidies that can draw more women into the workforce, and an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit, Yellen said. 
Defending her thesis in a scholarly manner during the Stanford conference, Yellen cited research https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Economic-Gains-from-Equity_Conf-Draft.pdf co-authored by San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly showing that more equitable access to labor markets over the past 30 years would add $790 billion to the U.S. economy annually.
She also cited a paper http://klenow.com/HHJK.pdf from Stanford and University of Chicago researchers that concludes that 20% to 40% of the growth in U.S. economic output per person from 1960 to 2010 can be explained by the inclusion of women and racial minorities in highly skilled occupations, such as the rising share of non-white doctors and female lawyers.
In a question-and-answer session, Yellen said that Friday's jobs report showing 675,000 jobs added to the economy in February was a sign of underlying strength in the U.S. economy..

She said that the Federal Reserve was working to bring down inflation without causing a recession.
""This is something that is not unheard of,"" she said, noting that strong growth followed Fed rate hikes in the 1990s.

The consensus forecast of 11 analysts surveyed was for inflation to grow to 7.23% from 7.07% in January. If the prediction is correct, it would be the first increase since November, when inflation hit a 20-year high.
The core rate of inflation, which strips out some volatile food and energy items, was seen accelerating to 6.58%, which would be the highest rate since June 2001.
The Bank of Mexico targets inflation of 3%, with a one percentage point tolerance range above and below that. In February the bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points, a sixth consecutive rise, citing inflation.
The central bank's next monetary policy decision is scheduled for March 24, a week after the United States' Federal Reserve is expected to hike percentages after years of near-zero rates.

Just in February, Mexican consumer prices are estimated to have increased by 0.78% with the core price index seen advancing 0.74%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Recession concerns are showing up more prominently in the U.S. Treasury yield curve, as soaring commodity prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine fuel worries over inflation and slower growth.
The closely watched gap between yields on two- and 10-year notes stood at its narrowest since March 2020 on Friday, a signal that some investors may be anticipating that economic growth will slow from its current robust pace.
On a two-month rolling basis, the 2s/10s flattening has been its most extreme since 2011, said Jonathan Cohn, head of rates trading strategy at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Market participants watch the yield curve for insight into the U.S. economy. An inverted curve, where rates on short-term government debt exceed those on longer-term debt, has reliably predicted past recessions. 
Investors said the most recent moves appear driven by worries that prices for oil and other raw materials, which have spiked after the invasion of Ukraine by commodity-export giant Russia, will add to already-high inflation, forcing the Fed to tighten interest rates even if growth slows.
While expectations of a 50 basis-point hike this month have been all but priced out in recent weeks, markets still expect over 150 basis points of tightening by next February. [FEDWATCH]
""If central banks prioritize fighting inflation in 2022, having failed the world on that front in 2021, then hiking into a stagflationary environment likely means they are accepting some sort of recession is necessary to sort the whole mess out,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst, Asia Pacific, at OANDA, referring to a blend of weak growth and strong inflation.
Brent crude oil prices approached $120 a barrel on Thursday, their highest level since 2012, after a fresh round of U.S. sanctions that targeted Russia's oil refining sector and raised concerns that oil and gas exports could be impacted next.
At the same time, growth appears strong for now: the U.S. unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.8% in February, the Labor Department's closely watched employment report showed on Friday, raising optimism that the economy could withstand mounting headwinds from geopolitical tensions, inflation and tighter monetary policy.

Still, the curve flattening suggests that may not last.
""Flattening has accelerated as the Fed is seen prioritizing inflation moderation over backstopping risk appetite,"" said Cohn of Credit Suisse.

(Reuters) - In the two years since the COVID-19 pandemic upended the U.S. economy, the labor market has rebounded far faster than most had predicted after roughly 22 million jobs were wiped out in the space of two months in the spring of 2020.
As remarkable as the rebound has proven to be, the comeback from the low point in April 2020 has not been evenly spread across industries and demographic groups, with restaurant employment, for instance, still in a deep hole and the share of Black women with jobs trailing the recovery in other groups. 
Here's a look at some of the ways the labor market has changed over the past two years. 
INDUSTRY MIX DIFFERENT
A look at the labor market recovery by industry sends a message about the ways consumer behavior and worker preferences have changed and how health restrictions affected some industries more than others. 
Employment for leisure and hospitality businesses plunged at the start of the pandemic and is still 9% below where it was in February of 2020, data from the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report for February showed on Friday.
That is a sign that demand for travel and dining out has not fully recovered and that employers are still struggling to recruit workers for those face-to-face service jobs, even as health restrictions continue to be eased. 
Hiring for transportation and warehousing businesses, in contrast, rose early on as more people turned to online shopping and food delivery services. Those gains have continued, with industry employment now 10% above pre-pandemic levels, far more than any other sector. 
RACIAL GAPS NARROWING
The share of Black Americans who are either working or looking for work, known as the labor force participation rate, was equal to the share for white workers in both January and February of this year. 
That participation gap between the two races typically narrows late in economic expansions when labor markets are tight and businesses are competing more intensely for workers. 
BLACK WOMEN STILL LAG
Black women, who faced substantial job losses at the start of the pandemic, still have more ground to recover than other groups to close the jobs hole left by the crisis. 
The employment-to-population ratio for Black women, or the share of the population that is working, is still 2.9 percentage points below where it was in February 2020 after it dropped last month. That is nearly double the 1.5-percentage-point shortfall faced by all women and almost three times the gap left for all men when compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Still, Black and Hispanic workers have seen employment rebound strongly over the past year, with their gains outpacing those for white workers. If that trend continues, it should help close those racial gaps.
NO DIPLOMA, NO PROBLEM
In another sign that the labor market is creating more opportunities for workers on the margins, the unemployment rate for people with less than a high school diploma dropped to 4.3% last month, the lowest since the Labor Department started tracking it in 1992.
In all, just 388,000 people aged 25 and above who had not completed high school were without a job in February, roughly a fifth of the number out of work in April 2020. That is also nearly 100,000 below the previous record low in September 2019.
BROAD-BASED HIRING
The number of workers being added to company payrolls has remained robust over the last year, averaging more than 550,000 a month, a level never seen prior to the pandemic. Moreover, the breadth of hiring is as wide as it has been in more than two decades.

The Labor Department's diffusion indexes, a gauge of how widespread hiring activity is across the manufacturing sector and private-sector industries overall, shows more industries adding staff over the last 12 months, on average, than at any time since 1998. They're also up substantially from where they were in the months before the pandemic struck.
With the two diffusion indexes now near where they have peaked in the past, the question is whether the gains will continue to be as broad-based as the employment recovery matures this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth accelerated in February, pushing the unemployment rate to a two-year low of 3.8% and raising optimism that the economy could withstand mounting headwinds from geopolitical tensions, inflation and tighter monetary policy.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed the economy created 92,000 more jobs than initially estimated in December and January. It suggested that the labor market was moving past the COVID-19 pandemic and that the economy has weaned itself off government money.
Though average hourly earnings were flat last month, that was because of the return of workers in lower-paying industries and a calendar bias. Companies are raising wages to attract scarce workers, which is contributing to higher inflation. 
Economists said absent Russia's war against Ukraine, which has pushed up prices of oil, wheat and other commodities, the strong employment report would have pressured the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by half of a percentage point later this month.
""On balance, despite weakness in wages, this is one more in a long line of reports suggesting the Fed should have started raising rates ages ago,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""The Fed has its work cut out if it wants to slow demand enough to stabilize the unemployment rate at 4%."" 
The survey of establishments showed nonfarm payrolls jumped by 678,000 jobs last month, leaving employment 2.1 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level. Economists expect all the lost jobs will be recouped by the third quarter of this year. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week described the labor market as ""extremely tight,"" and told lawmakers that he would support a 25-basis-point interest rate increase at the U.S. central bank's March 15-16 policy meeting. Economists expect as many as seven rate hikes this year. 
Employment growth was boosted by subsiding infections of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. At least 1.6 million people reported they were not at work last month because of illness, sharply down from a record 3.6 million in January. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would rise by 400,000 jobs, with estimates ranging from as low as 200,000 to as high as 730,000. February's broad increase in employment gains was led by the leisure and hospitality industry, one of the sectors hardest hit by the Omicron variant. 
Leisure and hospitality payrolls increased by 179,000 jobs. Employment at restaurants and bars shot up 124,000, while hotels and motels added 28,000 workers. Employment in the professional and business services industry increased by 95,000 jobs. 
Retailers added 37,000 jobs. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 36,000 jobs, while construction employment rose by 60,000. Government employment increased by 24,000 jobs.
The report was, however, overshadowed by the Russia-Ukraine war. Stocks on Wall Street dropped sharply in early trading before paring some losses, while the dollar rallied against a basket of currencies as investors sought safe havens. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
MORE PEOPLE WORKING
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent oil prices surging above $100 a barrel, which will keep U.S. inflation boiling for a while and hurt consumer spending in the near term. 
The unchanged reading in average hourly earnings followed a 0.6% increase in January. Data for the employment report is collected during the week that includes the 12th day of the month. 
""There's a very well-established pattern when the 15th of the month falls on a Saturday that typically boosts average hourly earnings that month and the following month falls to the downside,"" said Robert Rosener, a senior economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York. ""That was the case in January, when the 15th of the month fell on a Saturday ... and February was expected to show some payback that would drag down the figure.""
Wages rose 5.1% in the 12 months through February after advancing 5.5% in January. Wages for production and non-supervisory workers rose 0.3% from January.
The average workweek increased to 34.7 hours from 34.6 in January. Aggregate hours worked rebounded 0.8%, which bodes well for economic growth this quarter.
""With the rebound in hours worked and further gains projected for March, real GDP is expected to rise by close to 3% (annualized rate) in the first quarter,"" said Brian Bethune, professor of practice at Boston College. ""The 'Black Swan' massive invasion of the Ukraine, combined with related jumps in crude oil and other commodity prices, nevertheless, throws some sand into the machinery of growth in the first half.""
Details of the household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived were equally strong. Household employment increased by 548,000 jobs, more than enough to absorb the 304,000 people who entered the labor force. 
The unemployment rate dropped two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.8% last month, the lowest level since February 2020. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, increased to 62.3%, the highest level since March 2020, from 62.2% in January. 
Men accounted for the increase, with 479,000 entering the labor force, while 48,000 women left. 
""More individuals on payrolls means greater aggregate purchasing power from consumers,"" said Peter Essele, head of portfolio management at Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts. ""The result could set up a strong second half as more spending from the newly employed is put toward goods and services. If the current trend continues, today's equity markets will look like a bargain by year end."" 

The employment-to-population ratio, viewed as a measure of an economy's ability to create employment, rose to 59.9%, also the highest since March 2020, from 59.7% in January. 
But the number of people working part-time for economic reasons shot up 418,000 to 4.1 million. That lifted a broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, to 7.2% from 7.1% in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia's war in Ukraine has ""horrified"" the World Bank's shareholders and will have lasting consequences for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia's standing on the global stage, the global lender's president said on Friday.
World Bank President David Malpass told Fox Business Network that China's reaction to the war and the Western sanctions imposed on Moscow would be influential in determining how Russia's future trade relationships develop.
""There's a global outpouring in favor of Ukraine, and that will have lasting consequences, whatever the outcome of the war,"" Malpass said, citing what he called ""a very clear focus on Putin being the source of the problem.""
He listed previous Russian invasions, including of Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Georgia in 2008 and the annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014, but said the current war was far broader.
""This is an order of magnitude worse in terms of the decimation and the deaths that are occurring, so I think there will be lasting consequences,"" he said.
SPEEDING FUNDS TO UKRAINE 
Malpass said he would speak with Ukrainian President Vododymyr Zelenskiy later on Friday and planned to submit to the World Bank's board on Friday a loan package for Ukraine that has been expanded with country contributions and has been coordinated with ""people that are in bunkers in Ukraine.""
Reuters reported on Thursday that the package had grown to 460 million euros ($503 million). Malpass said the goal was to get the money to Ukraine as early as next week. 
Malpass, a former U.S. Treasury official, said the financing for Ukraine would be ""for payment of the ongoing - call it war effort - the ongoing development effort and the medicine efforts that they need to do as a government.""
Russia's global financial isolation intensified on Friday as the London Stock Exchange suspended trading in its last Russian securities and as Europe, the United States and othe countries continued to roll out financial sanctions on Russia.

Malpass said the raft of sanctions were having a significant impact on Russia's interactions with financial markets, while raising questions about its dependence on China and delivering a huge supply shock to world energy and food markets.
China, a major shareholder in the World Bank, had to be ""horrified at where this is developing,"" Malpass said, adding, ""That'll be an important issue in how world trade develops. They buy oil from Russia when the sanctions are in place, but can the companies really remain part of the world system when they're so engaged with Russia? We'll have to see how that evolves.""

(Reuters) - It was just a hint of something good on the horizon, Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin said this week, but in his recent conversations with business officials they have been suddenly upbeat about the number of applicants for open jobs.
He wasn't ready to call it a trend, but ""you can hear the first glimmers of the labor market starting to ease,"" Barkin told a Baltimore business group. It's an observation that if it holds up could mean the pandemic backlog of too many open jobs and too few workers may be on the verge of thawing, with implications for the path of inflation, wages, and the Fed's own policy debates.
Employment data released on Friday showed that glimmer may in fact be a bright light and the first solid evidence the Fed has had in recent months that some of the key economic aftershocks from the pandemic are starting to wane.
Workers did in fact surge into jobs: Firms added 678,000 new positions, and the unemployment rate fell to 3.8%.
But just as notably for the Fed wages were flat, relieving fears of an inflationary ""wage price spiral"" and redeeming somewhat the Fed's hope that over time workers would set aside their pandemic fears, find ways around childcare or other constraints, and return to work.
The employment-to-population ratio, watched by many Fed officials as an overall barometer of labor market health, rose again, to 59.9%, and is now just 1.3 percentage points below where it was before the pandemic; an additional 300,000 people were either working or looking for work in February versus the month before, and the labor force has now grown by 2.3 million in the last five months - the type of net flow back into work or jobseeking officials have been waiting for. 
Pandemic fiscal support for households has now largely expired with the end of childcare tax credits in January, wages are higher than they were, and businesses have reported using a variety of incentives like benefits and more flexible work arrangements to fill jobs with employees who have become more selective about working conditions.
""If we see more numbers like this moving forward, we can be optimistic about this year,"" said Nick Bunker, research director at job site Indeed, who noted that many core labor market statistics are in striking distance of where they were before the pandemic. The total number of jobs is just 2.1 million below February 2020, a gap that could be filled by the start of summer at the current pace of hiring; the unemployment rate is just three-tenths of a percentage point higher; and the number of unemployed, at 6.2 million, is just around half a million more than before the pandemic.
It wasn't time yet to declare the labor market healed from the pandemic, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said in an interview. 
""We still have work to do,"" he said noting the still- elevated Black unemployment rate of 6.6%. 
But he also predicted that within the year some of the pandemic-related gaps will have closed and ""we will be back to normal job day numbers."" 
NORMALIZATION THE 'TOP PRIORITY'
The employment report for February likely keeps intact the Fed's current plans to raise interest rates at its meeting in two weeks to confront high inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he would support an initial 0.25-percentage point increase from the current near-zero level, with more increases expected during the year.
But it may also give some relief, at least for now, against calls for faster or bigger rate hikes. The last few job and inflation reports showed both prices and wages accelerating, and pushed the Fed's current policy - crafted to battle the pandemic - further out of step with a quickening economic rebound.
The pause in wage increases coupled with strong hiring and a growing labor force showed a dynamic at work that policymakers hope will take root across the economy: Improvements in the supply of goods and services, in this case labor, helping meet strong demand without excessive price hikes. 
The war in Ukraine has added a new layer of uncertainty to the outlook, as Powell noted in congressional testimony this week.
Analysts noted as well that overall hiring remains so strong that one month of flat wages may not mean much. The annual increase remains a robust 5.1%.
""We are inclined to look through the reported wage weakness,"" wrote Jefferies Chief Financial Economist Aneta Markowska. ""The labor market is hot and inflation is likely to accelerate"" to perhaps as high as 8% by March from 7.5% in January.
""Policy normalization remains the top priority for the Fed,"" she said.
The employment data arguably showed a step back towards normal, with job gains spread widely through the economy, including in some of the service industries most harmed by the pandemic. A broadening set of industries have fully rebounded to pre-pandemic employment levels, with the hardest hit leisure and hospitality sector still 9% below but improving.
High frequency data have shown steady improvement as well with momentum for more to come. Air travel has been on the rise as has in-person restaurant dining, bellwether activities marred for two years by fears of the virus.

Payroll manager UKG said recent shift data showed the impact of January's Omicron wave, which had kept millions of workers off the job at its peak, had all but faded, and that employment gains seemed to be gaining steam in the most troubled sectors.
""It's very clear that people are increasingly coming off the sidelines,"" wrote UKG Vice President Dave Gilbertson.

405,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 02:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden said the surprisingly strong February jobs report shows his economic policies are working, though he acknowledged that wage growth isn’t keeping up with extraordinary U.S. inflation.
Non-farm payrolls increased by 678,000 last month, the most since July, data from the Labor Department showed, beating estimates. However, wage growth slowed, signaling that overheated inflation will continue to eat into Americans’ purchasing power. 
The report is “a welcome reminder that we’re coming back stronger both as a country and as a people,” Biden said at the White House, but he acknowledged that the last year was “punishing.”
“So many families are still struggling, though, to make ends meet because of inflation,” he added. “I understand that our top priority still must be getting prices under control.”
An earlier statement from Biden touted the job gains without mentioning wages. Average hourly earnings were little changed in February from the prior month.
The U.S. economy has added about 7.4 million jobs since Biden took office, though that was in the depths of the coronavirus pandemic. In his statement, Biden praised the broad-based gains, saying there were additions in several sectors. 
Biden’s again called on Congress to pass parts of his “Build Back Better” agenda in his State of the Union speech this week. The plan died last year after West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin said he wouldn’t support it. 
Biden has rebranded his effort as “Building a Better America,” though Manchin remains cool to the notion, citing inflation and excessive government spending as top concerns. With the Senate divided evenly between Democrats and Republicans and the GOP uniformly opposed to Biden’s economic policies, he can’t win their passage without Manchin’s support. 
Cecilia Rouse, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said on Bloomberg Television that Biden’s team is focused on trends in wage growth “because months can be noisy.” 
“We’ve seen real wage growth in lower-paid jobs and industries,” but she acknowledged that “inflation has been higher than nominal wage growth.”
“Look, that’s not what we hope,” she added. 
The president, she said, is “looking for economic policies that generate sustained economic growth, that generate wage increases, that are powered by increases in productivity, and so that is why he is doing all that he can to both reduce prices and costs for families, to increase economic capacity so that we do have a really healthy economic recovery where everybody benefits as we have some economic growth.”

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine, one of the world's breadbasket nations, has driven wheat prices to 14-year highs, forcing bread consumers to eat the cost.
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion has severely hampered trade from Black Sea ports, driving up global Chicago benchmark wheat prices by 40% and further pushing global food inflation that was already the highest in a decade. [GRA/]
Supply disruptions from Russia and Ukraine, which together account for 30% of world wheat exports and 20% of corn exports, will erode food security for millions of people, with the Middle East and north Africa especially vulnerable due to their reliance on imports, said Julie Marshall, spokesperson for the World Food Programme. 
Oil and gas prices have also spiked due to sanctions against Russia, while costs of freight and raw materials like steel were already soaring due to pandemic-related supply chain breakdowns. 
Even consumers in two of the world's biggest wheat-growing nations, Canada and the United States, are paying the price.
""Unfortunately for the short and intermediate-term, food inflation and the cost of baked goods in the United States will go up more. This will impact the most vulnerable in our society the most,"" said Robb MacKie, president and chief executive of the American Bakers Association. 
Weeks before the latest wheat price spike, Calgary Italian Bakery in Alberta raised prices 7% to keep pace with costs associated with last year's Canadian drought and inflation in prices of flour and yeast.
Now Louis Bontorin, co-owner of the 60-year-old family business, fears he will need to raise prices significantly again, once he has depleted his four to five months' flour supply.
""This could be really, really devastating,"" Bontorin said. ""Bread is one of the fundamentals, the essentials, and that's the hard part. You're trying to just take what you need, but you're also cognizant of what effect (higher price) has on the consumer.
""The buying power of everybody is just being eroded.""
The threat to wheat supplies from Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been exacerbated by a drop in global stocks of major exporters. 
Supplies in the European Union, Russia, the United States, Canada, Ukraine, Argentina, Australia and Kazakhstan are set to fall to a nine-year low of 57 million tonnes by the end of the 2021/22 season, International Grains Council (IGC) data shows.
'PAY THE COST OR DON'T GET YOUR FLOUR' 
Some mills signed contracts with farmers last autumn for the wheat they are currently using, insulating them for now from spikes related to the Russia-Ukraine war. But one miller said once it faces those higher costs, it will have to pass them along to the bakers that buy his flour.
""It will be mandatory. Either pay the higher cost or don't get your flour,"" said the miller, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. ""I don't think the general population has any idea what repercussions they will face.""
After Russia invaded, Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Foods' President Joe Girdner's phone started lighting up. The bakers who buy flour from his two British Columbia mills are now looking to secure supplies further out than before, on fears that prices could escalate even more.

It is also a problem for the miller. Spring wheat supplies were already running thin because of drought last year, and now global buyers who were depending on Black Sea supplies, may turn to Canada for wheat and compete with domestic mills, Girdner said.
""It's a really big concern,"" Girdner said of the Russia-Ukraine war. ""And the real story will be if this situation drags on.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -At least five superyachts owned by Russian billionaires were anchored or cruising on Wednesday in Maldives, an Indian Ocean island nation that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, ship tracking data showed.
The vessels' arrival in the archipelago off the coast of Sri Lanka follows the imposition of severe Western sanctions on Russia in reprisal for its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. 
Late on Wednesday Forbes reported that Germany had seized Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov's mega yacht in a Hamburg shipyard.
Usmanov was on a list of billionaires to face sanctions from the European Union on Monday. A Forbes report based on three sources in the yacht industry said his 512-foot yacht Dilbar, valued at $600 million, was seized by German authorities. 
German authorities did not immediately respond to Reuters inquiries. Forbes said representatives for Usmanov did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier, the Clio superyacht, owned by Oleg Deripaska, the founder of aluminium giant Rusal, who was sanctioned by the United States in 2018, was anchored off the capital Male on Wednesday, according to shipping database MarineTraffic. 
The Titan, owned by Alexander Abramov, a co-founder of steel producer Evraz, arrived on Feb. 28. 
Three further yachts owned by Russian billionaires were seen cruising in Maldives waters on Wednesday, the data showed. They include the 88-metre (288 ft) Nirvana owned by Russia's richest man, Vladimir Potanin. Most vessels were last seen anchored in Middle Eastern ports earlier in the year. 
A spokesperson for Maldives' government did not respond to a request for comment. 
The United States has said it will take strict action to seize property of sanctioned Russians.

""This coming week, we will launch a multilateral Transatlantic task force to identify, hunt down, and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs – their yachts, their mansions, and any other ill-gotten gains that we can find and freeze under the law,"" the White House said in a tweet on Sunday. 
Washington imposed sanctions on Deripaska and other influential Russians in 2018 because of their ties to President Vladimir Putin after alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, which Moscow denies.

408,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 11:45AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Governments around the world are taking steps to safeguard domestic food supplies after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine roiled trade and sent prices of key staples soaring.
Argentina and Turkey this week increased their control over local products, and Bulgaria is looking to build its grain reserves. Moldova, albeit a small shipper, temporarily banned exports of wheat, corn and sugar from this month. 
Protectionist measures -- which already picked up in recent years as the Covid-19 pandemic sparked worries about local supplies and high prices -- could spell more bad news for global food trade. The war in Ukraine has brought crop shipments from much of the crucial Black Sea region to a halt, heightening fears of shortages of grain and sunflower oil.
That’s adding to soaring global food inflation, increasing the chance of export restrictions, said Abdolreza Abbassian, an independent analyst. Harvest setbacks have exacerbated tight supply, with global grain stockpiles expected to drop for a fifth year. 
“It’s something one has to be worried about, because we know it has happened in the past,” said Abbassian, who has tracked agriculture markets for decades. “This is already a perfect storm. You don’t need that one.”
Argentina, a major grain shipper, is creating a mechanism to guarantee wheat supplies for local millers and tame pasta prices. Top flour exporter Turkey boosted the agriculture ministry’s authority over exports of an array of goods, allowing it to make “periodical arrangements” if needed. 
Elsewhere in Europe, Bulgaria is working on a system to buy grain that can be used to meet its population’s needs, the government said after a meeting with producer lobby groups on Friday. 
An association of grain producers in the country -- among the European Union’s top sellers -- had said cargoes are unofficially being obstructed from leaving ports, although the agriculture minister denied any export ban. That comes as buyers flock to alternative origins with Ukrainian ports shuttered.
“The state has the levers and mechanisms to prepare for a possible food crisis, while respecting market principles,” the Bulgarian group said earlier this week. 
In other measures, top palm grower Indonesia in January moved to curb shipments to bolster domestic supply. Russia also has been taxing grain cargoes since last year and regularly issues quotas for sales. The country’s trade has been further stifled by sanctions and dangers transiting the Black Sea. On Friday, it urged fertilizer producers to halt exports.

Gas prices have hit record highs in Europe on fears of supply disruption from Russia, which supplies about 40% of Europe's gas.
""The war shows how reliant Europe is on Russian gas,"" Energy Minister Simonetta Sommaruga told a news conference, saying Switzerland was too reliant on energy imports. ""We therefore must strengthen our own energy production."" 
Gas accounts for some 15% of Switzerland's energy use, Sommaruga said, roughly half of which is from Russia. 
""As the corresponding procurements can only be made jointly by the gas companies due to their size, agreements are necessary within the industry... (so) the Federal Council decided that the industry can already make the procurements jointly without having to fear anti-trust consequences at a later date,"" the government said.
It also said its energy supply was secure for this winter but faced ""residual risk"" in the event of further major unplanned power plant outages, a prolonged cold spell, or should the supply of Russian gas to Europe stop.
It is working to secure supplies for the 2022/23 winter and tasked the Swiss gas industry with procuring new sources of gas and terminal capacities, as well as storage capacities abroad.
Switzerland doesn't have an underground gas storage facility, but one of its four regional gas companies, Gaznat, owns a stake in France's Etrez site.
The regional natural gas supply companies -- Gaznat S.A., Erdgas Zentralschweiz AG, Gasverbund Mittelland AG and Erdgas Ostschweiz AG -- transport natural gas to local suppliers and direct customers in their respective regions.

Switzerland is planning new hydropower reserves and back-up power plants after officials warned the country would be without power for nearly two days in a worst-case scenario. 
The government plans to bolster its power network as it moves to more renewable and hydropower while phasing out nuclear energy.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. and European economies are facing a heightened risk of a recession this year as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine severely disrupts supply chains and causes inflation to accelerate to the fastest rate since the 1970s.
Yields on U.S. government debt maturing in two years’ time are trading less than 30 basis points below notes maturing in ten years, the narrowest spread since the pandemic erupted worldwide in early 2020.
Yield-curve flattening has been one of the most reliable indicators of an impending recession in recent decades since it measures the current stance of monetary policy relative to long-term interest rate expectations.
The current spread is in the 77th percentile for all months since the start of 1990, up from 58th percentile at the end of December and the 33rd percentile this time last year, indicating an elevated risk of recession.
In the last three decades, whenever the spread has narrowed this much it has heralded either a significant mid-cycle business slowdown or an end-of-cycle recession (https://tmsnrt.rs/3HFAGIr).
Even before the invasion, prices for energy, raw materials, industrial components, consumer products and freight were rising at the fastest rate since the early 1980s.
But the conflict and sanctions imposed in response by the United States and its allies have now sent prices for oil, gas, coal and other commodities surging even higher.
Severe disruptions have been reported in ocean shipping, international passenger and cargo aviation and the global supply chains for chemicals and automakers, among other sectors.
The result is equivalent to a massive loss of global production capacity, a supply-side shock that is simultaneously intensifying inflation while likely to depress output and employment.
Businesses grappling with sanctions, supply chain problems and the rapidly escalating cost of their inputs are less likely to undertake risky investment expenditures.
Households hit by higher bills for gas, electricity, motor fuels, cars and other durable items will have to trim expenditure on other goods and services.
Recessionary forces are intensifying rapidly across North America and Europe as global supply chains are stretched to breaking point.
POLICY DILEMMA
The U.S. Federal Reserve is impaled on the horns of dilemma, trapped between its dual goals to maximise employment and maintain price stability.
The central bank is simultaneously under pressure to raise interest rates faster to restrain inflation but leave them lower to offset the heightened uncertainty arising from the conflict.
For the time being, senior U.S. policymakers have indicated the need to restrain inflation outweighs other considerations and they plan to start increasing interest rates from this month.
Based on the fed funds futures market, traders expect the central bank to raise interest rates by six quarter-points (or equivalent) by the end of the year to bring inflation under control, though that is down slightly from seven anticipated increases before the invasion.
In the past similar contradictions between policy goals have created conditions for a sharp slowdown in the business cycle or a recession.
Top policymakers and economists like to say that economic expansions do not die of old age, they are murdered. In other words, they do not end naturally and inevitably but when the Fed tightens policy too much.
But that is not quite true. Policymakers do not deliberately “murder” expansions. Engineering a recession is rarely if ever the explicit aim of monetary policy.
Instead, expansions end and recessions arrive when policymakers are forced to sacrifice (temporarily) their long-term goal of supporting growth to some more urgent and pressing goal such as lowering inflation.
In 2022, the poisonous cocktail of supply disruptions, rapidly rising prices, heightened business and household uncertainty and slowing growth in output and employment presents policymakers with precisely this problem.
Recession risks are even greater in Europe because region’s economic integration with Ukraine and Russia and greater exposure to surging international gas prices will magnify the size of the supply shock.
Even before the invasion of Ukraine, the Fed and other central banks were confronted with the tricky task of engineering a soft-landing to control inflation rather than a hard landing that would bring a recession.
The conflict and its massive impact on supply chains has made that task very much harder and increased the probability that the attempt at a soft landing will turn into a hard one.

(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans on Friday said the U.S. central bank is on track to raising rates this year, though it may be ""more than I think is essential"" to do so at every policy-setting meeting.
""By the end of the year when we are closer to neutral we are going to have a better fix on how far we have to go,"" Evans said in a CNBC interview, after a U.S. government report showed employers added more than expected jobs in February.
""I don't think we are going to see nearly as restrictive a setting of monetary policy"" as when the Fed raised rates in the 1990s to as high as 6.5%, he said. But by getting interest rates higher by year's end, he said, ""we've got a lot of optionality"" to do more or less as needed to deal with inflation, now running at three times the Fed's 2% target. 

Friday's labor report showing employers added 678,000 jobs last month is ""good news,"" Evans said. ""It doesn't really change anything that (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell was prepositioning the Fed for the other day.""
Earlier this week Powell told Congress he expected to support a 25-basis point rate hike at the Fed's policysetting meeting in two weeks, with a series of rate hikes to follow in potentially bigger increments if needed.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union officials are examining curbing Russia's influence and access to finance at the International Monetary Fund following its invasion of Ukraine, six officials told Reuters.
This scenario now under discussion would add to the pressure on Russia's economy and financial system and also mark an important symbolic step, deepening Moscow's international isolation.
One option under consideration is to remove Russia entirely from the institution that acts as a lender of last resort, officials said, though some noted that would prove difficult if not impossible. 
""There is a discussion, but kicking Russia out entirely is probably unrealistic because of required quora,"" one senior euro zone official said, referring to the wide support needed among countries that include China. 
Other options being examined include the suspension of Russia's voting rights as well as blocking its access to a special IMF currency, the Special Drawing Rights, the officials said.
A spokesperson for the IMF did not immediately comment.
Russia has been economically isolated after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Moscow calls the assault a ""special operation.""
IMF curbs could be part of another round of sanctions, as the war in Ukraine enters its second week.
Russia has already been hit by a freeze on its central bank assets, a ban from EU, Canadian and U.S. airspace, the removal of a number of its banks from the SWIFT international payments system, and sanctions on a clutch of Russian tycoons.
The United States and the EU are now worried that Moscow, cut off from much of its $630 billion reserves, could have access to $17 billion in IMF reserves it received last year when the IMF boosted them to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
The SDR is an IMF currency based on a basket of dollars, euros, sterling, yen and yuan. To spend the $17 billion in SDRs, Russia would have to find countries willing to exchange them for the underlying currencies, a prospect seen as unlikely.
PRESSURE BUILDING
The officials confirmed that while curbing Russian membership rights in the IMF and blocking its access to the SDRs were discussed, the discussion was even broader, concerning Moscow's membership.
""There is on ongoing discussion to kick Russia out of all international financial institutions,"" a second senior euro zone official said, adding though the discussion on the IMF was chiefly about how to prevent Moscow from using its SDRs.
However, ejecting Russia from the IMF entirely may not be legally possible, another official said.
""The consensus legal reading is that it cannot be done. Even for members guilty of genocide it was not done, because it would require proof of a legal breach of the IMF agreement, so it very unlikely,"" the third official said.
Asked when the talks could come to a conclusion, the first official said the issue was urgent, but some other members of the IMF, which groups 190 countries, may object.
One of the officials said Russia's rights were being examined because of concerns it could use the IMF to avoid sanctions put on the Russian central bank. 
""The United States is also looking into this. But ... China, India and others may be problem,"" the first official said. 
U.S. Republican lawmakers have also urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to block Russia from exchanging the $17 billion in IMF reserves it received last year.

They said $650 billion allocation of Special Drawing Rights to IMF members had undermined previous sanctions on Russia.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Textile and leather goods' makers in Istanbul's garment district are feeling the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine as customers in Moscow and Kyiv have cancelled $200 million in orders in the past week, industry officials say.
The loss of trade adds to strains on Turkey's economy, with officials estimating that more than $1 billion is directly at risk to the textile industry alone if the conflict in Ukraine continues.
Mustafa Senocak, head of the Istanbul Leather and Leather Products Exporters Association, said orders for ""hundreds of thousands of pairs of shoes and thousands of leather jackets"" have been cancelled. 
""Some Russians say they can pay with the former rouble exchange rate. Otherwise they can't make payments,"" he said.
Russia and Ukraine accounted for more than $1 billion in Turkish exports of leather shoes, jackets and finished and unfinished clothing last year, and nearly three times that much in the unofficial ""suitcase trade"" centred in Istanbul, officials say. 
The hit to trade puts further pressure on Turkey's economy after a currency crisis in December and resulting inflationary spiral. Falling export income adds to the Turkish current account deficit, which is swelling following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week due to soaring energy prices and an expected hit to tourism this year. 
After a raft of orders and contracts with Kyiv and Moscow in February, ""we face cancellations... worth around $200 million so far (for the industry),"" said Seref Fayat, head of garment maker TOBB Clothing and Apparel Industry Assembly. ""It could exceed $1 billion if this situation continues."" 
Turkish trade with Belarus, Moldova and Romania has also cooled due to uncertainty, industry heads told Reuters. Some Polish customers asked to suspend orders, while some Russians asked to make payments based on foreign-exchange rates prior to the invasion and the collapse of the rouble. 
Turkey's garments, textile and leather exports totalled $718 million to Russia in 2021 and $308 million to Ukraine, data shows. 
The estimated $3 billion ""suitcase trade"" - in which small merchants from Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet states buy goods in Istanbul, pack them in empty suitcases and resell them back home - has also taken a hit. 
""We had already started manufacturing for the new season - but now we have all stopped,"" said Giyasettin Eyyupkoca, head of the Association of Industrialists and Business People of Laleli, the Istanbul district at the centre of the suitcase trade.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's unorthodox economic plan aims to stabilise the lira currency by balancing the current account deficit. But given the Ukraine conflict, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) revised its forecast for this year's deficit from 1.5% of GDP to 2.5%. 
Russians and Ukrainians drive half of Laleli's annual trade volume, Eyyupkoca said. ""I have had the same Ukrainian trading partner for years and an open account with him. How can I now ask him to pay me money while he is struggling to stay alive?""

Investing.com -- Russian shelling causes a fire at Europe's largest nuclear power plant - but there are no reports of any radiation leakage. The euro and European stock markets slump on the prospect that existing loopholes in sanctions will be closed to strangle Russian commodity exports. Commodity prices, meanwhile, are on course for their biggest weekly gain since the 1960s, led overnight by advances in wheat and nickel. Oh, and the monthly U.S. payrolls report is due and is expected to keep the Federal Reserve on course for a 25 basis point hike in interest rates later this month. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 4th March.
1. Russian forces seize Europe’s largest nuclear power plant
Russian forces secured control of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, outside Zaporizhzhya in eastern Ukraine.  A fire that broke out in a building away from the nuclear reactors was brought under control. There was no damage to the reactors.
Fears of a possible radiation leak – stoked by popular memory of the Chernobyl disaster in northern Ukraine during the late Soviet period – have proved unfounded. The reactors are built completely differently and have been retrofitted with a massive containment vessel that protects it against most plausible scenarios.
Russia’s Ministry of Defense blamed the fire on a squad of Ukrainian provocateurs. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Raphael Grossi, said that the damage had been caused by Russian weaponry. Lithuania’s Prime Minister said Russian shelling of the plant amounted to ‘nuclear terrorism’.
Russia and China had on Thursday voted against an IAEA resolution aiming to guarantee the safety of Ukraine’s nuclear installations.
2. Euro hits 22-month lows as sanctions fears deepen
The euro dipped below $1.10 for the first time since May 2020, as the progress of Russia’s war in Ukraine raised the likelihood of tougher Western sanctions that will hit the Eurozone economy disproportionately hard.
European stock markets also extended their decline, with the Italian FTSE MIB on course for an 11% drop this week and the German DAX on course for a drop of 9.3%.
An aide to French President Emmanuel Macron had briefed reporters on Thursday that people should “fear the worst” after Russia’s Vladimir Putin repeated his determination in a phone call with Macron to pursue the war to its end.
The number of senior European politicians now willing to accept a complete ban on purchases of Russian energy exports – which were originally exempted from last week’s sanctions packages – is rising daily, as the scenes of devastation from Ukraine’s cities multiply.
3. Payrolls seen extending U.S. labor market recovery
The U.S. economy is expected to have added another 400,000 jobs in the month through mid-February, continuing its rapid replacement of the jobs that were lost during the pandemic. The Labor Department releases its monthly report at 8:30 AM ET. 
That would represent a modest slowdown from 478,000 in January, but still an impressive performance given the disruption to retail, travel and hospitality from the wave of Omicron-variant Covid-19.
It would also cement expectations for a 25 basis point hike in the fed funds rate when the Federal Reserve’s policy-making committee meets in two weeks’ time.
The unemployment rate is expected to have fallen to 3.9% from 4.2%, but analysts will also zero in on developments with the labor force participation rate, which is still more than a full percentage point below its pre-pandemic level of 63.4%.
4. Stocks set to open lower
U.S. stocks are set to open lower later, amid the negative news flow out of Ukraine and Russia. The Russian Duma earlier approved a law that would punish the spread of 'misleading' news about the war in Ukraine with up to 15 years in prison.
By 6:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 334 points, or 1.0%, on course for a third weekly loss in four. The S&P 500 futures contract was also down 1.0% while the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 0.9%.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include software company Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), which received a vote of confidence from Helman & Friedland in the form of a 7.5% stake purchase.  Gap (NYSE:GPS) stock and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock are also headed higher in premarket after well-received quarterly updates late on Thursday, while Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock is marked down after warning of container delays, higher labor and freight costs and chip shortages, all of which outweighed the better-than-expected results in its fiscal second quarter.
5. Commodities set for best week since 1960s
Commodities remained on course for their biggest weekly gain since the 1960s, as the prospect of tighter sanctions on Russian exports continued to force buyers to look for substitutes.
By 6:25 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 2.2% at $110.06 a barrel, while Brent was up 2.0% at $112.66 a barrel. While that’s some way below the peaks seen earlier this week, it’s still a weekly gain of over 20%, the kind of increase that has in the past always resulted in demand destruction and an economic slowdown.
Wheat prices also continued to surge, a day after an Estonian cargo ship sank in the Black Sea after hitting a mine. That all but ended the chance of any ship securing insurance for trips into and out of Russian and Ukrainian Black Sea ports. The two countries account for nearly 30% of global wheat exports.
Elsewhere, Nickel Futures hit $29,823 a ton in London, their highest since 2008, on the same fears about the availability of Russian supply.

A “peak-to trough” crash in Russian gross domestic product is now expected at around 11%, “in line with the drop in the 1998 debt crisis,” JPMorgan economists said in a note to clients. Sanctions imposed on the central bank, alongside the cut-off from the SWIFT global messaging system, created obstacles for Russia’s ability to sell oil and gas, according to JPMorgan. 
“Russia’s export earnings will be disrupted, and capital outflows will likely be immediate despite its large current-account surplus,” they said. “Imports and GDP will collapse.”
President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has unleashed uncertainty in global oil markets, with buyers steering clear of doing business with Russia as the U.S and others seek to isolate it from financial markets. Traders are offering Russia’s flagship crude at a record discount in an attempt to attract buyers.
The unprecedented restrictions on the Bank of Russia have meanwhile handcuffed its ability to defend the ruble, which is already down more than 30% against the dollar this year. Instead, policy makers more than doubled the key interest rate to 20% and hardened capital controls.
“Downward pressure on the ruble and capital flight are pushing the Russian central bank to raise rates dramatically and impose capital controls,” JPMorgan’s analysts said. “Sanctions undermine the two pillars promoting stability -- the ‘fortress’ foreign-currency reserves of the central bank and Russia’s current account surplus.”
Oil and gas revenue has been providing a hard-currency lifeline for Russia because the sale and transport of energy largely escaped direct disruptions. Russia was running a monthly current-account surplus of about $20 billion at the start of the year.
The Biden administration is still opposed to banning oil imports from Russia, though its objections are putting it at odds with a bipartisan clamor to punish Moscow for the invasion of Ukraine.
JPMorgan now expects Russia’s economy to shrink 7% this year, down from its previous forecast for a 3.5% decline. It sees a drop of 10% this quarter on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, followed by a plunge of 35% in the following three months. 
 “The sanctions will hit their mark on the Russian economy, which now looks headed for a deep recession,” the analysts said.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's central bank sharply raised interest rates on Friday to staunch growing inflationary pressures and urged the government to consider measures including curbing non-essential imports and raising fuel prices to reduce pressure on the ailing economy.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) raised the standing deposit facility rate and the standing lending facility rate by 100 basis points (bps) each to 6.50% and 7.50%, respectively.
The median estimate in a Reuters poll of 13 economists was for the two rates to be raised by 50 bps each.
""We want to be clear that we want to address inflation as one of the key concerns,"" Ajith Nivard Cabraal, governor of the CBSL, said in his post policy news conference.
""We have had 13 years of single-digit inflation and we want to ensure price stability. We are concerned with the increase but we still feel these are largely supply side driven.""
More rate hikes in coming months now seem inevitable, Capital Economics said in a note to clients, pencilling in another 200 bps of tightening this year.
Retail inflation in February reached 15.1% while food inflation hit 25.7% - the highest in a decade. CBSL targets to hold inflation in a 4-6% range over the medium term.
The CBSL in its statement said economic activity has been affected by recent adverse global developments and surging commodity prices. 
With its foreign exchange reserves dwindling, Sri Lanka has been unable to pay for enough fuel to fire its power plants, and has implemented rolling power cuts.
""These disruptions have to be addressed immediately to ensure the continuation of uninterrupted domestic production and the momentum in exports,"" the central bank said.
GOVT ACTION AWAITED
The central bank made a list of recommendations to the government, including asking it to incentivise remittances and investments further, curb non-urgent imports and raise fuel and electricity tariffs, among other things.
Cabraal said though some measures may seem unpopular, they will help free up resources. 
""There is no issue between me and the finance minister. But at a policy level we have a responsibility to raise certain policy issues and convey things to the government,"" Cabraal said in response to a question regarding a potential rift with the government.
The International Monetary Fund this week said Sri Lanka needs to tighten its monetary policy to contain inflation, put its high debt repayments on track and reverse one of the worst financial crises the country has faced in years.
Cabraal reiterated that the debt repayments have been met in the past and the central bank was committed to honouring all future repayments.

Reserves have plunged 70% since 2020, dwindling to $2.36 billion at the end of January. The island has debt repayments of about $4 billion in the remainder of this year. 
""CBSL should maintain this momentum on tightening monetary policy and allow the currency to float,"" said Udeeshan Jonas, chief strategist at CAL Group.

Investing.com -- The Russian Central Bank said it will cut the surcharge imposed on retail purchases of foreign exchange through brokers to 12% from 30%, fine-tuning the draconian restrictions it has imposed in the last week to defend the ruble.
In a statement, the CBR said the 12% surcharge will also apply to companies transacting through brokerages. 
The central bank had imposed the new regulation on Thursday to stem the flood of demand for foreign currency as the ruble plummeted against the euro and dollar in response to Western sanctions. The ruble has fallen to a succession of all-time lows this week and has now lost nearly half its value against the dollar this year. By mid-morning in Moscow on Friday, the dollar had risen another 3.1% to 109.41, although that is still below Thursday's 24-year high of 118.28.
The central bank has had the majority of its $643 billion of foreign reserves frozen by sanctions imposed by the U.S., EU, U.K., and Japan. That leaves it with relatively little capacity to defend the ruble against the kind of run that has been going on in Russia all week, which has seen long lines at bank branches and ATMs across the country. 
FX brokerages, a common feature of Russian high streets, had initially offered ordinary citizens a way around the 30% surcharge that banks had immediately imposed in an attempt to stem outflows. That loophole is now closed.
Separately, the CBR kept Moscow's stock exchanges shut for a fifth consecutive day on Friday. That triggered an announcement from Nasdaq-listed  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX), Russia's largest Internet services company, that it may default on its dollar debt.",,,,,
418,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 04:31AM ET</span>","The war in Ukraine, and its fallout, remains central for markets.
How much more pain is about to hit Russia's economy? Can oil rise even higher? U.S. inflation data is due on Thursday, the same day the European Central Bank holds a crucial policy meeting. 
Here's your week ahead in markets from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Tommy Wilkes, Julien Ponthus and Dhara Ranasinghe in London.
1/ RUSSIAN PAIN
After a barrage of Western sanctions, Russia's economy will see a sharp economic contraction and spiking inflation. Debt default risks are on the rise. 
Aside from the rouble, which has hit record lows, most Russian markets have been shuttered since the West imposed tougher sanctions after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Foreign investors are scrambling to pull money out of Russia -- if they can. They have found their assets frozen as the sanctions, Russian-imposed restrictions and a lack of liquidity make it impossible to exit. 
It's also been tough to work out the full extent of the damage. Asset managers will be hoping for more clarity on just how little their Russian investments are worth, if anything.
Many will also be bracing for Western sanctions to go even further and target Russia's energy industry. Expect more jaw-dropping moves in the rouble and oil prices if they do.

2/ WHEN'S THE PEAK?
Expect data on Thursday to show U.S. inflation surged again in February, confirming what we all know already: the Federal Reserve will likely hike rates in March.
Economists forecast headline inflation at 7.8% year-on-year, surpassing January's four-decade high 7.5% print. 
War in Ukraine has tempered expectations for aggressive Fed rate hikes but a stronger-than-expected inflation print might rekindle chances of a more hawkish stance. That would hurt risk assets, already rattled by Ukraine-linked uncertainty.
The Fed says it's focused on containing price pressures. Its credibility could be at risk if inflation worsens, eroding household spending power and distorting investment and spending decisions. Friday's University of Michigan consumer sentiment index could provide a sense of how consumers are faring. 
CPI https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egpbkqjakvq/Pasted%20image%201646259171522.png 
3/ ROCK, HARD PLACE, ECB
Before Russia invaded Ukraine, the European Central Bank's March 10 meeting was expected to accelerate its exit from ultra-easy policies. Inflation at a record high 5.8%, more than double its 2% target, strengthens that case.
Here's the problem. The war, by sparking a fresh surge in energy prices, is causing upward pressure on inflation. At the same time it hurts consumption and economic growth.
ECB plans are in turmoil and big decisions on Thursday appear unlikely. President Christine Lagarde may be pressed on whether she expects a rate rise, having last month walked back on a pledge not to lift rates this year. 
That was before war broke out in Europe, leaving the ECB between a rock and hard place. 
Money markets scale back ECB rate hike bets https://graphics.reuters.com/EUROPE-MARKETS/gdpzybkonvw/chart.png 
4/ TRIPLE WHAMMY 
The Russian invasion is a triple whammy for euro zone banks, with no immediate fix on the horizon. Western sanctions on Russia hit banks exposed to that country's companies or hold assets there. It begs the question of whether multinational groups such as Austria's Raiffeisen or France's SocGen will divest, or be stripped of their units in the country, and at what cost? Second, ECB rate-hike expectations -- which banks were benefiting from -- have been revised down sharply. Finally, banking shares are cyclical stocks that investors tend to dump first when the macroeconomic environment sours.
The sector has lost over a quarter of its market value in about three weeks. Even if the coming week brings stability, that is a bitter pill for investors who had bought into what was the consensual buy trade entering 2022. 
Banks https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwvkrlkmrpm/Pasted%20image%201646310865293.png 
5/ IT'S THE ECONOMY, COMRADE And in China, it's the National People's Congress that hogs the headlines. The annual session of China's rubber-stamp parliament runs from Saturday for about a week, setting the main economic and policy goals for the year. The key word is stability. Beijing is keen to put its slowing economy back on track heading into an even more important event later this year -- the twice-a-decade Party Congress at which President Xi Jinping is almost certain to secure an unprecedented third term as leader. That means stepped-up fiscal stimulus, increased tax cuts and continued easy monetary policy, while any plans for painful reforms - such as a long-awaited ""prosperity tax"" – put on the back burner. 

Don't expect any comment on Ukraine either: China has not condemned Russia's attack and says Western sanctions on Russia are unfair.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Indika Prasanna Kumara ventures out every afternoon to try to find 200 litres of diesel for the Broadway Kids apparel factory in Sri Lanka so it can run its generators during power cuts and keep working.
""We have to scout for different fuel stations because of the shortages, then wait in line for eight hours or longer,"" Kumara said as he and two colleagues from the fuel-finding team poured their latest haul into a generator at the factory, which employs 275 workers in the commercial capital of Colombo.
""Once we get the fuel we have to guard the cans because they might be stolen. That is how desperate people are for fuel.""
Sri Lanka is facing its worst financial crisis in a decade with foreign exchange reserves shrinking 70% to $2.36 billion in January. 
The dollar shortage has left the island struggling to pay for imports including food, medicine and fuel. 
A serious shortage of diesel has shut multiple thermal power plants causing rolling power cuts, sometimes lasting more than seven hours a day.
Hit by the regular power outages, Broadway Kids, which produces clothes for British brands including Next, Matalan, Frugi and John Lewis & Partners, is among dozens of apparel factories struggling to meet production targets.
""We operate on very thin margins,"" said Broadway Kids' owner Chula Dharmadasa. ""I'm already getting warnings from clients that if we miss delivery targets we have to air freight goods, which we cannot afford to do."" 
""Our orders will get cancelled and buyers will move to competitors like Bangladesh,"" he said, adding that order losses of one company can impact the entire value chain and potentially lead to job losses.
Garments are Sri Lanka's second largest foreign exchange earner and the sector was just seeing a pandemic recovery with export earnings increasing by 22.1% to $514 million this January, compared with January 2021. 
'CRITICAL'
Overall, the sector has about 300 factories that generated revenues of $5.4 billion in 2021. 
""The situation is now critical as plants are coming to a halt due to lack of diesel for generators, staff transport and goods transport,"" said Yohan Lawrence, secretary general of the Joint Apparel Associations Forum, which represents the largest apparel companies in Sri Lanka. 
The government has given assurances that help is on the way.
Uninterrupted power supply will be restored after March 5, the office of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa said in a statement on Wednesday, but did not provide a plan for how dependable fuel supplies would be secured.
On Thursday, Rajapaksa appointed new ministers for energy and power in a snap cabinet reshuffle. 
The power situation and fuel shortage has forced Broadway Kids to spend 400% more on fuel and generator costs, compared with the same period last year, which has pushed up overheads. 
With fewer operating hours, workers are likely to get paid one third less this month as they don't work over-time, said Broadway Kids' Human Resources Manager Saumya Porage. 
The fuel shortage has also forced the company to suspend free transport to workers. Since many private busses are stuck in fuel queues for hours, some workers opt to walk to work, starting out as early as 6 a.m. 

""I wake up at 4.30 a.m. to cook for my family and leave for work. I take a bus for the first few kilometers and walk the rest of the way,"" R.M. Manike, 43, a machine operator, said of her 6 km hike to work.
""We're scared we'll lose our jobs.""

Western sanctions imposed on Russia in punishment for its invasion of Ukraine have prompted dozens of global companies to pause operations in the country and some, including energy majors BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) have said they will exit the country entirely.

The fast-track banruptcy plan ""will support the employment and social well-being of citizens so that bona fide entrepreneurs can ensure the effective functioning of business"", the government said in a statement on Telegram.
Foreign companies could also simply just stay in Russia, Belousov added.

A fire at a training building near the largest nuclear power plant in Europe during intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces has been extinguished, but markets globally were left on edge on Friday.
Stock markets across Asia were a sea of red, with MSCI's gauge of stocks outside Japan hitting a 16-month low and Japan's Nikkei down 2.2%.
European stock futures are sharply lower and Wall Street, when it opens later, looks set to join the selloff. MSCI's global equity benchmark is on track for a fourth straight week of losses. 
Also, watch the euro, which has been dealt another blow by latest developments in Ukraine. 
The single currency has shed almost half a percent and hit its lowest since May 2020 at $1.1010. It has lost over 2% this week and is set for its worst week since April 2020.
For some, a move to parity -- a word not used for some time -- versus the dollar, could be on the cards. As currency weakness adds the inflation headache, it may be time to watch how the European Central Bank responds to currency weakness.
Note some economists reckon headline inflation in the euro area could top 6% this year. The ECB's target is 2%.
U.S. payrolls data -- usually the top focus for markets -- almost appears to have faded to the background with markets gripped by the war in Ukraine.
Economists polled by Reuters forecast the U.S. economy created 400,000 jobs last month, after a 467,000 gain in January. That would leave employment 2.5 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level.
All the lost jobs are expected to be recouped this year, but the war in Ukraine could hurt business confidence and slow job growth in the months ahead. 
The Federal Reserve, which looks set to start its rates lift off later in March, will be watching the labour market closely.

422,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 01:20AM ET</span>",,,,,,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's next central bank governor should be someone who understands the need to work with the government in beating deflation, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Friday.
Markets are looking ahead to a change of leadership due next year at the Bank of Japan (BOJ), eyeing possible changes to its massive asset-buying and yield curve control measures which have failed to fire up inflation to its 2% target and drawn criticism for hurting financial institutions' profits.
Kishida will have the power to choose a successor to current BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, whose term ends in April 2023, if his ruling party secures victory in upper house elections expected this summer.
Kishida's administration and the BOJ last November reaffirmed commitments made in a 2013 joint statement for the two sides to cooperate on economic policy, and for the central bank to strive toward meeting its 2% price goal.
""The government and the BOJ have agreed to work together towards beating deflation,"" Kishida told parliament on Friday, referring to the reaffirmed joint statement.
""We hope the BOJ continues to strive toward achieving its 2% inflation target with an eye on economic, price and financial developments,"" he said. ""The next BOJ governor ought to be someone who understands this.""
The choice of governor to succeed Kuroda, who is serving a rare second five-year term, will be key to how quickly the bank could dial back the radical monetary experiment undertaken by Kuroda.
Some analysts say Kishida will likely distance himself from his predecessor Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies that relied heavily on monetary easing to reflate the economy.
Kishida's administration on Tuesday announced nominees to replace two BOJ policymakers retiring in July, appointments that will likely tilt the board away from radical easing.

Incumbent deputy governor Masayoshi Amamiya and former deputy governor Hiroshi Nakaso - both career central bankers - are seen by markets as among strong candidates as next BOJ head.

By Eduardo Baptista and Clare Jim
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's so-called ""common prosperity"" push in the near-term will not only aim to bridge the widening wealth gap but is also set to shape the country's regulatory approach, with sectors seen crucial for the economy getting more state support.
As part of that move, analysts expect the embattled property sector, accounting for a quarter of the economy, to get more regulatory support, while internet firms will remain a crackdown target due to what Beijing says is disorderly capital expansion.
Global investors who were burned by numerous crackdowns last year will be looking for signs of clear regulatory divergence at China's rubber-stamp parliament annual meeting starting on Saturday, when policymakers are expected to unveil more stimulus to ease slowing economic growth.
Thousands of delegates from across China will gather in the capital, Beijing, for the meeting that will discuss economic and social policies.
Last month, the Chinese technology sector was hit by fears of a fresh wave of regulatory clampdowns after the last couple of years' unprecedented changes stemming from antitrust violations and data security concerns, among other issues.
The mammoth property sector, on the other hand, has seen easing of some rules since the beginning of this year, paving the way for debt-laden developers to find their feet after having come close to the brink of collapse.
The move underscores Beijing's focus on halting the growth slowdown as war in Ukraine adds fresh uncertainty in a year when President Xi Jinping is almost certain to secure a precedent-breaking third term as leader.
""If you were only to look at the regulatory developments ... you would certainly be of the view that the Chinese government is really reining down on tech and they have relaxed their approach towards the property sector,"" said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, director of the Economist Intelligence Corporate Network.
""The property sector is seen as a key driver for economic growth, because it leads to investment, it leads to purchase of houses, it leads to property development, but it also carries a lot of demand for other sectors like commodities,"" he said.
China last year launched a multi-pronged regulatory and unprecedented crackdown on a broad range of industries, leaving startups and decades-old firms alike operating in a new, uncertain environment as part of Xi's ""common prosperity"" drive.
Both technology and property sectors saw a plunge in their revenues and massive sell-off in their stocks and bonds, as new rules curbing their businesses were framed, hefty penalties for violations imposed, and new capital raising plans thwarted.
SYSTEMIC RISK
Since the end of last year, however, Beijing has taken a number of initiatives to help revive the cooling property sector, which included making it easier for large and state-owned developers to raise fund, easing the escrow accounts for pre-sale funds and allowing some local governments to lower mortgage rates and down-payment ratios. 
The regulatory respite being given to the property sector was likely driven by regulators' concerns about the knock-on effects of the common prosperity measures on the broader economy, according to Montufar-Helu.
In comparison, the technology sector was hit with a spate of tighter regulations, affecting everything from overseas listings to outright bans on industries such as after-school private tutoring, along with a constant stream of fines. 
Companies most often on the receiving end have included tech giants like Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group.
""Technology and education are under the umbrella of 'common prosperity', but real estate is a different issue, because it involves systemic risk,"" said Gavekal Dragonomics' China investment analyst Rosealea Yao.
The central government's goal for the property sector is clear, Yao said, which is to ensure it manages to emerge from a deep liquidity crisis, so more easing measures will have to be rolled out.
The Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index has eased 0.2% this year versus a 6% drop in the Hang Seng Index, as some investors bought property shares on low valuations and stimulus expectations.
In comparison, the main Chinese tech share index, the Hang Seng Tech Index has fallen 12.1% so far this year.
Louis Lau, a. U.S.-based fund manager at Brandes Investment Partners LP, said he was surprised that regulators were still tightening the screws on the tech sector, dashing hopes for a period of recovery.

""People don't know when it's going to end, it's taken longer than expected,"" said Lau, adding that he expected the crackdown to last until the second half of this year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy expanded more than initially expected in the final quarter of 2021, but rising input prices likely kept wholesale inflation near a record in February in a sign of rising risks to the fragile recovery, a Reuters poll showed.
Revised gross domestic product (GDP) data will likely show the world's third-largest economy increased at an annualised 5.6% in October to December of last year, slightly higher than a preliminary reading of 5.4% growth, according to the poll of 17 economists.
The poll showed the upgrade is largely because of an expected 0.7% increase in capital expenditures, larger than the preliminary 0.4% rise, reflecting the robust fourth-quarter business spending data in a Ministry of Finance survey this week.
Yet the strong growth figure does not suggest Japan's full recovery from the blows of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to analysts.
""Even after the upward revision, the size of GDP will remain below that of pre-pandemic levels in October-December 2019,"" said Shinichiro Kobayashi, principal economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting.
With COVID curbs hammering consumption and the Ukraine crisis clouding the outlook, many analysts expect Japan's economic growth to slow or even contract in the current quarter.
The immediate hit from the war in Ukraine will likely come through a spike in fuel and commodity prices, analysts say.
Wholesale prices likely rose 8.7% in February from a year earlier, the poll showed, hovering near a record reached in November on gains in raw material and energy costs.
Separate data will show household spending likely rose 3.6% in January from a year earlier, marking the first increase in six months, the poll showed.

The government will release the revised fourth-quarter GDP data at 8:50 a.m. on March 9 (2350 GMT, March 8) and household spending data at 8:30 a.m. on March 11 (2330 GMT, March 10).
The Bank of Japan will release the wholesale inflation data at 8:50 a.m. on March 10 (2350 GMT, March 9).

Ukraine's government could receive the funds almost immediately after the board approves the loan, which may be delayed until Monday, one of the sources told Reuters.
The disbursement, arranged with unusual speed for the development lender, would provide Ukraine with desperately needed cash to bolster its defense against a Russian invasion that has killed thousands and unleashed bombardments of urban centers and Europe's largest nuclear power plant.

(Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine adds uncertainty to the U.S. economic outlook and may boost near-term inflation, but household savings and strong economic growth should help limit the damage, New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said on Thursday.
Higher oil prices stemming from the crisis may act like a ""tax"" on American consumers that limits spending, but savings accumulated during the pandemic may help offset higher costs, Williams said. 
""The economy is coming into this with a lot of forward momentum,"" Williams said during a virtual event organized by the Council for Economic Education. ""It's definitely not a stagflation issue."" 
Fed officials say they plan to start raising interest rates when they meet on March 15-16, a key step in their efforts to battle inflation at 40-year highs. 
Williams said he expects inflation to come down later this year, but remain ""well above"" the central bank's 2% target. Inflation should moderate as the Fed raises interest rates, fiscal policy fades, and supply shortages are resolved. 

But he stressed the Fed's ability to respond if inflation remains higher than expected at the end of this year and beyond.
""We have the ability to adjust interest rates higher if inflation ends up being much more persistent or staying much higher than we expect or want,"" Williams said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's consumer inflation hovered near a decade high in February and stood above the central bank's 2% target for an 11th month, adding pressure on policymakers to raise interest rates amid surging oil prices due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis.
The consumer price index (CPI) for February rose 3.7% from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, exceeding a 3.5% gain tipped in a Reuters survey and a notch below the decade high of 3.8% marked in November. It rose 3.6% in January.
The breakdown of data showed the cost of petroleum surged 19.4%, while that of housing rentals and outdoor dining increased 2.1% and 6.2%, respectively, year on year.
""Price instability will likely continue on persistent rise in energy prices and industrial goods,"" said Park Sang-hyun, an economist at Hi Investment & Securities.
""Future development of the Ukraine crisis and its impact on oil prices will play a major role in inflation,"" he said.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, jumped 2.9% from a year earlier, the fastest since June 2009, in a sign that surging prices of fuel and other raw materials have fed through to higher costs for goods and services.
That puts the Bank of Korea's (BOK) monetary policy board under pressure to raise the base rate further in coming months, following the back-to-back rate hikes in November and January. The BOK held the base rate at 1.25% at its February meeting.
In late February, the BOK also sharply increased its inflation forecast for this year to 3.1% from 2.0%. It sees next year inflation at 2.0%.

Separately on Friday, Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said the country will extend the 20% tax cut in oil products by three months to minimise the impact of surging energy prices, pushed up by the Russia-Ukraine crisis.
""Korea's government reduced the fuel tax last year to ease price pressure, however, its impact was offset by a faster increase in oil prices. CPI would have been much higher in the absence of price controls, in our view,"" Park Chong-hoon, economist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank Korea, said.

That number could rise. Data from research firm Morningstar, meanwhile, shows exposure from international funds to the tune of $60 billion in stocks and bonds.
Here is a breakdown of what we know so far as Western sanctions grip Russia's economy in response to its invasion of Ukraine.: 
STOCKS AND BONDS - ESTIMATED $60 BLN FROM MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETF 
Overseas investors in Russia have tens of billions invested in the country's stocks and bonds, according to Morningstar data. U.S. asset managers like Capital Group, Black rock and Vanguard disclosed large exposures, according to the most recent portfolio information available to the research firm.
Disclosures cover a period starting September 2021 through to Feb. 25 this year. They total over $60 billion when considering the top 100 open-end funds and exchange-traded funds worldwide in terms of estimated U.S. dollar exposure to Russian securities, according to Morningstar data.
Of these, some of the biggest were Capital Group Companies Inc, one of the world's largest investment management companies, Vanguard and PIMCO and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).
DEBT SECURITIES - $79 BLN 
JPM analysts said in a research note that foreigners own around $79 billion of Russia's debt securities, including local currency Offs, sovereign hard currency euro bonds and corporate hard currency eurobonds. 
BANKS - AROUND $78 BLN EXPOSURE DISCLOSED 
Bank of International Settlements data https://stats.bis.org/statx/srs/table/B4?c=RU&p= show that foreign banks have exposure to the tune of $120 billion to Russia. In Europe, Italian and French banks have the largest Russian exposure, representing just over $25 billion each at the end of September, the data says. The exposure of U.S. banks totals $14.7 billion, according to BIS data.
Of those that have announced exposure: 
Raiffeisen Bank International RBIV.VI overall Russian exposure totalled 22.85 billion euros ($25 billion), more than half relating to the corporate private sector, it said in its 2021 results presentation.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), which controls Russian bank Rosbank, had 18.6 billion euros ($20.5 billion) of overall exposure to Russia at the end of last year - or 1.7% of the group total.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) UniCredit's overall exposure to Russia totalled 14.2 billion euros ($15.7 billion) as of mid-2021. That includes 8 billion euros in loans extended by its Russian arm.
Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) ISP.MI Italy's biggest bank, loan exposure to Russia was 5.57 billion euros ($6 billion) at the end of 2021, or 1.1% of the total.
Of the U.S. banks, Citi announced total exposure of nearly $10 billion.
As a comparison,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) GS.N reported in a filing last month $293 million in net exposure to Russia, as well as a total of $414 million of market exposure as of December 2021.
EXXON MOBIL - $4 BLN EXPOSURE 
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) on Tuesday said it would exit Russia oil and gas operations that it has valued at more than $4 billion and halt new investment as a result of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
BP (NYSE:BP) - $25 BLN EXPOSURE
BP announced it was abandoning its stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft. Rosneft accounts for around half of BP's oil and gas reserves and a third of its production and divesting the 19.75% stake will result in charges of up to $25 billion, the British company said.
SHELL - $3 BLN EXPOSURE
Shell (LON:RDSa) will exit all its Russian operations. Shell said the decision to exit Russian joint ventures will lead to impairments. Shell had around $3 billion in non-current assets in these ventures in Russia at the end of 2021, it said.
NORWAY'S SWF - $3 BLN EXPOSURE 
Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, has written off the value off the roughly $3 billion in assets it held in Russia. The fund held investments in Russia worth some 27 billion crowns ($3.0 billion) at the end of 2021, equivalent to 0.2% of its total value, but now likely worth 2.5 billion crowns. The fund's Russian assets consisted of shares in 51 companies at the end of 2021. The most valuable stakes were in gas producer Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), bank Sberbank and oil firm Lukoil, which together accounted for two-thirds of the total. 
""They are pretty much written off,"" CEO Nicolai Tangen later told Reuters on Thursday, after Norway's government told the fund to sell the assets.
CALSTRS - $171.5 MLN
The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), the second-largest U.S. pension fund, said on Wednesday the value of its holding in Russia as of the end of February was $171.5 million.

CALPERS - $900 MLN 
CalPERS, which manages the largest U.S. public pension fund, said late on Thursday that the fund had around $900 million of exposure to Russia, but no Russian debt.

Investing.com – A goldilocks jobs report will be needed to fight off stagflation fears, and keep the Federal Reserve on a cautious rate hike path at a time when the Russia-Ukraine conflict has pushed inflation expectations to record levels.
The Labor Department will release its jobs report for February on Friday, with economists estimating that about 400,000 jobs were created last month, with the unemployment rate expected to creep below 4%.
The monthly jobs report will arrive at a crucial time. Bets on aggressive Fed rate hikes are on the decline. But the prospect of red-hot inflation running even hotter – in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict that has boosted the price of oil, wheat and precious metals – just as economic growth is expected to slow has many on the lookout for stagflation.
The five-year breakeven rate on Treasury inflation protected securities – a closely watched gauge of inflation expectations -- jumped to 3.23%, a record high.
The jobs report will need to strike the right balance between optimism and pessimism to avoid tipping the scale.
“This jobs number tomorrow will have to be a pitch perfect,” John Luke Tyner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said in an interview with Investing.com on Thursday. ""If it’s too hot -- 600,000 to 700,000 jobs created, and the unemployment rate falling to 3.7% –  then the market is going to take Powell's words that a 50 bps is on the table at later meetings and then maybe even price in 100 bps by July.""
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this week that he would back a 25-basis points rate hike at the March meeting, but said that increased rate hikes were on the table at subsequent meetings if inflation doesn’t subside as expected.
“I could see us in a position where the market then starts to revert back to the pricing of those six or seven hikes this year that were taken away by the Russia-Ukraine conflict,” Tyner added.
The market-implied expectations for Fed rate hikes for 2022 dropped 112 basis points, down from as much as 162 basis points last month, Bloomberg reported.
Weak jobs data that meaningfully undershoot expectations will flag economic growth concerns and add “to the stagflation fears that I think spooks the market,” the portfolio manager said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Thursday unveiled a $32.5 billion emergency plan to help Ukraine respond to Russia's military invasion and provide more money to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, sparking a new partisan battle in Congress amid a March 11 deadline for settling budget matters.
There appeared to be strong, bipartisan support in the Democratic-controlled Congress for $10 billion in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine following the Feb. 24 launch of Russia's invasion into its territory.
But some Republicans and a couple of centrist Democrats questioned the $22.5 billion in additional coronavirus pandemic aid on the heels of last year's $1.9 trillion ""American Rescue Plan"" that passed with only Democratic support.
The White House and congressional Democrats want to bundle the Ukraine and COVID-19 emergency funds with a much larger third package of around $1.5 trillion to keep regular government operations running beyond March 11, when stopgap funds expire.
Without action by Congress, many federal agencies would have to pare or shut down operations at the end of next week.
Republicans argued some of the American Rescue Plan money is unspent and should be used before a new tranche is considered.
""We shouldn't give money where it's not needed, because we're borrowing it,"" Senator Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, told Reuters.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), however, signaled support for COVID-19 funding, saying ""multiple crises are hitting at the same time.""
Some lawmakers fretted that the budget dispute, if unresolved, could have far-reaching fallout - showcasing political divisions in the United States that could hearten Russian President Vladimir Putin, delaying military aid to Ukraine and flirting with a U.S. government shutdown.
Democratic Senator Dick Durbin downplayed such concerns, saying coupling the Ukraine money with other spending could speed budget negotiations.
""I think it could be a spark to get it (Ukraine money) moving quickly,"" Durbin told reporters.
A House Democratic aide said closed-door negotiations on the entire appropriations package were making progress, although disagreements still had to be ironed out. Negotiators hoped to unveil a massive bill in coming days so it can quickly move through the House and Senate and be sent to President Joe Biden for signing into law by the March 11 deadline.
The White House and congressional Democrats argued that funding of key portions of the American Rescue Plan was nearly exhausted for facilitating the manufacture and shipping of more vaccines and COVID-19 tests needed to battle future spikes in the deadly disease.
""We are therefore urging Congress to promptly provide $22.5 billion to cover immediate needs for tests, treatments and vaccines, investments in research and development of next-generation vaccines, and responding globally, including getting more shots in arms around the world,"" Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Shalanda Young said in a statement.

More than 90% of American Rescue Plan funds have been committed, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Additional COVID-19 resources would allow the government to secure treatments, vaccines and tests for the coming months and fight future variants, Young said. The money would also ensure the continuation of free community testing, treatment and vaccination coverage for uninsured individuals.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is studying whether waiving biofuel blending mandates could help offset a surge in prices for key food ingredients like corn and soy oil following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The nation's biofuel policy, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), requires U.S. oil refiners to blend billions of gallons of corn-based ethanol, soy-based diesel, and other biofuels into fuel each year or purchase credits from those that do, a law intended to help farmers and ease energy imports.
But prices of corn, soy and wheat have jumped sharply since the invasion of Ukraine, a major grains producer, raising worries at the White House about consumer food inflation.
Corn and soy are common food ingredients and also widely used as feed for livestock.
The sources said the administration was looking at whether waiving the RFS requirements could help fend off food inflation by making more corn and soy available for food and meat production. There was no indication, however, that the White House was close to a decision.
Asked for comment, an administration official told Reuters that ""there is no serious consideration of this by the White House right now.""
Consumer inflation, including for food and energy, has become a major political vulnerability for the White House leading into the mid-term elections.
Chicago Board of Trade wheat futures prices have surged 26% to a 14-year high since the invasion of Ukraine and corn futures are at a decade high. Russia and Ukraine combined account for about 29% of global wheat exports and 19% of corn exports. 
Oil prices have also spiked, vaulting above $100 a barrel to levels not seen since 2014. Russia is a major oil producer and traders have shunned its energy shipments since the invasion, mainly over concerns about sanctions.

To counter price rises, the White House has orchestrated two releases of crude oil from strategic stockpiles alongside international partners since late last year. It has also publicly slammed big food companies for price hikes.
The RFS has been a lightning rod of contention between the agriculture and oil industries. Farmers and biofuel producers support the policy because it provides them a lucrative and stable market, while oil refiners say it imposes heavy costs on the industry.

The meeting occurred when Khan went to the Democratic Caucus lunch on Thursday, an FTC spokeswoman said.
The Biden administration, headed into midterm elections in November with narrow holds on the Senate and the House of Representatives, was concerned about inflation even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushed oil prices up sharply. 

""More people are being forced to pay more as mega-corporations make a killing—A twisted thing to see as we recover from COVID,"" Schumer said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""We are working to bring down costs NOW.""

PARIS (Reuters) - All the main candidates are now on the starting line for France's April presidential election, after Emmanuel Macron confirmed on Thursday that he was running for a second term.
* WHO WILL WIN?
Macron is the favourite in opinion polls. But the projected margin is narrower than when he was elected in 2017 and he is facing stiff competition from the right.
Even if he succeeds, Macron will need his centrist La Republique en Marche (LaRem) party - which has failed in all recent local elections - and its allies to win a parliamentary election in June if he is to have a strong platform to implement his policies. 
* WHAT TO WATCH FOR: 
- The race between Valerie Pecresse of the conservative Les Republicains and the far-right's Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour to be Macron's challenger in the likely second-round run-off.
- Will Macron trip up and lose his lead? In 2017, the early favourites lost the election to then-outsider Macron.
- Voter uncertainty. Opinion polls show many are unsure who they will vote for, and turnout could be lower than usual, adding more uncertainty.
* WHAT WILL THE ELECTION BE FOUGHT OVER?
- The election campaign starts amid a war in Ukraine. Polls show that could impact the vote's outcome, with initial surveys indicating a boost for Macron.
- Immigration and security issues had long been at the forefront of the political debate, but opinion polls show purchasing power as one of voters' top concerns. 
- Economic recovery, and whether it holds. Opinion polls show voters are unhappy with Macron's economic policy, but unemployment is at its lowest in years and those surveyed don't think any of his opponents would do better. 
* WHY DOES IT MATTER?
- Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent shockwaves through Europe and beyond. The winner of France's election will have to deal with the fallout.
- Now that Britain has left the European Union, France is the bloc's main military power. It's also the undisputed second biggest economy in the EU, and Angela Merkel's exit as German chancellor has given Macron a more prominent role in Europe.
- The next president will face soaring public deficits to tackle the impact of the pandemic, a pension system many say needs reforming, and moves to re-industrialise France.
* KEY DATES 
April 10 - Presidential election first round
April 24 - Second round held between the top two candidates if none wins a simple majority of votes cast in the first round.

May 13 - The latest day the new president takes office. 
June 12 and 19 - Parliamentary election.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada has ""considerable space"" left to raise interest rates this year, Governor Tiff Macklem said on Thursday, and did not rule out a rare 50-basis-point move if needed to rein in hot inflation.
The central bank, increasingly concerned about spiking prices, hiked rates for the first time in more than three years on Wednesday and said it was prepared to act aggressively if need be to keep inflation expectations grounded.
""There is certainly considerable space to raise interest rates over the course of the year,"" Macklem said in a question and answer session after a speech to a business audience. 
""If we have to move more quickly, we are prepared to do that,"" he added. ""I am not going to rule out a 50-basis-point move in the future.""
He did not elaborate when asked what conditions would merit such a hike.
The Bank of Canada last hiked by 50 basis points in May 2000. Inflation in Canada hit a 30-year high of 5.1% in January and price pressures are broadening, making buying necessities like gas and groceries more expensive.
Earlier, Macklem told the CFA Society of Toronto the bank would act ""with determination"" to rein in soaring prices, saying a failure to act decisively would make it much more painful to bring inflation back to target.
Even with food and gas prices rising quickly, inflation expectations remain well-anchored, Macklem said. 
""Canadians can expect us to use our tools with determination to keep them that way,"" he said. ""The lesson from history is that if inflation expectations become unmoored, it becomes much more costly to get inflation back to target.""
The central bank made clear interest rates remained its primary monetary policy tool, to be complimented by its first-ever quantitative tightening program, a reference to the process of allowing the government bonds purchased during the pandemic to roll off its balance sheet. 
Macklem said the central bank did not intend to actively sell bonds, nor did he give a timeframe for starting QT, saying only that it ""would be a natural next step"" following Wednesday's rate increase.
In the current reinvestment phase, the Bank of Canada buys roughly C$1 billion ($789 million) worth of government bonds each week to keep the size of its balance sheet constant.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.4% lower at 1.2675 to the greenback, or 78.90 U.S. cents.

On Wednesday, the central bank raised its policy rate to 0.5% from a record low 0.25%, its first increase since October 2018.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - With surging oil prices, concerns about the hawkishness of the Federal Reserve and fears of Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, the mood on Wall Street feels like a return to the 1970s. Other than bell-bottoms, the only thing missing so far is stagflation, which occurs when an economy experiences rising inflation and slowing growth at the same time. 
Yet some investors now think that it is not far off.
They are recalibrating their portfolios for an expected period of high inflation and weaker growth. 
Sanctions on top commodity exporter Russia have helped lift the price of Brent crude by some 80% in the last year to around $116 a barrel, stoking concerns that higher energy costs will continue pushing up consumer prices while pressuring global growth.
At the same time, market volatility stemming from geopolitical strife has made investors less certain over how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be in tightening monetary policy to tame soaring inflation. Investors now expect the Fed to take rates from zero to 1.5% by February 2023, compared with 1.75% or higher just a few weeks ago. [FEDWATCH] 
The percentage of fund managers who believe stagflation will set in within the next 12 months stood at 30%, compared with 22% last month, a survey from BoFA Global Research showed. 
""Our base case is still not 1970s stagflation, but we're getting closer to that ZIP code,"" said Anders Persson, chief investment officer of global fixed income at Nuveen. 
The threat of stagflation is especially worrisome to investors because it cuts across asset classes, leaving few places to hide. A diversified portfolio of global equities, bonds and real estate could end up losing 13% in the event that rising oil prices cause stagflation, according to a stress test model by MSCI’s Risk Management Solutions research team. 
The last major stagflationary period began in the late 1960s. Spiking oil prices, rising unemployment and loose monetary policy pushed the core consumer price index up to a high of 13.5% in 1980, prompting the Fed to raise interest rates to nearly 20% that year.
The S&P 500 fell a median of 2.1% during quarters marked by stagflation over the last 60 years, while rising a median 2.5% during all other quarters, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
With bond prices hit by recent market volatility, Persson is looking for opportunities to position in high-yield debt, which he believes may be a good hedge against future stagflation-fueled declines. 
Worries that stagflation may hit Europe harder due to its heavier reliance on energy imports will likely cause some investors to edge away from the region’s assets, said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute. Moving out of U.S. assets and into European ones became a popular trade near the end of 2021, as U.S. stocks rose to comparatively high valuations. 
OPPORTUNITY IN COMMODITIES 
Stagflation in Europe would likely resemble the long period of low growth and high inflation the United States experienced in the 1970s, Christopher said. 
""In Europe, if energy prices go too high then factories will have to shut down,"" he said. 
Nuveen's Persson estimates that a Brent crude price of $120 per barrel will sap 2 percentage points from the economy of the EU. Rising oil prices will likely shave 1 percentage point from the U.S. economy, due in part to the country's greater domestic supply and lower taxes. 
U.S.-focused equity funds have gained $44.5 billion in inflows since the start of February, while world stock funds have pulled in, losing $2 billion in outflows, according to ICI data. 
Funds focused on commodities have notched $7.7 billion in inflows since the start of the year, including the largest one-week net gain since August 2020, ICI data showed. 
Those inflows have come amid sharp price gains in raw materials that have benefited assets linked to commodity exporters such as Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia.
""We see a long wave of opportunity in commodities that we haven't seen in a long time,"" said Cliff Corso, chief investment officer at Advisor Asset Management. 
His fund has been building positions in commodities and emerging market equities from oil-rich countries such as Mexico as a hedge against the potential of higher inflation or stagflation. 

A robust job market and domestic sources of energy should leave U.S. equities, especially dividend-paying companies, more attractive than other global assets even in the face of rising inflation, said Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist at Ally. 
""The consumer remains healthy and has been able to absorb higher inflation thus far,"" she said.

""Simply put, this means that Russia and Belarus will no longer receive the benefits, particularly low tariffs that Canada offers to other countries that are fellow members of the WTO,"" Freeland told reporters at a news conference.
Canada had about C$1.2 billion ($948 million) in imports from Russia and about C$23 million from Belarus in 2020, according to Statistics Canada.
The most favored nation principle is a part of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) rules, and it prevents WTO members from favoring any one country with benefits like lower tariffs without giving all members the same standard.
Moscow unleashed an all-out invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 that has prompted Canada, the European Union, United States and others to respond with strict financial sanctions on Russia. Sanctions have also been levied on Belarus, which has been used as a key staging point for the invasion.
Canada has closed airspace and ports to Russian vessels, sent lethal military aid to Ukraine, curbed oil imports, and asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) to probe alleged war crimes by Russian forces.
""The G7 has already imposed the strongest sanctions ever inflicted on a major economy on Russia, and more will follow in the days to come,"" Freeland said.
Defense Minister Anita Anand, speaking at the same news conference, said Canada intends to supply more lethal aid to Ukraine, including up to 4,500 M72 rocket launchers and up to 7,500 hand grenades from the Canadian Armed Forces' existing stockpiles.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada, along with close partners, was calling for the suspension of Russia from the global police agency Interpol. 
""We're supporting this because we believe that international law enforcement cooperation depends on a collective commitment to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and mutual respect between Interpol members,"" he said at a separate event.
Thousands are reported to have died or been injured and more than a million people have fled Ukraine amid the biggest attack on a European state since 1945.
Canada also announced it would create two separate immigration streams for Ukrainians, one that allows for a temporary stay and one that is permanent.

""Canada is ready to welcome Ukrainians fleeing (Russian President) Vladimir Putin's war, and there is no limit to the number of applications that we are going to be willing to accept,"" Canada's Immigration Minister Sean Fraser said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia's war in Ukraine could hit the U.S. economy across a variety of channels from higher prices to dampened spending and investment, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday, though it is unclear what the ultimate impact will be. 
""What we know so far is that commodity prices have moved up significantly, energy prices in particular. That is going to work its way through our U.S. economy,"" in the form of higher inflation at least in the short term, Powell told the Senate Banking Committee. ""In addition we could see risk sentiment decline so you could see lower investment. You could see people hold back on spending. It is hard to see what the effect on both supply and demand will be.""
Powell repeated his prepared remarks from Wednesday to a House of Representatives committee whose members also focused on the Russian invasion of neighboring Ukraine.
The conflict has triggered broad financial and other sanctions against Russia.
Powell said that the Fed was watching the situation carefully and had begun running simulations, for example, on what persistent increases in oil prices might have on the economy.
Under rough rules of thumb that Powell provided, the jump in oil from around $75 a barrel in late December to around $110 on Thursday, if it lasts, could add nearly 0.9 percentage point to headline inflation and cut nearly half a percentage point from economic growth -- bad dynamics as the central bank tries to navigate inflation lower without hurting employment. 
But Powell said that so far the war has not changed the central bank's plans to raise interest rates beginning at its March meeting to try to bring down the pace of price increases that are currently running at three times the Fed's 2% annual target.
""It is appropriate for us to continue along the lines that we had in mind before the Ukraine invasion happened,"" Powell said. The Fed chair repeated his comments from Wednesday that he would back an initial quarter percentage point increase in the Fed's benchmark rate at the March 15-16 meeting.
But if inflation does not ease, Powell said, ""then we are prepared to raise by more than that amount in a meeting or meetings.""
Lawmakers however honed in on the new situation the Fed now faces, and the possibility that the central bank could be facing a more difficult scenario in which inflation is driven higher by the war while growth slows.

""I am a little bit worried that this war has changed the risk profile,"" said Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania.
""Both on the supply and demand side there is a lot of uncertainty,"" Powell said, but also noted that the ""strong financial shape"" of households and businesses may help sustain spending.

(Reuters) - Companies returned to Europe's corporate bond market to issue debt on Thursday after it remained frozen for a week following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
U.S. medical device company Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) American launched three, six, nine and 12-year bonds for a total of 3 billion euros to buy back U.S. dollar bonds. Bazalgette Finance, a special purpose financing vehicle backing the Thames Tideway Tunnel, launched a 300 million pound, 12-year green bond, according to Refinitiv's IFR. Both marked the first deals in the market since last Wednesday.
Marco Stoeckle, head of corporate credit research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), noted that the first issuers came from safer sectors, as would be expected after the market effectively froze.
""It's really hard to say this is the beginning of a longer-term trend because (issuance) could dissipate within minutes if we see the wrong headlines."" 
Reverse Yankees - U.S. companies like Boston Scientific issuing bonds in European markets - also offer investors a higher yield as they are not eligible for European Central Bank bond purchases, while green bonds tend to attract additional demand from ESG-focused investors chasing a limited pool of assets. 
European investment-grade corporate bond yields rose 50 basis points in February, with the market underperforming the U.S. one and suffering its worst monthly loss since March 2020, according to BofA indexes. The ECB's hawkish turn and then the invasion made yields, that move inversely to bond prices, more than double this year. 
STOP-AND-GO
This week's reopening pales compared to around $30 billion investment-grade companies in the United States raised on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to IFR.
European issuance had already slowed prior to the invasion and is expected to remain stop-and-go depending on daily market conditions. 
Issuers are still coming to terms with the rise in borrowing costs, according to a senior banker who arranges debt sales for European companies. 
""Some issuers are ready to go, some are struggling to get their heads around it and the pipeline will change,"" the banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said. 
Bankers told Reuters some companies have delayed planned debt sales to later this month or even May, some have dropped out as they no longer see market conditions as attractive for opportunistic deals. Others may have sought alternative financing, for example private debt, the bankers said. 
""Most of our issuers are quite liquid and have robust cash balances so aren't in an immediate need to rush to markets and pay large concessions,"" another corporate debt banker said.

Before the invasion many analysts were expecting more corporate bond offers this year to fund mergers and acquisitions as well as capital investments. Bankers say now issuance may fall short of those expectations given the prevailing uncertainty. 
""The financing will get done if it needs to get done but the opportunistic elements of it will be harder sell right now,"" the first banker said.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department has reached out to cryptocurrency companies about their cybersecurity controls amid concerns that Russia could wage retaliatory cyber attacks in response to Western sanctions, according to a person familiar with the situation. 
The United States and its allies have unleashed a slew of sanctions targeting Russia's banks, state-owned entities, and elites, among others, following the country's invasion of Ukraine
Governments have warned for weeks that Russia or its allies could carry out cyber attacks in retribution for sanctions, leading banks to increase monitoring, scenario-planning and line up extra staff in case hostile activity surges.
In a sign U.S. regulators see the ballooning cryptocurrency industry as a growing source of systemic risk, U.S. Treasury officials have also been in discussions with cryptocurrency exchanges and trade groups to ensure U.S. digital assets are safe, said the person familiar with the matter.
Officials are also sharing indicators that IT systems have been compromised, such as a network infiltration or a data breach, with crypto and other financial firms, the person said. 
The value of all cryptocurrencies surged past $3 trillion last year, with approximately 13% to 14% of Americans invested in digital assets as of 2021, according to research by the University of Chicago. 
As the digital asset has become more popular, crypto hacks have grown. Last year, for example, an anonymous hacker stole roughly $600 million in cryptocurrencies from Poly Network, a decentralized finance network, before giving it back. Hackers also stole at least $150 million from crypto exchange BitMart.

Regulators have warned that crypto routs or runs on crypto currencies could pose a risk to the broader financial system.
Some U.S. lawmakers have expressed concern that digital assets could be used to evade Western sanctions, although Biden administration officials have played down that risk.

“I would be recommending and supporting a one quarter of 1% increase” at the March meeting, he told the Senate Banking Committee Thursday. “We are prepared to raise by more than that” if inflation doesn’t come down, he added. 
“I do think it’s going to be appropriate for us to continue to proceed along the lines that we had mind before the Ukraine invasion happened and that was to raise interest rates at the March meeting and continue through the course of the year,” he said. “In this very sensitive time at the moment, I think it’s appropriate for us to be careful in the way we conduct policy simply because things are so uncertain and we don’t want to add to that uncertainty.”
Fed officials are pivoting to tackle the fastest inflation in 40 years and a few have publicly discussed the potential need to hike by a half point sometime this year if inflation comes in too hot. They get February data on consumer prices on March 10. Powell previously told a House panel Wednesday that he’ll propose a 25 basis-point increase when the U.S. central bank meets March 15-16. 
During Thursday’s hearing, Powell said that the Russian attack was causing risks both to inflation -- via higher energy and commodity prices -- as well as to growth, if increased geopolitical risks dim investment or cause consumers to temper spending. He also noted that higher gas prices typically also take a bite out of household budgets. 
“We need to be alert and nimble as we make decisions,” Powell told senators. He noted that the surge in energy prices will likely spill into inflation and if that shift proved to be lasting, it could put upward pressure at the “margin” to longer-term inflation expectations that the central bank wants to stop creeping up -- especially because price pressures are already elevated.
Russia’s attack has whiplashed financial markets and sent energy and commodity prices surging, with West Texas Intermediate crude hovering just under $110 a barrel.
Powell’s confirmation for a second term has been stalled by Republican opposition to President Joe Biden’s selection of Sarah Bloom Raskin to be vice chair for supervision.

(Reuters) - Palladium extended gains to a more than seven-month high on Thursday, spurred by concerns over supply shortages following harsh sanctions on top-producer Russia, while the Ukraine crisis and soaring inflation lifted demand for safe-haven gold.
Palladium, used by automakers in catalytic converters to curb emissions, rose 3% to $2,748.86 by 10:17 a.m. EST (1517 GMT), after hitting its highest since mid-June 2021 earlier in the session.
""Palladium is the one commodity from Russia which accounts for a sizable amount of exposure to the country. So it is in the sweet spot in terms of its impact,"" ED&F Man Capital Markets analyst Edward Meir said.
Western nations have piled sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which accounts for 40% of global palladium production.
""These sanctions have been designed to enable continued trade of commodities the West relies on, so any impact we're seeing is unintentional to an extent and will contribute to higher prices, at least for now,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.
Spot gold was up 0.2% at $1,929.29 per ounce. U.S. gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,932.70.
The Federal Reserve is expected to start raising rates with only a quarter point move, which means the central bank is even further behind the curve on in its inflation fight and that should be good for gold, Meir said.
Investors are looking out for more clues on U.S. interest rate hikes as Fed Chair Jerome Powell's Congress testimony enters its second day.
Powell on Wednesday said he will back a quarter point rate increase when the Fed meets March 15-16.

Meanwhile, data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week.
Spot silver eased 0.4% to $25.15 per ounce, while platinum rose 1% to $1,081.67.

Ukraine said international aid will exceed an estimated $15 billion after Russia’s invasion, a vital source of money as the country’s economy runs at about half its normal output.
The figure is roughly equivalent to 8% of Ukraine’s gross domestic product. National Bank of Ukraine Governor Kyrylo Shevchenko said on Thursday the sum was the total for financial, technical and humanitarian aid and that a third of it would go to the state budget. Monetary policy makers also delayed a scheduled decision on interest rates, as Russian troops continued their assault on the capital Kyiv and other cities.
“Definitely there is huge strain on our public finances, on the public reserves of the central bank and definitely we need the support of the global community to keep our finances viable and to support us in our fighting against Russia,” Shevchenko’s deputy, Serhiy Nikolaychuk, told Bloomberg Television.
Preliminary estimates show daily GDP is at about half what it was under “peaceful conditions,” he said.
Like its people, Ukraine’s economy is coming under unprecedented pressure as Russian forces press a violent advance from the north, east and south. The World Bank said on Tuesday that it’s working with the International Monetary Fund in preparing $3 billion of funding for the embattled country. 
Ukraine on Tuesday sold 8.1 billion hryvnia ($277 million) of war bonds, part of crowdfunding measures to raise cash to help the armed forces and civilians. Ally nations, meanwhile, have vowed to continue targeting Russia’s economy in a bid to restrain President Vladimir Putin, though his military campaign is showing no signs of abating. 
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy also said Russia will eventually pay financially for the war. “We are saying to Russia, learn about reparations and indemnities, because you will compensate us for everything you’ve done against us. Against every Ukrainian, in full,” he said. 
Interest Rates
The benchmark cost of borrowing remained at 10%, the central bank said. It added that it remains committed to inflation targeting and will resume regular monetary policy meetings once the economy normalizes.
Shevchenko added that authorities would return the foreign exchange market to business-as-usual as soon as possible, although that might happen over several phases. 
“After Ukraine is freed from Russian invaders and the economy is back to operating according to market-driven principles, the NBU will return to its traditional inflation-targeting mode with a floating exchange rate,” the bank said in the statement.
Mykhailo Demkiv, an analyst at ICU in Kyiv, said the delay made sense, as addressing inflation was an extreme challenge in the midst of a war. “It is really hard to tackle inflation when the country has to combat the enemy army,” Demkiv said. “Therefore decision to postpone the decision seems logical, but the NBU will have to act after the war is over.”
Russia, whose offensive has been greeted by a barrage of sanctions, the freezing of foreign reserves and the targeting of its own central bank, doubled benchmark borrowing costs to 20% and imposed capital controls on Monday.
Ukraine has grappled repeatedly with Russian aggression since a revolution toppled Kremlin-backed leader Viktor Yanukovych in 2014. During the conflict that Putin fomented following his annexation of Crimea the same year, Ukraine hiked rates to as high as 30% and restructured its foreign debt.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Regulators are preparing for a possible closure of the European arm of Russia's second-largest bank, VTB Bank, amid growing concerns about the impact of Western sanctions on the bank following the Ukraine invasion, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
VTB Bank's European operations could be closed within days by regulators in Germany, where it chiefly operates on the continent, one person with direct knowledge of the situation said.
The second source said BaFin, the German regulator, was on ""high alert"", monitoring the situation closely and ready to act if needed although no final decision had been taken.
VTB, which did not respond to a Reuters' request for comment, said on its European website on Thursday that it was in close consultation with BaFin. It said that the bank was stable and fully operational.
The Russian finance ministry in Moscow and officials at the embassy in Berlin did not respond to requests for comment about VTB's European division.
BaFin declined to comment. 
The  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG)'s clearing arm LCH said on Thursday it had placed VTB Capital, the trading division of VTB Bank, in default as a clearing member.
Last Friday, the exchange had suspended VTB Capital's membership, meaning it could no longer buy and sell stocks listed on the platform.
A spokesperson for the Bundesbank, which shares responsibility for bank supervision, declined to comment on a specific bank when asked about Russian banks in Germany but said it was in close contact with BaFin in this regard. ""If necessary, we will take the appropriate measures,"" the spokesperson added.
Should regulators decide to close VTB in Europe, it would mark the second failure of a major Russian bank in the region as sanctions from the West squeeze the country's lenders. Most of the European operations of Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, closed earlier this week.
VTB, which has more than 4 billion euros of deposits in Europe, principally in Germany, would be covered by Berlin's deposit protection scheme, which shields savers with up to 100,000 euros.
BaFin has said that VTB will not take on new customers and that existing account holders were able to access their money.
Supervisors, however, have been monitoring an outflow of deposits since Russia invaded Ukraine, one source familiar with the situation said. The person added that sanctions made it difficult for the bank to recapitalise to meet demands.
VTB has become one of the principal targets of economic sanctions against Moscow in recent days in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
On Wednesday, it was excluded from the SWIFT messaging system underpinning global transactions. 
That followed U.S. sanctions last week that effectively kicked the bank out of the U.S. financial system, banned trade with Americans and froze its U.S. assets.
One European Union official, asking not to be named, said VTB was in a similar position to Sberbank because both were sanctioned and had been reputationally damaged in Europe.

VTB had roughly 8 billion euros of assets in Europe, according to its most recent quarterly statements. Its European customers include 600 companies, 150 financial institutions from Russia and 160,000 private customers, according to its website.
In recent years, ordinary Germans and local governments have also parked their money with VTB in part because it was one of a handful of banks that did not charge negative interest rates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global supply chain pressures eased in February as backlogs and delivery times improved in several key markets and a measure of ocean shipping costs declined, according to new data from the New York Federal Reserve released on Thursday.
The New York Fed's supply chain pressure index, first published in January to measure the coronavirus pandemic's impact on global production troubles and prices, remains at a historic high.
But from a peak of 4.5 in December, it has fallen over consecutive months and hit 3.3 in February, with 0 representing the index's long-term average. The index combines measures of shipping costs, delay times, and order backlogs in the United States, the euro zone, the United Kingdom, Japan, China, Taiwan, and South Korea.
The improvement, NY Fed analysts noted, was broad across areas of the world and categories.
If that continues, it could represent an important turning point for the Federal Reserve and other central banks in the their efforts to control inflation.
Policymakers have attributed much of the recent rise in prices to world supply chain problems. If those problems improve over time, inflation may ease with relatively less effort by central banks to address the issue by curbing demand through higher interest rates.
""The lessening of supply chain pressures has been widespread ... which is a welcome development in terms of reducing global supply chain disruptions,"" the analysts said.

Improvements in outbound shipments from Asia and to delivery times in South Korea and the United Kingdom contributed among the most to the decline in the index, while some components in the United States, including order backlogs, got slightly worse.
Still, the overall index for the United States also declined to 2.63, after hitting a peak of 2.99 in January.

447,"<span>Mar 03, 2022 09:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers meeting last month agreed that the first interest rate hike in more than a decade was drawing closer as inflation showed signs of taking hold, the accounts of their Feb. 3 meeting showed on Thursday. 
The ECB had been preparing for gradually turning off the money taps when Russia invaded Ukraine last week, casting a shadow on the euro zone's oil-dependent, export-led economy and throwing policymakers' plans into turmoil ahead of a key policy decision on March 10.
ECB President Christine Lagarde walked back on a pledge not to raise rates this year at the Feb. 3 meeting and the accounts reveal growing chances of inflation stabilising at the bank's 2% target after a decade below that level.
The ECB has said it needs to see inflation sustainably at 2% before raising its rate on bank deposits, currently set at a negative 0.5%.
""The view was widely shared that convergence to the ECB’s medium-term inflation target was no longer a distant prospect, thus making the fulfilment of the forward guidance criteria (for a rate hike) more likely within a shorter time span,"" the ECB said in its accounts.
The accounts also lay bare growing scepticism by some policymakers about the ECB's forecasts, which have grossly underestimated inflation for the past several months.
Some policymakers even wanted to bring forward the end of the ECB's Asset Purchase Programme (APP) already at the meeting, which would pave the ground for a rate hike. Reuters was first to report this at the time.
""A number of these members were of the view that the forward guidance conditions were already broadly satisfied and expressed a preference for adjusting the forward guidance on the phasing-out of the APP at the present meeting,"" the ECB said.
The ECB's dilemma is clear. Euro zone inflation soared to a record high 5.8% last month, nearly three times the bank's target. Labour markets are also tightening faster than projected, suggesting that wage pressures could soon kick in, exacerbating the ECB's inflation troubles.
But high energy costs will sap consumer spending power and weigh on investment, deducting from growth and ultimately weighing on prices in the medium term, a time horizon more relevant for ECB policy. 
The war in Ukraine is also creating financial market uncertainty and policy tightening could add to volatility.
Still, even if not at its next meeting, the ECB is likely to curb support as underlying price growth is building, suggesting that inflation is likely to be more durable than thought even just weeks ago. 

""A scaling-back of monetary accommodation should commence, in line with the established forward guidance on sequencing,"" the ECB said in the account of the February meeting.
After overshooting its target in both 2021 and 2022, the ECB will be under pressure to rein in price growth if projections for next year also start to indicate rapid inflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ukraine has exchanged all but $80 million of the $2.7 billion in new International Monetary Fund emergency reserves it received in August, IMF data show, and debt experts say it will likely need urgent debt relief this year.
Ukrainian forces are battling Russian troops that invaded the country last week in the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, with thousands reported dead or injured and more than 1 million refugees having fled.
Western nations are sending billions of dollars in financial support and weapons to help Ukraine, while imposing sweeping sanctions aimed at pressuring Russia to halt the assault.
The World Bank's board is poised to approve an initial $350 million in budget support funds on Friday as part of a broader $3 billion package, with the IMF expecting to approve disbursement of a large part of the $2.2 billion left in Ukraine's stand-by arrangement next week.
Reuters reported last month that Ukraine was working with the United States and other Western nations to develop a new tool that would allow richer countries to transfer their IMF Special Drawing Rights, or reserve assets, to Kyiv.
Further complicating the crisis is Ukraine's heavy debt burden, which totaled $94.7 billion at the end of 2021, including loans from multilateral institutions such as the IMF, and bilateral, private and domestic creditors.
That sum comprises $21.7 billion in multilateral debt, including $13.4 billion held by the IMF; $6.5 billion in bilateral debt with sovereign lenders; $28 billion in debt held by bondholders and commercial creditors and $38 billion owed to domestic lenders, IMF data show.
AVERTING PAYMENTS CRISIS
The U.S. Treasury Department and the IMF could take several steps to ease Ukraine's debt burden and avert a payments crisis, Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, told Reuters. 
Treasury could seek congressional authorization to freeze the $2 million in service payments Ukraine owes the United States this year on its $790 million bilateral debt, he said.
U.S. President Joe Biden could also issue an executive order deferring debt payments to private creditors located in the United States, he said, citing a similar move made by former President George W. Bush during the Iraq war in 2004-2005.
Doing so, he said, would send a ""strong signal of support for Ukraine beyond the really good things that the administration has already been doing"".
It would also ensure that private creditors don't ""use this moment to try and exploit Ukraine"", he said. 
Despite the war, Ukraine has stayed current on its debt obligation and has made coupon payments on five of its Eurobonds that had been due on Tuesday, according to sources.
Ukrainian dollar-denominated bonds, which were issued as part of its 2015 restructuring, are trading in deeply distressed territory of around 25 cents in the dollar.
Mark Sobel, a former senior Treasury official and U.S. chairman of the OMFIF think tank, said the Rapid Financing Instrument loan being considered by the IMF would likely cover the roughly $2 billion the country owes the IMF this year.

LeCompte said the fund could freeze debt service payments as it has for low-income countries during the pandemic, or extend the loan so payments wouldn't be due for several years. Although Russia is a shareholder of the IMF, the United States and Europe hold more power and could push through such a decision, he said.
No comment was immediately available from the Treasury or the IMF on the issue.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A Tokyo court on Thursday handed former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor executive Greg Kelly a six-month suspended sentence for helping Carlos Ghosn hide pay from regulators, paving the way for the American lawyer to return home after more than three years in Japan.
The verdict draws a line under a case that threatened to strain relations between Japan and the United States, its closest ally, over the Japanese justice system's treatment of Kelly who was arrested alongside the former Nissan boss.
""The court finds the existence of unpaid remuneration"" and the failure to disclose amounted to ""false"" reporting, the chief judge Kenji Shimotsu said, telling Kelly he was responsible for one of the eight years included in the charges.
""I was shocked by the judgment,"" Kelly said in a statement after the ruling. ""The court found me mostly innocent, but I do not understand why it said I was guilty for one of the years,"" he added.
His lawyers said they will appeal the conviction, which Kelly should be able to do from the United States. 
Both Kelly and Ghosn - who fled to Lebanon in 2019 hidden in a box on a private jet - allege they are victims of a boardroom coup by former colleagues worried that Ghosn wanted to merge Nissan with alliance partner and largest shareholder  Renault  SA (OTC:RNLSY).
In pointed criticism of the prosecutors, the ruling also pinned blame for Ghosn's alleged failure to disclose $80 million of income over eight years on Toshiaki Ohnuma, a Nissan official overseeing compensation, who was given legal immunity in return for testimony implicating Kelly. 
""Ohnuma's statement is fraught with danger that he was making statements that conformed to the prosecutors' wishes,"" Shimotsu said. ""There was a danger as an accomplice that he would seek to shift responsibility to Ghosn,"" he added.
The court also fined Nissan, which pleaded guilty at the start of the trial 18 months ago, 200 million yen ($1.73 million) for its part in the financial wrongdoing and took aim at corporate governance failings. 
""The dysfunctional governance of the company allowed Ghosn to act in his own self interest. The severe damage to the company's social reputation can only be described as it suffering the consequences,"" Shimotsu said, describing Ghosn's tenure there as a ""dictatorship"". 
In Beirut, Ghosn described Nissan's fine as ""laughable"" and said of Shimotsu's comment: ""It's like a cartoon comment. I am trying to understand what makes him make this kind of comment when I am not there""
He added that Renault (PA:RENA) was struggling because of Nissan's lack of vision. 
'LONG THREE YEARS'
Some Western observers criticised the Japanese justice system's treatment of Kelly.
Suspects in Japan are not allowed to have a lawyer present during interrogations and can be detained for up to three weeks without charge and often in solitary confinement. And 99% of cases that go to trial end with a conviction. 
""While this has been a long three years for the Kelly family, this chapter has come to an end. He and Dee (his wife) can begin their next chapter in Tennessee,"" U.S. ambassador in Japan Rahm Emanuel said in a statement.
Kelly testified that his only intent was to give Ghosn, who was also the chief executive at Renault, a compensation package that would dissuade him from defecting to a rival automaker.
Bill Hagerty, a U.S. Senator from Kelly's home state Tennessee, said he planned to welcome his constituent at the airport.
""Greg has been subjected to circumstances corporate America could never contemplate,"" Hagerty said. ""Greg is innocent of the charges levied against him,"" he added.
The court ruling, however, does not mean an end to legal troubles faced by the former head of Nissan and alliance partner Renault, but it may be the closest the Tokyo court gets to ruling on Ghosn's culpability. 
Ghosn is beyond the reach of Japanese prosecutors after while in Lebanon. He is unable to leave without risking arrest. 
In addition to the charge of hiding his earnings, Ghosn is also accused of enriching himself at his employer's expense through $5 million of payments to a Middle East car dealership, and for temporarily transferring personal investment losses to his former employer's books. 

Ghosn has denied all the accusations against him.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Casino companies in Macau will have their licences extended by six months, the city's Economy and Finance Secretary said on Thursday, allowing more time for a highly anticipated rebidding process in the world's biggest casino hub.
Lei Wai Nong said Macau's casino licences that were due to expire on June 26 will be extended to Dec. 31, according to a government statement.
Authorities would start the rebidding process once the city's legislature had passed a revised law, he said.
Macau's six operators,  Wynn Macau  (OTC:WYNMF), Sands China (OTC:SCHYY), MGM China (OTC:MCHVY), SJM Holdings (OTC:SJMHF), Galaxy Entertainment and Melco Resorts, all have to reapply to maintain operations in the Chinese-ruled former Portuguese colony.
Legislators in the Chinese special administrative region need to first approve changes to the city's gaming law which are the biggest reforms in two decades.
The law will lay the groundwork for what is required from the multibillion dollar casino operators ahead of their license expiration.
In 2019, Macau raked in $36.5 billion from its casinos, more than six times that of the Las Vegas strip. 
Since 2020, however, Macau's casinos have been slammed by coronavirus travel restrictions, which have curbed visitors, and crackdowns on the opaque junket industry.
Beijing, increasingly wary of Macau's acute reliance on gambling, has not yet indicated how the licence rebidding process will be conducted.

It is clear, however, that authorities want far greater control over the casino operators' activities. 
Beijing and Macau massively tightened scrutiny of casinos in recent years, with authorities clamping down on illicit capital flows from the mainland and targeting underground lending and illegal cash transfers.

Investing.com -- Commodity prices surged again and the ruble hit new lows as Western sanctions made it ever harder to deal with Russia. The Kremlin's forces continue to make battlefield gains. Jobless claims and factory orders data are due, while Eurozone producer price inflation hits a massive 30.6%. Snowflake stock tanks after weak guidance, while Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) report after the bell. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 3rd March.
1. Commodity prices surge again
Commodity prices surged again as the threat to Russian supplies of oil, gas, wheat and industrial metals continued to stoke panic buying of alternatives.  
U.S. crude futures surged to as high as $116.50 a barrel, their highest since 2008, before retreating to $113.31 by 6:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), a gain of 2.5% on the day. Brent rose 1.9%% to $115.08 a barrel.
In a stark illustration of what is a de facto tightening of the global market, Russian oil major Surgutneftegaz found no buyers for April exports averaging over 200,000 barrels a day at a tender on Wednesday. At the same time, U.S. inventory data showed that stockpiles at the Cushing hub fell to their lowest since 2018, while the Strategic Petroleum Reserve fell to its lowest level since 2002 – even before the measures announced earlier this week to release more oil in the coming days.
Elsewhere, Asian coal and European natural gas futures hit fresh highs, while U.S. wheat futures rose another 4.2%. They’ve now risen over 90% since July. Russia and Ukraine account for some 28% of world wheat exports, an even greater weight than Russia has in world energy markets.
2. Ruble hits new lows; Russian debt cut to junk; battlefield gains continue
The Russian ruble plumbed new depths after the central bank asked foreign exchange brokerages to charge a 30% commission on any sales of dollars, the latest in an increasingly desperate suite of measures to stabilize the local economy. On Wednesday, it had forbidden the payment of interest on domestic government debt held by foreigners.
Overnight, ratings agencies Moody’s and Fitch cut their Russian sovereign debt rating to junk status, while MSCI and Russell said they will cut Russian equities from all of their indices.
EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU is willing to consider tighter sanctions if the situation deteriorates. That reflects a growing awareness that the loopholes left by the first round of sanctions last week still allows massive hard currency flows to Russia on a daily basis.
In Ukraine, Russian forces appear to have captured the southern city of Kherson and continue to pound Kharkiv, the country’s second city, with indiscriminate rocket attacks. Russia’s Foreign Ministry talked up the possibility of peace talks with Ukraine later today.
3. Stocks set to open a little lower; Powell to continue testimony
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower later, giving up some of the gains they made on Wednesday on hints from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell that the central bank may not raise interest rates as far as previously thought, given the likely hit to global growth from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Powell continues his semiannual Congressional testimony in the Senate from 10 AM ET.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 39 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.4%. The three cash indices had gained between 1.6% and 1.9% each on Wednesday.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include software company Snowflake, which fell over 20% after hours on Wednesday after predicting a slowdown in growth this year, and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), which announced a new CEO late Wednesday.
4. Flight from Russia continues; VW, H&M stop operations; Yachts seized
International companies continue to distance themselves from Russia in the wake of the invasion, which was condemned by a large majority in a non-binding motion by the UN General Assembly on Wednesday (albeit China and India abstained).
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) became the latest to say it will stop production in Russia, while fast-fashion giant H&M and IKEA also said they would suspend operations there. Toyota and GM, which don’t produce in Russia, have said they will stop exports there, as has Mercedes-Benz.
Moves to seize the assets of oligarchs linked to the Russian regime are also gathering pace: French authorities seized a yacht belonging to Igor Sechin, the CEO of oil giant Rosneft, while their German counterparts seized a yacht belonging to metals and telecoms billionaire Alisher Usmanov. The U.K. government instructed one of its senior ministers, Michael Gove, to accelerate efforts to freeze Russian assets in Britain.
5. Jobless claims, Challenger job cuts due; euro sinks as PPI rips higher
Away from the war, the regular rhythms of the economic calendar throw up the weekly U.S. jobless claims numbers and the monthly Challenger Job Cuts survey. There are also data due on factory orders and the final version of the ISM’s non-manufacturing survey for February.
Parallel surveys in the Eurozone led to a slight downward revision of flash estimates earlier. Meanwhile, the Eurozone’s annual rate of producer price inflation soared even more than expected to 30.6% after a 5.2% rise in prices in February. That sits ill with ECB comments about the possible need to normalize policy more slowly due to the invasion of Ukraine. The euro fell to a 22-month low of $1.1071.",,,,,
453,"<span>Mar 03, 2022 06:21AM ET</span>","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has decided to stop supplying rocket engines to the United States in retaliation for its sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, Dmitry Rogozin, head of the state space agency Roscosmos, said on Thursday.
""In a situation like this we can't supply the United States with our world's best rocket engines. Let them fly on something else, their broomsticks, I don't know what,"" Rogozin said on state Russian television.
According to Rogozin, Russia has delivered a total of 122 RD-180 engines to the U.S. since 1990s, of which 98 have been used to power Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) launch vehicles.
Roscosmos will also stop servicing rocket engines it had previously delivered to the U.S., Rogozin said, adding that the U.S. still had 24 engines that would now be left without Russian technical assistance.
Russia has earlier said it was suspending cooperation with Europe on space launches from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana in response to Western sanctions over Ukraine.

Moscow has also demanded guarantees from British satellite company OneWeb that its satellites would not be used for military purposes. OneWeb, in which the British government has a stake, said on Thursday it was suspending all launches from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
Rogozin said Russia would now focus on creating dual-purpose spacecraft in line with the needs of Roscosmos and the Defence Ministry.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering excluding banks in Belarus from the SWIFT messaging system that underpins the global financial transactions, as it has already done for seven Russian banks, an EU official said on Thursday.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Under President Xi Jinping, China has pushed for self-reliance in key areas of technology and the payments needed to settle trade to minimise its vulnerability to economic pressure over flashpoints, from trade policy to Taiwan.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the tough global response, including curtailment of access to the SWIFT payments system and a freezing of Russian assets, provide a case study for China on the economic and financial vulnerabilities analysts expect it will continue to address.
The unexpectedly heavy sanctions, led by the West, have exposed vulnerabilities for Russia, including dependence on the U.S. dollar, that China would want to mitigate before becoming the target of any such measures.
While the China-U.S. trade war during the Trump administration forced China to seek greater self-sufficiency, the sanctions on Russia are a louder wake-up call, said Abraham Zhang, chairman of Shenzhen-based China Europe Capital.
""Just as China needs food security, China also needs oil reserves, and a complete industrial system, so that if China is one day cut off from external supplies as Russia is now, China can still be self-sufficient, maintain internal circulation, and survive,"" Zhang said.
China has in recent years ramped-up efforts to develop home-grown technologies, from semiconductors to advanced materials to aircraft, to ease reliance on imports. Huawei Technologies, crippled by sanctions preventing its access to high-end chips, is a cautionary example. 
""China needs to accelerate the development of key technologies. Otherwise, it would be too late once you're suffocated by sanctions, if Russia offers any lessons,"" he said.
To be sure, China has a much bigger and more diversified economy than Russia's, although it depends on imported energy and food, and relies heavily on global commerce as the world's largest trading economy. 
Also, Ukraine is not Taiwan, which Beijing has vowed to bring under its control, by force if necessary. 
The political and geostrategic circumstances are vastly different, including the likely response to a Chinese attack on the democratically controlled island, which among other factors is a linchpin in the global technology supply chain. 
Where the United States has ruled out intervening militarily in Ukraine, its policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" towards Taiwan and its strengthening defence ties with the island, including stepped up arms sales and the development of the AUKUS grouping with Australia and Britain, convey a warning.
China, which has declined to condemn Russia's attack or call it an invasion, has blamed the Ukraine conflict on NATO expansion.
Taiwan has reported no unusual Chinese military movements since the Ukraine war began and U.S. President Joe Biden this week dispatched a team of former senior officials to visit the island in a show of support. 
CURRENCIES, PAYMENTS
China has in recent years sought to internationalise its currency by settling more trade with the yuan, including with Russia. The yuan accounted for 13.1% of the Russian central bank's foreign currency reserves last June, compared with just 0.1% in June 2017
China's central bank is developing a digital currency, which would have the benefit of further encouraging yuan settlement for trade, but the project, while ahead of efforts elsewhere, is still in its early days.
China has an alternative system to bypass SWIFT, the Cross Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), which saw a 75% increase in processing volume last year, although 80% of CIPS transactions still involve SWIFT.
Bert Hofman, director of the East Asian Institute at the Lee Kuan Yew School of the National University Singapore, said China has been concerned about dollar dominance of international payments since the global financial crisis.
""The sanctions may therefore lead China to accelerate the development of alternative options, including the China-led CIPS system, and the further internationalisation of the (yuan).""
WORRY ABOUT ISOLATION
While the unity and strength of the diplomatic response to the invasion, which many experts believe Russia underestimated, may be instructive to China, the unexpectedly sluggish early performance of Russia's forces in Ukraine is less applicable, with the United States not engaged there militarily.
U.S. intervention would be China's biggest worry in the event that it attacked Taiwan, said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center. 
""The international isolation of Russia, and the broad coalition ... make China worry about the potential international isolation of China in a similar event on Taiwan,"" she said.
Still, she said, China would take comfort that countries that have joined in sanctions against Russia remain in the minority, and the fact that China has yet to face secondary sanctions for its Russia ties.
Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said Beijing was unlikely to be happy with the way things are going in Ukraine but the ultimate effectiveness of the international response would determine its outlook.

If Russia was not brought to its knees, ""China will be relatively relaxed about what the West could do when China is finally ready to take Taiwan,"" he said.
""If the responses should prove effective against Russia, Xi will be a lot more cautious about when and how he will try to bring Taiwan into the fold,"" he said.

AGBOPURA, Sri Lanka (Reuters) - W.M. Seneviratne sat watching a mechanised harvester slice through the jade green fields around him in eastern Sri Lanka's Agbopura village one recent morning, aware that this year's harvest would be only a fraction of what he was used to.
""I cannot recall any time in the past when we had to struggle so much to get a decent harvest,"" said Seneviratne, a lean 65-year-old with a shock of silver hair, who has been farming since he was a child.
""Last year, we got 60 bags from these two acres. But this time it was just 10,"" he added.
The dramatic fall in yields follows a decision last April by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to ban all chemical fertilisers in Sri Lanka - a move that risks undermining support among rural voters who are key to his family's grip on Sri Lankan politics.
Although the ban was rolled back after widespread protests, only a trickle of chemical fertilisers made it to farms, which will likely lead to an annual drop of at least 30% in paddy yields nationwide, according to agricultural experts.
The shortfall comes at a bad time for the island nation of 22 million people. Sri Lanka is in the throes of its worst economic crisis in a decade, foreign exchange reserves are at a record low and inflation is soaring, especially for food.
Fuel shortages have led to rolling power cuts across the country.
The impact of the poor paddy crop could push up the retail price of rice by around 30%, said Buddhi Marambe, an agriculture professor at the University of Peradeniya, who blamed the decision to ban chemical fertilisers.
""That's where the problem is,"" he told Reuters. ""Yields will likely be lower next harvest season as well. So, costs will keep increasing even 4-5 months from now.""
To ease the hit on consumers, Rajapaksa's administration is importing rice using credit lines from friendly neighbours.
And to help farmers, it has raised the minimum government purchase price and announced a 40 billion Sri Lankan Rupee ($200 million) compensation package.
Sri Lanka's agriculture and finance ministries did not respond to questions from Reuters.
Agriculture Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage told reporters on Tuesday that the harvest would be lower this year.
""We will start paying compensation to 1.1 million farmers from next week ... none of the farmers will suffer financially,"" he said. ""We will never let that happen.""
'VISTAS OF PROSPERITY'
In a campaign manifesto for the presidential election in 2019 titled ""Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour"", which became a policy framework after a landslide victory, Rajapaksa proposed providing Sri Lankans with food without harmful chemicals.
He pushed the reform through in a single season rather than over several years, adding to confusion across Sri Lanka's farms including around Agbopura, a quaint hamlet some 220 km northeast of the country's main city of Colombo.
""Farmers around here really tried everything possible to grow their paddy. They applied coconut fertiliser, liquid fertiliser, compost... basically, anything they could get their hands on,"" said Chanuka Leshaan Karunaratne, a major paddy trader in Agbopura.
Yields among the area's 500 farmers appear to have dropped by half, Karunaratne said, sitting at his warehouse on the main road that runs through Agbopura.
Indika Paranavithana, head of the local farmers' association, estimated a similar fall in output and said many distressed households had used up their reserve stocks.
""This paddy reserve is their savings,"" he said. ""For the rest of the year, if someone gets sick or there is a funeral, they sell a sack of paddy to cover costs.""
On Monday, the government approved a minimum of 50,000 rupees per hectare as compensation, part of the 40 billion rupee package announced in January. That could make it harder to achieve its 8.8% budget deficit target for 2022, and further stoke inflation. 
Some farmers say the amounts are not enough, and the government has become deeply unpopular, according to a new survey by Colombo think-tank Verité Research.
In its first ""Mood of the Nation"" poll, which surveyed over 1,000 Sri Lankans in January, Verité found that 10% approved the government's work and more than 80% had lost confidence in the country's economy.
Sri Lanka's 1.5 million paddy farmers are a core vote base for the nationalist Rajapaksa family, who have supported them with fertiliser subsidies and higher crop prices.
The farm sector contributes 7% to the country's GDP but employs about 27% of the workforce, mostly in rural areas. 
Sri Lanka's reserves fell to $2.36 billion in January, leaving the government short of dollars for chemical fertiliser imports for the cultivation season starting in April.
The military is getting involved. Thousands of troops have been tasked with producing 2.5 million tonnes of organic fertilisers by April, according to an official who declined to be named.
GOLD NECKLACES
Weeks before the harvesters arrived at Agbopura, Seneviratne noticed the plants were short and reedy.
""These crops need urea. Compost is just not good enough and we didn't even get any of the organic fertiliser that was distributed by the government,"" he said.
Despite 150,000 rupees in debt, a decent harvest would allow him to get back two of his wife's gold chains that were pawned last year to meet household costs.
The night before his crop was harvested, Seneviratne camped in the fields to scare away a group of elephants that arrive each winter.
But paddy from his two areas only filled 10 bags. His earnings dropped to around 15,000 rupees from 85,000 rupees a year earlier. 
""After I paid off the harvester, there was only 200 rupees left,"" he said.
Like many other farmers in Agbopura, Seneviratne said he did not know when and how government compensation would reach him.

""If I had known the yield would be this low, I would have left the crop to be eaten by wild animals,"" he said. ""I don't know how we will get the pawned gold back.""

BERLIN/LONDON (Reuters) - Home prices in Germany's booming property market look set to rise sharply again in 2022 and, while the pace will ease in coming years, the increases will still outstrip general inflation, a Reuters poll found.
As in much of the world, many Germans spent most of the coronavirus pandemic working from home and those who could afford to move sought out larger, more expensive properties - fuelling home price rises.
Years of ultra-low borrowing costs have also made it cheaper for people to upsize or for first-time buyers to get onto the property ladder.
Historically, the German housing market was dominated by renters but the desire for a safe-haven investment, along with speculators, has grown in recent years, adding to the property market boom.
European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel said in February the bank must consider surging house prices when assessing inflation.
Much of the polling was conducted before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which could delay - or limit - any ECB considerations of tighter monetary policy. That in turn may support the housing market in the short term.
Home prices rose around 10% last year and were forecast to rise 6.3% this year, according to the Feb. 10-March 2 Reuters poll of 16 property market experts. That pace was expected to slow to 4.5% next year and then to 2.8% in 2024.
INFLATION
Yet consumer price inflation was pegged at 3.0%, 1.8% and 1.9%, respectively, in a January Reuters poll and the latest house price forecasts were an upgrade from the respective 6.0%, 4.0% and 2.0% given in November. [ECILT/EU]
""House prices will continue to rise, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than in the previous years,"" said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING.
""Both the mismatch between supply and demand, currently fuelled by a stagnating supply, as well as high material and construction costs and the fight against climate change, for which energy-efficient housing plays a major role, will continue to drive house prices up in the coming years.""
Germany should curb a boom in house prices by setting caps on mortgages and forcing banks to build up more capital, the European Union's financial stability watchdog said last month.
""The house price to income ratio is even higher than during the housing boom of the '90s, particularly in big cities,"" said Marco Wagner, senior economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Asked to rate the affordability of German house prices on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 was extremely cheap and 10 extremely expensive, analysts rated them 8. That matched the previous estimate and one of the highest medians given compared to other Reuters polls for major housing markets.
Respondents to an additional question said the ECB would have to lift its refinancing rate to 1.50% this year to significantly slow activity. It currently sits at zero and only 13 of 43 economists in a separate Reuters poll on ECB policy saw it rising at all this year.

""To significantly slow down activity, a sharp rise in interest rates is required, which is not to be expected to this extent,"" said Pekka Sagner, economist for housing policy and property economics at the German Economic Institute.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The crisis in Ukraine could hurt Japan's economy by driving up the price households and companies pay for fuel and commodities, a central bank policymaker said on Thursday, signaling the need to maintain massive stimulus to support a fragile recovery.
Japan's consumer inflation could briefly approach the central bank's elusive 2% target due in part to sharp rises in energy costs triggered by the crisis, Bank of Japan (BOJ) board member Junko Nakagawa said.
But such a rise in inflation alone would not be reason to dial back stimulus, Nakagawa said, adding that Japan's economy was still in the midst of recovering from the pandemic's wounds.
More time was needed to gauge the Ukraine war's impact on Japan's economy, which may come not just through trade but market volatility and rising raw material costs, she said.
""While energy and food prices may rise, such moves could weigh on Japan's economy if they hurt corporate profits and household income,"" Nakagawa told a briefing.
""We need to scrutinise developments (in Ukraine) more to determine whether they warrant a big change in monetary policy,"" said Nakagawa, the first BOJ policymaker to elaborate on the economic outlook since Russia invaded Ukraine.
While soaring raw material costs have pushed up wholesale prices in Japan, core consumer inflation stood at 0.2% in January on weak household spending and wage growth.
But analysts expect core consumer inflation to pace up towards the BOJ's 2% target from next month, as the drag from cellphone fee cuts dissipates and rising oil costs boost gasoline and electricity bills.
""For the time being, inflationary pressure will remain strong, mainly for energy, food and industrial goods,"" Nakagawa said in a speech prior to the briefing, adding that year-on-year growth in core consumer prices may ""briefly rise close to 2%.""
""Even if that happens, what's important is to scrutinise the factors (driving up prices) and whether Japan's economic fundamentals are strong enough to make such price rises sustainable,"" she said.
The remarks heighten the chance the BOJ will upgrade its inflation forecast in a quarterly review of its projections in April. In current forecasts, it expects core consumer inflation to hit 1.1% in the fiscal year beginning in April.

Japan's reliance on fuel and food imports makes its economy vulnerable to higher commodity prices, adding to woes for policymakers fretting about the hit to growth from the pandemic.
Given Japan's low inflation and fragile recovery, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has repeatedly said the bank has no intention of following in the footsteps of the U.S. Federal Reserve in tightening policy.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan will freeze the assets of four additional Russian banks from April 2, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Thursday, taking to seven the total number Tokyo has slapped with such sanctions.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's cabinet approved the decision to freeze the assets of VTB Bank, Sovcombank, Novikombank and Otkritie, the Ministry of Finance said in a document.
The move will take effect on April 2, a ministry official said. The banks are all closely related to the Russian government. 
The size of their assets was not immediately known but VTB Bank is the second-largest Russian bank in terms of assets, the official said. 
Targets of asset freezes also include dozens of individuals including Aleksandr Lukashenko, president of Belarus, which has provided footholds for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Tokyo has also decided to ban Belarus-bound exports.
""Japan will firmly implement (the sanctions) together with other members of G7,"" the Group of Seven advanced nations, Suzuki told reporters.
Washington has imposed several rounds of sanctions so far, including against Russian President Vladimir Putin and the central bank. The EU on Monday imposed sanctions on 26 prominent people over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including oligarchs and business people active in the oil, banking and finance sectors.
Tokyo's latest decision came on top of the government's announcement on Tuesday that it will freeze assets of Russia state-owned Promsvyazbank and Vnesheconombank, as well as the country's central bank.

Tokyo's banking sector sanctions have followed in the footsteps of the West with the addition of the four banks, which the European Union has decided to exclude from the SWIFT international payments network.
The official said there may be more to come: ""We cannot tell whether this is it or not.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Terraformation, a forest restoration start-up founded by the former boss of technology company Reddit, is looking to raise $100 million for a fund focused on early-stage projects in developing countries.
The as-yet unnamed fund will blend private, public and concessional capital in a mix of equity and debt, it said, and aims to launch later this year.
In the week U.N. climate scientists warned of the escalating impact of climate change, Terraformation and non-profit Bankers without Boundaries, which is helping structure the fund, said restoring 2.3 billion acres of forest could cost $2.6 trillion.
""To solve climate change, the world needs to turn trillions of dollars into forest in the next eight years. Despite increasing demand from investors, the financial products don't yet exist to put that money to work at scale,"" said Terraformation founder and Chief Executive Yishan Wong.
In a co-authored report, the partners said grants, guarantees, asset-backed securities, collateralised loan obligations, sustainability-linked credit and green, social and forest bonds could all be used to scale up forest finance.
More than 100 leaders pledged to stop and reverse deforestation at global climate talks in November, yet Terraformation said a ""new wave of innovation"" was needed in financing of projects to make it happen.
The partners said they aim to address hurdles to reforestation, including a lack of seeds and trained foresters, concern over the rigour of checks, and a shortage of cash, in order to cut risk and attract investors.

""Forest finance is one of the next frontiers for innovation in financial services,"" said Rupesh Madlani at Bankers without Boundaries, which normally help governments and institutions with financial advice on social and environmental projects.
""But it’s clear that a step-change in both thinking and action is required. This is a global issue and it needs a global answer.""

462,"<span>Mar 03, 2022 12:35AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Ratings agencies Fitch and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) downgraded Russia by six notches to ""junk"" status, saying Western sanctions threw into doubt its ability to service debt and would weaken the economy. 
Russia's financial markets have been thrown into turmoil by sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.
The invasion has triggered a flurry of credit rating moves and dire warnings about the impact on Russia's economy. S&P lowered Russia's rating to junk status last week.
It also prompted index providers FTSE Russell and MSCI to announce on Wednesday that they will remove Russian equities from all their indexes, after a top MSCI executive earlier this week called Russia's stock market ""uninvestable"".
FTSE Russell said the decision will be effective from March 7, while MSCI said its decision will be implemented in one step across all MSCI indexes as of the close on March 9. MSCI said it is also reclassifying MSCI Russia Indexes from emerging markets to standalone markets status. 
Russia has a weighting of 3.24% in MSCI's emerging market benchmark and a weighting of around 30 basis points in the index provider's global benchmark.
The Institute of International Finance predicts a double-digit contraction in economic growth this year.
Fitch downgraded Russia to ""B"" from ""BBB"" and placed the country's ratings on ""rating watch negative"". Moody's, which last week had flagged the possibility of a downgrade, also cut the country's rating by six notches, to B3 from Baa3.
Fitch said the only other precedent to such a large six-notch downgrade on a single sovereign entity was South Korea in 1997.
""The severity of international sanctions in response to Russia's military invasion of Ukraine has heightened macro-financial stability risks, represents a huge shock to Russia's credit fundamentals and could undermine its willingness to service government debt,"" Fitch said in a report. 
Fitch said that U.S. and EU sanctions prohibiting any transactions with the Central Bank of Russia would have a ""much larger impact on Russia's credit fundamentals than any previous sanctions,"" rendering much of Russia's international reserves unusable for FX intervention.
""The sanctions could also weigh on Russia's willingness to repay debt,"" Fitch warned. ""President Putin's response to put nuclear forces on high alert appears to diminish the prospect of him changing course on Ukraine to the degree required to reverse rapidly tightening sanctions."" 
Fitch said it expects further ratcheting up of sanctions on Russian banks. 
Moody's said on Thursday the scope and severity of the sanctions ""have gone beyond Moody's initial expectations and will have material credit implications.""
The sanctions imposed by Western countries will also markedly weaken Russia's GDP growth potential relative to the ratings agency's previous assessment of 1.6%, Fitch said.
""In this case, the sanctions-driven frozen/falling assets tail-wagged the ratings dog,"" analysts at Mizuho wrote. They added that ""ratings and benchmark risks revealed may compound further capital exodus as benchmark funds are forced to liquidate rather than hold."" 
Sanctions imposed on Russia have significantly increased the chance of the country's defaulting on its dollar and other international market government debt, analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and elsewhere said on Wednesday.

Russia has responded to the sanctions with a range of measures to shore up its economic defenses and retaliate against Western restrictions. It hiked its main lending rate to 20%, banned Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners, ordered exporting companies to buttress the rouble, and said it would stop foreign investors selling assets.
The government also plans to tap its National Wealth Fund (NWF), a rainy day cushion, to help counter sanctions.

Russia's financial markets have been thrown into turmoil by sanctions imposed over the invasion, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two. 
In the face of those sanctions, Russian companies have been exploring workarounds with emerging market allies, especially China, with settlement of transactions in yuan seen rising at the expense of the dollar.
In a note this week, ANZ economists and strategists said they estimate yuan bond holdings of Russia's central bank and the Russian National Wealth Fund at $80 billion and $60 billion, respectively. 
Foreign holdings of bonds on China's interbank bond market totalled 4.07 trillion yuan ($644.13 billion) at the end of January, the latest month for which data is available.
""We are watching if Russia will liquidate the assets if (yuan) cash is needed to meet other payment obligations,"" ANZ said.
Yuan accounted for 13.1% of the Russian central bank's foreign currency reserves in June 2021, compared with just 0.1% in June 2017. Dollar holdings dropped to 16.4%, from 46.3%.
But while Russia could potentially make use of yuan assets and China's Cross Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) to counter the impact of Western sanctions, including bans on some Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial messaging system, the crisis is unlikely to significantly boost use of the yuan, they said.
""CIPS is a mainly a RMB clearing system and more than 80% of transactions on CIPS rely on SWIFT telegram. It is not an immediate replacement for SWIFT."" 
Underscoring the impact of sanctions over the invasion, rating agencies Fitch and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) slashed Russia's sovereign credit rating to ""junk"" status, following a similar move from S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) last week.

464,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 11:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s vow to contain inflation with higher interest rates is holding, and that may boost the dollar.
The two-year Treasury note yield surged 17 basis points on Wednesday after Powell backed a quarter-point rate hike this month despite uncertainties stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Although yields fell across the curve in Asia on Thursday, overnight-indexed swaps price in more than five Fed rate hikes this year, in stark contrast with the prospect of continued accommodative policy in the euro zone and Japan.
“U.S. inflation is unlikely to accelerate further from here, while the policy rate and bond yields will rise, so real yields have entered a sustained upward trend,” said Koji Fukaya, a fellow at Market Risk Advisory in Tokyo. “The dollar will go up.”
The U.S. currency’s track record in largely following differentials in inflation-adjusted 10-year yields is a good indicator of strength ahead. Over the past two years, the Dollar Index has tracked the gap in yields between the U.S. and the gauge’s members, excluding Switzerland, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That spread has widened almost half a percentage point this year, while the dollar gained about 2%.
Fukaya sees the Dollar Index rising another 1.5% to 99 this year, compared with 97.524 on Thursday.
U.S. inflation, as measured by the personal-consumption expenditures index, probably will peak at an annual 5.6% in the January-March period before slowing to 3% in the fourth quarter, economists forecast.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -The United States will address potential gaps in tough sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday, adding the measures would ""continue to bite.""
Yellen said financial sanctions on the Russian central bank, commercial banks and members of the country's wealthy elite were having a significant impact, as demonstrated by the rouble's sharp fall. 
""Russia is increasingly an economic island,"" she said at the University of Illinois-Chicago after visiting Chicago's Ukrainian Village neighborhood. 
""We will continue to look at how the sanctions work and whether there are leakages and we have the possibility to address them.""
Asked whether sanctions to curb Russia's oil and gas exports could follow, she said ""nothing is off the table,"" but added that the United States had not taken this step to spare Americans, Europeans and other people around the world from ""punishing consequences.""
Sanctions imposed last Sunday and Monday have so far restricted 80% of the Russian banking sector's assets and ""immobilized"" about half of the Russian central bank's assets, she said. 
The rouble, which has lost about a third of its value since the start of the year, touched a fresh record low of 110 to the dollar in Moscow on Wednesday as the country's financial system teetered under the weight of Western sanctions.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities.
The former chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve said she knew there were concerns about members of Russia's elite using cryptocurrencies as a possible means to evade sanctions, but noted there were anti-money laundering laws in place to prevent that from happening.
""That is a channel to be watched,"" she said. ""But ... many participants in the cryptocurrency networks are subject to anti-money-laundering (laws) and sanctions. So it's not that that sector is completely one where things can be evaded."" 
Yellen said she does not expect the sanctions on Russia to have a major impact on the economic trajectory of the United States, due to limited U.S. trade and financial connections with Russia. Their effects will most likely be transmitted through higher energy prices, she said, adding that Biden was seeking to keep the United States well-supplied with oil. 
The Treasury will continue to ""go after oligarchs or Russian elites who are key to President Putin's corrupt power,"" she said.
""We have sanctioned many of these individuals over the last few weeks and we are assembling a task force with Justice Department colleagues and our allies to uncover, freeze, and seize their wealth around the world.""
Washington is preparing a sanctions package targeting more Russian oligarchs as well as their companies and assets, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 

Yellen, also said stronger economic policies were needed to strengthen America at home, despite an economic recovery from COVID-19 that has exceeded most expectations and U.S. growth that looks poised to continue.
At the University of Chicago's Innovation Center, she called for Congress to pass key Biden economic investment proposals, including funding for research, child care, universal pre-school and clean energy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is preparing a sanctions package targeting more Russian oligarchs as well as their companies and assets, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, as Washington steps up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Some sanctions could be announced as early as this week, one of the sources told Reuters, adding that details are still being worked out. Washington is also readying sanctions against more officials in Putin's inner circle, the source said.
The U.S. Treasury Department issued new guidance on Wednesday to close loopholes it said Russia was exploiting to evade sanctions.
""Today’s guidance makes clear that such actions on behalf of Russia’s Central Bank are prohibited, closing off attempts to access the U.S. financial system,"" the Treasury Department said.
Washington has repeatedly warned that it was prepared to impose further costs on wealthy Russians. The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday launched a task force known as ""KleptoCapture"" aimed at straining the finances of Russia's oligarchs.
Washington has so far imposed several rounds of sanctions, including against Putin and the central bank, after Russia's forces invaded Ukraine in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Moscow calls the assault a ""special operation.""
The measures have included sanctions against what the U.S. Treasury Department said were Russian ""elites,"" including some with ties to Sberbank, VTB, Rosneft and the Federal Security Service (FSB).
The Washington Post, which first reported the United States was preparing to expand sanctions on Russian oligarchs, said the list of people being readied by the White House and Treasury will overlap with some of those sanctioned by the European Union on Monday, including Alisher Usmanov, the owner of an iron and steel conglomerate.
The EU on Monday imposed sanctions on 26 prominent people over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including oligarchs and business people active in the oil, banking and finance sectors.
It also targeted government members, high-level military people and ""propagandists who contributed to spread anti-Ukrainian propaganda,"" the EU said in a statement.
Several people included on the EU's list on Monday are not yet designated by the United States, including Nikolay Tokarev, the chief executive of energy giant Transneft, Dmitry Chernyshenko, Russia's deputy prime minister, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.
State Department spokesman Ned Price on Monday said that U.S. sanctions ""will ultimately be symmetrical and mutually reinforcing"" with those of U.S. allies and partners.
Washington has repeatedly warned that it is prepared to take further measures to hold Moscow to account over its invasion of Ukraine.
In his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, U.S. President Joe Biden said the United States would work to seize the yachts, luxury apartments and private jets of wealthy Russians with ties to Putin.
""We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,"" Biden said.

The United States and its allies last week announced they would launch a task force to identify and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs.
The White House on Wednesday said the United States is ""very open"" to imposing sanctions on Russia's oil and gas industry as it also weighs the potential market impact, as global oil prices touched eight-year highs and supply disruptions mounted.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said he is inclined to support a 25 basis point rate increase at the March policy meeting but said the central bank is prepared to move more aggressively later if inflation does not abate as expected. 
""I’m inclined to propose and support a 25 basis point rate hike,"" Powell testified before Congress on Wednesday about the Fed's upcoming March meeting. He added that the central bank is ""prepared to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points"" at one or more meetings if inflation does not come down later this year as expected.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, balancing high U.S. inflation against the complex new risks of a European land war, said Wednesday the central bank would begin “carefully” raising interest rates at its upcoming March meeting but be ready to move more aggressively if inflation does not cool as quickly as expected.
Powell called the Russian invasion of Ukraine ""a game changer"" that could have unpredictable consequences.
""There are events yet to come and we don't know what the real effect on the U.S. economy will be,"" Powell told the House Financial Services Committee during a monetary policy hearing overshadowed by the conflict in Europe.
But he said for now the Fed was proceeding largely as planned to raise the target overnight federal funds rate and reduce the size of its balance sheet in order to tame inflation that is currently the highest it has been since the 1980s.
Powell said he will back a quarter point rate increase when the Fed meets March 15-16, effectively putting to rest debate over starting a post-pandemic round of rate hikes with a larger than usual half-point increase.
But the Fed chief said he was ready if needed to use larger or more frequent rate moves if inflation does not slow, and may over time need to push rates to restrictive levels above 2.5% - slowing economic growth rather than simply stimulating it less robustly.
It is a subtle distinction but a marker of Powell’s focus on inflation as the key fight before the Fed right now, a top of mind concern that could undermine the central bank’s credibility if it gets worse, erodes household spending power and begins distorting the investment and spending decisions of businesses and families.
The job market, Powell noted in prepared testimony, was ""extremely tight,"" and Fed officials have declared their maximum employment goal effectively met. The pandemic's impact on the economy appeared to be easing and ""demand is strong,"" Powell said. 
However inflation is currently triple the Fed's 2% target, and has become a prime political concern for the Biden administration and members of Congress who came to Wednesday’s hearing armed with anecdotes of constituents paying more for staple goods or for business supplies.
What Powell described as a collision between strong consumer demand and pandemic constraints on global product supply was ""not as transitory as we had hoped...Other mainstream economists and central banks around the world made the same mistake. That doesn’t excuse it, but we thought these things would be resolved long ago.”
FRAMED BY UKRAINE CONFLICT
But even with the immediate focus on inflation, Powell's testimony was framed by the conflict in Ukraine, and what it might mean for the United States and world economies in the weeks or even years ahead.
Powell said that Fed staff had begun analyzing different scenarios but that too much remained unknown about an event whose full implications may ""be with us for a very long time."" 
""The near-term effects on the U.S. economy of the invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war, the sanctions, and of events to come, remain highly uncertain,"" Powell said. ""Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.""
""We will proceed carefully as we learn more about the implications of the Ukraine war on the economy,"" Powell said. ""We have an expectation that inflation will peak and begin to come down this year. To the extent inflation comes in higher or is more persistently high ... we would be prepared to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings.""
The Fed slashed rates to the current near zero level in 2020 to blunt the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. There is now broad agreement that the current level of borrowing costs is out of phase with an economy that has rebounded faster than expected from the health crisis.
Lawmakers peppered Powell with questions about the fallout from rising oil prices following Russia's action, the threat of cyberattacks and broader risks to the financial system, and even the impact on the market for fertilizer.
""Everything we can do ... we are doing it,"" to protect against a cyberattack, Powell said. ""The larger financial institutions are doing it. It's hard to say what's possible, but we are on high alert and will continue to be."" 
Regarding financial markets, Powell said that so far they have been ""functioning well. There is a great deal of liquidity out there,"" and existing Fed programs were helping.
Powell will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. The Fed chief is required to testify to those House and Senate committees twice a year as part of the central bank's semiannual reviews of monetary policy. 

Major U.S. stock indexes were trading sharply higher, extending their gains during Powell's testimony, and yields on Treasuries rose. The U.S. dollar was little changed against a basket of major trading partner currencies. Traders in interest rate futures began pricing in six quarter-point rate hikes this year versus five as of Tuesday.
Powell, ""preferred to keep the Fed's options open ... there was little pushback on current market rate expectations, which have plummeted since Russia's invasion,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's nearly $9 trillion balance sheet has more room to decline than it did the last time the central bank shrank its holdings and policymakers will still watch money markets closely, a senior bank official said on Wednesday.
The Fed's standing repo facilities should also serve as a backstop to keep markets stable as the central bank shrinks its bond holdings, said Lorie Logan, an executive vice president with the New York Fed.
""Staff will carefully monitor developments in money markets to understand changes in reserve conditions,"" Logan said during a webinar organized by New York University.
Logan reiterated that policymakers want to shrink holdings mainly by letting their securities mature.
Some officials have said the Fed may need to consider selling some if its mortgage-backed securities later to speed up the transition to a portfolio made up mostly of Treasury securities, but Logan said those decisions would be made later.
She also shared some estimates on what the balance sheet runoff could look like. For instance, principal payments from Treasury holdings could range from $40 billion to $150 billion per month, over the next few years, averaging around $80 billion.
The runoff for mortgage-backed securities could average about $25 billion per month over the next few years, but the exact pace is uncertain and affected by mortgage rates, she said.

The Fed's balance sheet doubled after the central bank purchased assets to stabilize markets and support the economy during the pandemic. Logan, who heads the New York Fed's market operations, said that asset purchases to support market functioning will be rare in the future.
""I expect circumstances warranting sizable intervention to support market functioning to be extraordinarily rare,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The World Bank said on Wednesday it had stopped all programs in Russia and Belarus with immediate effect, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and ""hostilities against the people of Ukraine.""
In a statement, the multilateral development bank said it had not approved any new loans to or investments in Russia since 2014, the year Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine.
The bank said it had not approved any new lending to Belarus since mid-2020, when the United States imposed sanctions on the country over a disputed presidential election.
The World Bank's lending commitments to Belarus totaled $308 million in 2020, according to the bank's website, with active projects including a biomass heating project, forestry development work and education modernizations.
The World Bank has loaned more than $16 billion to Russia since the early 1990s. The most recent projects approved including a youth program in the North Caucasus in 2013 and a cultural heritage program dating back to 2010, the bank's website showed.
The decision to halt all programs in Russia and Belarus came a day after the leaders of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund said they were racing to provide billions of dollars of additional funding to Ukraine in coming weeks and months, warning the war could result in ""significant spillovers"" to other countries.
The European Union, the United States, Britain and others have hit Russia with a wide range of sanctions after its invasion of Ukraine.

They have also imposed asset freezes, travel bans and other restrictions on numerous Russian individuals including President Vladimir Putin himself.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”

(Reuters) - In the U.S. Midwest one retailer planned to raise prices but did not have enough floor staff to physically change the tags.
In the South, a high-end restaurant chain let employees ""shift surf"" among the eateries it owned, tailoring their schedules and maximizing their moneymaking. But the new system left some establishments short-staffed. 
In Alaska and Utah, job candidates skipped scheduled interviews and new hires failed to show up for their first day of work.
Those stories and others were showcased in the Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book, a periodic snapshot of the U.S. economy as relayed by the central bank's business contacts from coast to coast. They highlighted how high inflation and labor shortages are colliding, sometimes producing outcomes that seem scripted for late-night talk show monologues.
The Beige Book anecdotes also show why Fed Chair Jerome Powell will go ahead with raising interest rates this month despite rising economic uncertainty from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
The main reason for the Fed's imminent move, as Powell made clear on Wednesday, is to tamp down inflation, running at three times the Fed's 2% target.
But in his monetary policy update to Congress Wednesday, Powell also flagged the ""widespread"" improvements in labor market conditions. He noted that low-wage workers alone were getting wage hikes that outpaced high inflation. 
He added that: ""employers are having difficulties filling job openings, an unprecedented number of workers are quitting to take new jobs, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years."" 
The Beige Book noted that many firms told the Cleveland Fed employee turnover was high ""for various reasons, including a greater desire to work remotely, receive higher wages, change careers, or find better working conditions.""
""Government employees may have benefits but working for lower pay than the pizza delivery guy is very demoralizing,"" a contact told the Minneapolis Fed, explaining why public sector workers are seeking other jobs.
Some firms told the Richmond Fed that even after raising pay and adding benefits, they still lost workers ""to companies who were willing to pay higher wages or were fully remote.""
By raising interest rates, Powell hopes to slow the demand for not just for goods, services and houses, but also for workers, bringing it into better alignment with the limited supply.

Businesses meanwhile were figuring out their own solutions. A transportation company in South Dakota reported turning away a ""staggering"" amount of work due to lack of staffing. 
And while one retailer enlisted corporate staff to change the in-store tags, the St. Louis Fed said, others ""reported plans to utilize electronic price tags to reduce the labor needed to change prices.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -At least five superyachts owned by Russian billionaires were anchored or cruising on Wednesday in Maldives, an Indian Ocean island nation that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, ship tracking data showed.
The vessels' arrival in the archipelago off the coast of Sri Lanka follows the imposition of severe Western sanctions on Russia in reprisal for its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. 
Late on Wednesday Forbes reported that Germany had seized Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov's mega yacht in a Hamburg shipyard.
Usmanov was on a list of billionaires to face sanctions from the European Union on Monday. A Forbes report based on three sources in the yacht industry said his 512-foot yacht Dilbar, valued at $600 million, was seized by German authorities. 
German authorities did not immediately respond to Reuters inquiries. Forbes said representatives for Usmanov did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier, the Clio superyacht, owned by Oleg Deripaska, the founder of aluminium giant Rusal, who was sanctioned by the United States in 2018, was anchored off the capital Male on Wednesday, according to shipping database MarineTraffic. 
The Titan, owned by Alexander Abramov, a co-founder of steel producer Evraz, arrived on Feb. 28. 
Three further yachts owned by Russian billionaires were seen cruising in Maldives waters on Wednesday, the data showed. They include the 88-metre (288 ft) Nirvana owned by Russia's richest man, Vladimir Potanin. Most vessels were last seen anchored in Middle Eastern ports earlier in the year. 
A spokesperson for Maldives' government did not respond to a request for comment. 
The United States has said it will take strict action to seize property of sanctioned Russians.

""This coming week, we will launch a multilateral Transatlantic task force to identify, hunt down, and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs – their yachts, their mansions, and any other ill-gotten gains that we can find and freeze under the law,"" the White House said in a tweet on Sunday.

""More than ever, in the face of rising oil prices, we need to take steps to stop fuel prices from going up,"" he wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), as crude prices surged past $110 a barrel.
One of the projects mentioned by Pacheco creates a stabilization fund for fuel prices, while the other changes the ICMS state tax calculation rules. According to the head of the upper chamber, both will be ""on the Senate agenda"" next week.
The sharp rise in fuel prices has contributed to double-digit inflation in Latin America's largest economy. President Jair Bolsonaro, who seeks to boost his popularity ahead of elections in October, has already signaled support for proposals to cut taxes on fuels. 

Economy Minister Paulo Guedes is firmly against the stabilization fund, but favors changes to the ICMS calculation. He has argued that measures could backfire if they weaken the real currency, which would push up imported products, inflation and interest.
In command of one of the most aggressive monetary tightening policies in the world, the Brazilian central bank has also said that short-term measures to tackle inflation could put upward pressure on prices over the longer term.

""There are stagflation scenarios in front of us,"" he said at an event in Lisbon. ""It will obviously depend on the duration of the conflict and the more or less concerted response (in fiscal policy) of the Europeans.""
In response to the invasion, the United States, Britain, European Union and Canada have imposed a wave of punishing sanctions on Russia, including freezing its Central Bank reserves and blocking several banks from the SWIFT international payment system.
Centeno said the various punitive measures would likely have a ""devastating impact"" on Russia's economy that would be exacerbated by the departure of several large companies. 
The war in Ukraine has disrupted the ECB's plans to prepare markets for a further curb to stimulus measures at its March 10 meeting due to mounting price pressures.

While war is likely to boost prices above all forecasts this year, it will weigh on growth and inflation in the longer term, a horizon that is more relevant for the central bank.
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 5.8% from 5.1% in January, more than twice the ECB's 2% target, data from Eurostat showed on Wednesday.

In an interview with CNN, Dias said Brazil needs to have bigger fertilizer production for a ""national security matter.""
The minister said the government expects to have the plan, which was under review by the Economy and Agriculture ministries, ready by March 17. It aims to minimize bottlenecks in terms of legislation, taxes and especially environmental issues, for the national development of the sector, she said.
Dias indicated that the plan will be important to speed up approval of environmental licenses, because in some cases ""it takes five to ten years, and investors end up giving up exploring this potential.""
Last month, head of grains-growing and trading firm Amaggi, Blairo Maggi, said the group is in talks with Canadian investor Stan Bharti to help develop the largest potash mine in Latin America, in a push to wean Brazilian farmers off costly fertilizer imports.

Brazil has fertilizer stocks that should last until October, when the harvest of the country's biggest grain crop intensifies, Dias said.
The country imports about 85% of its fertilizer consumption, including potash, which faces a bigger bottleneck due to the conflict in Ukraine and Western sanctions on Belarus, an important producer. In the case of potash, the country's foreign purchases account for 96% of consumption.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's central bank on Wednesday said pandemic shocks on inflation have been deeper and longer lasting than expected, and the bank could not rule out new price pressures caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
In a quarterly report, the Bank of Mexico, known as Banxico, said the Russia-Ukraine crisis could lead to higher commodity prices, especially for energy and agricultural products. Supply chain interruptions and higher wage costs could also lead to inflationary pressures, it said, while stressing that it is focused on monetary policy aimed at price stability. 
Banxico governor Victoria Rodriguez cautioned in a news conference that it was too early to tell how the Russia-Ukraine crisis would affect prices and inflation, but said the conflict would be one of many factors taken into consideration in monetary policy decisions. 
""We will be very attentive to how the conflict evolves. ... It will depend on the length and scope it might have,"" Rodriguez said. ""It could impact the development of both energy and grains prices.""
The central bank said it expects that inflationary pressures would diminish throughout 2022 and that annual headline inflation would average 4% in the fourth quarter and decline to near the bank's 3% target by the second quarter of 2023.
It also forecast that GDP would grow between 1.6% and 3.2% this year.

Rodriguez also noted that decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve are one of the ""relevant variables"" that Banxico takes into account in its own monetary policy decisions.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell, balancing high U.S. inflation against the complex new risks of a European land war, said earlier on Wednesday the central bank would begin “carefully” raising interest rates at its upcoming March meeting but would be ready to move more aggressively if inflation does not cool as quickly as expected.

Tenreyro said it was too soon to know how the trade-off would play out, and that policymakers would begin to review this at March's Monetary Policy Committee meeting and when the BoE next updates its forecasts in May.
""Recent developments will intensify the terms of trade shock that we were already experiencing, so will push up inflation and have a negative impact on activity. How exactly? That's the job we will start next week,"" she said at a discussion hosted by Britain's Economic Research Council.
Financial markets still expect the BoE to raise rates from 0.5% to their pre-pandemic level of 0.75% on March 17, and as high as 1.5% by August as the central bank seeks to stop surging inflation from becoming entrenched.
Tenreyro - who voted against the BoE's first post-pandemic rate rise in December due to uncertainty about the threat from the Omicron variant - said there was no good evidence that a wage-price spiral was taking root in Britain.
The BoE forecast last month that inflation would peak at 7.25% in April, before tensions between Ukraine and Russia escalated to a Russian invasion.

Tenreyro said she had been surprised by the scale of wage rises expected for 2022 in a BoE survey of companies, which exceeded other surveys, and was unsure if it would materialise.
""When you are talking about spirals, you are talking about explosive dynamics which we haven't seen yet. If anything, we are just starting the first round, so how can you talk about second round (effects)"" she said.

The court ordered Bank Audi and its peer SGBL on Feb. 28 to make the payments, amounting to about $1.1 million and $2.9 million respectively, to claimant Vatche Manoukian by March 4.
In the absence of any capital control law in Lebanon, banks began imposing informal restrictions on withdrawals and transfers abroad as the country's financial system collapsed in 2019 after years of unsustainable financial policies, corruption and waste.
These controls were never formalised with legislation and have been challenged in local and international courts, with mixed results
""The profusion of lawsuits filed by depositors against banks before Lebanese and foreign jurisdictions is a direct consequence of the mismanagement of the crisis since October 2019, and more specifically the failure to enact a most needed capital control law"", Bank Audi said.
Bank Audi said it intends to comply with the UK order but will consider its options on whether to appeal. 
Deputy Prime Minister Saade Chami said he hoped a draft law that has been with parliament for some time would be approved soon. 
“There is a renewed push to pass the capital law, even before the latest court ruling, because it is highly needed,"" he told Reuters. 
Bank Audi said the order means ""wealthy depositors who happen to be resident in the United Kingdom being able to be paid 100% of their funds out of the pockets of the remaining depositors who do not have the right or ability to bring proceedings overseas"". 
""This will significantly reduce the money available to the other depositors."" 
A lawyer for Manoukian said the decision acknowledged his client's ""legal right to transfer his money out of Lebanon"".
""This is the first case relating to the Lebanese financial crisis to be successfully brought in the UK. This decision is likely to be of interest to other English and EU domiciled individuals with funds held in Lebanese banks,"" the lawyer, Graham (NYSE:GHM) Shear, said.

SGBL has not responded to requests for comment.
A capital control law is a requirement for Lebanon to make progress in IMF talks towards an aid package.

Moscow faces harsh economic sanctions from the United States, European Union and their allies after Russia invaded Ukraine, which have hit the rouble and spurred people to pull their money out of banks. 
The central bank provided banks with $70 billion in rouble liquidity via two repo auctions on Tuesday and it plans to boost the financial system with another 6 trillion roubles via repo and deposit auctions on Thursday. 
Russian banks owe the central bank 9.6 trillion roubles in total as of Wednesday, it said, up from 8.2 trillion roubles a day before. 
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

Moscow is blocking foreign investors, who hold tens of billions of dollars worth of Russian stocks and bonds, from exiting after its invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of economic sanctions and a haemorrhage of assets.
The Bank of Russia said on Wednesday it had banned coupon payments for foreign investors holding rouble-denominated sovereign debt, known as OFZs, and Russian companies were also barred from paying dividends to overseas shareholders. It did not specify how long the curbs, which don't apply to local investors, would last.
""They have no problem with paying OFZs because they can print roubles, but they seem to have decided that foreigners won't get the money,"" said Paul McNamara, investment director at asset manager GAM Investments.
""We can argue the toss about whether that is a default or not, but it doesn't really matter because this stuff is under Russian law so they can pay them if they want to or not pay them if they can't.""
On Wednesday, Russia's finance ministry channelled 11.233 billion roubles ($107.5 million) from the state budget to coupon payouts on two OFZ treasury bond series. It was due to pay a 6.5% coupon the OFZs due to mature in February 2024. 
The ministry did not mention whether payment was made to foreign investors, which include major asset managers such as Vanguard, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Ashmore and Fidelity who held the February 2024 bond, according to data from the Refinitiv eMaxx database.
Its next payment on hard currency debt, coupons on two Eurobonds, is due on March 16.
""Issuers are eligible to take decisions on paying dividends and making payments on other securities,"" the central bank said in a statement on Wednesday. ""But actual payments ... towards foreign clients will not be made. This applies to OFZs as well.""
The National Settlement Depositary (NSD), the Russian system for overseeing the sale of securities, said it was limiting payment options on Russian securities for foreign individuals and companies, as well as a right to transfer such assets, in line with a central bank request.
The world's biggest settlement systems, Euroclear and Clearstream, are no longer accepting Russian assets, effectively shutting off an exit route for overseas investors.
Belgium-based Euroclear said in a note on Tuesday that the NSD had blocked its accounts as a result of the central bank measures.
""To the extent legally permissible, you should wire out any remaining long balances in roubles as soon as possible,"" it said.
Clearstream also informed its customers on Tuesday evening that the NSD has blocked all securities held on Clearstream Banking's FNH Account until further notice.
Foreigners held around 3 trillion roubles ($28 billion) worth of OFZs out of a total market of 15.5 trillion roubles, according to central bank data, and nearly $20 billion, or 51%, in sovereign Eurobonds. 
Foreigners held 19.7 trillion roubles in Russian shares as of July, 1, or around a third of the total market capitalisation at that time. Moscow has kept the stock market shut this week to help stem losses.
The central bank also said on Wednesday that Russian residents can no longer make foreign exchange transfers to foreigners under loan agreements. 
Russian banks and companies had $391 billion in outstanding external debt as of Oct. 1, according to Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at Locko-Invest. 
""This could be understood as a ban on servicing external loans which equals a default,"" Polevoy said. 

In a matter of weeks, Russia has gone from a lucrative, oil-rich investment destination to a financial pariah. The rouble has plunged to record lows, and in London, depository receipts for Russia's biggest bank Sberbank and gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), once Moscow's top blue chips, have lost over 90% of their value.

The unusually candid statement issued at the end of a three-day visit to Beirut by a senior delegation did not say to which members of the elite it was referring in a country where corruption and abuse of power has long been commonplace.
Allegations of financial misconduct by elites spiked following the country's 2019 financial collapse, when banks imposed tight controls on hard currency accounts for most savers but critics say some people with influence were able to more freely access funds. Banks have denied claims of favouritism towards certain clients. 
The delegation ""emphasized the need to make serious efforts to investigate those abuses, particularly by the Banque du Liban and the Special Investigation Commission,"" said the statement, referring to the central bank and an investigation unit set up to probe illicit financial activity. 
""They pressed for the appropriate authorities to conduct investigations and perform due diligence on any related transactions,"" it said. 
The Association of Banks in Lebanon (ABL) said in a statement that they were committed to contributing to fighting against corruption, which the statement said had been the focus of a meeting between ABL head Salim Sfeir and the Treasury delegation Wednesday. 
Sfeir told the delegation banks were ""continuing to use their best efforts, under the present circumstances, to exercise the adequate due diligence to control the flow of funds which goes through the system and apply the required standards of compliance,"" the statement said.

The United States is Lebanon's single-largest donor, providing more than $370 million in humanitarian aid to Lebanon in 2021 alone, according to the website of U.S. government development agency USAID.

483,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 02:09PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The conflict in Ukraine could knock $1 trillion off the value of the world economy and add 3% to global inflation this year by triggering another supply chain crisis, according to the U.K.’s National Institute for Economic and Social Research.
Supply problems will slow growth and drive up prices, reducing the level of global gross domestic product about 1 percentage point by 2023, the London-based researcher said. Europe’s ties to Russia and Ukraine, which are major sources of commodities and energy, leave it more exposed than any other region.
The war will also force European governments to borrow more to pay for an influx of migrants and strengthen their armies, NIESR added. It urged central banks to raise interest rates “only slowly while they assess the impact on confidence and activity of the war and its squeeze, through energy, on real incomes.”
“The conflict in Ukraine imposes further economic stress on a system stretched by Covid,” said Jagjit Chadha, director of NIESR. “Supply chains will be further fractured, and monetary and fiscal policies put under a severe examination.”
Russia will avoid a recession because the economic hit from sanctions will be “partly offset by higher prices for gas and oil exports.” However, GDP will be 2.6% lower than previously forecast by the end of 2023, with the collapse in the ruble driving inflation up to 20%.
The hit to Russian GDP is only marginally worse that the eurozone and the U.K., both of which will end 2023 with levels of GDP about 1.5% below previous predictions, according to the researcher. As growth slows the cost of living crisis will intensify, NIESR warned. U.K. inflation will average 7% this year and may slide to 4.4 % in 2023.
Should sanctions be escalated to cut off Russian natural gas and oil shipments, the hit to Russia would be “severe” but also increase the “the chances of recession accompanying significantly stronger inflation” in the EU. The bloc gets 40% of its gas from Russia.

LA GUAIRA, Venezuela (Reuters) - Barber Franklin Iriarte had to get creative to survive when Venezuela, reeling from a long-running economic collapse, imposed a nationwide quarantine during the COVID pandemic.
Inspired by YouTube videos of barbers in other countries, the father of two sold his car in August to buy a van that he turned into a mobile barbershop.
""I wanted a storefront, but right now what they ask for in rent is equivalent to everything you have,"" said the 38-year-old. ""I couldn't swing it.""
Iriarte, who has worked at several barbershops during his decade in the business, learned new skills to soup up the van.
He repaired, refurbished and painted it himself over several months, adding chairs and mirrors inside and installing air conditioning.
""It wasn't easy because there were moments when there was no food in the refrigerator,"" he said. ""It was between keeping food in the house and keeping the project going.""
He started to park it around La Guaira, about 30 kilometers (18.64 miles) from Caracas, in December, and now works Monday through Saturday from around 8 a.m. until as late as 9 p.m.
Venezuela's economy has been faltering for years from high inflation and sanctions against its once-prosperous oil industry, though the government has relaxed some foreign currency controls.
While public employees earn a monthly minimum wage of just $3 a month, Iriarte is able to charge $5 a cut because private sector workers generally earn more and many people receive remittances from relatives who have migrated abroad.

Even so, Iriarte said he sometimes offers free haircuts to those who cannot pay.
So far, business is good, he said. ""Thank God (the business) has been well-received.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada hiked interest rates for the first time since October 2018 on Wednesday and said they would need to go higher despite increased uncertainty following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, setting the stage for a further increase in April.
The central bank raised rates to 0.50% from a record-low 0.25%, as expected, and also said it would continue with the reinvestment phase of its bond buying program.
""Today's rate hike is the first step in the most consequential tightening cycle in decades,"" said Royce Mendes, head of macro strategy at Desjardins Group.
Central bankers around the world are racing to slow red-hot inflation with rate increases, while also trying to avoid stifling economic growth too much. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased pressure, adding to inflation while potentially weighing on growth through supply disruptions.
""The unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by Russia is a major new source of uncertainty,"" the Bank of Canada said in its rate-decision statement. ""Prices for oil and other commodities have risen sharply. This will add to inflation around the world.""
The bank said it now expects price increases to be higher in the near term than in its January forecast. Inflation surged to a 30-year high at 5.1% in January, its 10th consecutive month above the Bank of Canada's 1%-to-3% control range.
""Price increases have become more pervasive, and measures of core inflation have all risen,"" the bank said. ""Persistently elevated inflation is increasing the risk that longer-run inflation expectations could drift upwards.""

""The repeated reference of upside inflation risks ... suggests the Bank will go back-to-back with interest rates hikes at its April meeting,"" said Jay Zhao-Murray, FX market analyst at Monex Canada.
Zhao-Murray said he expects the central bank also to start reducing the size of its balance sheet in April, with Governor Tiff Macklem likely to ""lay the groundwork"" for quantitative tightening in a speech slated for Thursday at 11:30 a.m. EST (1630 GMT).
The central bank said on Wednesday quantitative tightening would ""complement"" rate increases.
The Bank of Canada also said Canada's rebound from the Omicron variant was ""well in train,"" and that first-quarter growth now looked more solid than previously projected.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen travels to Chicago on Wednesday to amplify President Joe Biden's State of the Union messages on punishing Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and advance his economic agenda, including investments in child care, education and clean energy.
The brief trip comes after Yellen spent several intensive days working with U.S. allies on crippling sanctions and asset freezes against Russia's central bank, major financial institutions, Russian President Vladimir Putin and the wealthy elites close to him, denying them access to the international financial system.
""We expect these efforts to have a debilitating impact on Russia's economy and hamstring the Russian government's ability to fund its invasion,"" Yellen said after a call on Tuesday with G7 counterparts and Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko.
Biden, in his speech on Tuesday night, closed U.S. airspace to Russian aircraft, adding: ""When the history of this era is written, Putin's war in Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.""
Yellen's actions on sanctions will resonate in the Chicago area's 54,000-strong Ukrainian-American community, one of the largest in the United States. She will meet with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who spoke on Sunday of his family's origins in Kyiv at a rally in support of Ukraine.
At the University of Illinois-Chicago's Innovation Center, Yellen also will tout big job gains and Biden's efforts to persuade Congress to pass key parts of his domestic agenda, including new investments in manufacturing research and development.
While he spoke, Yellen tweeted: ""I am optimistic about the U.S. economic recovery. President Biden’s policies will increase the productive capacity of our economy to boost long-term growth, protect the environment, and promote equity.""

Biden dropped the term ""Build Back Better"" from his speech, the name for a sweeping $2 trillion spending package that stalled at the end of last year amid opposition from moderate Democrats, premiering the new phase ""Build a Better America.""
He emphasized his focus on key elements of the previous proposal, including universal preschool, cutting child care costs for families, and clean energy tax breaks, paid for by tax hikes on the wealthy and new, 15% minimum corporate taxes.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union is excluding seven Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system that underpins global payment transactions as the West ratchets up sanctions on Russia over its attack against Ukraine.
Here is a rundown of how sanctions already announced impact banks and investors: 
WHAT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED SO FAR?
The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada committed on Saturday to removing some Russian banks from the SWIFT payments system, potentially damaging Russia as well as its trading partners.
The EU on Wednesday named the banks it was excluding: Russia's second-largest bank VTB, along with Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, Sovcombank and VEB. It is giving them 10 days to wind-down their SWIFT operations.
Sberbank, Russia's largest lender, and Gazprombank have not been included in the list because they are the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas, which EU countries are still buying. The two banks are subject to other measures, an EU official said.
EU leaders on Friday had agreed sanctions on Moscow that they said targeted 70% of the Russian banking market. 
The bloc also imposed a ban on issuing bonds, shares or loans in the EU for refinancing Alfa Bank and Bank Otkritie, after freezing assets at Rossiya Bank, Promsvyazbank and VEB earlier last week. 
Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank do not face the EU asset freeze. 
Refinancing in the EU of Russian state-owned enterprises is also forbidden, with the exception of some utilities. Securities settlement houses in the EU will not be allowed to serve Russian counterparties, with Euroclear and Clearstream saying they will not accept transactions in roubles.
The U.S. Treasury Department last week said it was targeting the ""core infrastructure"" of Russia's financial system and sanctioning Sberbank and VTB. Also on the U.S. sanctions list are Otkritie, Sovcombank and Novikombank and some senior executives at state-owned banks.
U.S. banks must sever their correspondent banking ties with Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, within 30 days. These links allow banks to make payments between one another and move money around the world. 
Officials in Washington also wielded the government's most powerful sanctioning tool, adding VTB, Otkritie, Novikombank and Sovcombank to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. The move effectively kicks the banks out of the U.S. financial system, bans their trade with Americans and freezes their U.S. assets. 
The U.S. sanctions also target two Belarusian state-owned banks - Belinvestbank and Bank Dabrabyt - over the country's support for Moscow's attack.
The British government last week said it would impose an asset freeze on all major Russian banks, including VTB, and stop major Russian companies from raising finance in Britain.
WHAT NEXT?
Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system, and sanctions on the biggest institutions are already being felt far beyond its borders -- the European arm of Sberbank has been forced to close after a run on the bank.
The U.S. Treasury said its sanctions would disrupt billions of dollars worth of daily foreign exchange transactions conducted by Russian financial institutions. Overall, these institutions conduct about $46 billion worth of forex transactions, 80% of which are in dollars.
The sanctions target nearly 80% of all banking assets in Russia.
Banks and Western creditors have feared Russia being shut out of SWIFT, which is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries.
After the EU's announcement on Wednesday, the next shoe to drop would be widening those bans to all Russian banks including those that are heavily involved in energy-related transactions.
The consequences of that are complex, however, especially for Russia's trading partners. There are concerns about how payments for Russian energy imports would be made and whether foreign creditors would get paid. 
Analysts have said that while Russian institutions are better able to cope with sanctions than eight years earlier after Russia annexed Crimea, their unprecedented scale and the coordination of current measures will hit hard. 
Shares in Sberbank and VTB tumbled before Russian authorities halted trading to prevent capital outflows. Sberbank's depositary receipts in London fell more than 90% on Wednesday.
Sberbank has previously said that it was prepared for any developments. VTB said last week it had prepared for the most severe scenario.
The Russian embassy in the United States has not replied to requests for comment.
WHICH FOREIGN BANKS ARE MOST EXPOSED?
Many foreign banks have significantly reduced their exposure to Russia since 2014 but several Western lenders have been involved in deals and have other relationships.
Shares of banks with significant operations in Russia such as Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International and France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) have fallen sharply. A European bank stocks index is down 15% since Thursday.
Raiffeisen is looking into leaving Russia, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters this week. An RBI spokesperson said it had no plans to leave Russia.
Italian and French banks each had outstanding claims of some $25 billion on Russia in the third quarter of 2021, based on Bank of International Settlement figures.

Austrian banks had $17.5 billion. That compares with $14.7 billion for the United States.

493,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 08:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank expects to raise interest rates later this month to tackle hot inflation amid a tight labor market while Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added uncertainty to the U.S. outlook.
“With inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, we expect it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at our meeting later this month,” Powell said Wednesday in remarks prepared for his appearance before the House Financial Services Committee. “The process of removing policy accommodation in current circumstances will involve both increases in the target range of the federal funds rate and reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.”
The hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. in Washington. 
Powell said the labor market is “extremely tight,” essentially a message to lawmakers that the central bank has met its maximum employment goal in current conditions, which opens the door to its inflation fight. He said employers are having difficulties filling job openings, while workers are quitting and taking new jobs helping wages rise at the fastest pace in years. 
“We know that the best thing we can do to support a strong labor market is to promote a long expansion, and that is only possible in an environment of price stability,” Powell said, restating a line he has used several times now that interprets the inflation fight in terms of preserving the expansion.
‘Highly Uncertain’
Financial markets have reeled since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, sending energy prices jumping and potentially pushing inflation higher, even as heightened tensions cloud the outlook for global growth. Even so, interest-rate futures markets are fully priced for a quarter point interest-rate increase later this month and several Fed officials speaking since the invasion have said they are still inclined to act.
Powell cautioned, however that the “near-term effects on the U.S. economy of the invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war, the sanctions, and of events to come, remain highly uncertain.”
“Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways,” he said. “We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.”
No Timing
The Fed chair gave no timing on balance-sheet reduction, a decision that is likely still pending for the Federal Open Market Committee. After rate increases start, trimming assets “will proceed in a predictable manner primarily through adjustments to reinvestment,” he said. 
Powell, whose confirmation for a second term has been stalled by Republican opposition to President Joe Biden’s selection of Sarah Bloom Raskin to be vice chair for supervision, faces the challenge of pivoting policy to confront the highest inflation in 40 years, while not tightening so much that the economy stalls. 
Critics, including some Republican lawmakers, say the U.S. central bank has been too slow to act.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Russian state-controlled media outlets RT and Sputnik will be banned in the European Union with immediate effect for systematic disinformation over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the 27-country bloc said on Wednesday in an unprecedented move.
The sanction means EU operators will be prohibited from broadcasting, facilitating or otherwise contributing to the dissemination of any RT and Sputnik content.
Broadcasting licences or authorisation, transmission and distribution arrangements between the two companies and their EU counterparts will also be suspended.
The ban applies to RT's English unit and operations in Britain, Germany, France and Spain.
""Systematic information manipulation and disinformation by the Kremlin is applied as an operational tool in its assault on Ukraine,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement. ""It is also a significant and direct threat to the Union's public order and security."" 

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, YouTube and TikTok are already blocking access to RT and Sputnik in the EU. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has said it will comply with the EU ban.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. house prices are set to climb in double digits this year even as the Federal Reserve embarks on its expected series of interest rate hikes, according to a Reuters poll of property analysts who forecast a sellers' market for another two years.
Record low interest rates and a scarcity of homes to buy, combined with unexpectedly explosive demand during the pandemic, sent the average house price up 17% last year, the strongest annual rise in at least two decades.
That has stretched affordability ever further, particularly for aspiring new homebuyers, a common theme across most developed economies as the global economy emerges from the worst of COVID-19 and central banks raise interest rates.
The Feb. 8-28 poll of 33 property analysts suggested U.S. house prices would rise 10.3% this year. That was an upgrade from 8.0% in the December poll, suggesting underlying demand for housing is still strong and housing supply is still tight.
Prices are forecast to rise 5.0% next year and 4.1% in 2024, marginal upgrades compared with 4.0% and 3.7% in the last poll.
Predictions are based on the Case/Shiller index.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing conflict has injected some caution into interest rate expectations, which could keep 30-year mortgage rates lower and in turn may leave the near-term trend largely intact.
""The recent pace of home price increase is clearly unsustainable,"" said Brad Hunter, head of independent consultancy Hunter Housing Economics, who expects just under 8% house price inflation this year, followed by 4.1% in 2023.
""The expectation is for the rate of increase to slow to a pace closer to the pace of income growth of households made up of people who are in their late 20s and early 30s. The millennials are driving the surge in demand for single-family homes. There is, however, very little risk that home prices will decline in this cycle."" 
Graphic: Reuters poll outlook on U.S. housing market: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/myvmnxaexpr/Reuters%20poll%20on%20U.S.%20house%20prices.png 
When asked what federal funds rate would bring about a significant slowdown in the housing market this year, analysts returned a median of 1.75%. That is 50 basis points above where a separate Reuters poll predicted it to end 2022, at 1.25%, and also well above money market pricing. [ECILT/US]
""We consider a funds rate above 2% to be restrictive, a rate that would slow economic growth and probably dampen housing activity,"" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at consultancy Oxford Economics, said.
In the meantime, house prices are set to keep climbing.
A like-for-like analysis showed 12 of 18 analysts had upgraded their predictions from the December poll. While four kept them unchanged, two analysts downgraded them.
Roughly 57% of analysts, or 17 of 30, predicted double-digit house price rises this year, nearly double the 30% in the last poll. All but one of 27 analysts said it would remain a sellers' market this year and will only turn in 2024.
Already at historic lows, housing inventory levels are likely to worsen as rising input costs encourage builders to build more expensive homes where profit margins are better than the starter homes which are in such high demand.
Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of total sales, were expected to average a little over 6 million annualized units this year, around where they've been over the past 19 months.

Asked to rate U.S. house prices on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 was extremely cheap and 10 extremely expensive, analysts who in most Reuters polls since 2017 had rated it 7 or below nudged the median assessment higher in the latest survey to 8.

The World Food Program (WFP) this week said the Ukraine crisis is likely to further increase fuel and food prices, especially grains, in import-dependent Yemen where food costs have more than doubled in many areas in the past year.
Russia and Ukraine account for about 29% of global wheat exports and interruption to that flow is pushing up global prices.
Conflict and inflation in Yemen have pushed millions to the brink of famine.
""People are now rushing to purchase, people are on alert, anticipating a crisis,"" said wholesaler Mohammed al-Nimri in Yemen's capital Sanaa. ""They are taking, ten, twenty sacks.""
Flour importer Mahran Al-Qadi said they had stocks, but people were panic buying. ""Some merchants have even raised prices after seeing the great demand.""
Seven years of conflict have divided Yemen between an internationally recognised government in the southern city of Aden, and the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Sanaa.
The Aden government on Tuesday held a meeting on food supplies and said there were four months of wheat and other basic goods stocks.
The Houthis' deputy industry minister Muhammad al-Hashemi told Reuters the administration had several months of wheat stocks and more were coming from outside Ukraine and Russia.
Concerns about supplies come on top of a deteriorating hunger situation in Yemen and amid a shortfall in aid funding.
The WFP has since January cut rations for 8 million of the 13 million people it feeds a month, with warnings of more cuts.

""We have no choice but to take food from the hungry to feed the starving,"" WFP head David Beasley said.

China, which has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has repeatedly criticised what it calls illegal and unilateral sanctions.

Investing.com -- The European Union has exempted two of Russia's largest banks from the sanctions it announced last week, in an attempt to ensure that European buyers can still pay for Russian commodity exports.
According to details published in the EU's Official Journal on Wednesday, state-controlled Sberbank (MCX:SBER) and Gazprombank will be allowed to continue operating through SWIFT. However, banks such as VTB and VEB will be banned from using the global payment messaging network, as will the smaller Promsvyazbank, Otkritie, Rossiya, and Novikombank.
A lack of clarity over the detail of Western sanctions has led buyers to hold off from transacting at all with Russian counterparties in recent days, and instead chase alternative sources of supply. For commodities where Russia is a globally significant exporter, such as oil, natural gas, and wheat, generated massive price spikes. According to Saxo Bank analysts, independent oil traders struggled to find anyone willing to buy Urals crude - the main Russian export blend - on Tuesday, despite offering it at nearly $20 a barrel below Brent crude. The differential between the two blends is rarely more than a couple of dollars. 
It's unclear to what extent the details published on Wednesday will mitigate such behavior.
Separately, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told MSNBC on Wednesday that the U.S. is ""very open"" to imposing sanctions on Russia's oil and gas industry, adding that the administration is still considering the possible impact on global markets and U.S. energy prices.

Investing.com -- Commodity prices skyrocket to multiyear highs as the difficulty of replacing Russian energy and grain supplies to global markets becomes apparent. OPEC is expected to steer a steady course, however, having rebuffed U.S. pressure for a bigger increase in oil output. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and a host of European Central Bank officials will talk about the impact of the war in Ukraine on the outlook for inflation and monetary policy. Eurozone inflation surges to 5.8%. ADP reports its monthly figures on U.S. private-sector hiring. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 2nd March.
1. Commodities surge
Oil and gas prices skyrocketed, with crude prices touching their highest since 2013 and European natural gas prices hitting new all-time highs on fears that Western sanctions will hit exports from Russia.
By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), U.S. crude futures were up 4.9% at $108.44 a barrel, while Brent crude was up 5.3% at $110.48 a barrel. Benchmark European gas futures were up over 30% at an all-time high.
The moves come ahead of a monthly meeting between Russia and OPEC nations to decide April output levels. They are expected to stick with their existing plan to raise output by a notional 400,000 barrels a day, the U.S.’s traditional Gulf allies having resisted U.S. diplomatic pressure for a larger increase.
Weekly U.S. inventory data are due at 10:30 AM ET, as usual.
Price spikes are also being seen in other commodities where Russia and Ukraine are major exporters. US Wheat Futures rose as much as 7.6% to their highest since 2008, while U.S. Corn Futures in Paris rose 7.5% to an all-time high.
2. Private sanctions compound difficulties for Russian economy
The imposition of official sanctions is being reinforced by a growing number of international companies cutting their links with Russia, a development that threatens to dampen global growth in the short term as well as restricting Russia’s medium-term economic potential.
The world’s largest shipping companies – Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd, MSC and CPM - have all said they will halt all non-humanitarian shipments to Russia, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Tuesday it will halt product sales there and suspend services such as Apple Pay. Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have restricted Russian banks’ access to their networks.
Russian Central Bank chief Elvira Nabiullina was quoted by newswires earlier as saying that the Russian economy is in an “extreme position”. The dollar touched a new record high of 109.59 rubles before retracing. Trading on Moscow’s stock exchanges remained suspended for a third day. The dollar also rose to a 21-month high against the euro, as investors priced in a bigger hit to the Eurozone economy. ECB President Christine Lagarde will later attend a meeting of EU finance ministers to discuss the situation.
3. Powell to testify; Lane, Nagel also weigh in
The head of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank’s chief economist will speak later, amid growing expectations that they will water down their plans to tighten monetary policy in response to the latest developments.
Jerome Powell will testify before the House Committee on Financial Services at 10 AM ET, while ECB chief economist Philip Lane speaks at 11 AM ET.  Earlier, German central bank head Joachim Nagel said that German inflation and Eurozone inflation are likely to run well ahead of prior forecasts this year, requiring a monetary policy response. 
Data released earlier showed Eurozone prices rose 5.8% on the year in February, far more than the 5.3% expected.  The U.S. data calendar for Wednesday is dominated by the ADP private payrolls report for February, which is expected to iron out last month’s blip of a 301,000 drop in private jobs.
4. U.S. Stocks set to open with modest bounce; Dollar Tree, Salesforce, SoFi eyed
U.S. stock markets are set to open moderately higher later, recouping less than half of Tuesday’s losses.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 198 points, or 0.6%, while S&P 500 futures were up in parallel and NASDAQ 100 futures were outperforming slightly with a gain of 1.8%. The three main cash indices had all lost between 1.5% and 1.8% on Tuesday.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI), both of which posted stronger-than-expected results after the close on Tuesday. Dollar Tree, Coupang, Snowflake and Abercrombie & Fitch head Wednesday’s roster for earnings releases.
5. Russian troops advance, backed by artillery barrages against cities
The war in Ukraine itself grinds on, with the Ukrainian government playing down earlier (Russian) reports of fresh peace talks.
The mayor of Kharkiv, the country’s second city, was quoted by newswires saying that Russia continues to launch indiscriminate rocket artillery strikes against it. Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed that its forces had taken the southern city of Kherson and made further progress in creating a ‘land bridge’ between eastern Ukraine and Russian-held Crimea. If confirmed, it would bring the Russian forces closer to encircling government forces fighting in eastern Ukraine. 
The UN estimates more than 600,000 refugees have fled Ukraine, most of them to neighboring Poland, Hungary, Moldova and Romania. The currencies of those countries, which have disproportionately large trade exposure to Ukraine, all remain under pressure"

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada is poised to hike its key overnight interest rate for the first time in three years on Wednesday, kicking off a string of increases geared at curbing hot inflation even as Russia's invasion of Ukraine adds to global uncertainty.
All 25 analysts polled by Reuters expect Canada's central bank to increase rates to 0.50% from the current record low 0.25% when the decision is released at 10:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT). It last hiked rates in October 2018, then slashed three times in March 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. 
In January, the Bank surprised markets by holding rates even as it said the economy had broadly recovered, taking the more measured approach of formally casting off its commitment to keep rates low and clearly signaling increases were coming.
""The Bank of Canada has been very explicit with what we should expect. They've been saying that rates are headed higher,"" said Royce Mendes, head of macro strategy at Desjardins Group. He expects back-to-back hikes in March and April.
The Ukraine conflict is unlikely to derail that, Mendes said, particularly with Canada's economic growth clocking in stronger than expected and rising oil prices set to push already hot inflation above forecast in the first quarter.
""This is coming at a time when the Bank of Canada is already concerned about inflation expectations being on shaky ground,"" said Mendes.
Canada's inflation rate hit 5.1% in January, its highest level since September 1991 and its 10th consecutive month above the Bank of Canada's 1%-to-3% control range. Deputy Governor Tim Lane said last month the Bank would be ""forceful"" in its moves.
That had some investors betting the central bank would start with an initial 50-basis-point increase. But with Russia's attack on Ukraine, markets now see 25 bps this month, with up to six hikes in 2022 back to a pre-pandemic 1.75%. [BOCWATCH]
Where the Bank of Canada could surprise markets is with its balance sheet. In January, the central bank said it would keep its holdings of Government of Canada bonds stable ""at least until"" it began to increase interest rates.
But some economists think it has already signaled an earlier start. 

Stephen Brown of Capital Economics pointed to Deputy Governor Lane saying last month that quantitative tightening would begin ""as soon as we're starting to raise rates"" and that the bank would have more to say at its March decision.
""Maybe it was just a slip of a tongue,"" said Brown. ""It would just surprise me that he said that, if the bank hadn't exactly already discussed something along those lines.""

TORONTO (Reuters) -Canada ratcheted up pressure on Russia on Tuesday for its invasion of Ukraine by shutting ports to Russian-owned ships and saying that holdings of all Russian oligarchs and companies in the country are under review.
Canada has announced a slew of measures to isolate Russia, including imposing sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin, closing Canadian airspace to Russian planes, banning oil imports and forbidding Canadian financial institutions from dealing with the Russian central bank, acting in tandem with other Western countries.
Ottawa expanded its crude oil import ban to include refined petroleum products and ""other petroleum products from Russia,"" the country's natural resources minister tweeted on Tuesday night.
Earlier, Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said that while the number of Russian ships entering Canadian waters and ports is ""small,"" there will still be an impact, especially with other countries doing the same.
Russia represents less than 2% of Port of Montreal's annual containerized volumes, and the ban will have little commercial impact, a port spokesperson said.
Port of Vancouver, Canada's busiest, said the number of Russian-flagged vessels calling there is minimal. In the past, those have traded in crude oil, canola oil and copper concentrates, a spokesperson said.
Canada is tracking three Russian-flagged vessels off the East Coast, one of which is a cargo vessel, a government official told Reuters.
Canada is also scrutinizing holdings of all Russian oligarchs and Russian companies in the country, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters on Tuesday. ""We are reviewing them and everything is on the table,"" she added.
Canada is sending 1,600 bulletproof vests and almost 400,000 meal rations to Ukraine.

Canada imported C$2.14 billion ($1.68 billion) worth of goods from Russia in 2021, Statistics Canada data showed, with metals and minerals among the most valuable categories. It imported C$289 million worth of Russian energy products last year, according to the agency.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Canada's runaway house prices will keep growing at a robust pace this year, despite several rate rises expected from the central bank, according to a Reuters poll, which also showed the likelihood of a significant correction was low.
Home prices in Canada, one of the frothiest property markets in the world, have risen for more than a decade on near-zero interest rates. That, combined with C$100 billion government aid to the economy drove bumper activity in the market even during the pandemic.
The Canadian economy likely started 2022 on a strong footing, despite the impact of the Omicron variant and protests that shut key border crossings, and home prices soared nearly 21% from a year ago in January ahead of widespread expectations for interest rate rises starting Wednesday. [CA/POLL]
Ten of 13 respondents said the likelihood of a significant correction in the Canadian housing market this year was low, including two who said very low.
""Rampant home price increases are likely to extend through the early spring. Buyers are frantic given price growth trends and low inventory, while racing against the clock as lower rate commitments come to an end,"" said Bryan Yu, chief economist at Central 1 Credit Union.
Expectations of higher interest rates this year and next, a shortage of homes, a strong labour market and higher immigration were seen as likely drivers of housing market activity in 2022.
Canada plans to welcome more than 1.3 million immigrants over the next three years, according to the government's 2022-24 Immigration Levels Plan released in February.
A Feb. 8-28 Reuters poll of property market analysts showed Canada average home prices would rise 9.2% this year, 1.5% next year and 2.0% in 2024.
That compared with a 5.0% rise in 2022, 2.0% and 2.1% in the next two years predicted in December.
""The ongoing housing supply shortage is likely to continue, continuing to put upward pressure on prices,"" wrote Christopher Alexander, president at RE/MAX Canada.

House prices in Toronto and Vancouver were expected to rise 10.0% and 6.0% this year respectively, up from 5.2% and 5.0%predicted in December and while the upswing is good for sellers, it throws challenges for buyers - specially first-timers.
First-time home buyers looking to live in Canada's biggest markets, like Vancouver or Toronto, find themselves pushed out to smaller regional areas due to record high prices.
All 15 real estate analysts who responded to another question said the housing market would not become a buyers' market this year. The consensus showed it could happen next year or later but the conviction among respondents was not strong.
""The market is so sharply tilted in sellers' favour at the moment that I think it will be balanced market, rather than a buyers' market, as interest rates rise,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics.

When asked how high would the overnight rate have to go this year to significantly slow Canadian housing market activity, the median showed 1.25%, a level the separate Reuters poll predicted it to reach later this year. Forecasts ranged between 1.00% to 3.50%.

VIENNA/SARAJEVO (Reuters) - The European arm of Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender, has been closed by order of the European Central Bank, which had warned it faced failure due to a run on deposits after Russia invaded Ukraine, Austria's Financial Market Authority said.
The European Central Bank's Single Resolution Board (SRB) determined earlier this week that Sberbank Europe, which is based in Vienna, was failing or likely to fail. That prompted Austria's FMA on Monday to impose a moratorium on the bank's activities.
The FMA's announcement late on Tuesday that it was ordering the bank to close came just over an hour before that moratorium was due to expire.
""By order of the European Central Bank (ECB), the Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) issued a decision today banning the licensed credit institution 'Sberbank Europe AG' ... from continuing business operations in their entirety with immediate effect,"" the FMA said in a statement at 10:45 p.m. (2145 GMT). 
The European Union and United States have responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with a battery of sanctions including moving to ban big Russian banks from SWIFT, the main global payments system.
As a result, Sberbank Europe said on Monday that several of its banks had ""experienced a significant outflow of customer deposits within a very short period of time"".
The SRB ordered the moratorium so that it could determine whether the case should be handled under European bank resolution rules and decided it should not, the FMA said. 
The FMA said it had appointed an administrator who is tasked with determining whether and when the criteria of an insolvency are met. In the meantime, the closure triggers Austria's deposit guarantee scheme, which covers deposits up to 100,000 euros ($111,240) per customer, the FMA said.
The central banks of Slovenia and Croatia announced that Sberbank's operations in their countries would be taken over respectively by Slovenia's biggest banking group NLB and the Croatian Postal Bank (HPB), which is majority owned by the government. 
Customers will be able to withdraw money as normal from Wednesday after restrictions over the past two days.
Sberbank Europe said in November it had reached a deal to sell its subsidiaries in Croatia, Slovenia, Hungary, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to a group including Serbia's AIK bank and Slovenia's Gorenjska bank.
Serbian regulators gave their consent on Monday but Gorenjska said it was no longer viable to proceed with the acquisition of the Slovenian subsidiary. 

Sarajevo-based ASA Banka acquired Sberbank Sarajevo, the banking agency of Bosnia’s Bosniak-Croat Federation said late on Tuesday, while the the Serb Republic government acquired Sberbank Banja Luka on Monday.

BERLIN/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Group of Seven major economies will convene a task force to focus on freezing and seizing assets of key Russian elites as it aims to put further pressure on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Tuesday.
The move ""will inflict financial pain on the powerful individuals surrounding (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and make clear that no one is beyond our collective reach,"" Yellen said in a statement after a virtual G7 meeting of finance chiefs.
The G7 will also continue to endorse removing key Russian financial institutions from the SWIFT banking system, she said, adding that the group expects that sanctions imposed so far will ""hamstring the Russian government's ability to fund its invasion.""
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
The sanctions have had an immediate impact on Russia's economy, with queues forming outside banks as Russians rush to salvage their savings. Oil company Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc on Tuesday became the latest big Western firm to pull out of the country. 
The measures limit Moscow's use of a $640 billion war chest to defend its currency but it remains to be seen whether Russia can find other channels for trade and financing of its economy. 
Notably, Chinese businesses and banks are looking for ways to limit the impact of sanctions on their relations with Russia, with settlement of transactions in yuan seen rising at the expense of the dollar.
Earlier on Tuesday, Germany's finance minister, Christian Lindner, said the G7 expected an agreement in the coming days on possible further sanctions, though he gave no details about what moves were under discussion.
""We want to isolate Russia politically, financially and economically,"" Lindner told reporters after the virtual meeting chaired by Germany.
""We had an exchange on the implementation of the current sanctions and we also exchanged proposals on what additional measures could be taken,"" he said, adding: ""And in the coming days there will be an agreement on this.""
Lindner said the impact of measures curbing the activities of the Russian central bank and excluding Russian banks from the SWIFT inter-bank messaging system had already exceeded expectations.
""The rouble is in free-fall,"" he said as the Russian currency weakened to around 112 to the dollar in trade on Tuesday.

Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said G7 capitals had stressed the need for tight coordination of their measures against Moscow during the talks, which Ukraine's finance minister, Sergii Marchenko, also joined.
Meanwhile, France's Bruno Le Maire declared an ""all-out economic and financial war"" against Russia to bring down its economy before rowing back on language he later said was inappropriate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The International Monetary Fund and World Bank on Tuesday said they were racing to provide billions of dollars of additional funding to Ukraine in coming weeks and months, adding the war there is creating ""significant spillovers"" to other countries.
IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass said the war was driving commodity prices higher, which risked further fueling inflation, and disruptions in financial markets would continue to worsen should the conflict persist. Sanctions imposed by the United States, Europe and other allies would also have a significant economic impact.
The leaders said they were deeply shocked and saddened by the war, but did not explicitly mention Russia, which is a shareholder in both institutions. Russia began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and its armed forces are bombarding Ukrainian urban areas. 
""People are being killed, injured, and forced to flee, and massive damage is caused to the country’s physical infrastructure,"" Georgieva and Malpass said in a joint statement. ""We stand with the Ukrainian people through these horrifying developments. The war is also creating significant spillovers to other countries.""
The IMF and the World Bank were urgently increasing financing and policy support for Ukraine, and had been in daily contact with the authorities on crisis measures, they said.
The IMF board could consider Ukraine’s request for emergency financing through the Rapid Financing Instrument as early as next week, they said. An additional $2.2 billion was available before the end of June under its stand-by arrangement.
The World Bank is also preparing a $3 billion package of support in the coming months, they said. That funding would start with a fast-disbursing budget injection of at least $350 million that the bank's board will consider this week, followed by $200 million for health and education programs.
Reuters first reported the $350 million loan earlier on Tuesday.

The two institutions said they were also assessing the economic and financial impact of the war and refugees on other countries in the region and the world. They said they stood ready to provide enhanced policy, technical, and financial support to Ukraine's neighbors as needed. More than 660,000 people have fled Ukraine to countries such as Poland, Romania and Hungary since the invasion began, the U.N. refugee agency said.
""Coordinated international action will be crucial to mitigate risks and navigate the treacherous period ahead,"" the institutions said.

514,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 05:54PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden plans to say the U.S. and its allies were prepared for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and said that “dictators” must pay a price for their aggression.
In his first State of the Union address whose domestic focus has been largely overtaken by the war in Europe, Biden will say that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “war was premeditated and unprovoked.”
Noting that Russia thought he would divide Europe and the U.S., Biden declared, “Putin was wrong. We were ready,” according to excerpts of his speech released by the White House. 
Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, was invited to the address, in a high-profile display of solidarity. 
“Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson – when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos,” he will say. 
Looming over Biden’s domestic woes are fears that the war in Ukraine could spiral into a wider conflict. Biden during the campaign said his decades of foreign policy experience made him best equipped to guide America’s role in the world. But the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan shook the public’s confidence in his leadership.
Biden’s speech, however, still focuses largely on domestic worries as his administration prepares for midterm elections this fall that favor the Republican Party.
The speech, Biden’s second to a joint session of Congress, comes at a perilous moment for his presidency. Most Americans remain deeply pessimistic about the direction of the pandemic-weary country and state of the economy, and harbor doubts about his leadership and that of and his fellow Democrats, polls show. 
He plans to unveil a new economic plan after his earlier proposal was rejected by Republicans and enough Democrats to doom it. “We have a choice,” Biden plans to say. “One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer. I have a better plan to fight inflation.”
He called for measures to boost U.S. manufacturing, shore up supply chains, promote renewable energy sources and reduce the federal budget deficit. Those items appeared to be aimed at moderates like West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin whose opposition to Biden’s sweeping Build Back Better agenda effectively killed the social spending plan.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An overwhelming vote by workers at a northern Mexican factory to elect an independent union, defeating an entrenched labor group, could presage more such showdowns amid growing U.S. pressure to strengthen worker rights.
Independent union SNITIS won nearly 87% of the vote at the Tridonex auto parts plant in the border city of Matamoros late on Monday, clobbering powerful union CTM, which also recently lost an election at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in the central city of Silao.
Tridonex came under U.S. scrutiny last year after U.S. unions pushed for a labor complaint under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal, saying workers had been blocked from choosing their union.
CTM's latest defeat could encourage workers at other plants in industrial Matamoros to seek new representation, say workers and experts, in line with a recent Mexican labor reform meant to give workers a stronger voice, a tenet of the USMCA.
Many workers at Tridonex, owned by Philadelphia-based Cardone, had accused CTM, one of Mexico's biggest labor groups, of failing to demand higher wages.
""Tridonex is going to push forward the entire Matamoros working class,"" said Rosario Moreno, SNITIS secretary general.
Cardone thanked workers for participating at Tridonex, which refits second-hand car parts for sale in the United States and Canada, and said it would work with the winning union once officials certify the vote.
Tridonex's longstanding union, a CTM affiliate called SITPME, declined to comment, but previously said it generates jobs and provides perks to members.
Top Biden administration officials said the vote signaled the strength of USMCA labor provisions.
For Tridonex worker Hector Manuel, the vote marked ""justice"" for colleagues who began a push to change unions two years ago. Some were fired for what they described as retaliation for their activism, beginning with wildcat strikes in 2019 at numerous Matamoros factories.
""It's a big step ... for my colleagues to be able to lose their fear and think about their futures,"" said Manuel, adding he barely gets by on a daily paycheck of 260 pesos ($12.62).
Co-worker Alejandro Rodriguez said CTM's ouster will encourage workers beyond Tridonex.
""This will motivate people to make the effort to organize,"" he said.
Labor scholar Cirila Quintero said fledging SNITIS has hard work ahead to negotiate its first contract, but its victory sends a strong message after long-simmering resentment toward CTM.

""This is a lesson to listen to workers and not belittle their claims,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Ukrainian cyber guerrilla warfare group plans to launch digital sabotage attacks against critical Russian infrastructure such as railways and the electricity grid, to strike back at Moscow over its invasion, a hacker team coordinator told Reuters.
Officials from Ukraine's defense ministry last week approached Ukrainian businessman and local cybersecurity expert Yegor Aushev to help organize a unit of hackers to defend against Russia, Reuters previously reported. 
On Monday, Aushev said he planned to organize hacking attacks that would disrupt any infrastructure that helps bring Russian troops and weapons to his country. 
""Everything that might stop war,"" he told Reuters. ""The goal is to make it impossible to bring these weapons to our country."" 
Aushev said his group has already downed or defaced dozens of Russian government and banking websites, sometimes replacing content with violent images from the war. He declined to provide specific examples, saying it would make tracking his group easier for the Russians.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
A Ukrainian defense attache in Washington declined to comment on Aushev's group or its relationship with the defense ministry. Aushev said his group has so far grown to more than 1,000 Ukrainian and foreign volunteers. 
The group has already coordinated with a foreign hacktivist organization that carried out an attack on a railway system.
After word spread of the formation of Aushev's team, the Belarusian Cyber Partisans, a Belarus-focused hacking team, volunteered to attack Belarusian Railways because they said it was used to transport Russian soldiers. 
The Cyber Partisans disabled the railway's traffic systems and brought down its ticketing website, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday. 
On Monday, a Cyber Partisans spokeswoman told Reuters the group carried out those attacks and confirmed her organization was now working with Aushev's group. 
The spokeswoman said because her group had brought down the reservation system, passengers could only travel by purchasing paper tickets in person. She sent Reuters a photo of a paper, handwritten ticket issued on Monday. 
""We fully side with Ukrainians,"" she said. ""They are now fighting for not only their own freedom but ours too. Without an independent Ukraine, Belarus doesn’t stand a chance."" 
Reuters could not confirm attacks against the Belarus railway's traffic system. The company's reservation website was down on Tuesday afternoon. A railway spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Officials at the Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a Russian news outlet on Tuesday that Russian embassies were under cyberattack by ""cyber terrorists from Ukraine."" 
Beyond striking back at Moscow, Aushev said his team would help Ukraine's military hunt down undercover Russian units invading cities and towns. 
He said his group had discovered a way to use cellphone tracking technology to identify and locate undercover Russian military units moving through the country, but declined to provide details. 

Russian troops are reportedly using commercial cell phones in Ukraine to communicate, multiple media outlets reported. 
Over the last week, numerous Russian government websites have been publicly interrupted by reported distributed denial of service (DDoS) style attacks, including one for the office of President Vladimir Putin.

Tai said the U.S. would monitor Mexico's certification of Monday's vote, which came after a settlement reached with Tridonex following a U.S. complaint filed under a labor enforcement mechanism in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.
“Workplace democracy is a cornerstone of the USMCA’s labor provisions. People on both sides of the border win when workers can choose their union representation in a free and fair manner - and without delay,” Tai said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The World Bank is pushing for ""fast-track"" approval of an additional $350 million loan for Ukraine within days, to provide emergency cash for its efforts to defend against Russia's invasion, people familiar with the plans said.
The expansion of an existing loan would provide ""budget support"" to Ukraine, leaving no restrictions on how President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's government can spend it, the sources told Reuters.
One of the sources said the loan may be ready for board consideration as early as the end of this week, while another said next week was also possible, with disbursement coming within days of approval.
They said the plan has strong support on the World Bank's 25-member executive board, despite objections from Russia's executive director. The United States and Western allies control an overwhelming majority of the development lender's voting shares.
A U.S. Treasury spokesperson declined to comment on the loan plan.
The move to quickly wire cash to Ukraine has taken on greater urgency at the World Bank since Russia invaded the country last week. World Bank President David Malpass told Zelenskiy in Munich on Feb. 19 that the organization was preparing a $350 million disbursement by the end of March, followed by other financing projects.
A World Bank spokesman declined to provide details of the plan but said: ""We are currently preparing a package of fast-disbursing financing for Ukraine, which we hope to present to our board for consideration in the coming days.""
The sources described the disbursement as a ""topping up"" that would effectively double a $350 million Development Policy Loan https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P177931 granted to Ukraine on Dec. 17 to support reforms to foster more competition in the economy, land reforms and access to credit for small farmers.
The plan would bring World Bank lending to Ukraine in the past year alone to over $1.5 billion https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/projects-list?lang=en&countrycode_exact=UA&os=0, including loans for COVID-19 response and vaccinations, power grid improvements and education. World Bank financing to Ukraine has totaled $2.3 billion since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 and nearly $14 billion since the country joined the institution in 1992.
The new financing would not add to Ukraine's policy commitments, and by expanding an existing loan, the bank can move to board approval much faster than if it were to start a completely new loan process with new program objectives, the sources said. Some of the funds for the supplement may be contributed by bilateral donor countries.
With Russia's invasion force in Ukraine growing in scale, one of the sources said the $350 million disbursement could be held back if Zelenskiy's government is deposed before the transfer is ready.
""If on the day of the disbursement, there are concerns that the funds will be misused, they will not be disbursed,"" one of the sources said. ""Unless the bank is sure that the funds will fall to the Ukrainian government, they will not be disbursed, up until the very last moment.""
The plan marks a move into ""extraordinary terrain"" in terms of speed and lending circumstances for the bank, which is better known for its post-conflict reconstruction lending, said Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and a former U.S. Treasury official. 

""It's laudable that the bank would stretch itself in this way,"" he said.
Malpass and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva also have said they are coordinating on support for Ukraine. Georgieva said on Friday that Ukraine has asked for emergency IMF financing and the Fund was exploring all options to aid the war-torn country, including through some $2.2 billion in capacity under its existing IMF loan program.

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's plan to end the loose money policies used to fight the coronavirus pandemic is facing an unexpectedly early test as the Russian invasion of Ukraine poses new economic and financial risks already being felt in global markets.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to testify before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, and his first comments on the economy in nearly five weeks will confront a situation that has become markedly more complex since January, when he outlined a straight-forward central bank effort to address high U.S. inflation.
The remedy - steadily rising interest rates, an eventual reduction in the Fed's bond holdings, and ""nimble"" attention to new data - may remain largely intact. Inflation since Powell last spoke has accelerated, and the conflict in Europe could add even more pressure with the spot price of U.S. oil jumping above $103 a barrel on Tuesday - a 17% increase since the central bank's last policy meeting in late January.
But Fed policymakers speaking Tuesday noted that the economic landscape had become far more uncertain in a short amount of time.
""Our hard job just got a whole lot harder,"" Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said at an online seminar. ""Energy is changing a lot. The ability of people and goods to move through Europe – looks like that is going to change a lot. That has implications for supply chains and a whole host of things. There is a lot we have to figure out.""
Central banks globally are facing the same dilemma as they assess the degree to which the war in Ukraine will damage growth, raise prices, or both, and how that might affect local monetary policy.
The Fed's global role and the dollar's status as a safe haven investment make the situation even more tricky for U.S. policymakers. 
Along with rising oil prices, interest rates on U.S. Treasury bonds have begun to fall - undermining what the Fed had seen as a positive trend towards higher market interest rates that would help counter inflation.
Since the start of the war in Ukraine, the yield on the two-year Treasury note, a benchmark for Fed policy, has hit as high as 1.62% but traded as low as 1.27% on Tuesday. 
Russia's increasing isolation, meanwhile, with its central bank assets frozen and other sanctions starting to bite, has driven global risk aversion higher and raised the cost of dollar funding in European credit markets.
The jump was smaller than seen at the start of the pandemic, when trading became difficult even in usually free-flowing markets like that for U.S. Treasury bonds and the Fed intervened with massive bond purchases.
Yet it is a reminder that sanctions against the Russian government will exact a potential cost in the form of slower global economic growth and increased financial stress.
Periods when rising energy prices sap consumer budgets at the same time the Fed is raising interest rates have preceded several recessions in the past, said Michael Kantrowitz, chief investment strategist at Piper Sandler, and it was now ""in the hands of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and Powell"" whether that would happen this time. 
""We already have a sharp rise in energy spending,"" he noted, and if the Fed pursues a more aggressive pace of rate hikes, ""we're likely heading for recession in 2023.""
Graphic - The Fed, oil 'shocks' and recessions: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/OIL-SHOCK/dwvkrlzaqpm/chart_eikon.jpg
Tighter funding conditions for overseas banks and companies could also make it more difficult for the Fed to justify plans to cut its own holdings of bonds until global tensions ease.
""So far all of the repricing in risk and dollar funding markets has been orderly,"" said Ed Al-Hussainy, senior analyst at Columbia Threadneedle. But the new uncertainty may test the effectiveness of Fed facilities established during the coronavirus crisis to keep financial markets running smoothly, he said.
""I think Powell sits down in front of Congress this week and says...we are 100% focused on reacting to inflation...We will support market liquidity if necessary...We will work hand in hand with Treasury to impose sanctions on Russia and make sure that the U.S. financial system has the capital and liquidity buffers to handle spillover risks,"" he said.
FOCUS STILL ON INFLATION 
Powell will testify Wednesday at 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee and at the same time on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee, one of the Fed chief's two congressional appearances coinciding with publication of a semiannual Fed review of monetary policy.
The report was released last week, shortly after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, and included one terse mention that ""recent geopolitical tensions related to the Russia–Ukraine situation are a source of uncertainty in global financial and commodity markets.""The focus of the report was U.S. inflation, now running at triple the Fed's 2% target and, according to the document, at risk of remaining higher than desired unless more people start filling the record number of open jobs, and supply chains work through a pandemic backlog. 
Powell is likely to keep much of his focus at the hearings on inflation and the need for the Fed to begin raising interest rates.
Graphic - Fed policy rate and inflation hit a record gap: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/FEDFUNDS/movandmydpa/chart.png
The current setting for the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate, effectively at zero, is out of sync with the U.S. economy's comparatively fast exit from the pandemic-induced recession of 2020. The gap between consumer inflation and the Fed's policy interest rate is the widest on record as the central bank stokes an economy enjoying fast growth, rising wages, strong consumer spending, and record demand for workers.
But recent events may temper how fast the Fed tries to catch up.
Fed officials had been sparring in recent weeks over whether to kick off the next round of interest rate increases with a larger than usual half-percentage-point increase at the central bank's March 15-16 policy meeting, a debate that showed the different strategies favored by different Fed officials https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/FED/lgpdwawwzvo/index.html.
Traders in markets linked to the Fed's policy interest rate, spurred by high inflation and earlier comments from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, were convinced as of Feb. 10 that the larger rate hike was in the works. 
Graphic - 50 basis points, there and back: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/HIKE/lbvgnzogrpq/chart.png

They now put the probability of such a hike at about 5%.
""We now know what we are dealing with: a protracted stand-off between Russia and the West. We also think it has reduced the risk of central banks slamming the brakes to contain inflation,"" the BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute said in an analysis. Interest rates ""are headed higher. Yet central banks may face less political pressure to contain inflation as the conflict becomes an easy culprit for higher prices. We believe this will allow them to move more cautiously.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders said Russia's invasion of Ukraine is likely to push Britain's soaring inflation higher, but that it is too soon to determine the impact on monetary policy.
A higher peak for inflation - which the BoE has already forecast will exceed 7% in April - would hurt incomes and spending, Saunders said in a question-and-answer session after giving a speech to the University of East Anglia on Tuesday.
""It's not clear at this stage if those recent developments have any effects on the outlook for inflation two and three years out,"" he said when asked about the invasion.
""I wouldn't want to be drawn at this stage on the question of whether there are any monetary policy implications from this.""
Investors, responding to increased tensions after the invasion, earlier on Tuesday scaled back their bets for another 25-basis-point increase in Bank Rate on March 17, after the MPC's next scheduled meeting. 
But they were still pricing in a roughly 90% chance of an increase of that magnitude, despite a slump in yields on two-year British government bonds which are sensitive to speculation about BoE rate decisions and on other maturities. 
Saunders and three other members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted last month to raise Bank Rate to 0.75% to stop the recent jump in inflation - which hit a 30-year high of 5.5% in January - from becoming a longer-term problem.
But a five-strong majority on the MPC supported a smaller 25 basis-point hike to 0.50%.
Saunders said on Tuesday that his preference was ""to move quite quickly towards a more neutral stance"" to snuff out the risks of higher inflation expectations and prevent rising pay growth from becoming more firmly embedded.
But he also said he would not necessarily vote for a 50- basis-point rate hike again in future, despite risks of ""stronger and more persistent inflation pressures"" than implied by BoE forecasts last month. 
""My preference for a 50bp hike at the February meeting does not necessarily imply that I will vote for 50bp steps in the event that rates have to rise further,"" he said.
Saunders said energy prices accounted for quite a lot of the recent inflation overshoot but there was ""significant excess demand"" in the economy and ""inflation expectations are not as well anchored as I would like"".
He said his support for a 50-basis-point rate hike last month did not imply Bank Rate would have to rise higher than the peak of just under 1.5% in the market-based yield curve that underpinned the BoE's forecasts.

""All else equal, prompt tightening now could, in my view, help limit the total scale of tightening that will be needed to return inflation to target,"" he said.
Fellow MPC member Catherine Mann, who also voted for a 50- basis-point hike last month, said on Tuesday that the BoE had to ensure the current surge in energy prices does not feed into businesses' longer-term pricing decisions.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve and some of its major central banking peers will press ahead with lifting interest rates this month, money markets suggest, even as a war on Europe's eastern flank complicates the picture for inflation and economic growth.
The situation is fluid, with rate futures and bond prices whipsawed by conflicting impulses and no indication of which could gain the upper hand: a war that threatens to undercut a global economic recovery or the inflation unleashed by an oil price surge that will be hard for central bankers to overlook. 
Still, expectations of big rate hike bets have fallen by the wayside, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sanctions slapped on it by Western powers. 
The subsequent bond rally, caused also by an influx of safety-seeking cash, has driven German 10-year yields back below 0% on Tuesday, while their U.S. counterparts have dropped some 30 basis points (bps) from the 2%-plus levels touched two weeks ago.
Wednesday brings the first real test of March when the Bank of Canada (BoC) is expected to stick to its guns and deliver a quarter point rate rise - its first since 2018. 
The BoC has pledged to be ""forceful"" in tackling inflation, running at 30-year highs just above 5%. So markets see a 90% chance of a 25 bps increase this month.
The five to six hikes priced for 2022 are slightly less aggressive than a couple weeks ago, when six to seven moves were expected. [BOCWATCH]
The Federal Reserve and Bank of England (BoE) are also forecast to raise rates by a quarter point mid-March. But before the Ukraine crisis erupted, markets saw a high probability both would opt for half-point moves. 
Money markets now predict fewer than six, 25 bps Fed rate hikes in total this year, compared to mid-February expectations for a total 175 bps of tightening.
Jim Caron, chief fixed income strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management, called the latest events ""a double-edged sword,"" given the inflation threat from higher oil prices and the possible hit to economic growth from war. 
""There has been a recalibration of rate expectations and that has become very apparent with the pricing out of a 50 bps (Fed) hike for March,"" Caron said. 
""So, the question becomes one of trying to figure out what it means for the Fed."" 
The dilemma is less acute for the Fed than European peers, given Russia-linked growth setbacks are less likely in the United States. And U.S. inflation is at 40-year highs above 7%, while latest data showed unemployment rolls shrinking to levels last seen in 1970.
BACKS AGAINST THE WALL
Britain faces a similar inflation dilemma, with the added complication of an energy-linked hit to growth. 
On Tuesday, 25 bps rate rises were almost fully priced in for the BoE meetings in both March and May, although markets now see a roughly 10% change it may not tighten policy this month - an element of doubt that has only recently crept in. 
A total of four quarter-point rate rises are now factored in for 2022, versus five late last week and six in mid February.
""Different central banks are in different boats but the Fed and Bank of England have their backs up against the wall,"" senior Mizuho economist Colin Asher said. 
""When inflation is 6% to 7%, inactivity is not an option.""
British annual consumer price inflation (CPI) hit 5.5% in January, the highest since 1992. While the BoE expects CPI to peak around 7.25%, Citi economists reckon it could reach 8.1%. 
British government bonds have reacted far more than money markets, with two-year yields down 40 bps since Friday's close at around 0.8%. They hit an 11-year high of 1.565% on Feb. 16. The fall in yields since the announcement of sanctions against Russia is the sharpest since just after June 2016's Brexit referendum.
Norway is also expected to raise rates on March 24.
DOVES, HAWKS, DOVES AGAIN 
Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation,"" even dovish banks were under pressure from inflation. 
While the Reserve Bank of Australia kept rates steady as expected on Tuesday, it hinted that uncertainty caused by war could be reason to be patient with tightening. 
As for the European Central Bank (ECB), inflationary pressures are building - German CPI soared past 5% in February - but so are economic growth risks.
ECB chief economist Philip Lane has said the conflict may reduce euro zone economic output by 0.3%-0.4% this year.
While the bank had been preparing markets for a further stimulus cut at its March 10 meeting, rate hike bets are shrivelling. Just under two, 10 bps moves are priced for 2022, versus 50 bps shortly after the Feb. 3 ECB meeting.

Finally, the dash for safe assets has halted the rise in longer-dated Japanese bond yields - a headache for the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which targets 10-year yields in a band around 0%. 
""The pressure is off the BOJ as things have moved in their direction,"" Mizuho's Asher said of the March 18 BOJ meeting.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Reserve on Tuesday proposed a tiered framework for reviewing applications to obtain a master account with the U.S. central bank as part of an effort to ensure ""transparent and consistent"" review of those applications.
The proposal would establish a streamlined review process for federally insured institutions that are seeking such accounts, which grant firms access to Fed payment services.
The strictest review would be reserved for firms, like many fintechs, that are not insured and are not directly supervised by banking regulators. The proposal includes a middle ground of moderate review for firms that are not insured but are supervised by banking regulators.
The proposal supplements a May 2021 proposal intended to provide a framework for such accounts. The Fed said the addition is meant to provide more clarity, and comes as a host of nontraditional financial institutions and fintech firms have entered the marketplace.
""With technology driving rapid change in the payments landscape, the proposed guidelines would ensure novel requests for access to Federal Reserve accounts and payment services are evaluated consistently and transparently to ensure a safe and innovative payment system,"" said Governor Lael Brainard in a statement.
The proposal comes one day before Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is due to begin two days of testimony before Congress, and as fintech firms have complained that they are unable to gain access to the Fed's payments system. 
It also comes as Powell's nomination to a second term as the Fed chief, along with the nomination of four others to the Fed's board, are stuck in limbo. Senate Republicans on the Banking Committee in February refused to attend a vote to advance the nominees as part of a fight over Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Joe Biden's nominee to serve as the Fed's top Wall Street regulator, whom Republicans have suggested inappropriately lobbied on behalf of a fintech firm, Reserve Trust, on whose firm she sat. Republicans have also attacked her over past statements expressing support for using financial rules to police climate change.

Republicans, led by Senator Pat Toomey, have questioned Raskin's previous work on the board of Reserve Trust, which obtained a Fed master account, and insisted she has not been sufficiently responsive.
Democrats, including the White House, have defended Raskin, who previously held top posts at the Fed and Treasury Department, and said she complied with all ethics laws in her work.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The National Bank of Hungary (NBH) is ready to intervene ""at any moment"" with all tools at its disposal to ensure the stability of local financial markets, it said in a reply to Reuters questions on Tuesday, reining in the forint from record lows.
The NBH raised its base rate by 50 basis points to 3.4% last week, as expected, after consumer prices grew at their fastest rate in almost 15 years in January and mounting Ukraine-Russia tensions fuelled market uncertainty.
The NBH said it was closely monitoring the situation, adding that current market moves were not justified by economic fundamentals after the forint fell as much as 2% on the day to record lows versus the euro.
""It is the NBH's clear intention to prevent the heightened risks stemming from geopolitical circumstances from threatening Hungary's price and financial stability,"" it said.
""Financial market moves are not justified by fundamentals, however, they add to upside risks for inflation.""
Deputy Governor Barnabas Virag told private broadcaster Info Radio in an interview that the NBH must continue its monetary tightening cycle in a predictable way, but also stand ready to act in a flexible manner, if needed.
""The situation will be more difficult throughout the year because of the war,"" Virag said. ""We must prepare for an increase in inflation risks and a deterioration of the economic growth outlook.""
Virag said given the high degree of uncertainty over the outcome of the military conflict, it was not possible to give predictable economic forecasts, adding that the road back to the bank's 3% inflation target will be a long one.
Earlier on Tuesday, economists at Raiffeisen Bank sharply raised their inflation forecasts for Hungary to 9% this year and 7% for 2023, with the average rate for two years projected at the highest for the entire Central European region.
""The National Bank of Hungary is closely monitoring the situation and stands ready to intervene at any moment,"" it said. ""If necessary, the NBH will use all tools at its disposal to ensure the stability of local financial markets.""
The war over the eastern border in neighbouring Ukraine, home to a large ethnic Hungarian community, has hammered Hungarian financial markets.
The forint has fallen some 4% versus the euro since Russia invaded Ukraine last week, sinking to record lows at 379 per euro on Tuesday. The currency pared some of its losses after the central bank remarks, but was still down more than 1% on the day, extending its losses for the year.

Shares in central Europe's largest independent lender, OTP Bank, plunged 21.5% on Tuesday, hitting their lowest level since November 2020. The bank's shares have lost about a third of their value since Russia invaded Ukraine last week.
The NBH's next regular policy meeting is due on March 22. It will hold a non-rate setting meeting next Tuesday, while the weekly tender of its one-week deposit facility, which it uses to tackle short-term market volatility, is due on Thursday.

The decision applies to smaller banks that fall under the Bank of Italy's oversight and reflects a similar move taken earlier by the European Central Bank for bigger lenders.
The Bank of Italy said smaller lenders would no longer benefit from capital relief measures beyond Dec. 31, 2022 while a liquidity relief measure would end on March 15.
Given the uncertainty weighing on the macroeconomic outlook, the Bank of Italy said it would continue to monitor banks and maintain prudent payout policies.

Russia's huge sovereign wealth fund will also be pressed into action, spending up to 1 trillion roubles ($10.3 billion) to buy shares in Russian companies, a government decree showed, confirming an earlier report by Reuters. 
""In the current sanction situation foreign entrepreneurs are forced to be guided, not by economic factors, but to make decisions under political pressure,"" Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin told a governmental meeting.
""In order to give business a chance to make a considered decision, a presidential order was prepared to impose temporary curbs on exit from Russian assets,"" he said, without giving details. 
Russian authorities are hurrying to respond to increasingly harsh sanctions imposed by Western nations since Moscow invaded Ukraine last Thursday.
The measures range from curbs on the central bank's ability to use its gold and foreign exchange reserves to the exclusion of big Russian banks from the international financial system. 
On Monday, a plunge in the rouble to all-time lows forced the central bank to hike its key interest rate to 20% and ask exporting companies to sell forex to support the currency.
Global companies which have operated in Russia for decades have said they will halt investments, including BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa), shareholders respectively in Russia's top energy company Rosneft and Sakhalin 2 LNG plant.
Mishustin said Russia was ""open to dialogue with constructively-minded investors"" and that: ""We expect that whose who invested into our country will be able to work here further on."" 
On Tuesday, Connecticut Treasurer Shawn Wooden said he would direct the U.S. state's pension funds to sell Russian assets, for moral reasons and to reduce investment risk in the state retirement funds, worth more than $47 billion in all.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" designed not to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
The Institute of International Finance (IIF), a trade group representing large banks, has warned that Russia is extremely likely to default on its external debts.

With Moscow's battered stock market closed for a second day on Tuesday, Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman, who has been sanctioned by the European Union, warned that exiting Russian assets might prove difficult even without the temporary ban.
""I don't think we would be able to divest assets in Russia right now because there are no buyers for the time being,"" Fridman told reporters in London.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Canadian economy mostly likely started 2022 on a strong footing, despite the impact of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, while fourth-quarter growth came in above expectations, official data showed on Tuesday.
Canada's economy grew 6.7% in the last three months of 2021 on an annualized basis, beating analyst forecasts of 6.5%, while gross domestic product in January most likely rose 0.2% after stagnating in December, Statistics Canada data showed. 
With January's gain, which is a preliminary estimate, economic activity is now 0.6% above pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said. 
""While the clouds darkened a bit before the end of the year ... GDP posted a surprising 0.2% advance in January despite the Omicron wave and all of the associated job losses,"" said Royce Mendes, head of macro strategies at Desjardins Group.
""The economy likely built on that momentum in February, as the latest COVID wave turned a corner, which allowed for more reopenings across the country,"" he added.
The strong fourth-quarter print came in above the Bank of Canada's own forecast in January of a gain of 5.8%. The Canadian central bank is broadly expected to raise its key interest rate to 0.50% when its meets on Wednesday.
With the Canadian economy strong and set to be boosted by higher oil prices, the central bank is unlikely to change course on its signaled increases even amid increased uncertainty following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, economists said.
""So far I don't see the war in Ukraine as being enough to derail those prospects, and so I expect we'll hear the Bank of Canada guide that they are on the path toward a series of hikes tomorrow,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of Capital Markets at Scotiabank.

Canada's economy grew 4.6% in 2021, in line with Canadian government forecasts for the year.
The Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1.2679 to the greenback, or 78.87 U.S. cents.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's economy grew 6.6% last year following a record contraction of 9.0% in 2020, while the budget deficit and public debt came in below government targets, statistics bureau ISTAT reported on Tuesday.
For the third year in a row, Rome's fiscal deficit was significantly lower than official forecasts, as three different governments have overestimated the cost of measures designed to increase welfare provision and support the economy.
The 9.0% contraction in gross domestic product in 2020, caused by extended coronavirus lockdowns, was marginally revised from a previously reported -8.9%.
The rebound last year was stronger than initially expected by the government, which repeatedly revised up its GDP forecast during the course of the year. 
The final outturn of 6.6% was above the latest official target of 6.0% made last September and also slightly higher than the most recent indication of 6.5% given by Economy Minister Daniele Franco. 
This year, Prime Minister Mario Draghi's coalition government has penciled in growth of 4.7%, but the outlook has been clouded by a surge in energy prices and geopolitical turmoil connected to the war in Ukraine.
Moreover a resurgence of the coronavirus at the start of this year is expected to have crimped growth in the first quarter, getting the year off to a weak start.
In recent comments, ministers have insisted growth will still be above 4%.
Italy's budget deficit came in at 7.2% of GDP last year, ISTAT said, well below the official target of 9.4% and down from the 2020 ratio of 9.6%.
""Growth was stronger than we expected early in the year and that meant tax revenues were more than 20 billion euros ($22.31 billion) higher than we budgeted for,"" said a government official close to the matter, asking not to be named. 
In addition, spending was below target by more than 10 billion euros due to lower outlays on salaries, public procurement, welfare, and subsidies to businesses hit by COVID-19 restrictions, the official said.
Draghi is targeting the deficit to fall to 5.6% of GDP this year.
The public debt - proportionally the highest in the euro zone after Greece's - fell to 150.4% of GDP in 2021 against a government target of 153.5%. That was down from a record high of 155.3% in 2020.

A further reduction to 149.4% is targeted for this year.

532,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 09:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will try to reassure lawmakers this week that the central bank will act to curb the hottest inflation in four decades while remaining flexible in the face of uncertainty posed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Powell, in semiannual monetary-policy testimony to House and Senate panels starting Wednesday, is likely to signal the U.S. central bank will go ahead with plans for raising interest rates in March, with traders parsing his comments for hints of a potential half percentage-point move.
At the same time, he may acknowledge the risks created by the conflict, which has triggered one of the worst security crises in Europe since World War II and caused oil prices to jump -- are complicating the Fed’s job.
Officials have to contend with potentially stagflationary fallout from the invasion. Higher oil prices could dim demand by denting spending power if that leads to higher prices at the gas pump, but will also push headline inflation higher.
Adding to the uncertainty is Powell’s own position: He’s currently serving as chair “pro tempore” while awaiting Senate confirmation to a second term. His and other Fed nominations remain stalled over Republican opposition to President Joe Biden’s pick of Sarah Bloom Raskin for Fed vice chair of supervision.
 
 
“Powell will be teeing up liftoff, but also he is going to convey a high sense of uncertainty,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., who’s predicting a quarter-point move in March. “He needs to give a balanced talk that expresses concern about inflation and recognizes the strength in economic growth but says we don’t need to rush and there are uncertainties out there.”
Fed officials in the wake of the Russian invasion have signaled their readiness to raise interest rates when they meet March 15-16 to confront inflation, while keeping their options open on how far or how fast they move following liftoff.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“Bloomberg Economics expects Powell to sound vigilant on inflation, but ultimately favor the gradualist approach to rate hikes due to elevated market uncertainty from the Russia-Ukraine crisis. He will not provide an explicit endorsement of a 50-basis-point hike for the March meeting, in our view. Bloomberg Economics expects the Fed to deliver a 25 basis-point hike in March.”
--Anna Wong, Yelena Shulyatyeva, Andrew Husby and Eliza Winger (Bloomberg economists)
--To read the note, click here 
The Ukraine crisis could put Powell in a difficult spot because rising prices of oil and other commodities could push the annual inflation rate higher than the 7.5% reading for January, while trimming U.S. growth as it hurts spending of consumers. Oil prices have surged in the wake of Russia’s attack.
“This is the Fed’s nightmare scenario, as we are pouring fuel onto an already well-kindled fire of inflation,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist for consultancy Grant Thornton. “The situation has eerie similarities to the 1970s, with external oil shock threatening a more entrenched and vicious inflation cycle.”
Traders and economists alike still see the Fed kicking off rate hikes in March and a quarter-point increase is fully priced in. But bets of a bigger half-point move have been scaled back drastically as investors assess the likely impact of the Russian aggression on growth and Fed policy in the months ahead.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic on Monday said that he is still in favor of raising rates by 25 basis points in March and was open to discussing a 50 basis-point increase if inflation data between now and the meeting comes in too hot.
Officials left rates near zero in January but said they were ready to raise them “soon.” Powell’s post-meeting press conference was viewed as as hawkish at the time, leading some investors to anticipate a half-point move, but he was expected to strike a more careful tone during his testimony.
“He will be more cautious given the financial market nervousness created by the Russian military assault and this will likely cement expectations for a 25 basis point rate increase,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.
Data on Friday showed the Fed’s preferred gauge of price pressures rising 6.1% in the 12 months through January -- three times the 2% target and the most since 1982. Another measure, the consumer price index, has shown a larger 7.5% gain, and the February CPI report will be released March 10. Officials get another important piece of evidence Friday with the February employment report.
While inflation will be a focus, lawmakers could also ask Powell about the role of the Fed in implementing sanctions on Russians through the central bank’s payment system, said John Silvia, founder of Dynamic Economic Strategy and former chief economist at the Senate banking panel.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen must block Russia from exchanging the $17 billion in International Monetary Fund reserves it received last year and oppose any further such IMF allocations, U.S. Republican lawmakers said.
The 41 lawmakers said in a letter to Yellen that the $650 billion allocation of Special Drawing Rights to IMF members had undermined previous sanctions on Russia even before it invaded Ukraine. 
""The hostile invasion of Ukraine this week demonstrates why the IMF should never have approved its latest $650 billion general allocation of SDRs in August 2021,"" the lawmakers said in the letter dated Feb. 28.
All IMF members received SDRs - backed by dollars, euros, yen, sterling and yuan - in proportion to their shareholding in the Fund in the distribution aimed at helping poorer countries fight the COVID-19 pandemic. But to spend the $17 billion in SDRs it received, Russia would need to find a partner country willing to exchange them for underlying currencies in the form of an interest-bearing loan. 
The United States and Western allies have imposed sanctions on Russia's central bank aimed at neutralizing Moscow's $640 billion reserves, which would make such a transaction difficult and subject the counterparty to sanctions as well. 
But the lawmakers used the invasion to repeat their longstanding criticism of the SDR allocation, which also provided SDRs to China and Iran. They said Yellen should press IMF members to formally agree not to exchange Russia's SDRs, and should oppose further allocations because they would grant more assets to Moscow.
""We cannot allow these reserve assets to help the regime withstand the latest sanctions announced by the President, let alone offer additional billions through further allocations,"" wrote the lawmakers, led by Representative French Hill of Arkansas and Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee.
The lawmakers also said that Yellen and U.S. allies must plan for contingencies to block a bailout if an economically weakened Russia is forced to turn to the IMF for future loans.
""As the largest shareholder of the IMF, the United States has a responsibility to ensure that the Fund is not misused to support Russia's warmongering in Ukraine,"" the lawmakers wrote.
A U.S. Treasury spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
But Mark Sobel, a former Treasury and IMF official, said that $17 billion in SDRs was a pittance compared to Russia's $630 billion in foreign currency reserves, most of which are now locked up by Western sanctions against Russia's central bank. 

""I think Russia's SDRs are fairly irrelevant and meaningless in the bigger scheme of things,"" said Sobel, now U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum think tank.
""China and Russia have little use for their SDRs,"" while Iran ""doesn't appear to have touched its 2021 SDR allocation"" he added.

534,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 07:51AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China and Russia have grown increasingly close in recent years, including as trading partners, a relationship that brings both opportunities and risks as Russia reels from tough new sanctions led by the West in response to its invasion of Ukraine.
Total trade between China and Russia jumped 35.9% last year to a record $146.9 billion, according to Chinese customs data, with Russia serving as a major source of oil, gas, coal and agriculture commodities, running a trade surplus with China. 
Since sanctions were imposed in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea, bilateral trade has expanded by more than 50% and China has become Russia's biggest export destination. 
A related graphic: China's trade with Russia: https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/xmvjoerqapr/chart.png 
The two were aiming to boost total trade to $200 billion by 2024, but according to a new target unveiled last month during Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to Beijing for the Winter Olympics, the two sides want bilateral trade to grow to $250 billion.
As sanctions against Russia mount, China could offset some of its neighbour's pain by buying more, but would also be wary of running foul itself of potential sanctions.
Below are key areas of trade cooperation between China and Russia. 
OIL AND GAS 
Exports of Russian oil and gas to China have steadily increased. Russia is China's second-biggest oil supplier after Saudi Arabia, with volumes averaging 1.59 million barrels per day last year, or 15.5% of Chinese imports. 
About 40% of supplies flow via the 4,070-km (2,540-mile) East Siberia Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline that was financed by $50 billion in Chinese loans.
Russia is also Beijing's No. 3 gas supplier, exporting 16.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) of the fuel to China in 2021, meeting about 5% of Chinese demand. 
Supplies via the Power of Siberia pipeline, which is not connected to the network of westbound Russian gas pipelines, began in late 2019 and are due to rise to 38 bcm a year by 2025, up from 10.5 bcm in 2021, under a 30-year contract worth more than $400 billion. 
Russia aims to build a second gas pipeline, Power of Siberia 2, with capacity for 50 bcm a year to run via Mongolia to China.
Russia was also China's No. 2 coal supplier in 2021. 
Last month, Putin unveiled new Russian oil and gas deals with China worth an estimated $117.5 billion.
FOOD TRADE 
Russia's food trade with China is small but expanding.
In 2019, China allowed the import of soybeans from all regions of Russia, and the two countries signed a deal to deepen cooperation in soybean supply chains, which saw more Chinese firms growing the beans in Russia.
Soybean exports to China stood at 543,058 tonnes last year and are expected to reach 3.7 million tonnes by 2024.
In 2021, China approved beef imports from Russia, while last Friday, it allowed imports of wheat from all regions of Russia. 
Other food exports from Russia to China include fish, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, poultry, wheat flour and chocolate. 
China is also a huge buyer of timber from Russia's Far East, with imports of timber and related products worth $4.1 billion last year. 
In the other direction, China sells mechanical products, machinery and transport equipment, mobile phones, cars and consumer products to Russia. Chinese exports to Russia stood at $67.6 billion last year, up 34%. 
INVESTMENT 
Western sanctions have forced Russia to look toward China for investment opportunities in recent years, and Chinese state banks have helped Russia finance everything from infrastructure to oil and gas projects under China's Belt and Road Initiative. 
Russia is by far Beijing's largest recipient of state sector financing, securing 107 loans and export credits worth $125 billion from Chinese state institutions between 2000 and 2017, data from the College of William and Mary's AidData research lab showed. 
China and Russia began using their own currencies to settle bilateral trade in 2010 and opened their first currency swap line in 2014, which they renewed in 2020 for 150 billion yuan over three years. 

Yuan settlements accounted for 28% of Chinese exports to Russia in the first half of 2021, compared with just 2% in 2013, as both countries seek to ease reliance on the dollar while developing their own respective cross-border payment systems.
The Chinese currency accounted for 13.1% of the Russian central bank's foreign currency reserves in June 2021, compared with just 0.1% in June 2017, with Moscow's dollar holdings dropping to 16.4% from 46.3% in the same period.

Investing.com -- Ceasefire talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials have failed to end the conflict, and U.S. stocks are expected to open lower as a result, while crude oil surges past $100 a barrel once more. The number of companies taking a stand against Russian aggression is rising, and focus will turn Tuesday to U.S. President Biden's State of the Union speech. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 1st March. 
1. Ceasefire talks fail; Companies pull out of Russia
Faint hopes that talks last night between Russian and Ukrainian officials near the Belarusian border could result in a ceasefire have been dashed as they ended without a breakthrough, and negotiators have not said when a new round would take place.
Meanwhile, Russian troops have escalated shelling of key cities in Ukraine, while they move slowly in a large convoy toward the capital, Kyiv, seemingly tightening their grip on the country.
The corporate world is starting to show its displeasure at the invasion, cutting ties with Russia and reversing around 30 years of investment by foreign businesses there, following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
BP (NYSE:BP), Russia’s largest foreign investor, started the ball rolling by announcing on Sunday that it would exit its 20% stake in state-controlled Rosneft (OTC:OJSCY), at a cost of around $25 billion.
U.K. peer Shell (LON:RDSa) followed suit on Monday, ending partnerships with state-controlled Gazprom (OTC:OGZRY). TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE) said it will no longer provide capital for new projects in Russia, while Daimler Truck (DE:DTGGe), the world’s largest truck maker, said it will stop its business activities in Russia until further notice.
Other companies with major links to Russia, including the likes of  Renault  (PA:RENA), Ford (NYSE:F), Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY), and  Danone  (PA:DANO), will be under increasing pressure to make a stand, especially as their stock prices head south rapidly. 
2. U.S. ISM manufacturing PMI due
The main U.S. economic data due for release Tuesday is the ISM manufacturing purchasing managers index for February, which is expected to show, at 10 AM ET (1500 GMT), the sector continuing in strong expansionary territory, up 58.0 from 57.6 in January.
The Federal Reserve holds its next policy-setting meeting later in March and is expected to start raising interest rates to combat soaring inflation, particularly as the economy continues to show strong growth.
Earlier in the day Chinese factory activity recorded an unexpected expansion in February, with the manufacturing PMI coming in at 50.2, above the 50-point mark indicating growth, as well as the expected 49.9 and January’s 50.1.
In Europe, the key German manufacturing sector contracted slightly in February, with the PMI falling to 58.4 from 59.8 in January, but remained strongly in expansion territory.
3. Stocks set to open lower; Target results due
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower as investors react to the failure of Russia/Ukraine ceasefire talks with Russia’s invasion of its southern neighbor intensifying. 
By 5:10 AM ET (1010 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 205 points, or 0.6%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.7% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.7%.
In a volatile session on Monday, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 170 points, or 0.5%, the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4%.
Investors are preparing to hear from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in his semiannual hearing on Capitol Hill, which begins on Wednesday, and ahead of there is the start of a big week for retail earnings from department stores and discount stores.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) gets the ball rolling before the bell, while cloud giant Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) reports after the close. 
Additionally,  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) stock traded substantially lower in premarket Tuesday after the video conferencing company posted a disappointing outlook.
4. State of Union speech
U.S. President Joe Biden is set to make his State of the Union address later Tuesday, needing to reconnect with the public as his approval ratings have dropped sharply as families struggle with rising inflation, driven in part by higher energy prices.
""The president will call on Congress to send him a bill that lowers costs and lowers the deficit without delay,"" the White House said in a preview of the speech. ""American families need relief from higher costs, and they need it now.""
His ‘Build Back Better’ social-spending agenda has stalled in Congress, and this is likely to result in Biden pivoting to addressing inflation and budget deficit worries via a four-point plan: moving goods cheaper and faster; reducing everyday costs; promoting competition; and eliminating barriers to jobs.
The annual consumer price index came in at 7.5% in January, the biggest year-on-year increase since February 1982, while Biden's approval rating was last at 43%, according to polls from Reuters/Ipsos, near to the lowest level of his presidency. 
5. Brent pushes past $100/barrel
Crude oil prices pushed higher, with the global benchmark Brent trading over the $100 a barrel level, on concerns that the sanctions levied on Russia, the second largest crude producer in the world, will lead to a substantial disruption in supplies.
Major oil and gas companies, including BP and Shell (BS:SHELl), have already announced plans to exit Russian operations and joint ventures, and they are likely to be joined by other Western companies, deeming Russia’s actions in invading Ukraine unacceptable.
These concerns have outweighed talk that the United States and allies have been discussing a coordinated release of crude stocks to mitigate this supply disruption.
The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute releases its estimate of weekly U.S. crude inventories later in the session. 
Attention will also be on an extraordinary ministerial meeting of the International Energy Agency later Tuesday, and then Wednesday’s gathering of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, to discuss future production levels.
By 5:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 3% at $98.60 a barrel, after settling more than 4% higher on Monday, while Brent crude futures were up 3.6% at $101.41 a barrel, not far off the seven-year high of $105.79 reached last week.
Gasoline RBOB Futures were up 2.8% at $3.0130 a gallon.",,,,,

Foreign trade, which helped drive the world's second-largest economy last year, will be confronted by uncertain external demand and a high statistical base from 2021, said Commerce Minister Wang Wentao. 
""This year, the pressure on foreign trade will be huge and the situation will be very severe,"" Wang said at a press conference. 
Labour shortages and high raw material costs have also heaped pressure on the ability of China's small and medium-sized companies to handle overseas orders, he said.
Given the global uncertainties, China must ""do everything possible"" this year to spur domestic consumption, Wang said. 
Last year, the Chinese economy rebounded with its best growth in a decade, helped by robust exports and a resulting record trade surplus. But there were signs that momentum was slowing on weakening consumption and a domestic property downturn.
In December, retail sales grew 1.7% from a year earlier, missing an average forecast of 3.7% and slowing from November's 3.9% gain. 
Some recovery momentum was seen in consumption in February after downward pressure since the fourth quarter, Wang said.
Stability in all aspects of society is the watchword in China this year as the Communist Party gathers for a once-in-five-year congress in late 2022. President Xi Jinping is expected to claim his third term as leader of the party. 

China will aim to broaden access to its markets and draw more foreign investment into the country's industrial sector, including advanced manufacturing and strategic new industries, Wang said. 
Foreign direct investment grew in the double-digits in January-February, he said.

Speaking shortly after his online talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Suzuki said both sides agreed to continue to coordinate with each other in acting against Russia, which invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The fact that Russian central bank raised interest rates showed that sanctions were having an impact, he added.
Yellen pledged to work closely with Japan and other G7 wealthy democracies to isolate Russia from the global financial system and ""impose maximum costs"" on Moscow, the U.S. Treasury said in a statement after her call with Suzuki.

G7 finance ministers are due to meet virtually on Tuesday to discuss the financial sanctions against Russia.

""We're watching that vote extremely closely,"" Tai said after an event at Morgan State University in Baltimore. ""We obviously have an outsized interest in terms of what happens, given the earlier agreement that we secured from the company in terms of their participation in future elections.""
Nearly 1,700 workers at the Tridonex auto-parts plant are scheduled to vote on Monday on their union representation after two years of campaigning by some workers to replace a union that they accused of failing to push for higher wages.
Tridonex in August agreed to ensure worker rights, pay severance and back wages to dismissed employees to settle an early labor rights complaint under a labor enforcement mechanism in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
The AFL-CIO labor organization had filed a complaint with the USTR after Tridonex workers said they were being denied the right to freely select their representation.

Monday's vote will allow workers at the plant in the northern border city of Matamoros to choose between their current union, part of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), and an independent group, SNITIS.
Auro parts maker Cardone, based in Philadelphia, has said it will be neutral and work with the group elected by workers.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Lee Jae-hong would have had no trouble buying a home in the suburb of Ilsan on the outskirts of Seoul back in 2018. With a strong credit score and a job at a blue chip company, borrowing enough for an average apartment in the city costing about $562,000 was well within reach.
But the now 39-year-old held off thinking there would be better opportunities in the coming years - only to be ""gobsmacked"" by a near tripling of prices in his neighbourhood since President Moon Jae-in took office in 2017. 
Housing has emerged as a critical issue in the presidential election slated for March 9, as Lee and millions of others who missed getting onto the property ladder blame the government for failing in its promises to make housing more affordable. 
""I would do anything, if I can go back in time, to buy something,"" said Lee, who has delayed his marriage and retirement plans due to his financial uncertainty.
""Those who think they can control the (property) market should never be in power again.""
Now a YouTuber, Lee said he will vote for Yoon Suk-yeol from the opposition party, whose policy pledges including cutting capital gains taxes and deregulating rules on knock down-and-rebuild homes are regarded more market friendly than those of Lee Jae-myung from Moon's progressive camp. 
Lee's decision not to buy a property left him far worse off than peers like Park Seong-eun.
Park ignored Moon's policy visions and in 2017 bought two apartments in Gwangmyeong, west of Seoul, when local rules allowed him to borrow as much as 70% of a property's value.
An on-paper gain of around 1.2 billion won ($1 million) on his investments mean his retail management job is now a choice not a necessity, said Park, who is also 39.
""When I have a bad day at work I think about retiring early and having a simple life. I can do that because prices doubled to over 1.1 billion won, both of them,"" said Park. 
He plans to vote for someone who would ease investment rules again so that he can buy one more property. 
CURBS FAIL
Moon promised to make South Korea more equitable by curbing what he believed was the root causes of the country's economic inequality, real estate speculation.
He raised capital gains taxes on multiple homes and repeatedly tightened loan restrictions, especially for higher priced apartments. Starting with Seoul, the government designated more and more parts of surrounding satellite cities as speculative zones subject to tightened mortgage rules and raised tax rates on ownership of pricey properties.
But his five-year term has been marked by endless debates about his policies, which critics say inflicted pain on those he intended to help and benefited those who did the opposite of what the government advised - snap up homes using debt. 
Moon's approval rating slid to 43% from as high as 84% when he took office in 2017, the latest poll by Gallup Korea showed. Those who disapprove of his performance cite his failure to tamp down real estate speculation as the biggest disappointment.
The average price of an apartment in Seoul more than doubled in the past five years to 1.26 billion won in January, making it less affordable than cities like New York, Tokyo and Singapore, relative to income.
Curbing real estate speculating is only one of many challenges the next leader will need to address, which includes sustaining growth at rates matching the economic potential after an estimated 4% expansion last year, the fastest since 2010.
Still, Moon's pledges to fix some major economic problems remain unfulfilled.
The economy ended up creating an average of about 172,700 jobs per year between 2017 and 2021, fewer than half of what he had promised, after a combined 41.6% hike in minimum wages and a reduction in working hours.
For those who got on the property ladder, the future looks far brighter. 
Jang Sung-won, 32, left his civil servant job in November to run a YouTube channel and write books as his 2019 purchase of a three-bedroom home gave him confidence that growing equity could be enough to support his pregnant wife and a child.
""I don't think I could have made long-term plans, with our second child coming, without securing this home. That's difficult if we are hopping from one studio or a small flat to another, right?""

""I'm just really grateful, but at the same time I feel bad for others my age. They will now need much more seed money to buy home.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -As western governments ratchet up sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow's emerging markets allies are exploring channels for trade and financing to continue.
The other members of the erstwhile BRICs group - Brazil, India and China - are treading cautiously for fear of tripping on the sanctions, but the beginnings of a parallel financial system centred on Beijing are becoming detectable.
    The United States and Europe have banished big Russian banks from the main global payments system SWIFT and announced other measures to limit Moscow's use of a $640 billion war chest.
So the willingness of the emerging market giants to sustain business relations with Russia highlights a deep rift over Europe's biggest crisis since the World War II, and threatens to chip away the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade. 
Chinese businesses and banks are now scrambling for ways to limit the impact of sanctions on their relations with Russia, with settlement of transactions in yuan seen rising at the expense of the dollar. The western curbs, which aim to cut Russia out of the global financial system, could also deepen commercial links between Moscow and Beijing.
In India, as concerns mount over sustaining supplies of Russian fertilizer, government and banking sources say there is a plan to get Russian banks and companies to open rupee accounts with a few state-run banks for trade settlement as part of a barter system.
Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro said his country will remain neutral in the conflict.
    Deng Kaiyun, who heads Zhejiang's chamber of commerce that represents Chinese private businesses that trade with Russia, said doing transactions without SWIFT was not a big issue, as the two countries both started de-dollarisation five years ago. 
    ""Yuan-rouble settlement has become a normal business at major banks nowadays ... We business people are already accustomed to that,"" Deng said, adding yuan is increasingly popular with Russians.
    SWIFT 
    The sanctions are prodding Russian and Chinese companies to open accounts at Chinese banks that have subsidiaries in Russia, said a Moscow-based lawyer who represents Chinese businesses. 
    ""SWIFT is not the only payment system. If you block this channel, business people need to find alternatives,"" said the lawyer, who declined to be named due to sensitivity of the topic.
    A source at a Chinese state bank who declined to be identified says ""exporters are now in favour of using yuan to settle their payments"" with Russia. Some of those trades were settled in euros or dollars until last week.
    A source at another state lender said that, given a lack of details in the Western sanctions, the bank is closely monitoring the situation while encouraging clients to use yuan in trade settlements with Russia.
Yuan settlements already accounted for 28% of Chinese exports to Russia in the first half of 2021, compared with just 2% in 2013, as both China and Russia step up efforts to reduce reliance on the dollar, while developing their own respective, cross-border payment systems. 
    The current crisis could accelerate the trend. 
    Dang Congyu, analyst at Founder Securities writes the SWIFT sanctions against Russia are ""a milestone event that will accelerate the process of de-dollarisation."" 
    ""Although it's hard to replace SWIFT in the short term, this incident is very beneficial to yuan's globalisation over the long run."" 
    DE-DOLLARISATION 
    Efforts on de-dollarisation are not limited to trade. 
Investment firm Caderus Capital said it has been working to promote cross-border investment between Russia and China. 
Managing director Andrei Akopian also hailed Russia central bank's move to increase investment in yuan assets as ""the best way to increase the popularity of the Chinese RMB among Russian investors.""
    Yuan accounted for 13.1% of the Russian central bank's foreign currency reserves in June 2021, compared with just 0.1% in June 2017. Dollar holdings dropped to 16.4%, from 46.3%.
""If we talk about trade and investment, it makes a lot of sense for both countries not to trade in the in U.S. dollars, because then you have double conversion, in addition to other difficulties recently,"" Akopian said. 
But the pain for many Chinese businesses is immediate, with a volatile rouble and trade contracts not being honoured. 
    ""Everyone is focused on maintaining or cutting existing business right now. No one is talking about new business. That's what I'm hearing from all quarters, including Chinese clients,"" said a lawyer who declined to be named. 
    Han-Shen Lin, senior advisor The Asia Group and an ex-banker, also cautions that Chinese banks could face tougher scrutiny in the face of western sanctions against Russia. 

    ""All the Chinese banks know that the U.S. dollar clearing global banks will be asking Chinese banks about involvement in sanctions-related counterparts transactions,"" Lin said. 
     ""What will be of interest is how Chinese banks can segregate the sanctioned transactions versus non-sanctioned"", such as energy-related businesses.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Malaysia's central bank will wait until the third quarter before raising interest rates from a record low to support an uneven economic recovery, according to a Reuters poll of economists who predicted higher rates by year-end than in a survey conducted in January.
With economic growth yet to return to pre-pandemic levels and inflation within Bank Negara Malaysia's (BNM) expectations, the central bank is likely to remain patient on rates, shunning recent hawkishness by some global peers.
The Feb. 14-28 Reuters poll predicted BNM would hold its one-day repurchase rate at 1.75% until at least the end of June, with only four economists expecting a rate rise before then, in May.
All 19 economists expected no rate change on Thursday.
The central bank was expected to hike rates to 2.00% in the third quarter, based on the median view, with half the 18 economists polled expecting that rate. Five expect rates to reach 2.25% and four expect no change by end-September.
Rates were expected to climb to 2.25% in the fourth quarter, based on the median, higher than in a January poll. Seven of 18 economists said rates would end 2022 there, three said 2.50%, another seven said 2.00% and one forecast no rise in rates.
""We expect Bank Negara Malaysia to stay patient and maintain its overnight policy rate at a record low to provide continued support to the ongoing economic recovery and enable a sustainable upturn amid moderate inflation,"" wrote Han Teng Chua, an economist at DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) Research.
That cautious approach echoes the stance of a few other central banks in Asia, including the Reserve Bank of India, the Philippine central bank and the Bank of Thailand, which were all expected to maintain an accommodative stance.
The BNM is due to raise rates by 25 basis points in July-September next year, to 2.50%, based on a lower sample of forecasters.
While headline inflation decelerated to 2.3% in January, core inflation was 1.6% as economic activity normalised amid high input costs.

But some economists expect BNM's patience won't last long. 
""The build-up of domestic inflation pressures together with sustaining growth momentum and more aggressive Fed monetary policy tightening would justify an interest rate hike by Bank Negara Malaysia as early as in 2Q22,"" wrote Julia Goh, senior economist at UOB.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Over the last five years Yokohama-based Lasertec Corp has delivered what much of Japan Inc hasn't in decades: big pay rises.
The maker of chip-measuring equipment has boosted salaries by about a third overall since 2016. Employees at its main unit, many of them engineers, make on average just under 14 million yen ($121,000) - more than three times the national average of 4.3 million yen.
Lasertec is among a subset of Japanese firms, often in specialised areas such as technology, where pay is increasingly tied to employee performance and not determined by seniority or the base pay set in annual labour talks.
While ""shunto"" spring wage talks between big manufacturers and unions still have immense significance for the economy - especially this year - more firms are opting for performance-based pay, experts say, a change that speaks to a wider shift slowly taking hold in Japan. (For an EXPLAINER on the 'shunto' talks, click on)
""For companies like us, employees are valuable assets, not costs,"" said Yutaro Misawa, a senior executive at Lasertec, whose profit has soared nearly five-fold and shares have surged more than 2,800% over the past five years. 
Attractive pay makes it easier to retain talented engineers who specialise in research and development, especially given the labour crunch as Japan's population shrinks, Misawa said.
But for much of the rest of the world's no.3 economy, wages remain lacklustre. Thanks to decades of deflation, companies, like households, tend to hoard cash instead of spending. Japanese companies now sit on a record $2.8 trillion in cash and deposits. 
In dollar terms, average annual pay totalled $38,515 in Japan in 2020, well below the OECD average of $49,165 and little changed from the early 1990s.
Higher wages are critical for the government's target of stable 2% inflation. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has called on companies to boost salaries and kick-start a virtuous cycle of spending, as part of his platform of ""new capitalism"" to push for greater wealth distribution.
LAGGARD?
Renewable energy start-up Abalance Corporation has actively hired mid-career executives over the past three years, lifting the average salary in Japan by more than 30%. Its roughly 100 employees in Japan - both locals and non-Japanese - are paid on average more than 7 million yen.
""Acquiring talented people from all over the world is vital for a company's growth,"" said Yuichi Kawauchi, a senior executive. ""If we leave things as they are and fail to show Japan as an attractive place to work, Japan will fall further behind the rest of the world.""
To be sure, performance-linked pay means bonuses can get cut in a downturn - an unattractive prospect for the many Japanese workers who prize stability. Unions typically seek incremental increases to base pay, which is permanent.
Most firms don't plan to raise base pay at spring labour talks this year, the latest Reuters Corporate Survey showed. A slim majority expect to raise total pay, which includes one-off bonuses, the survey showed.
That won't be enough to keep up with recent spikes in commodity costs, analysts say, eroding household spending power.
RAISING CHILDREN
For Yamada Consulting Group, which helps midsize companies restructure, attractive pay and perks are necessary to keep staff from being poached, President Keisaku Masuda said.
The consulting firm allows staff to work shorter hours to encourage them to raise children. 
""We face stiff competition for high-performance workers. We have substantially raised pay and improved working conditions to prevent head-hunting,"" Masuda said.
It raised pay by an average of 19% in 2020 and by 5% last year and now its average employee earns 9.2 million yen.
Japan's labour talks will eventually shift from uniform hikes in base pay towards more flexible wages that reflect the market value of workers, said Yuya Takada, a researcher at recruitment and staffing firm Recruit Holdings Co.
Even  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, itself the long-time pace-setter of the spring labour talks, has stopped disclosing details of base pay, highlighting the gradual decline in importance of the labour talks.
Seniority-based pay will become a thing of the past, Recruit's Takada said.
""That'll lower the significance of the way management and unions struggle for base pay hikes at annual rituals.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Every March, management of Japan's blue-chip firms meet with unions for wage talks across industries that set the tone for employees' pay in the new fiscal year. 
The precedent set at the ""shunto"" spring wage talks also influences wages at smaller firms that supply big manufacturers. The talks have substantial implications for the world's no.3 economy, where policymakers are desperate to kickstart domestic demand after decades of deflation.
Here is an overview of the wage negotiations, and why they are particularly important this year. (For a related story, click on)
WHY ARE COMPANIES UNDER PRESSURE THIS YEAR?
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has exhorted profitable firms to raise wages by 3% or more this year, thrusting wage talks into the spotlight. 
He has pushed to boost growth and wealth distribution since taking office in October, touting a ""new capitalism"" agenda. 
The outcome of the wage talks will give a clear sense of corporate attitudes on higher pay, which is critical to stimulate domestic demand. Policymakers want to generate a virtuous growth cycle to move inflation towards the Bank of Japan's long-elusive 2% target.
Last year major companies offered the lowest wage increases in eight years - below 2% - as the pandemic hammered profits.
Bellwether  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp has accepted union pay demands, its chief executive said last week, although it and the union have not disclosed the pay rise.
However, analysts said the speed with which it wrapped up the talks was notable, given the government demands for higher wages.
HOW BIG WILL THIS YEAR'S INCREASE BE?
Analysts expect wages to rebound slightly above 2% as profits have recovered from the COVID-19 slump, but the size of the increase may still be behind that of price hikes, in a blow to consumer purchasing power.
""The focus of this year's talks is whether Japan can revive momentum for wage hikes, which was disrupted by the pandemic,"" said Hisashi Yamada, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.
With labour's share of profits at historic lows and liquidity on hand at highest levels since the 1980s, cash-rich Japanese firms have ample room to raise wages, he said.
WHY DOES JAPAN HAVE ANNUAL LABOUR TALKS?
The ""shunto"" talks began in 1956 when the postwar economy was experiencing high growth, and unions demanded improvement in wages and job conditions by resorting to tactics such as general strikes in big cities.
The talks peaked in 1974 with a record 33% rise in pay. The increases fell below 3% after the bubble economy burst in the 1990s.
Unionists have long since turned cooperative, rather than combative, working with management on the shared objective of job security rather than higher pay.
WHY THE TRADITIONAL FOCUS ON BASE PAY?
During the talks, the country's largest trade union confederation, ""Rengo"", sets a specific target for base-pay increases. That increase, which is permanent, is often accompanied by one-time bonuses, which are not. 
Bonuses can make up a significant portion of annual pay, and are often sharply reduced - or not paid at all - in lean years, adding to the tendency for households to hoard cash.

As Japan slid into deflation around 2000, management and unionists agreed to no base-pay hikes for more than a decade through 2013. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's return to power for a second term saw him intervene heavily in the talks, ensuring modest pay hikes.
Toyota was long the pace-setter of the wage talks, but in recent years its union has withheld details on base pay and focused instead on trying to rectify income gaps among workers.

548,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 04:51PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russia's central bank more than doubled its key policy rate on Monday and introduced some capital controls as the country faced deepening economic isolation, but its governor said sanctions had stopped it selling foreign currency to prop up the rouble.
The admission that restrictions had effectively tied the Bank of Russia’s hands underscores the ferocity of the backlash to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and Western allies' success in restricting its ability to deploy some $640 billion of foreign exchange and gold reserves.
""The central bank today increased its key rate to 20% as new sanctions triggered a significant deviation of the rouble rate and limited the central bank's options to use its gold and foreign exchange reserves,"" Governor Elvira Nabiullina told a news conference. 
""We had to increase rates to compensate citizens for increased inflationary risks.""
Western sanctions had earlier sent the rouble tumbling nearly 30% to record lows. It clawed back some ground after the central bank raised its main interest rate to 20%, the highest level this century, from 9.5%.
The Bank of Russia sold $1 billion on foreign exchange markets on Thursday, Nabiullina said, but did not intervene on Monday.
That suggests the rouble was supported by other unnamed market participants.
Russia's central bank also said that stocks and derivatives trading on the Moscow exchange will remain closed for a second day on Tuesday. Russian stock markets and derivatives markets were closed on Monday to gird against further losses. 
On Monday, the central bank and the finance ministry ordered exporting companies, which include some of the world's biggest energy producers from Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) to Rosneft, to sell 80% of their forex revenues on the market, as the central bank's own ability to intervene on currency markets was curbed.
Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at Locko Invest, estimated that Russian exporters could offer $44 billion-$48 billion per month to support the rouble provided oil prices stayed around current levels and there were no sanctions on energy exports.
""This looks sufficient to stabilise the market in the next couple of weeks,"" he said.
Sanctions targeting Russia's energy sector remain on the table, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday.
The central bank temporarily banned Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners, although it did not specify assets for which the ban applies. It also said it would resume buying gold on the domestic market.
Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a ban on foreign exchange loans and bank transfers by Russian residents to outside of Russia from March 1, the Kremlin said on Monday, in retaliation for economic sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West. 
The United States and Britain banned their citizens or entities from transacting with the central bank, Russia's National Wealth Fund or the Russian finance ministry.
Switzerland said it would adopt European Union sanctions against Russians involved in the invasion of Ukraine and freeze their assets, in a major departure from the neutral country's traditions.
""If Russia continues on its current path, it is quite easy to see how the latest sanctions could be just the first steps in a severe and enduring severing of Russia’s financial and economic ties with the rest of the world,"" wrote Oliver Allen of Capital Economics in a report.
DEMAND FOR CASH
Russia's major banks have also been excluded from the SWIFT messaging network that facilitates trillions of dollars' worth of financial transactions worldwide, making it hard for lenders and companies to make and receive payments.
Nabiullina said Russia had an internal replacement for SWIFT to which foreign counterparties would be able to connect, but did not give details. 
She said the banking sector faces ""a structural deficit of liquidity"" because of high demand for cash, and that the central bank was ready to support it. 
""The central bank will be flexible to use any tools needed ... banks have enough coverage to raise funding from the central bank,"" Nabiullina said.
Russians had queued outside ATMs on Sunday, worried the sanctions could trigger cash shortages and disrupt payments. 
All banks would fulfill their obligations and funds in their accounts are safe, Nabiullina said, although the central bank was recommending that banks restructure some clients' loans.
The European arm of Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender, was set to fail, the European Central Bank warned on Monday, after a run on its deposits sparked by the backlash from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Nabiullina said further monetary policy decisions would be driven by the central banks' assessment of external risks, adding that it would be flexible in its decisions given the ""non-standard situation"" faced by the financial system and economy.
The rouble finished trading down around 14% to the U.S. dollar. 
DEBT DEFAULT?
The Institute of International Finance (IIF), a trade group representing large banks, warned on Monday that Russia was extremely likely to default on its external debts and its economy will suffer a double digit contraction this year after the fresh reprisal measures by the West.
The central bank and finance ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the IIF assessment. 
An order that Russian brokerages reject sell orders for Russian securities from foreign clients could complicate plans by the sovereign wealth funds of Norway and Australia to wind down exposure to Russian-listed companies.
It was also unclear how energy major BP (NYSE:BP) Plc, Russia's biggest foreign investor, would follow through on a decision to abandon its stake in state oil company Rosneft at a cost of up to $25 billion.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management suspended its JPM Emerging Europe Equity fund on Monday, a source familiar with the matter said, and Denmark's Danske Invest said it had suspended trading in equity funds with a significant exposure to Russian shares.
Global bank HSBC and the world's biggest aircraft leasing firm, AerCap, are among other Western firms looking to exit Russia over its actions in Ukraine, which Moscow characterises as a ""special operation.""

UK-listed depositary shares of Russian companies plummeted, including those of gas giant Gazprom and Sberbank .
“We are witnessing prices for Russian ADRs that we haven't seen for literally decades,” said Michael Kart, a partner at investment firm VLG Capital. “This is certainly the most devastating hit ever taken by the Russian securities market.""

Foreigners, including rich Russians, have for years been attracted to Monaco, a tiny Mediterranean principality, by its warm climate and generous tax rules. During the summer months, Monaco's marina and bay are filled with the superyachts of international billionaires, celebrities and oligarchs.
The Monaco Royal Palace did not say whose assets would be frozen. 

Earlier on Monday, neighbouring France said it was combing through the financial assets owned by Russians listed on sanctions lists linked to the Ukraine war, including properties, yachts and luxury cars.
""We have the legal powers to seize all of these assets,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said after a crisis meeting with President Emmanuel Macron.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden will shift emphasis away from his Build Back Better spending plan when he delivers his State of the Union address on Tuesday, focusing instead on a four-point plan to save the U.S. economy, administration officials said.
""It's not about the name of the bill,"" said an administration official. ""It's about the ideas. It's about lowering costs for families.""
Dominating the news is Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a crisis that has redirected Biden's attention from the administration's effort to revive his domestic economic agenda ahead of Nov. 8 congressional elections.
Yet, with his approval ratings wilting, Biden is retooling his push for broad tax-and-spending changes in a new way.
Many of the policies he promotes will seem familiar - raising Pell grants for education, raising the federal minimum wage to $15 and creating a national paid family medical leave program - but the messaging is different.
""The president will call on Congress to send him a bill that lowers costs and lowers the deficit without delay,"" the White House said in a preview of the speech. ""American families need relief from higher costs, and they need it now.""
Out is talk of remaking society with a Build Back Better social-spending agenda. 
In is talk of restraining deficits and putting an end to inflation, two of the concerns that Democrat Joe Manchin, the swing vote in the U.S. Senate, thought the administration had failed to emphasize enough.
Manchin's opposition tanked a package of Biden economic reforms that were aimed at working women and families, paring down the country's massive income inequality and meeting climate goals. 
Biden's speech will call for many of the reforms on housing, education and climate to be passed under the rubric of a four-point plan: moving goods cheaper and faster; reducing everyday costs; promoting competition; and eliminating barriers to jobs.
Biden will commit to a number of initiatives related to his $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, including repairing 65,000 miles (105,000 kilometers) of roads and 1,500 bridges. He also will ask Congress to complete work on bills he hopes will make the U.S. economy more competitive against China.
Biden will also argue that ocean shipping is dominated by a small number of foreign-owned companies which are increasing costs too much and announce steps by agencies including the Department of Justice to promote competition in that space. The administration estimates that rising shipping costs will add 1% to consumer prices over the coming year.
He will also announce plans to increase safety inspections at nursing homes to reduce their cost and bad patient outcomes, especially those owned by private equity firms. He also wants the federal government to hire more people based on their skills instead of educational qualifications alone.

Rising costs have threatened the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and undermined Biden's favorability with voters as a steward of the economy.
In the 12 months through January, the CPI jumped 7.5%, the biggest year-on-year increase since February 1982. Biden's approval rating, meanwhile, sits at 43%, which is close to the lowest level of his presidency according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia is very likely to default on foreign debt and its economy will suffer a double digit contraction this year after the West launched sanctions unprecedented in scale and coordination, a global banking industry lobby group said on Monday.
The Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimated that half of the Russia's central bank's foreign reserves are held in countries which have imposed freezes on its assets, severely shrinking the bank's policymaking firepower.
The central bank, which on Monday hiked interest rates and introduced capital controls, would prioritise the protection of domestic savers with foreign investors ""one of the last on the list,"" the IIF said.
""If we stay here and this (the crisis) escalates, then default and restructuring is likely,"" Elina Ribakova, the lobby group's deputy chief economist told reporters during a media call. 
She said default would be ""extremely likely"", although the relatively small size of foreign holdings - at around $60 billion - of Russian debt would limit the fallout.
Default on domestically held bonds was far less likely, she added.
Russia's central bank and the Russian finance ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Russia last week invaded Ukraine, leading the West to impose a series of sanctions. These have included the freezing of the central bank's assets, removal of many Russian banks from the global payments system SWIFT and the blacklisting of individuals and entities. Russia calls its military action in Ukraine a “special operation.”
The sanctions sent the rouble plunging to record lows on Monday, and Western investors are scrambling to dump Russian assets as the country finds itself increasingly isolated.
The IIF's Ribakova said the measures, which could yet be toughened even further, were ""the most severe economic sanctions imposed on a country"" ever and would send the Russian economy into a tailspin, with a low double-digit contraction this year likely and inflation soaring by a double digit amount too.
She said conversion of Russian domestic foreign exchange holdings into roubles was also on the table, although the central bank would be reluctant to deploy that initially as it tried to spare hurting domestic savers.
The central bank retains tools to try to calm markets, including hiking rates further, providing liquidity to domestic banks and limiting capital flows. It may also be forced to impose bank holidays to stop a run on banks, the IIF said in a report issued on Monday and written before the latest sanctions. 
Ribakova said an estimated $10 billion had been pulled from Russian banks on Friday alone.
The sanctions could get tougher, including preventing U.S. and European entities from trading in existing Russian government debt, expanding the list of institutions banned from SWIFT and removing energy-related trade exclusions.

Such measures would amplify financial, trade and pure contagion risks for the global economy too, and especially Europe, Ribakova added.
In its earlier report the IIF said that should Russia's biggest lenders, Sberbank and VTB, get kicked off SWIFT, expect ""a fundamental destabilization of the entire financial system, with profound implications for the real economy.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on Russia's central bank and other sources of wealth, dealing a crushing blow to the country's economy and further punishing Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
The measures, blocking Americans from engaging in any transactions involving Russia's central bank, finance ministry or national wealth fund, are likely to push Russian inflation higher, cripple its purchasing power and drive down investments, U.S. officials said on Monday as the new measures took effect.
The actions included a carve-out for energy payments.
Last week Washington imposed several rounds of sanctions, including against Russian President Vladimir Putin and major banks, after Russia's forces invaded Ukraine in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. 
""Our objective is to make sure that the Russian economy goes backwards if President Putin decides to continue to go forward with an invasion in Ukraine, and we have the tools to continue to do that,"" a senior U.S. administration official told reporters on Monday.
Washington and its allies said on Saturday they would take action against the central bank and bar some of Russia's banks from the SWIFT international payments system, a list officials said was still being finalized with EU partners.
Russia's central bank more than doubled its key policy rate on Monday and introduced some capital controls, but its governor said sanctions had stopped it selling foreign currency to prop up the rouble.
The U.S. official said that when Russia was planning its invasion of Ukraine, it was counting on being able to use its central bank's assets to mitigate the impact of sanctions, and since Saturday's announcement had been trying to get those assets to Russia or safe havens.
Monday's measures ""immobilized"" any assets Russia's central bank held in the United States, hindering Russia's ability to access hundreds of billions of dollars in assets, the official said.
""Putin's war chest of $630 billion of reserves only matters if he can use it to defend his currency, specifically by selling those reserves in exchange for buying the rouble,"" a second senior administration official said.
""After today's action, that will no longer be possible and 'Fortress Russia' will be exposed as a myth.""
Mark Sobel, a former senior Treasury official who serves as the U.S. chairman of the OMFIF forum for central banking, economic policy and public investment, said the action was a ""tremendous example of Western unity.""
""This all happened overnight, and the force of it basically cut off a significant country from the global financial system,"" Sobel told Reuters.
The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement on Monday said it had also slapped sanctions on a Russian sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which markets Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine internationally, and its management company.
Its chief executive, Kirill Dmitriev, accused by Washington of being a close Putin ally, was also targeted.
RDIF said in a statement that it has not been involved in political activities and said the restrictions could complicate its promotion of Sputnik V.
""Imposition of sanctions against RDIF, which from the moment it was established has stood for building international relations and supporting constructive ties, demonstrates that the U.S. has picked the course to destroy constructive dialogue between countries,"" its statement read. 
Neutral Switzerland on Monday imposed sanctions on Russia, and Singapore has also said it will take measures against Moscow.
ENERGY SUPPLIES
The Treasury issued a general license alongside Monday's action authorizing certain energy-related transactions until June 24.
President Joe Biden's administration has been concerned that its sanctions could raise already high gas and energy prices and has taken steps to mitigate that. 
The officials said Washington would continue to tailor its measures against Russia to limit the impact felt at home and allow for steady energy supplies to global markets.

They also warned that the United States would not hesitate to take further action against Russia and was actively exploring measures that would cut off Russia from critical technologies it needs to remain a major energy producer in the longer term, citing similar steps already taken by the European Union.
They said Washington was also watching Belarus closely, adding the Russian ally could face more punitive action if it continues to aid Moscow in the invasion.

With price pressures building, the ECB was preparing markets for a further curb in stimulus at its March 10 meeting, only for the war in Ukraine to throw those plans into turmoil.
While conservatives argue that rapid inflation, driven by soaring energy prices, still warrant a quicker exit from bond buys, policy doves, including Panetta, are making the case for patience given the uncertain economic cost of the war and associated sanctions.
""It would be imprudent to move further until we have strong confirmation that both actual and expected inflation is durably re-anchoring at 2% in a world of tighter financing conditions,"" Panetta said in a speech.
""In this environment, it would be unwise to pre-commit on future policy steps until the fallout from the current crisis becomes clearer,"" he added. ""The danger of high inflation becoming entrenched seems contained at the moment.""
At the core of the debate is a diverging view on the durability of inflation.
Price growth is now more than twice the ECB's target but policymakers disagree on the underlying price pressures, particularly the state of the jobs market. 
While board member Isabel Schnabel last week argued that the bloc was enjoying the strongest labour market in its history, Panetta pushed back, saying that the labour market is ""not looking excessively tight"".

""If we respond to a false signal and react to a rise in inflation that might not be lasting, we could suffocate the recovery,"" Panetta said. ""We should aim to accompany the recovery with a light touch, taking moderate and careful steps.""
Panetta added the ECB was ready to take any measure necessary to shore up confidence and stabilise financial markets.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Toymaker Lego has recommended that its staff in Russia not attend protests or get involved in any public discussion about the war in Ukraine, after police detained thousands at anti-war protests across Russia.
The advice was given to ensure the safety of its employees, but also highlights the challenge for foreign companies with staff in Russia as tensions between the West and Moscow grow.
In an email sent on Monday and seen by Reuters, Lego recommended its 80 employees in Russia ""avoid discussing sensitive topics on the Russia-Ukraine and associated subjects in public and in social networks or internet overall.""
""Do not engage, whether intentionally or unintentionally, into any public protest or even peaceful demonstrations,"" it said.
More than 5,500 people have been detained in Russia at various anti-war protests since the country began an invasion of neighbouring Ukraine on Thursday.
The recommendation comes even as political leaders, including UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, have urged Russian citizens to publicly oppose the war in order to increase pressure on the country's leadership.
A Lego spokesman said the email had made clear that these were guidelines only and it was a personal choice whether to follow them.
""We deeply care about our colleagues in Russia, which is why we shared recommendations from our security team on ways they could protect their personal safety,"" the spokesman said.

Lego also said that it in partnership with major shareholder Lego Foundation and the Ole Kirk Foundation, a non-profit organisation, would donate 110 million Danish crowns ($16.60 million) to emergency relief efforts in the Ukraine conflict.

“I am still in favor of a 25 basis-point move at the March meeting,” Bostic said Monday in a virtual discussion with Harvard University students. 
“One data point that I am looking at in particular is month-to-month change in inflation. To the extent we start to see that trend down, then I will be comfortable pretty much with a 25 basis-point move. If that continues to persist at elevated levels, or even moves in the other direction, then I am really going to have to look at a 50-basis-point move for March.”
February consumer price data will be released March 10, five days before the FOMC begins its two-day policy meeting. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect the consumer price index to rise 0.7% from the previous month and 7.8% year-over-year.
Fed officials in the past week stuck to their resolve to raise interest rates next month despite uncertainty posed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Governor Christopher Waller discussing the possibility of a half-point move. 
While acknowledging the risks created by the conflict, which has triggered one of the worst security crises in Europe since World War II and caused oil prices to jump, the central bankers stressed the need to confront the hottest U.S. inflation in 40 years. 
Bostic, who does not vote on monetary policy this year, said he wanted to be sure that no one would be surprised by the possibility of a larger move.
“Historically, over the last 10 years or so our moves have been in 25 basis point increments,” he said. “I was hearing and getting a sense that many expected that was the only type of move we could do. I actually think that is wrong. We need to make sure people have different levels of move in mind, and awareness of those are possibilities.”
Bostic added each of the seven FOMC meetings this year will be important for a possible move.
“Every meeting is live for us,” he said. “ As data comes in, we will have to make judgments about what happens at every stage of the way.”

Below are four charts showing the magnitude of today's market moves and the response from Russia's central bank.
ROUBLE ROUT 
The rouble tumbled more than 30% in early trading, hitting 110 per dollar in both onshore and offshore trading before clawing back some losses. It was worth about 75 to the dollar at the end of 2021.

Trading in equities on the Moscow stock exchange was suspended on Monday but depository receipts and exchange-traded funds listed in London and Frankfurt did open for trading, apart from Russian bank VTB whose membership of the London Stock Exchange was suspended on Friday. 
The London-listed iShares MSCI Russia ETF slumped 48%, for a year-to-date loss of 70%. Sberbank's depositary receipts in London dropped more than 70% on the day and were down 93% year-to-date.

Russia's sovereign hard currency bonds have suffered a dramatic drop over the past few days, though losses sharply accelerated on Monday after harsh sanctions were imposed.

LONDON (Reuters) -The number of investors seeking to ditch their Russian holdings continued to grow on Monday following the country's attack on Ukraine and despite attempts by its central bank to staunch the flow.
The exodus of capital from Russia has accelerated since Ukraine was invaded last week, as the West scales up sanctions against the government of President Vladimir Putin in response to its 'special operation' in the country.
Latest to head to the exit was Norway's largest pension fund KLP, which said it planned to sell around $56 million worth of Russian stocks, and the Church of England, which said it had asked its fund managers to sell out of Russian stocks last week.
Kiran Aziz, head of responsible investments at KLP, which manages around $80 billion in assets, said it had already sold out of Russian stocks and bonds listed in London and was doing the same in New York.
""For assets listed in Moscow, it is of course not possible to sell right now,"" Aziz told Reuters, referring to a decision by the Russian central bank to freeze all trading on the Moscow stock exchange.
Further seizing up markets, Euroclear said on Monday it has closed its link to rival settlement house Clearstream Banking for settling trades in Russian securities in response to European Union financial sanctions.
The Church could well be one of the last to take advantage of open markets after it told its fund managers on Feb. 24 to sell direct holdings equivalent to around 0.16% of its total investments. It added it would also make no further investments.
Also pledging to buy no more Russian assets on Monday was Britain's Universities Superannuation Scheme, the country's largest private pension scheme with around $120 billion in assets.
""We have placed a moratorium on new long positions taken in all Russian assets which is over and above full compliance with UK government sanctions restricting trading in sovereign debt and other Russian assets,"" a spokesperson said in emailed comments.
""Where we have existing investments, we will need to consider our position carefully in the light of trading restrictions,"" the spokesperson added.
The decision by more asset owners to take a stand follows news over the weekend that Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, planned to do the same, and as the New York City Comptroller said he weas reviewing assets for possible divestment.

Some of the banned countries had already been identified, while others were named by the aviation authority Rosaviatsia for the first time on Monday following the punitive measures imposed over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
The flight bans are expected to hurt airlines that fly over the world's biggest country to get from Europe to Asia. They are likely to force them to find new routes.
Rosaviatsia said that flights from those countries could in exceptional circumstances be authorised if they secure special clearance from Russia's aviation authority or foreign ministry.

The rouble hit a low of 120 to the dollar on electronic currency trading platform EBS after President Vladimir Putin ordered his military command to put nuclear-armed forces on high alert on Sunday, while the West imposed harsh sanctions against Russia.
In another attempt to support the rouble, Russian authorities told Russian exporting companies to sell 80% of their foreign currency revenues on the market, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said.
Presenting the new emergency measures, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said the central bank had stopped interventions on Monday due to the latest western sanctions, suggesting the rouble was supported by other unnamed market participants.
The Bank of Russia sold around $1 billion from its reserves on Thursday, Feb. 24, the day when Russia started what it calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine, and also carried out FX selling on Friday, Nabiullina said.
""Due to restriction on using gold-forex reserves in dollars and euros, interventions were not carried by us today,"" Nabiullina said.
Nabiullina also said Russia had an internal replacement for the SWIFT international payments system, adding that foreign counterparts can join it.
RATE HIKE
The central bank, which says it targets inflation at 4% and will do all necessary to ensure financial stability, said the rate increase will bring deposit rates to levels ""needed to compensate for the increased depreciation and inflation risks"".
""This is needed to support financial and price stability and protect citizens' savings from depreciation,"" it said.
The rate hike to levels above the 17% seen in 2014 when Russian annexed Crimea from Ukraine comes after Western countries moved to block certain Russian banks' access to the SWIFT international payment system to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
""External conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,"" the central bank said in a statement.
The recent moves add to a slew of measures announced since Thursday to support domestic markets, as the state scrambles to manage the broadening fallout from Western sanctions.
Russian authorities have also ordered brokers to suspend short selling on the Russian market and stop executing orders by foreign legal entities and individuals to sell Russian securities.

""These measures may help calm down increased market nervousness, but at the same time they undermine the foundation of the monetary policy, focused on inflationary targeting and flexible exchange rate,"" BCS Global markets said in a note.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A global financial crime watchdog will decide this week whether the United Arab Emirates has made enough progress to avoid landing on a 'grey' watchlist, a designation which risks reputational damage to the Middle East's business hub. 
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2020 called for ""fundamental and major improvements"" by the UAE, the region's financial capital and a gold trading hub that has tightened regulations to overcome an image as a hotspot for illicit money.
Countries on the 'grey list' face increased FATF monitoring and risk reputational damage, ratings adjustments, trouble obtaining global finance and higher transaction costs, experts say. 
UAE Minister of State Ahmed al-Sayegh told Reuters the risk from a potential greylisting to sectors such as banking, real estate and credit ratings was ""generally low"". 
""The UAE's economy is resilient and diverse,"" he said.
""We are engaged in an active dialogue with investors, financial institutions and firms doing business in the UAE to anticipate all relevant scenarios and mitigate any consequences as a result of increased monitoring.""
The Paris-based FATF will update its list of high-risk and other monitored jurisdictions by March 4. 
Mazen Boustany, of Habib Al Mulla & Partners, a member of Baker & McKenzie International, said greylisting could impact sovereign and local bank ratings, and the UAE property sector.
""I believe the UAE will do everything in its power to be removed very, very shortly thereafter if it is (listed),"" he said.
Ratings agencies S&P and Fitch did not directly comment on whether a greylisting of the UAE would lead to a ratings change.
Mohamed Damak of S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said the firm looks at regulation and supervision when making Banking Industry Country Risk Assessments. ""Whenever we see weaknesses we take them into account,"" he told Reuters. 
""The cost of transacting with banks in that (grey-listed) country may be higher due to additional checks and compliance requirements. It could also increase the cost of cross-border funding for banks in that country,"" Damak added.
OWNERSHIP TRANSPARENCY 
When FATF grey-listed Malta in 2021, Fitch did not alter sovereign or bank ratings, saying authorities' responses would be important in assessing any credit impact.
The UAE, an oil and gas exporter that vaunts open-for-business credentials and enables glitzy expatriate lifestyles, has introduced reforms to improve technical compliance with FATF anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing standards. But it will also be evaluated on implementation in the federation of seven emirates.
""I am confident that we are in a position to continue to address any potential aspects of FATF's feedback promptly and effectively,"" Emirati minister al-Sayegh said. 
The UAE's property sector, in particular Dubai's, is fuelled by foreign money. FATF's 2020 report said the UAE had not demonstrated effective supervision of real estate agents and precious stones and metal dealers.
The UAE last year founded an Executive Office for Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing after passing an anti-money laundering and terrorism financing law in 2018.
The Executive Office has moved to raise standards for trading of bullion and improve ultimate ownership transparency. 
Highlighting progress ahead of the FATF review, it said that assets worth $625 million were confiscated in 2021, including for money laundering and the gold and precious metals sectors. 
The average time it takes to act on international requests for money laundering and terrorism financing cooperation fell to 37 days in 2021, from 139 in 2019. 

""Illicit finance poses a threat to the UAE's international reputation and to the integrity of our world-leading financial sector,"" Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed wrote in Forbes Middle East magazine this month. 
""We are already making strong progress,"" he wrote, adding that sharing information more effectively is key.

Speaking to reporters after telephone talks with Zelenskiy, Kishida also said Japan would impose sanctions on Belarusian organisations and individuals including President Alexander Lukashenko, and limit exports there given the country's ""evident involvement in the invasion"" of Ukraine.
""I told (President Zelenskiy) that Japan is with Ukraine... and offered firm support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Kishida said.
Japan joins the West in seeking to restrict the Russian central bank's ability to deploy $640 billion of forex and gold reserves, and cut Russia's major banks off the SWIFT financial network, making it hard for lenders and companies to make and receive payments. 
Earlier, Japan's top currency diplomat, Masato Kanda, said the government was working closely with other G7 nations to ensure effective economic sanctions against Russia and its central bank. 
He spoke after a meeting with counterparts at the Bank of Japan and the Financial Services Agency to discuss the fallout from the Ukraine crisis - the first such gathering in roughly a year.
Japanese shares fell and the yen drew demand as a safe haven currency on Monday, after Western nations imposed the new sanctions on Russia.
""Market stability is extremely important,"" said Kanda, Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs, adding the government was closely watching market developments.

The rouble plunged nearly 30% to an all-time low versus the dollar on Monday. The stock market and derivatives market remained closed.
Kishida said Japan, which has pledged $100 million in emergency humanitarian aid to Ukraine, would also allow Japan-based Ukrainians to extend their stay amid the conflict.

Western allies announced sweeping new sanctions against Moscow on Saturday, including Russia's central bank in a bid to restrict its ability to deploy $640 billion of forex and gold reserves. 
As part of its role, the Switzerland-based BIS can conduct currency and reserves transactions for its member central banks, which include Russia. 
""The BIS will not be an avenue for sanctions to be circumvented,"" spokeswoman Jill Forde said during a conference call with journalists following its first major report of the year. ""The BIS will follow sanctions as applicable"".
The head of the BIS's monetary and economic department, Claudio Borio, said the dramatic events in Ukraine, and the retribution for Russia, meant the global economy was now facing widespread uncertainty.
Rising energy and commodity prices will further push up global inflation, while such far-reaching sanctions have never been applied to a country so interconnected in the world economy as Russia.

""It is hard to tell where markets will go from here,"" Borio said. ""The situation has clearly changed"".
""Central banks' challenges have become more complex,"" he said, referring to how major central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve have been preparing for their first post-COVID pandemic interest rate hikes.

568,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 06:51AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - The European Union has imposed several packages of sanctions on Russia for launching an ""unprecedented and unprovoked military attack against Ukraine"", with some measures the bloc has never applied before and some deemed a taboo until Russia's invasion.
The measures come on top of sanctions already in place since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
According to the EU, the sanctions are designed ""to cripple the Kremlin's ability to finance the war, impose clear economic and political costs on Russia's political elite responsible for the invasion and diminish (Russia's) economic base"".
This is a list of the measures agreed so far:
RUSSIA'S CENTRAL BANK
The EU has frozen part of what it calls ""Putin's war chest"" by banning its transactions and freezing all its assets in the EU. This is meant to make it impossible for the central bank to liquidate its assets. 
SWIFT
A certain number of Russian banks, representing 70% of the country's banking market, are to be cut off from SWIFT, the world's dominant global payment system. The moved is intended to harm their ability to operate globally, stopping the banks from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively blocking Russia's exports and imports.
RUSSIAN STATE-OWNED MEDIA
The EU is set to tackle what it calls ""the Kremlin's media machine"", banning state-owned broadcaster Russia Today, the news agency Sputnik and their subsidiaries. The move is intended to make sure they ""will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin's war and to sow division in the Union"".
AIRSPACE
The EU has shut down its airspace for Russia, banning all Russian aircraft from taking off, landing or overflying the EU. The ban applies to all aircraft, no matter whether they are owned by Russians, registered in Russia or controlled by Russian individuals or companies - including private jets owned or chartered by oligarchs.
WEAPONS
For the first time in its history, the EU has agreed to use its funds for purchasing and delivering weapons to Ukraine. 450 million euros are earmarked for buying arms, another 50 million euros will be used for financing other supplies such as fuel or medical equipment.
BELARUS
The EU has agreed to hit Belarus, which it sees as complicit in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with further sanctions. The bloc aims to stop Belarusian exports of mineral fuels, tobacco, wood, timber, cement, iron and steel.
BLACKLISTINGS
The EU has blacklisted hundreds of additional people, many of them members of the Russian parliament who voted for the recognition of the breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. Their bank accounts in the EU are now frozen and they are banned from travelling to the bloc.
The most prominent individuals on the blacklist are Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, although they are exempt from the travel ban. This is meant to enable negotiations with them should the opportunity arise.
Still, Putin is now one of only three world leaders blacklisted by the EU, along with Syria's Bashar al-Assad and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus. The blacklist currently includes 654 individuals and 52 entities in total.
ENERGY SECTOR
The sanctions ban the export of specific refining technologies, making it harder and more expensive for Russia to modernise its oil refineries. They add to an existing oil equipment ban imposed in 2014. Russia earned 24 billion euros in 2019 from refined oil exports to the EU, according to the bloc.
TRANSPORT SECTOR
The EU has banned the export, sale, supply or transfer of all aircraft, aircraft parts and equipment to Russia as well as all services related to the repair, maintenance and financing of aircraft. 
Three-quarters of Russia's commercial air fleet were built in the EU, United States and Canada, according to the EU. The sanctions mean that ""Russia will not be able to maintain its fleet to international standards"", the EU said.
DUAL-USE GOODS AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY
The EU has toughened existing sanctions on goods that can be used for civilian as well as military purposes, targeting Russia's and Belarus' military-industrial complex and limiting their access to advanced technology such as drones and software for drones, software for encryption devices, semiconductors and advanced electronics.
These measures are meant to downgrade Russia's technological capabilities over time. 
DIPLOMAT VISAS
Russian holders of diplomat passports will no longer enjoy visa-free travel to the EU, and Russian government officials and business people will no longer benefit from lower fees when applying for a visa. This measure will not apply to Russian citizens in general, who will retain the benefits they currently have.

TRADE WITH BREAKAWAY REGIONS IN UKRAINE
The EU has imposed an import ban on goods from breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, on doing business with tourism services there and on exports of certain goods and technologies.

The bank has also introduced some capital controls as the West seeks to restrict its ability to deploy $640 billion of forex and gold reserves and cut Russia's major banks out of the SWIFT financial network, making it hard for lenders and companies to make and receive payments. Those moves have sent the rouble tumbling to record lows.
""The economic reality has considerably changed,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""These are heavy sanctions, they are problematic, but Russia has the potential to offset the harm."" 
""Russia has been making plans for quite a long time for possible sanctions, including the most severe ones. There are response plans, they were developed and are being implemented as problems appear.""
Peskov said sanctions introduced against President Vladimir Putin himself were pointless.
""(Putin) is quite indifferent. The sanctions contain absurd claims about some assets,"" Peskov said. ""The president has no assets other than those he has declared."" 
The West is seeking to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls it a ""special military operation"" aimed at protecting civilians. 

Putin will work on economic issues today, Peskov said, meeting with officials including Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, and German Gref, CEO of dominant lender Sberbank. 
Asked about the central bank's handling of the crisis, Peskov said: ""We have had no reason to doubt the effectiveness and reliability of our central bank. There is no reason to doubt it now.""

Investing.com -- Fresh Western sanctions trigger financial panic in Russia and sharp falls in equities worldwide. The dollar and gold rise. Vladimir Putin puts his nuclear forces on high alert after ""unfriendly"" moves, while Europe awakes from a 30-year slumber on defense policy. In the U.S., New York City lifts its mask mandate and Lucid Motors is set to report earnings. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 28th February.
1. Russian assets tumble after fresh sanctions
The Russian ruble tumbled after new western sanctions effectively froze over half the foreign reserves of its central bank and shut selected Russian banks out of the global financial messaging network SWIFT. That move will stop almost all payments into and out of Russia, except those directly linked to payment for Russian energy exports.
News of the sanctions triggered mass runs on deposits at Russia’s banks, Around 30% of Russian retail deposits are held in foreign currency.
The Central Bank, which doubled its benchmark rate to 20% to defend the ruble, said that Russia’s stock exchanges would remain closed all day, but depositary receipts of Russian companies listed in Europe, fell sharply, as did Russia-themed ETFs. Governor Elvira Nabiullina will hold a press briefing at 8 AM ET (1300 GMT).
2. Putin puts nuke forces on high alert as EU steps up
In addition to the financial measures announced, the weekend also saw major shifts in European foreign policy, as the continent was jolted into a new assessment of political realities.
Germany announced its biggest increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War and vowed to spend above the amount recommended for NATO members in the future. The European Union for the first time ever said it would ship lethal weaponry to another country and closed its airspace to Russian commercial aircraft.
On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces continued to frustrate Russian attempts to seize major cities across the country. Unverified reports and social media footage suggested that Russia had responded by launching missile barrages against cities such as Kharkiv to break their resistance.
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin had placed his country’s strategic nuclear forces on high alert, describing the move as a response to ‘hostile’ actions by the West against Russia.
Despite this, Ukrainian and Russian diplomats are due to meet on the Ukraine-Belarus border later.
3. U.S. stocks set to open sharply lower
U.S. stock markets are set to follow European markets lower when they open later, in a response to the political and military developments.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 443 points, or 1.3%, while S&P 500 futures were down 1.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 1.4%.HP (NYSE:HPQ), Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) are among companies reporting earnings later.
The situation was also reflected in a rush for haven assets. The dollar index rose strongly, while the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury fell six basis points to 1.92%. Gold futures rose another 1.0% to trade back above $1,900 an ounce.
4. Oil and gas prices surge on new fears
Crude oil prices rose sharply, as did European natural gas futures, amid fears that the new sanctions could disrupt energy flows out of Russia, even though they were tailored to avoid doing so.
By 6:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 4.3% at $95.56 a barrel, while Brent crude was up 4.4% at $96.29 a barrel. U.S. Natural gas futures rose 1.5% to $4.538 per thousand BTUs, in anticipation of heightened demand from Europe to cover shortfalls in supplies from Russia.
Over the weekend, oil giants BP (NYSE:BP) and Equinor (OL:EQNR) said they will start exiting their Russian holdings. BP envisages a hit of up to $25 billion from a fire sale of its 19.75% stake in Rosneft (OTC:OJSCY), most of it, albeit in the form of non-cash charges.
5. NYC to lift mask mandate
In brighter news, New York City said it will lift its mandate on people to wear masks in restaurants and entertainment venues as of March 7, another landmark in the country’s emergence from the latest wave of the pandemic.
The nationwide 7-day case rate has now fallen to its lowest since last July.
It’s a different story in China, however, where Hong Kong continues to record unprecedented levels of both new infections and deaths. Figures for the Chinese mainland, which are harder to verify, also continue to show rising case incidences.",,,,,

Money markets are showing signs of the most stress since the early days of the pandemic as traders scrabble for dollars in the wake of toughened Western sanctions against Russia, prompting calls for help from central banks.
The cost of converting both yen and euro payments into dollars using three-month cross-currency basis swaps hit the most since March 2020. The gap between future Libor and Federal Reserve rates, a key gauge of funding stress known as the FRA/OIS spread, also widened for one-month contracts by the most since March 2020.
The gyrations suggest concerns that dollar funding costs could increase amid sanctions on Russia’s economy and central bank. The decision to exclude various Russian lenders from the SWIFT messaging system could result in missed payments, and prompt monetary authorities to supply the market with dollars, according to Credit Suisse Group AG strategist Zoltan Pozsar.
“We are likely to see some emergency measures including EUR and USD swap lines in the coming days,” said Mohit Kumar, a London-based managing director of interest-rate strategy at Jefferies. “The immediate concerns of central banks would be to maintain a proper functioning of the funding markets and prevent any stress in the banking system.”
The moves in funding markets have similarities to the global run on the greenback triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, though not on the same scale. That pushed the Federal Reserve to step in as the lender of last resort through swap lines, which eased a dash for dollars. 
Russia had about $300 billion of foreign currency held offshore, enough to disrupt money markets if frozen by sanctions or moved suddenly to avoid them, Credit Suisse Group estimated last week. 
The dislocations added to concerns that the impact of the Ukraine crisis is piling stress on fixed-income markets, which were already showing signs of dysfunction as the Fed and its peers accelerated plans to tighten policy. 
“Details on sanctions were fairly vague so the market will be looking for more clarity, but there is no doubt the goal of the sanctions is to drive a liquidity crisis within the Russian economy,” said Prashant Newnaha, an Asia-Pacific rates strategist at TD Securities. “The moves in front-end basis aren’t too surprising, a classic risk-off move, while spreads are wide and liquidity thin.”
Three-month euro-dollar basis -- which helps govern costs for traders to swap interest rates across currencies -- fell as much as 26 basis points to minus 49.5 basis points. The equivalent measure for Japan’s yen fell as much as 29 basis points to minus 64 basis points.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea will tighten export controls against Russia by banning shipments of strategic items and join Western countries' moves to block some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system, Seoul's foreign ministry said on Monday.
""The Korean government condemned Russia's armed invasion of Ukraine and, as a responsible member of the international community, decided to actively participate in the international community's efforts, including economic sanctions, for a peaceful resolution of the situation,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Among the strategic items that could be controlled are supplies of electronics, semiconductors, computers, information and communications, sensors and lasers, navigation and avionics, and marine and aerospace equipment.
Shortly after the announcement, Russia's Ambassador to South Korea Andrey Kulik expressed regret, blaming ""strong outside pressure"" on Seoul from the United States its western partners to join them in applying sanctions.
He called Moscow's actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" aimed at defending Russia from those western forces trying to use Ukraine ""as a tool"" to mount military threats.
Two leading banks in South Korea confirmed on Monday that while they haven't yet received specific guidelines from SWIFT, or the member-owned cooperative for interbank payment system, they stopped trade financing with at least seven Russian banks.
South Korea's Shinhan Bank and one other leading lender said that they stopped issuing letters of credit and other trade financing to PSB, VEB, VTB, Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Sovcombank, and Sberbank. The second Korean bank declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
""Blocking SWIFT will adversely affect trade financing although South Korea's overall imports of natural gas and oil from Russia isn't that huge, at about 5-10%"" of the total, said Jeong Min-hyeon, an economist with expertise in Russia and Europe at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy.
""The difficulties South Korean buyers of Russian commodities and other exporters go through with payment difficulties could lead to supply disruption and price increases.""
In its statement, the foreign ministry also said the Korean government has decided to promote the additional release of strategic oil reserves for stabilisation of the international energy market, and to further review other measures such as the resale of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe.
South Korea will boost humanitarian aid to Ukraine, the ministry added, saying its decisions have been officially notified to the U.S. government through diplomatic channels.

It also plans to seek exemption from Washington's sanctions against Russia as measures to block Russia's access to high-tech products could affect South Korean exporters including Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix, local news agency Yonhap reported, citing the trade ministry.
The U.S. government said in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last week it will implement export controls designed to cut Russia off from semiconductors and other advanced technology crucial to its weapons development and biotechnology, measures that could hurt chipmakers including Samsung (KS:005930).

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is interested in coming to an agreement that is in the interests of both sides at talks with Ukraine, Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said on Monday, as officials prepare to meet near the border.
Medinsky said talks were expected to begin at 12 p.m. local time (0900 GMT). Russia's political and economic isolation deepened on Monday as its forces met stiff resistance in Ukraine's capital and other cities in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two.

JPMorgan also lowered its forecast for Russia's trend growth to 1.0% from 1.75% as growing political and economic isolation will crimp expansion in years to come. 
Russia inflation is expected to stand at 10% at year-end with risks heavily skewed to upside, the bank added.

GENEVA (Reuters) -Swiss President Ignazio Cassis said on Sunday that it was ""very probable"" that neutral Switzerland would follow the European Union (EU) on Monday in sanctioning Russia and freezing Russian assets in the Alpine country.
Cassis, interviewed on French-language Swiss public television RTS, said that the seven-member Federal Council would meet on Monday and review recommendations by the departments of finance and economy.
Asked whether Switzerland -- a major financial centre and commodities trading hub -- would follow the EU in freezing Russian assets, he said: ""It is very probable that the government will decide to do so tomorrow, but I cannot anticipate decisions not yet taken.""
Cassis said that Switzerland's neutrality must be preserved and it stood ready to offer its good offices for diplomacy if talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials on the Belarusian border do not succeed, for example by reaching an armistice.
""That does not prevent us from calling a spade a spade,"" he said.
Switzerland has walked a tortuous line between showing solidarity with the West and maintaining its traditional neutrality that the government says could make it a potential mediator.
But it faces growing pressure to side clearly with the West against Moscow and adopt punitive European Union sanctions. The government had so far said only that it will not let Switzerland be used as a platform to circumvent EU sanctions. 
In the biggest peace march in decades, around 20,000 people demonstrated in the capital Bern on Saturday to support Ukraine, some booing the government over its cautious policy. 
Cassis said on Sunday that Ukrainians fleeing the conflict would be welcome ""for a transitional period, which we hope will be as short a possible"".
Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said separately that Switzerland was ready to take in those who need protection and also to support the neighbouring countries affected. ""We will not leave people in the lurch,"" she said.
The Swiss government last week amended its watchlist to include 363 individuals and four companies that the EU had put on its sanctions list to punish Moscow.

(Reuters) -European nations and Canada moved on Sunday to shut their airspace to Russian aircraft, an unprecedented step aimed at pressuring President Vladimir Putin to end his invasion of Ukraine, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.
Aeroflot said it would cancel all flights to European destinations after E.U. foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the European Union had decided to close its airspace to Russian traffic.
The United States is considering similar action, but has yet to make a final decision, according to U.S. officials. The U.S. government said citizens should consider leaving Russia immediately on commercial flights, citing an increasing number of airlines cancelling flights as countries closed their airspace to Russia.
The ban on Russian jets comes as the airline industry continues to grapple with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic that is still undermining global demand for travel.
Germany, Spain and France joined Britain, the Nordics and Baltic states in declaring bans on Russian use of their airspace, a major escalation in a tactic by mostly NATO allies to wage economic war against Putin in retaliation for the invasion.
The West, led by the United States, also unveiled sweeping new financial sanctions on Russia.
Russia is now widely expected to retaliate further against the air blockades and other sanctions. It has already responded to the earliest European airspace bans with its own edicts barring airlines from Britain, Bulgaria and Poland.
Without access to Russia's airways, experts say carriers will have to divert flights south while also avoiding areas of tension in the Middle East.
A reciprocal airspace ban by Russia and the United States would cause longer flight times for U.S. carriers and could require crew changes on East Coast routes to Asia, said U.S.-based analyst Robert Mann of R.W. Mann & Company, Inc.
It could make certain flights too costly to operate for U.S. carriers. ""It would just add a lot of expense,"" he said.
WILL WASHINGTON FOLLOW?
France on Sunday evening said it was shutting its airspace to all Russian aircraft and airlines, in an announcement echoed across continental Europe.
The closure of European airspace to Russian airlines and vice versa had immediate impacts on global aviation.
Air France-KLM said it is suspending flights to and from Russia as well as the overflight of Russian airspace until further notice. Air France said it was also suspending flights to and from China, South Korea and Japan temporarily while it studied flight plans that avoided Russian airspace.
Finnair said it would cancel flights to Russia, Japan, South Korea and China through March 6 as it avoided Russian airspace, though flights to Singapore, Thailand and India would continue with an added hour of flight time.
If U.S. airlines were barred from Russian airspace, it would lengthen some international flights and some would likely be forced to refuel in Anchorage, industry sources told Reuters. The flights that could be impacted include U.S. flights to India, China, Japan and Korea, the sources said. 
The White House National Security Council declined to comment on whether the United States will close its skies to Russia and referred questions to the Federal Aviation Administration, which did not immediately comment.
Swiss International Air Lines, a unit of Germany's Lufthansa  Canada also said it had shut its airspace to Russian aircraft effective immediately. There were no direct flights between Russia and Canada but several Russian flights a day had used Canadian airspace. An Aeroflot flight from Miami to Moscow passed through Canadian airspace on Sunday after the ban was announced, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24.  A spokesperson for Canada's transport minister said air traffic control manager NAV Canada had mistakenly permitted a banned aircraft into Canadian airspace and steps were being taken to ensure it did not happen again. Transport Canada said it was launching a review into the conduct of Aeroflot and NAV Canada leading up to the violation. DISRUPTION TO FREIGHT, LESSORS The aviation sanctions also spell disruption for logistics companies and the mainly Ireland-based aircraft leasing industry. U.S.-based  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), two of the world's largest logistics companies, have said they are halting deliveries to destinations in Russia. It was unclear whether both firms continue to use Russian airspace as part of their general operations. Neither responded immediately to requests for comment.  Asian aircraft lessor BOC Aviation said on Monday that E.U. sanctions requiring the termination of leases to Russian airlines by March 28 would affect most of its aircraft in Russia. 
The sanctions are a setback for the leasing industry after Russian carriers were seen as more reliable performers on jet rental agreements than many global carriers during the pandemic.  Russian companies have 980 passenger jets in service, of which 777 are leased, according to analytics firm Cirium. Of these, two thirds, or 515 jets, with an estimated market value of about $10 billion, are rented from foreign firms.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economic growth will likely grind to a near halt this quarter as coronavirus curbs and supply disruptions threaten to derail the country's economic recovery, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Monday.
The forecast was much lower than the robust expansion expected in January's projection in a sign of the heavy damage chip and parts shortages and the infectious Omicron variant are inflicting on the world's third-largest economy.
Another setback for the economy could put pressure on the government to do more to offset a surge in global energy prices and to support households ahead of upper house elections that must be held by the summer.
Japan's economy will grow an annualised 0.4% in the first quarter, down from a 4.5% expansion predicted last month, according to the median forecast of nearly 40 analysts in the poll, which was mostly carried out before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The economy grew an annualised 5.4% in the final months of last year, keeping the seasonally-adjusted real gross domestic product (GDP), sized around 541 trillion yen ($4.7 trillion), below the pre-pandemic level of late 2019.
The economic outlook has become more uncertain for Japan due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis and soaring energy and raw material prices, which are aggravated by a weaker yen.
The Japanese currency hit a near five-year low against the U.S. dollar in January, and has since hovered close to that level.
In a Feb. 15-25 poll, the largest risk to the country's economy over the coming year was expected to be from the emergence of new coronavirus variants, followed by faster than expected U.S. monetary policy tightening and supply chain disruptions.
""Private consumption has to normalise for the economy to recover,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
""Coronavirus trends continue to be the biggest risk for that not to happen.""
Economic growth is expected to pick up to an annualised 5.6% in the second quarter, which was better than last month's projection of 3.4% growth, according to the poll.
The poll also found the economy would grow 2.9% in fiscal 2022, starting in April, after an expected 2.5% expansion this fiscal year.
Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile fresh food prices, will rise 1.2% next fiscal year after a projected flat reading this fiscal year, the poll showed.
Three-quarters of 33 analysts who responded to a question about U.S. interest rate rises said multiple hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve in the coming 12 months would not have a serious impact on Japan's economy.
The remaining quarter, or eight respondents, said the effect of multiple U.S. rate increases on the economy would be serious, while none expected it to be very serious.

""The impact won't be serious if attention is paid to improvements of supply constraints while prices are kept in check by multiple rate rises,"" said Harumi Taguchi, principal economist at IHS Markit.
""If prices rise more than expected and depress consumers' purchasing power, there's a risk of a vicious cycle of price hikes and wages that may lead to a recession in the United States.""

(Reuters) - The governors of a handful of U.S. states have ordered government-run liquor stores to stop selling Russian-made vodka and distilled spirits in solidarity with the Ukrainian people after Russia's invasion of the neighboring country.
Utah Governor Spencer Cox became the latest over the weekend, instructing the state's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control on Saturday to take off all Russian-produced and branded products from the shelves of its retail stores. 
In issuing the executive order, Cox joined the governors of New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania in taking what is largely a symbolic gesture of support for besieged Ukraine, which came under attack by Russian military forces last week. 
""We will do our part to push back on the Russian invaders and stand with our sisters and brothers in Ukraine,"" said Cox. He also said that Utah would review all state procurements to check for any Russian ties.
The boycott is unlikely to have a tangible impact. Only 1.2% of U.S. vodka imports came from Russia in the first half of 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, which tracks such data.
The group's data shows that Russian vodka accounted for only $18.5 million of the $1.4 billion worth of total vodka imports in the United States in 2021, which included $660 million from France.
Many Russian-styled vodkas sold in the United States, including Smirnoff and Stolichnaya, are actually made in other countries, including in the United States.
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the ownership of the Stolichnaya brand has been under dispute between a Russian state-owned company and the Stoli Group, but the vodka sold in the United States is produced by the latter.
Stoli Group, which produces the Stolichnaya brand in Latvia, has said it supports the Ukrainian people. Those visiting Stoli's website now see an opening page with a pale blue and yellow dove carrying an olive branch on a white background. 
Below the dove reads a message: ""Stoli Group stands for peace in Europe and in solidarity with the Ukrainian people.""
Russian Standard vodka, the most popular Russian-made vodka sold in the United States, is distributed by Moscow-based Roust Group and Roust International. It is also sold under the brand name Green Mark Vodka. Reuters was not able to reach a spokesperson late on Sunday.

Some Canadian provinces, including Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, made similar moves last week, ordering provincial liquor stores to stop selling Russian-made brands.
In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott urged all liquor stores and restaurants in the state to stop serving Russian-made products on a voluntary basis. ""Texas stands with Ukraine,"" he said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) message.

580,"<span>Feb 27, 2022 09:56PM ET</span>","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The banning of certain Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system could push central banks to enhance liquidity to offset missed payments, a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) strategist said on Sunday.
Western nations announced on Saturday a harsh set of sanctions to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, including blocking some banks from the SWIFT international payments system.
Major banks were working this weekend to get to grips with the raft of new sanctions and their full implications, while markets braced for more volatility as the measures could disrupt global trade and hurt Western interests as well as Russia.
""Exclusions from SWIFT will lead to missed payments and giant overdrafts similar to the missed payments and giant overdrafts that we saw in March 2020"", Credit Suisse's Zoltan Pozsar said in a note.
Back in March 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve enhanced efforts with other major central banks to ease a global dollar-funding crunch, as part of emergency measures to stem the financial and economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. 
""The virus froze the flow of goods and services that led to missed payments, and war has led to exclusions from SWIFT that will lead to missed payments again"", said Pozsar.
""One would assume that central banks would re-activate daily swap line operations now that the SWIFT option got invoked. Central banks should stand ready to make markets on Monday again"", he added.
To counter inflation, the Fed has announced plans to reduce its balance sheet this year, after it roughly doubled in size during the pandemic to nearly $9 trillion as it bought bonds to help keep longer-term interest rates down.

But the Fed's balance sheet may expand again before shrinking through so-called quantitative tightening, a reversal of the Fed's bond-buying programme, Pozsar said.
""The consequence of excluding banks from SWIFT is real, and so is the need for central banks to re-activate daily U.S. dollar funds supplying operations"", he said.

Moves to block some Russian banks from the SWIFT global payments system and freeze the Bank of Russia's reserves are expected to deal a severe economic blow, although Russian authorities and lenders sought to assuage fears.
""Since Thursday, everyone has been running from ATM to ATM to get cash. Some are lucky, others not so much,"" St Petersburg resident, Pyotr, who declined to give his last name, said. 
Russians waited in long lines amid concerns bank cards may cease to function, or that banks would limit cash withdrawals.
While the SWIFT move will hinder Russian banks from communicating with international peers, analysts say limiting the use of more than $630 billion in international reserves could prove even costlier for Russia.
Sergey Aleksashenko, a former deputy chairman of the Russian central bank who now lives in the United States, said that Russia's national wealth fund would effectively disappear. 
""(President Vladimir) Putin and (former Finance Minister Alexei) Kudrin built it up for years, thinking about a major war,"" he said. ""War has come, and there is no money.""
BANKS URGE CALM 
Russian banks sought on Sunday to calm fears over money supplies and online payment systems. 
Meanwhile, rates offered for foreign exchange shot up. The rouble closed on Friday at 83 to the dollar, but some lenders were offering rates of above 100 on Sunday. 
Russia's biggest lender, Sberbank, said it was not seeing any interruptions in customer transactions through its own and partner payment systems. State development bank VEB said external restrictions would not stop it supporting projects within Russia. 
Otkritie, bailed out by the central bank in 2017, said new restrictions would not have a significant impact beyond use of its bank cards abroad. 
The central bank, however, advised people to carry their bank cards with them, saying that mobile payment systems may not work at all with terminals or online shops operated by one of the five banks under the harshest sanctions. 
Moscow resident Sergei said he would need to order a new card and remember how to live as he had five years previously when he stopped using cash. 
""I'm used to living in the 21st century, without carrying plastic cards around. Everything is installed on my smartphone,"" he said. ""I'm definitely against it."" 
Senior Russian lawmaker Andrei Klimov was cited by RIA as saying: ""Russia's exit from SWIFT poses no threat to our domestic settlements, stimulates the rouble as an international currency and at the same time reduces the possibility for the West's destructive control of our settlement operations."" 
CATASTROPHE
But some warned of catastrophic economic damage now that the West has announced it is freezing the central bank's reserves.
""The most important thing is that the West is freezing the Central Bank's reserves,"" former Russian prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""There is nothing to support the rouble with. They will turn on the printing press. Hyperinflation and catastrophe for the economy is not far away.""
The Russian central bank did not respond on Sunday to requests for comment on the asset freeze. 
Roman Borisovich, a former Moscow investment banker, said markets would be ""messy"" on Monday.
""(The Russian authorities) will put controls in place for sure. They can't defend the rouble but they will probably halt trading and fix the rouble at an artificial rate like they used to do. There will be a black market,"" he said. 
The central bank said its repo auction on Monday would have no limit. 

In Moscow, one resident, Tatiana, said she did not expect to suffer too much because she does not earn much and, despite the inevitable fallout, believed Russians would get by. 
""We are people who have overcome lots of ups and downs over the years,"" she said. ""We will also overcome this because it is for a good cause. I salute everything Putin does.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - World Bank President David Malpass said on Sunday the bank may be able to provide Ukraine with more financial resources within days and that additional aid for the war-torn country will be discussed by G7 finance leaders on Tuesday.
Malpass told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" he was not yet considering what would happen if the Ukraine's government falls, but the bank is ""doing everything we can to support the people of Ukraine.""
""Right now, we have an instrument that is able to move quickly in the next few days if it's - if it's needed - and the circumstances go that way,"" Malpass said. ""I briefed our board on Thursday and it can be added to by other countries that want to support Ukraine.""
A disbursement for Ukraine within days would represent a rapid acceleration from World Bank financing options that Malpass discussed a week ago with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Malpass at that time said the bank was readying a $350 million disbursement to Ukraine that the group's board would consider by the end of March.
Malpass said he would join a virtual meeting on Tuesday of finance ministers and central bank governors from the G7 Western democracies, who will discuss other options and ""can decide a lot of how much aid goes into Ukraine.""
A source familiar with the G7 meeting plans said the finance leaders also will discuss the latest rounds of sanctions against Russia aimed at punishing Moscow for the invasion of Ukraine. These include moves by the United States and its allies to cut key Russian banks off from the SWIFT financial transactions messaging system and impose sanctions against Russia's central bank aimed at neutralizing its $630 billion in foreign currency reserves.
Malpass also said the World Bank, along with the International Monetary Fund, was considering steps to help countries bordering Ukraine to support their intake of Ukrainian refugees, such as Romania and Moldova.

He added that the conflict and financial sanctions against Russia would increase hardship for the Russian people as the rouble's value has fallen dramatically.
""You know, this is a tragedy right now for Ukrainians, for the neighbors of Ukraine, but also for Russians,"" he said. ""They didn't choose war.""

Investing.com -- A decision on Saturday by Western nations to block some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments network as punishment for the invasion of Ukraine looks set to trigger a fresh wave of volatility when markets open on Monday. Testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may give investors an indication of how the war in Ukraine and rising energy prices have impacted the monetary policy outlook. Datawise, Friday’s U.S. employment report for February is expected to show the recovery in the labor market remains solid. Surging commodity prices are set to remain in focus, while Eurozone inflation data for February is expected to reach another record high, underlining the impact of rising energy costs. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Western allies announced sweeping new sanctions against Moscow on Saturday, including blocking some banks from the SWIFT international payments system. The decision will be implemented in the coming days.
The allies, who also vowed curbs on the Russian central bank to limit its ability to support the ruble, have not yet said which banks would be targeted, but a European Union diplomat said some 70% of the Russian banking market would be affected.
Investors have been fearful about moves to block Russian banks from SWIFT as this would disrupt global trade and hurt Western interests, as well as hit Russia.
One likely casualty will be the Russian ruble, investors said. Russia’s currency fell to an all-time low against the U.S. dollar in the past week, though it pared some of those losses on Friday.
“With the central bank likely to face severe constraints on currency intervention, the ruble will struggle to find a bottom,” Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay told Reuters. “No one wants to catch a falling knife.""
With sanctions against Russia escalating and market volatility remaining at elevated levels, testimony on the economy and monetary policy by Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week will need to reassure investors that the Fed will take steps to tackle soaring inflation as the economic outlook grows more uncertain.
Powell is due to testify before the House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday, and again before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.
The Fed has indicated that it is poised for an interest rate lift-off at its upcoming March meeting, to combat inflation which is running at a 40-year high. But now Fed officials must weigh the geopolitical and economic fallout from the conflict in Ukraine against mounting an aggressive attempt to curb inflation.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will fuel a sharper increase in the cost of living by driving up energy prices, while the extra squeeze on household spending is likely to act as a drag on the economic recovery, which has already been hit by the Omicron wave.
Economists expect Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for February to show that the economy added 450,000 jobs with the unemployment rate expected to tick down to 3.9% and average hourly earnings forecast to rise at a 5.8% annual rate.
Ahead of the employment report, payrolls processor ADP is due to release figures on private sector hiring on Wednesday and the Labor Department is to publish the weekly report on initial jobless claims on Thursday.
The economic calendar also features surveys of the manufacturing and service sectors for February by the Institute of Supply Management, which are likely to have rebounded as the impact of the Omicron wave on business activity subsided.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 on Thursday with Brent touching $105, before paring gains. European gas prices have also surged amid concerns over supply security.
Russia is the world's second-largest crude producer and a major natural gas provider to Europe.
Energy traders will be awaiting details on the moves to block Russian banks from SWIFT to see if the sanctions will impact oil and gas flows, but the measures will likely discourage many buyers from purchasing Russian oil.
Meanwhile, ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia, a grouping known as OPEC+, are to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to increase output by 400,000 bpd in April.
The Eurozone is to release what will be closely watched data on consumer price inflation on Wednesday, which is expected to reach a fresh record high of 5.3%.
The inflation data will add to the headache facing the European Central Bank ahead of its key March meeting. The ECB has said it will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the economic outlook after Russia's attack on Ukraine at its upcoming meeting.
Several ECB officials, including President Christine Lagarde, Vice President Luis de Guindos, Chief Economist Philip Lane, and Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel are due to speak ahead of the start of the traditional blackout period, which begins on Thursday with the publication of the minutes of the bank’s most recent meeting.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Soaring energy prices and a geopolitical crisis over Russia's invasion of Ukraine are looming over the European Union's attempts to agree a raft of tougher climate change laws, raising concerns that some could be delayed or scaled back.
In the weeks after the European Commission unveiled the world's biggest package of green policies last July, wildfires ripped through the Mediterranean and floods ravaged western Europe. From Greece to Germany, governments called for urgent action to address climate change.
Seven months later, as EU policymakers are negotiating how to turn those proposals into binding laws, the political context is starkly different.
Europeans' energy bills are soaring. Gas prices ended Thursday 300% higher than in July, pushed upwards as the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Europe's top gas supplier, sharpened concerns of energy supply shocks. EU carbon prices are near record levels. Eurozone inflation is at an all-time high.
Brussels has billed Europe's green transition as its escape route from reliance on Russian energy and the 300 billion euros EU countries spend on oil and gas imports each year. It will require huge investments upfront, but ultimately bring down costs and give European industry an edge in global green technologies.
Immediate concerns about cost, however, are dominating negotiations on the climate proposals among EU countries and the European Parliament. A majority from both must approve the laws.
While soaring gas prices are the main driver of recent increases in energy bills, a growing number of states - especially from the bloc's poorer east - warn of public pushback if ambitious green goals hike costs in future.
""We used to be a fairly sizable group of countries arguing for more ambition. We're not a huge number left,"" one EU diplomat said.
CARBON MARKETS
The EU proposals are designed to deliver the bloc's target to cut emissions 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels, putting the world's third-biggest economy on a path that, if followed globally, could avoid global warming's worst impacts.
They include a 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel cars, taxes on polluting jet fuel and carbon border tariffs on imports of high-carbon goods. 
A proposed new emissions trading system (ETS) is particularly contentious. That would introduce carbon costs for transport and buildings - costs that fuel suppliers may pass on to consumers through higher bills.
""What is the cost and who will pay? We are warning that if we don't discuss this we will lose popular support for the whole project,"" said a senior diplomat from one EU country.
The Commission proposed using revenues from the new market to shield low-income households from the costs. Critics still warn of a political backlash.
Pascal Canfin, chair of the European Parliament's environment committee, said the ETS proposal was so contentious it could ""freeze the whole package"" of climate laws.
Groups representing more than 200 of the EU assembly's 705 lawmakers this month proposed amendments to scrap the new ETS, according to documents seen by Reuters.
Soaring energy costs are also looming over reforms of the EU's existing carbon market, which forces power plants and industry to buy permits when they emit CO2.
CO2 permit prices soared by 150% last year and are now trading around 90 euros per tonne - a near-record level that analysts say could incentivise key green industrial technologies such as CO2 capture facilities.
But as CO2 costs have increased, so too have calls for intervention to dampen price spikes. 
Parliament's lead negotiator this month proposed rules making it easier for policymakers to release more permits into the ETS if prices rise rapidly. Countries including Poland, Spain and Romania back the idea, although others warn against undermining the price signal for low-carbon investments. 
""Any intervention on pricing is undesirable,"" one EU diplomat said.
BALANCING ACT
The European Parliament and EU countries plan to confirm their positions on the biggest proposals, including the carbon market, by July. The Commission has urged negotiators to strike deals before a U.N. climate summit in November, strengthening the EU's diplomatic hand to convince other countries to improve their plans.
EU officials expect some talks to spill into 2023. Contentious proposals may be escalated to EU leaders, raising the bar for approval as they take decisions unanimously.
The challenge is to ensure that the final package will still deliver the EU's legally-binding emissions targets.
""Everybody's saying the targets are too high and too binding. The problem is that if you add all of those concerns, you are going to miss your 2030 target,"" said Lucie Mattera, head of think tank E3G's Brussels office.

Green lawmaker Bas Eickhout said he was optimistic some plans could be made more ambitious, such as proposals to expand renewable energy and tighten CO2 limits for cars.
""The member states on each file are becoming a bit more careful,"" Eickhout said. ""Well, they promised the 55% so they will have to deliver.""

BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and its allies on Saturday moved to block certain Russian banks' access to the SWIFT international payment system in further punishment of Moscow as it continues its military assault against Ukraine.
The measures, which will include restrictions on the Russian central bank's international reserves, will be implemented in the coming days, the nations said in a joint statement https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/26/joint-statement-on-further-restrictive-economic-measures that also vowed further action to come.
""We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin,"" the leaders of the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Great Britain, Canada and the United States wrote.
""Even beyond the measures we are announcing today, we are prepared to take further measures to hold Russia to account for its attack on Ukraine.""
The move comes after the United States and its allies slapped sanctions this week on major Russian banks as well as on President Vladimir Putin, among others, as Moscow's forces pushed into the heart of Ukraine toward Kyiv.
""As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, we are resolved to continue imposing massive costs on Russia. Costs that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies,"" said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the European Union's executive.
The actions are aimed at preventing Putin from using $630 billion in central bank foreign currency reserves in the invasion of Ukraine and to defend a plunging rouble.
Cutting Russian banks out of the SWIFT system - the world's main international payments network - deals a blow to Russian trade and makes it harder for Russian companies to do business. 
""Putin's government is getting kicked off the international financial system,"" a senior U.S. administration official said.
SWIFT, or the ""Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication"", is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments, making international trade flow smoothly and transferring trillions of dollars each year in what has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade.
""We are engaging with European authorities to understand the details of the entities that will be subject to the new measures and we are preparing to comply upon legal instruction,"" SWIFT said in a statement. 
The U.S. official told reporters that if one of the banks cut off from SWIFT wants to make a payment with a bank outside of Russia, it will likely need to use a phone or fax machine. But the official said most banks worldwide would likely stop all transactions with Russian banks removed from the network.
The United States and its allies will finalize the list of banks that will by cut off from SWIFT, the official said, adding that banks already under U.S. and European sanctions would be the first ones considered. 
'WAR CHEST'
U.S. President Joe Biden announced sanctions on Thursday that were aimed at limiting Russia's ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen. Among the targets were five major Russian banks including state-backed Sberbank and VTB, the country's two largest lenders. 
At the time, Biden said there was no agreement to take action on SWIFT - suggesting that the view of allies who were holdouts had since turned heavily against Putin. 
The new measures will stop Russia from ""using its war chest,"" von der Leyen said, paralyzing the assets of its central bank, freezing its transactions and making it impossible for the central bank to liquidate its assets.
""We're disarming fortress Russia by taking this action,"" the U.S. official said, adding that other actions targeting the central bank could be finalized over the weekend.
The United States slapped sanctions on Iran's central bank in 2019 following attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia that were claimed by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen. 
At the time, then-U.S. President Donald Trump said the moves, aimed at cutting off Iran's remaining funding sources, were ""the highest sanctions ever imposed on a country.""
""Sanctioning the central bank - that has got to be the biggest hammer left in the tool shed,"" said Paul Marquardt, a lawyer with Davis Polk in Washington where he advises clients on U.S. sanctions.
The allies on Saturday also pledged to limit the sale of citizenship via so-called golden passports used by some wealthy Russians to gain residency in Western nations and access to their financial systems.
The partners will also launch a task force to ""identify, hunt down and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs, their yachts, their mansions, and any ill-gotten gains that we can find and freeze.""
EU foreign ministers will discuss the sanctions package at a virtual meeting on Sunday evening, the fourth time they come together in a week. 

Edward Fishman, an Atlantic Council fellow who worked on Russia sanctions at the State Department during the Obama administration, said the measures announced on Saturday are a significant escalation.
By signaling their joint commitment to the moves, Fishman said, the West was ""giving Putin one more chance to back down before they unleash the full range of the economic arsenal on Russia.""

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A decision by Western allies on Saturday to block ""selected"" Russian banks from the SWIFT payments system will inflict a crippling economic blow, but also cause much pain to their own companies and banks. And the allies still have room to do more. 
The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is a secure messaging system to ensure rapid cross-border payments which has become the principal mechanism to finance international trade. 
Russian banks denied access to SWIFT will find it harder to communicate with peers internationally, even in friendly countries such as China, slowing trade and making transactions costlier.
But the allies, who also vowed curbs on Russian's central bank to limit its ability to support the rouble, have not yet said which banks would be targeted. That would be crucial to the measure's impact, said sanctions and banking experts.
""The devil will be in the details,"" said Edward Fishman, an expert on economic sanctions at the Eurasia Center of the Atlantic Council think tank. ""Let's see which banks they select.""
If the list covered the largest Russian banks, such as Sberbank, VTB, and Gazprombank, it would be ""an absolutely huge deal,"" he wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Sberbank and VTB have previously said that they were prepared for any developments. 
The decision to kick some banks off SWIFT, though not all, could encourage ""nesting"", in which Russian entities turn to non-sanctioned banks and large multinationals instead in a bid to access the global financial system, one expert said.
Such a workaround for the Russians would create compliance headaches for global banks.
""It really is a dagger into the heart of Russian banks,” said Kim Manchester, whose firm provides financial intelligence training programs to institutions. 
Manchester said the Biden administration had been selective in its sanctions, leaving room to tighten further by blocking more banks and eventually imposing a blanket ban. ""It is a creeping barrage.""
DEVASTATING BLOW 
The impact is likely to be devastating for the Russian economy and markets.
The sanctions are likely to hit the rouble hard when markets open on Monday, said Sergey Aleksashenko, a former deputy chairman of the Russian central bank who now lives in the United States, leading to the disappearance of many imports to Russia. 
""This is the end of a significant part of the economy,"" Aleksashenko added. ""Half the consumer market is going to disappear. These goods will disappear if payments can't be made for them.""
But the impact could be blunted if the listed banks were limited to those already sanctioned and Russia's central bank was given time to transfer assets elsewhere, said one former senior Russian banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
""If it is the banks that are already sanctioned, it doesn't really make a difference. But if it is the top 30 Russian banks then that is an entirely different matter,"" he said.
""It all sounds very loud and everyone is very glad, but in reality it is a political statement.""
Previously announced U.S. sanctions against a handful of Russian banks including Sberbank and VTB, took direct aim at the vast majority of about $46 billion worth of daily foreign exchange transactions by Russian financial institutions. Those sanctions targeted nearly 80% of all banking assets in Russia. 
As an alternative to SWIFT, Russia has set up its own network, the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS).
It sent about 2 million messages in 2020, or about a fifth of Russian internal traffic, says the central bank, which aims to up this share to 30% in 2023.
But SPFS, which limits the size of messages and operates only on weekdays, has found it hard to add foreign members.
'FINANCIAL NUCLEAR WEAPON'
The decision to block Russian banks from SWIFT has been fraught.
Over the past few days, even as Ukraine urged Western nations to kick Russia off the payments system and was backed by countries such as Britain, others, such as Germany, worried about the possible impact on their economies and companies. 
The SWIFT ban was a ""financial nuclear weapon,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Friday. ""When you have a nuclear weapon in your hands, you think before using it,"" he told reporters.
The tide shifted, however, as Russian forces launched an assault on Kyiv and hopes of a diplomatic resolution faded.
Earlier on Saturday, Germany, which has the EU's biggest trade flows with Russia, softened its stance and suggested it was looking for a way to remove Russia from SWIFT while trying to limit the collateral damage.
Manchester, the financial intelligence trainer, said the partial ban would force Russian banks to get more creative in accessing the financial system. 
Multinationals with large treasury operations and banks with SWIFT access could become the new hubs of financial transactions out of Russia. 
Nesting, he said, was a massive concern for global banks, which would have to ensure that any transactions they support do not violate Western sanctions.
Manchester said he spoke on Friday to a contact in the financial crimes division of a global bank.

Such banks could face heavy regulatory penalties if they dropped the ball on sanctions, he added.
""They are burning the midnight oil to make sense of everything that’s going on,"" Manchester said.

The official said that recent reports that some Chinese banks have stopped issuing letters of credit for purchases of physical commodities from Russia were a positive sign.
This ""suggests that, much like has been the pattern for years and years, China has tended to respect the force of U.S. sanctions,"" the official added.
China is Russia's biggest trade partner for both exports and imports, buying a third of Russia's crude oil exports in 2020 and supplying it with manufactured products from cell phones and computers to toys and clothing.
The China-Russia trade relationship has grown significantly since 2014, when the West first imposed sanctions against Russian entities over Moscow's annexation of Crimea.

Some of that trade is conducted in China's yuan currency, which could technically fall outside of sanctions aimed at cutting Russia off from transactions in U.S. dollars, euros, sterling and other major currencies.
But Chinese banks that do business with Russian banks and other entities hit with full blocking sanctions and put on the Treasury's ""specially designated nationals"" list could face sanctions themselves and loss of access to the U.S. financial system.

The official said that if China were to help Russia evade U.S. sanctions, ""it really would be an unfortunate signal for China's vision of the world,"" and give ""tacit or explicit accommodation to Russia's invasion of a sovereign country in the heart of Europe.""
""It would do profound damage to its reputation in Europe, but really across the world,"" the official said of China.

(Reuters) - The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada announced new sanctions on Russia on Saturday - including blocking certain lenders' access to the SWIFT international payment system - following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Thursday.
Below are details on the measures proposed so far:
SWITCHING OFF SWIFT
Washington and its partners started to deploy what was widely seen as one of the harshest sanction measures: barring banks from SWIFT - a step that will stop lenders from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and, according to the statement, effectively curb Russian exports and imports.
The step, which will include restrictions on the central bank's international reserves, will be implemented in the coming days, the nations said in a joint statement that also vowed further action.
It was not immediately clear which Russian banks would be removed from SWIFT, but Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the move would ensure those selected were ""disconnected from the international financial system"" in a way that would ""harm their ability to operate globally.""
SWIFT is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries. 
BANKS & FINANCIAL FIRMS 
The United States and Britain announced restrictions that, combined with previous sanctions, would in effect kick the vast majority of Russian banking assets out of both countries. New targets included Sberbank and VTB Bank, Russia's two largest lenders.
U.S. banks must sever correspondent banking ties - allowing banks to make payments between one another and move money around the globe - with Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, within 30 days.
Officials in Washington also wielded their most powerful sanctioning tool, adding VTB, Otkritie, Novikombank and Sovcombank to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list - effectively kicking them out of the U.S. financial system, banning trade with Americans and freezing their U.S. assets. 
EU leaders have agreed sanctions targeting 70% of the Russian banking market and important state-owned companies, including in defence. 
Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system and sanctions will be felt far beyond its borders. Data from the Bank for International Settlements showed European lenders hold the lion's share of the around $120 billion in foreign banks' exposure to Russia.
According to data from Russia's central bank, total Russian banking foreign assets and liabilities stood at $200.6 billion and $134.5 billion, respectively, with the U.S.-dollar share amounting to around 53% of both, down from 76%-81% two decades ago. 
SOVEREIGN DEBT & CAPITAL MARKETS
Britain announced it would ban Russian sovereign debt sales in London. Russia has issued 4.1 billion pounds of sovereign debt in London since the beginning of 2020.
The coming package of EU measures will ""target the ability of the Russian state and government to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services, to limit the financing of escalatory and aggressive policies,"" the bloc said. It will ban EU investors from trading in Russian state bonds. 
Washington announced new restrictions on dealings in Russia sovereign debt on Tuesday. Americans - already barred from investing in Russian sovereign debt directly - will be banned from purchasing it in the secondary market after March 1.
Even before the latest events, access to Russian bonds had become increasingly restricted. 
U.S. sanctions imposed in 2015 made future Russian dollar debt ineligible for many investors and key indexes. In April 2021, President Joe Biden barred U.S. investors from buying new Russian rouble bonds over accusations of Russian election meddling. 
The curbs have cut Russia's external debt by 33% since early 2014 - from $733 billion to $489 billion in the third quarter of 2021. 
INDIVIDUALS
The U.S., the EU and Britain have already imposed asset freezes, travel bans and other curbs on Russian individuals. 
Britain announced sanctions on more than 100 Russian individuals and entities, including an asset freeze and travel ban on Yelena Georgieva, chair of the board of Novikombank; Pyotr Fradkov, Promsvyazbank chairman; Denis Bortnikov, VTB deputy president; Kirill Shamalov, President Vladimir Putin's former son-in-law; and United Aircraft's Yury Slyusar.
Britain will also introduce legislation to limit deposits that Russian nationals can hold in UK bank accounts. The limit will be 50,000 pounds ($66,860) at British banks.
Washington sanctioned Fradkov and Bortnikov on Tuesday, as well as Vladimir Kiriyenko, the son of a former prime minister. 
On Thursday, Washington targeted others close to Putin, including Sergei Ivanov, CEO of Russian state-owned diamond mining company Alrosa; Andrey Patrushev, who has served in leadership roles at Russian state-owned gas company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP); and Ivan Sechin, reportedly a deputy head of a department at energy company Rosneft. 
Biden said on Thursday he would consider personal sanctions on Putin, a move Moscow has said would not harm the Russian president personally but would prove ""politically destructive"".
The EU has already imposed sanctions on five people who were involved in a Russian parliamentary election in annexed Crimea last September, and said it would blacklist all lawmakers who voted to recognise two regions controlled by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, freeze any assets they have in the EU and ban them from travelling to the bloc. 
ENERGY CORPORATES & NORD STREAM 2
The United States and the EU already have sanctions in place on Russia's energy and defence sectors, with state-owned gas company Gazprom, its oil arm Gazpromneft and oil producers Lukoil, Rosneft and Surgutneftegaz facing various types of curbs on exports/imports and debt-raising. 
Sanctions could be deepened, with one possible option being to prevent companies settling in U.S. dollars. 
Nord Stream 2, a recently completed pipeline from Russia to Germany, was awaiting regulatory approval by EU and German authorities before Berlin put its certification on ice. 
The U.S. on Wednesday imposed sanctions on the company in charge of building Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
CURBING TECHNOLOGY
The EU has vowed to introduce measures to crimp Russia's technological position in key areas - from high-tech components to cutting-edge software.

The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday it was implementing export controls that will severely restrict Russia’s access to semiconductors, computers, telecommunications, information security equipment, lasers, and sensors that it needs to sustain its military capabilities. 
Similar measures were deployed during the Cold War, when sanctions kept the Soviet Union technologically backward and crimped economic growth.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States, Britain and European Union ratcheted up sanctions against Moscow on Saturday as Russia continued its assault against Ukraine, saying they would block access to the SWIFT international payment system.
Here is a rundown of how sanctions which have already been announced impact banks and investors:
WHAT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED SO FAR?
The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada committed on Saturday to removing some Russian banks from the SWIFT payments system, deploying what the French finance minister had earlier called a ""financial nuclear weapon"" because of the damage it would cause to Russia as well as its trading partners. 
The latest round of sanctions came after the U.S. Treasury Department said it was targeting the ""core infrastructure"" of Russia's financial system, sanctioning two of its largest banks - state-backed Sberbank and VTB. Also on the sanctions list are Otkritie, Sovcombank and Novikombank and some senior executives at state-owned banks. 
U.S. banks must sever their correspondent banking ties - which allow banks to make payments between one another and move money around the globe - with Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, within 30 days.
Officials in Washington also wielded the government's most powerful sanctioning tool, adding VTB, Otkritie, Novikombank and Sovcombank to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. The move effectively kicks the banks out of the U.S. financial system, bans their trade with Americans and freezes their U.S. assets.
The U.S. sanctions also target two Belarusian state-owned banks - Belinvestbank and Bank Dabrabyt - over the country's support for Moscow's attack. 
The U.S. sanctions came soon after the British government said it would impose an asset freeze on all major Russian banks, including VTB, and stop major Russian companies from raising finance in Britain. 
Russian banks would be cut off from sterling markets and clearing payments, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.
Britain also announced asset freezes and travel bans on members of Russia's political and financial elite, including those who have long enjoyed high-rolling London lifestyles. 
More than 100 individuals, entities and subsidiaries will ultimately be sanctioned. 
EU leaders have agreed sanctions on Moscow that target 70% of the Russian banking market, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday.
The bloc imposed a ban on issuing bonds, shares or loans in the EU for refinancing Alfa Bank and Bank Otkritie, after freezing assets at Rossiya Bank, Promsvyazbank and VEB earlier in the week.
The top three Russian banks Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank, however, do not face an EU asset freeze.
The bloc also set a cap of 100,000 euros ($112,700.00) for EU bank accounts of Russian citizens, who will not be allowed to buy euro denominated shares.
Refinancing in the EU of Russian state-owned enterprises is also forbidden, with the exception of some utilities. Securities settlement houses in the EU will not be allowed to serve Russian counterparties.
WHAT NEXT?
Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system, meaning any sanctions on the biggest institutions could be felt far beyond its borders. Cutting them from SWIFT would make transactions more difficult and costlier.
But it is also expected to hurt the country's trading partners in Europe and elsewhere. While further details are awaited, Germany suggested on Saturday that the allies were looking for ""targeted and functional restriction of SWIFT"" to limit collateral damage.
A ban from SWIFT would come on top of other sanctions that limit the ability of some of Russia's largest banks to do business internationally.
U.S. Treasury said Thursday's sanctions would disrupt billions of dollars worth of daily foreign exchange transactions conducted by Russian financial institutions. Overall, these institutions conduct about $46 billion worth of forex transactions, 80% of which are in dollars. ""The vast majority of those transactions will now be disrupted,"" it said.
The sanctions target nearly 80% of all banking assets in Russia. 
Sberbank said that it was prepared for any developments.
VTB said it had prepared for the most severe scenario. 
Sovcombank, Otkritie and Novikombank did not reply to requests for comment. The Russian embassy in the United States also did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
WHAT WOULD HIT HARDEST?
Banks and Western creditors have been fearing Russia getting blocked from SWIFT, which is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries.
Such a move would hit Russian banks hard but the consequences are complex. Western officials have said blocking Russia is technically difficult and would hurt trading partners. There have been concerns, for example, about how payments for Russian energy imports would be made and whether foreign creditors would get paid.
Analysts said Russian institutions are better able to cope with sanctions than eight years earlier, although that does not mean they would not hurt.
WHICH FOREIGN BANKS ARE MOST EXPOSED?
Many foreign banks have significantly reduced their exposure to Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014 but several Western banks have been involved in deals and have other relationships.
Shares of banks with significant operations in Russia such as Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International and France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) were hard hit last week.
Italian and French banks each had outstanding claims of some $25 billion on Russia in the third quarter of 2021, based on Bank of International Settlement figures.

Austrian banks had $17.5 billion. That compares with $14.7 billion for the United States.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union, along with the United States and other Western partners, has announced further sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, including cutting off a number of Russian banks from the SWIFT interbank payments system.
SWIFT is the world's main international payments network. Here is more about what it does and why it matters:
WHAT IS SWIFT?
SWIFT, or the ""Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication"", is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments, making international trade flow smoothly. 
Banks which connect to the SWIFT system and establish relationships with other banks can use SWIFT messages to make payments.
The messages are secure so that payment instructions are typically honoured without question. This allows banks to process high volumes of transactions at speed. 
It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, around 38 million SWIFT 'FIN messages' were sent each day over the SWIFT platform, according to its 2020 Annual Review. Each year, trillions of dollars are transferred using the system.
WHO OWNS SWIFT?
SWIFT, founded in the 1970s, is a co-operative of thousands of member institutions which use the service. 
Based in Belgium, SWIFT made a profit of €36 million in 2020, according to its 2020 Annual Review. It is run principally as a service to its members.
WHY IS A SWIFT BAN SO SERIOUS?
Excluding Russian banks from SWIFT restricts the country’s access to financial markets across the world.
Russian companies and individuals will find it harder to pay for imports and receive cash for exports, borrow or invest overseas.
Russian banks could use other channels for payments such as phones, messaging apps or email. That would let Russian banks make payments via banks in countries which have not imposed sanctions but since alternatives are likely to be less efficient and secure, transaction volumes could fall and costs rise.
HOW WOULD SWIFT BAN ON RUSSIA AFFECT OTHER COUNTRIES?
Exporters would find selling goods to Russia riskier and more expensive.
Russia is a big buyer of manufactured goods. The Netherlands and Germany are its second and third biggest trading partners, based on World Bank data, although Russia is not a top 10 export market for either country.
Foreign buyers of Russian goods would also find it more difficult, potentially prompting them to seek alternative suppliers.
But when it comes to Russian oil and gas, foreign buyers could find it harder to find replacement suppliers.
Russia is the main EU supplier of crude oil, natural gas and solid fossil fuels, according to the European Commission https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/energy/bloc-2c.html. 
IS SWIFT BOUND BY ECONOMIC SANCTIONS?
SWIFT is bound by Belgian and European Union rules, which would include economic sanctions.

SWIFT's website says: ""Whilst sanctions are imposed independently in different jurisdictions around the world, SWIFT cannot arbitrarily choose which jurisdiction's sanction regime to follow."" 
In March 2012, the European Union barred SWIFT from serving Iranian firms and individuals which had been sanctioned in relation to Tehran's nuclear programme. The list included the central bank and other big banks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada on Saturday moved to block Russia's access to the SWIFT international payment system as part of another round of sanctions against Moscow as it continues its assault against Ukraine.
The measures, which will also include restriction on the Russian central bank's international reserves, will be implemented in the coming days, the nations said in a joint statement.

The sanctions, agreed with the United States, France, Canada, Italy, Great Britain and the European Commission also include limiting the ability of Russia's central bank to support the rouble.

The will also end the ""golden passports"" for wealthy Russians and their families and will target individuals and institutions in Russia and elsewhere that supports the war against Ukraine, the spokesperson said. 
""The countries stressed their willingness to take further measures should Russia not end its attack on Ukraine and thus on the European peace order,"" he added.

""What you have seen just today is more countries joining the call of the UK to use SWIFT,"" Johnson said. He said more countries had said they would not block cutting Russia off from SWIFT. 
""Things are not going all the way [of] President Putin,"" Johnson said of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

601,"<span>Feb 26, 2022 01:56PM ET</span>","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany changed its position on Saturday about imposing restrictions on Russia's access to the SWIFT global interbank payment system, joining other Western powers in support of harsher sanctions aimed at halting Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""We are urgently working on how to limit the collateral damage of decoupling from SWIFT in such a way that it affects the right people. What we need is a targeted and functional restriction of SWIFT,"" Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Economy Minister Robert Habeck said in a statement.
Germany, which has the EU's biggest trade flows with Russia, had been reluctant to get on board with cutting off Russia from the world's main international payments network, saying it must first weigh the economic consequences of such move.
Berlin's change of heart comes as Russian forces continued to pound Kyiv and other cities with artillery and cruise missiles on day three of a campaign that has sent hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing west toward the European Union, clogging major highways and railway lines.
The move would hit Russian trade and make it harder for Russian companies to do business. SWIFT is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments and is the principal mechanism for financing international trade.
Earlier on Saturday, Italy, the other European Union member that had voiced reservations over taking such a step, said it would support Russia's disconnection from the payment system.
Greece also joined the EU line on SWIFT and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said his government would not block any planned EU sanctions.

""This is the time to be united, it's a war,"" Orban said.
The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said a decision on SWIFT could happen in the ""coming days"".

PARIS (Reuters) - Discussions among European Union members about excluding Russia from the Swift international payment system are close to reaching a successful conclusion, a French presidential official said on Saturday.
The official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, said that no EU member state was blocking Russia's exclusion from the system, but that the talks were still ongoing.

603,"<span>Feb 26, 2022 11:50AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - The European Union has imposed two packages of sanctions on Russia for launching an ""unprecedented and unprovoked military attack against Ukraine"". 
Further sanctions, including the suspension of Russia's access to the global SWIFT payment system, could follow. The measures come on top of sanctions already in place since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
According to the EU, the sanctions are designed ""to cripple the Kremlin's ability to finance the war, impose clear economic and political costs on Russia's political elite responsible for the invasion and diminish (Russia's) economic base"".
This is a list of the measures imposed so far:
BLACKLISTINGS
The EU has blacklisted hundreds of additional people, many of them members of the Russian parliament who voted for the recognition of the breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. Their bank accounts in the EU are now frozen and they are banned from travelling to the bloc. 
The most prominent individuals on the blacklist are Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, although they are exempt from the travel ban. This is meant to enable negotiations with them should the opportunity arise.
Still, Putin is now one of only three world leaders blacklisted by the EU, along with Syria's Bashar al-Assad and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus. The blacklist currently includes 654 individuals and 52 entities in total.
SANCTIONS TARGETING FINANCE AND ECONOMY
Sanctions targeting Russia's economy are designed to cut the country's access to EU capital markets, increase borrowing costs for those sanctioned and gradually erode its industrial base. 
They include an asset freeze and financial ban on three key Russian banks, add more state-owned companies to the sanctions list and ban Russian elites from depositing money in EU banks. 
The sanctions also prohibit any form of lending and buying of securities by Russian banks and government, including the Russian central bank. 
Seventy percent of the Russian banking system (measured by assets), government and key state-owned companies will no longer be able to refinance in the EU's capital markets, according to EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen.
ENERGY SECTOR
The sanctions ban the export of specific refining technologies, making it harder and more expensive for Russia to modernise its oil refineries. They add to an existing oil equipment ban imposed in 2014. Russia earned 24 billion euros in 2019 from refined oil exports to the EU, according to the bloc.
TRANSPORT SECTOR
The EU has banned the export, sale, supply or transfer of all aircraft, aircraft parts and equipment to Russia as well as all services related to the repair, maintenance and financing of aircraft. 
Three-quarters of Russia's commercial air fleet were built in the EU, United States and Canada, according to the EU. The sanctions mean that ""Russia will not be able to maintain its fleet to international standards"", the EU said.
DUAL-USE GOODS AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY
The EU has toughened existing sanctions on goods that can be used for civilian as well as military purposes, targeting Russia's military-industrial complex and limiting its access to advanced technology such as drones and software for drones, software for encryption devices, semiconductors and advanced electronics. 
These measures are meant to downgrade Russia's technological capabilities over time.
DIPLOMAT VISAS
Russian holders of diplomat passports will no longer enjoy visa-free travel to the EU, and Russian government officials and business people will no longer benefit from lower fees when applying for a visa. This measure will not apply to Russian citizens in general, who will retain the benefits they currently have.

TRADE WITH BREAKAWAY REGIONS IN UKRAINE
The EU has imposed an import ban on goods from breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, on doing business with tourism services there and on exports of certain goods and technologies.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers remain open to accelerating their exit from bond buys even as the war in Ukraine raises uncertainty, and their biggest debate may be whether to put a firm end-date on the stimulus scheme, sources told Reuters.
With inflation pressures building faster than expected, the ECB had been all but certain to signal the end of bond purchases at its March 10 meeting. But the war in Ukraine has thrown those plans into turmoil, prompting policymakers to reassess the outlook. 
Six sources close to the discussion say that a faster exit is still necessary as inflation could be around double the ECB's 2% target this year, with even medium term inflation at risk of overshooting.
""Inflation is higher and broader. And it's no longer just energy, but food prices, too,"" one of the sources, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. ""It would be inappropriate not to act on this."" 
Russia and Ukraine are both major grain exporters and the conflict risks pushing up food price inflation further. 
Inflation projections have been notoriously inaccurate in recent quarters so policymakers may put greater weight on current readings, including the February figure, due next week, the sources added.
An ECB spokesperson declined to comment. At a news conference on Friday, ECB chief Christine Lagarde said it was premature to speculate about the March decision as policymakers will decide based on data available to them at the time.
The problem is that, while temporary, high inflation could seep into the broader economy, lifting wages and prices, entrenching high consumer price growth.
The ECB was already due to cut its bond buying over the coming quarters but aimed to keep the purchases open-ended.
An end-date is crucial, however, as it has implications for any interest rate hike. Since the bank has signalled there will be no rate increase before the bond buys end, indefinite purchases also push out the timing of any rate hike.
""One option would be to signal our intent to end the bond buys in the third quarter but not make a firm commitment,"" a second source said.
This is likely to be a sticking point as policymakers in the dovish camp argue for ""flexibility and optionality"".
""I bet the end date will be the biggest debate, I think that's still an open issue,"" a third source said.
The sources agreed the ECB should make no commitment on rate hikes.

They also said policymakers are likely to agree in March on loosening the link between bond buying and any rate move. The bank's current guidance is that bond buys will end ""shortly before"" an interest rate rise.
The ""shortly"" may create undue expectations and tie the ECB's hand so it could be dropped, the sources said.

""If you ask me to share one conviction with you this morning, it is that this crisis is here to stay, this war is here to stay,"" Macron told the Paris farm show on Saturday. 
Trade restrictions resulting from EU sanctions on Russia will weigh on French exports such as wine and grains, Macron said, while a further rise in energy prices will hit livestock farming. 
""We are building a resilience plan,"" Macron said, adding measures would be taken to protect farmers from cost pressures and compensate lost revenues. 
A surge in commodity prices in the past year has benefited grain producers but squeezed livestock farmers for whom grain feed is a major cost. The government announced at the end of January a 270 million euro ($304 million) relief package for the pork sector.
The crisis in Ukraine is increasing volatility in agricultural markets, with Paris wheat futures hitting a record high on Thursday. Farmers are also worried the crisis could exacerbate supply tensions in fertilisers and disrupt the spring growing season for crops.
The annual Paris farm show, the Salon de l'Agriculture, is a major occasion in France and, coming less than two months before the first round of presidential elections, has drawn the major candidates. 
French commentators long expected Macron could use his presence at the show to officially announce he will be running for a second term, a fact nobody in France doubts. 
But international crises, above all Russia's invasion in Ukraine, have thwarted the president's calendar several times. 

While Macron spent over 12 hours at the Salon's last edition in 2020, trying to reassure farmers over the impact of Brexit and a reform of the EU's farm policy, he only spoke on Saturday for about 15 minutes.

It was not immediately clear which individuals or entities would be targeted by such sanctions. The officials told Reuters Tokyo will coordinate with other members of the Group of Seven industrial powers.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman declined comment. The office of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida could not immediately be reached for comment.
The U.S. sanctions over Thursday's invasion include 24 Belarusian individuals and entities, the U.S. Treasury Department said.

Japan has announced sanctions on Russia over the invasion, with Kishida terming Moscow's moves an unacceptable violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and international law.
Russian troops were advancing toward the capital Kyiv on Friday even as Russia and Ukraine signalled an openness to negotiations, in the wake of the invasion from the north,east and south, an attack that threatens to upendEurope's post-Cold War order.

615,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 08:31PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canada, the United States, Britain and the European Union on Friday said they could act to exclude Russia from the SWIFT global interbank payments system in a further round of sanctions aimed at halting Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Such a move could happen in coming days after officials in two European countries that had voiced reservations - Germany and Italy - softened their opposition against kicking Russia out of the world's main international payments network, U.S. and European officials said.
Doing so would hit Russian trade and make it harder for Russian companies to do business. SWIFT is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments and is the principal mechanism for financing international trade.
It would mark a further escalation of concerted sanctions imposed by Western powers against Russia this week, including rare sanctions aimed personally at Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday.
Western powers are racing to ratchet up pressure on Moscow after Russian forces early on Thursday launched the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two.
Earlier this week, sanctions were announced targeting Russian banks, oligarch and exports announced.
Barring Russia from SWIFT could be part of a further round of sanctions, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said on Friday.
Italy, which had been reluctant to take that step, on Friday said it would not veto proposals to ban Russia and pledged to continue working in unison with its EU partners.
Germany, which has the EU's biggest trade flows with Russia, is also open to banning Russia from SWIFT, but must calculate the consequences for its economy, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Friday.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country strongly supported barring Russia from the system. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on leaders of NATO member countries on Friday to take immediate action to remove Russia from SWIFT.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said a decision on SWIFT could happen in the ""coming days.""

White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said removing Russia from SWIFT ""remains an option on the table"" and underscored President Joe Biden's preference to take steps together with allies.
Another U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said further Western sanctions were expected if the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, fell, something Western officials now believe could happen within days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will nominate Jay Shambaugh, a George Washington University professor and former Obama administration economic adviser, as the U.S. Treasury's next undersecretary for international affairs, the White House said on Friday.
Biden also will nominate William Duncan as ambassador to El Salvador and Lesslie Viguerie as ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic, the White House said. Both are career Foreign Service officers.
If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Shambaugh, an expert in international monetary and exchange rate policy, will fill a long-vacant post as the Treasury's top financial diplomat, working to coordinate economic policy with foreign governments.
Andy Baukol, a Treasury career assistant secretary, has been serving as acting undersecretary and leading Treasury's negotiations in the G7 and G20 groupings of major economies.
David Lipton, a senior Treasury adviser and former No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund, also has been helping to guide Treasury's international policies for the past year.
Shambaugh's nomination comes as the administration seeks to rally international support for stiff financial sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine and coordinate policies to sustain the COVID-19 recovery and fight inflation.
As undersecretary for international affairs, Shambaugh would be the Treasury's point person for relations with China and oversee the Treasury's dominant shareholdings in the IMF and the World Bank, which will play significant roles in the aftermath of the Ukraine conflict.
Shambaugh served as a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 2015 to 2017 during the Obama administration and previously served on the CEA staff as senior economist for international economics and chief economist. He served on the Biden administration's CEA transition team.
As a tenured professor of economics and international affairs at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs since 2013, Shambaugh's research has focused on the interaction of exchange rate regimes with monetary policy, capital flows and trade flows, according to his website.
Michael Klein, a Tufts University international economic affairs professor who taught Shambaugh in the 1990s, said his former student will bring rigorous analysis to the job. 

""He does very careful empirical work, asking fundamental questions,"" said Klein, who wrote a 2009 book with Shambaugh.
From 2017 to 2020, Shambaugh also led the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project, a grouping of academics and business leaders that promotes broader participation in economic growth. He holds a doctorate in economics from the University of California-Berkeley.

(Reuters) - U.S. curbs on exports to Russia for invading Ukraine look tough at first glance, but exemptions on everything from mobile phones to airplane parts coupled with the difficulty of policing shipments suggest a softer economic blow.
The restrictions imposed on Thursday, and similar measures being adopted by the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand, Canada and other countries, are meant to hurt Russia over time.
But numerous exceptions weaken the new 86-page U.S. rule.
""When you really parse this out, this is not a full-scale embargo by any means,"" said Washington trade lawyer Doug Jacobson.
""There are a lot of carveouts,"" he noted, such as cellphones for Russian civilians, certain oil field equipment, and aircraft parts necessary for flight safety.
Peter Harrell, on the White House National Security Council, said a month ago the United States would spare the average Russian from penalties and instead degrade Russia's key industries and cost its military. The restrictions are based on who will use the technology, as well as the items.
In announcing the curbs on Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden said that ""between our actions and those of our allies and partners, we estimate that we will cut off more than half of Russia's high-tech imports.""
The impact relies on multilateral cooperation and a dramatic expansion of the so-called Foreign Direct Product Rule, forcing companies that make tech items in other countries with U.S. tools to seek licenses from the United States before shipping to Russia.
Certain partner countries planning to adopt similar measures, however, are not subject to the new U.S. foreign direct product measures.
U.S. exports to Russia were less than $5 billion in 2020, according to Commerce Department statistics, but a senior Commerce official said the historic multilateral cooperation means that more than $50 billion in key inputs to Russia may be restricted.
The measures allow for exports of consumer items such as humanitarian goods and household electronics. Consumer communications devices, like cellphones and certain laptops, are permitted as long as they are not sent to entities that support the military, Russian government employees or certain affiliates.
Blocking access to all consumer technology would undermine the work of Russians opposing Putin's repression, the senior Commerce Department official said. It would also hurt independent media.
""You can make a good argument that a better strategy would have been to do a much broader blanket thing, and if that hurts the average Russian, that's OK,"" said William Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official.
The rule's complexities are a double-edged sword, Reinsch said. ""The more complicated you make it, the harder it is to comply on the part of businesses.""
But few large companies depend on the Russian market and some exporters may just cut off Russia because it is too complicated, he added.
""It's simpler for a company to say we're going to have nothing to do with it. Stop all sales.""
One chipmaker said it had halted all supplies to Russia while figuring out which exports would violate the rules. 
Enforcement may be tough. For example, it is hard to track a semiconductor made with U.S. technology in one country if it is later sent to a Russian company that supports the military through an intermediary, said Cordell Hull, another former Commerce official.
""The U.S. government will need to use every source available to it to ensure compliance with the rule."" 

The Commerce Department plans to use its special agents, export control officers posted overseas, and analytic and investigative resources to identify violators, the senior official said.
Much depends on the cooperation and expertise of foreign manufacturers, along with physical inspections by non-U.S. enforcement authorities.

PARIS (Reuters) -Qatar Airways has asked a UK court to reinstate an order for 50 Airbus A321neo passenger jets that the European planemaker revoked as part of a bitter dispute over the partial grounding of larger A350s, a court filing showed on Friday.
Failing that, the Gulf carrier is asking a UK judge to award the airline unquantified damages over the planemaker's decision to withdraw what it described as a ""unique"" plane as it prepares to receive the 220-seat A321neo from February next year.
Airbus declined comment on the filing.
The claim is the latest salvo in a months-old contractual and safety dispute that has brought relations between two of the industry's largest players to an all-time low.
The two sides are at loggerheads over erosion to the painted surface and gaps in lightning protection on A350 jets.
So far, the airline has said Qatar authorities have grounded 21 of its 53 A350s over safety concerns, prompting the airline to sue Airbus for more than $600 million as it prepares for an influx of visitors ahead of this year's FIFA World Cup.
In the new filing, Qatar Airways disclosed that a further A350 had been grounded on Feb. 13.
Airbus has acknowledged quality problems but accused the airline of mislabelling them as safety woes to get compensation. European regulators have said the problems do not amount to an airworthiness issue on the jet, which is not grounded elsewhere.
SEVERE DISRUPTION
As the A350 row heated up, Airbus last month cancelled the order for A321neos, saying Qatar had breached a clause linking the two deals. Days later, Qatar placed a provisional order for at least 25 competing Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX. [L1N2U029N]
Despite that, Friday's filing sang the praises of the Airbus model, saying it had no available equivalent in a section designed to support its request to have the deal reinstated.
Qatar also asked the division of London's High Court to order Airbus not to try resell the A321neos, which are in high demand. Airbus is sold out until 2028 on that model and Qatar would otherwise face ""severe disruption,"" it said.
Details of the airline's claim emerged as Airbus was expected to issue a counter-claim in the A350 dispute. 
A spokesperson confirmed Airbus had filed documents but declined to provide details ahead of their publication.

The planemaker has insisted in preliminary hearings that the A350 is safe to fly and suggested its own interests could be damaged if it were forced to go ahead and build the A321neos while waiting for the outcome of a potentially long spat. 
Even so, Airbus has been ordered to preserve the status quo until a hearing due in April.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House asked Congress on Friday to approve $6.4 billion in aid to address the humanitarian and security crisis in Ukraine after Russia invaded the country this week, Biden administration and congressional aides said.
""In a recent conversation with lawmakers, the administration identified the need for additional U.S. humanitarian, security, and economic assistance to Ukraine and Central European partners due to Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion,"" an official from the White House Office of Management and Budget said.
The request included $2.9 billion in security and humanitarian assistance and $3.5 billion for the Department of Defense.
Congressional aides said the administration had made the request on Friday at a briefing for staff from congressional leadership offices and relevant committees, including the appropriations committees that set spending.
Congress, which is controlled by President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats, would consider the $2.9 billion in funding for the State Department and USAID as an emergency bill, with funding for the Pentagon considered later, congressional aides said.
The money would also cover the implementation and enforcement of the sanctions Biden is enacting to punish Russia for its aggression against Ukraine.
Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he would work closely with the administration to address the crisis.
""The United States government needs to provide the necessary resources to support our allies and assist the innocent people caught in the middle of this needless calamity,"" he said in a statement.
The newly requested funds would augment the $650 million in security assistance and $52 million in humanitarian assistance the United States has already committed to Ukraine over the past year, as well as the $1 billion sovereign loan guarantee announced last week.
A Biden administration official said the conversation around funding needs would change as the situation on the ground evolves.
Earlier on Friday, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that oversees foreign aid, said he would support $10 billion or more to address the crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Departing from recent party divisions, both Biden's fellow Democrats and opposition Republicans have expressed strong support for sharp increases in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, with some calling for passage of an emergency spending bill as soon as next week.
Russian missiles pounded Kyiv on Friday, families cowered in shelters and authorities told residents to prepare Molotov cocktails to defend Ukraine's capital from an assault that the mayor said had already begun with saboteurs in the city.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation rose again in January and a new report from the central bank warned that price pressures could persist unless a shortage of available workers begins to ease. 
The new inflation data, alongside the developing sense at the central bank that inflation may prove harder than anticipated to dislodge, will likely firm the central bank's intent to raise interest rates through the year, beginning with an initial hike in March from the current near zero level.
Policymakers will have to weigh one fresh and unanticipated set of risks in their discussion: The Russian military invasion of Ukraine could roil the economic outlook in unpredictable ways, and potentially undermine global growth and financial markets. 
But Fed officials say that's unlikely to shift their immediate plans to begin tightening monetary policy in response to inflation that is not only high but continues moving higher. 
The personal consumption expenditures price index rose at a 6.1% annual rate through January, its highest since 1982 and more than triple the 2% inflation rate the Fed has set as its target for the U.S. economy.
That measure of annual inflation, reported monthly by the government, has been as higher or higher than in the prior month for 14 straight months - a run not seen since the 1970s and a blow to arguments commonly heard at the Fed last year https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/zdpxoqkrkvx/index.html that rising prices would prove ""transitory"" and disappear as the economy reopened. 
The month-to-month change in the same index, watched by some officials as a signal of moderation, showed no sign of easing. 
Graphic: The COVID inflation surge The COVID inflation surge - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/akvezawxopr/chart.png 
""EXCEEDINGLY HOT?""
The Fed is set to raise interest rates when it meets on March 15-16. Officials have been debating whether the initial ""liftoff"" should be a standard quarter point increase, or a larger half point hike to demonstrate the Fed's seriousness in controlling prices.
On Thursday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller flagged Friday's PCE inflation report as one to watch, saying if it shows ""the economy is still running exceedingly hot, a strong case can be made for a 50-basis-point hike in March.""
For now at least the data are not only hot but getting hotter: Since September the PCE index has jumped in steady increments from 4.4% to 6.1%, and has either risen or held level with the prior month in each report since November 2020. 
In the Fed's latest monetary policy report to Congress, issued twice a year, central bank officials acknowledged that inflation had not eased as they expected, but in fact had broadened through the economy.
The ""extraordinary circumstances"" which the Fed had said last July were driving higher prices had given way to other dynamics, the report said, particularly a workforce falling far short of the numbers demanded by businesses to fill open positions.
""In the period ahead, the large price changes in goods may ease once supply chain disruptions finally resolve,"" the Fed report stated. ""But, if labor shortages continue and wages rise faster than productivity in a broad-based way, inflation pressures may persist and continue to broaden.""
Fed officials have largely downplayed the risk of a durable ""wage price spiral.""
But they've also been surprised by much of what's happened during the reopening from the pandemic.
The rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant was expected to slow hiring and spending through the winter. It didn't happen. Job growth continued, and new spending data released on Friday showed consumer spending exceeded expectations.
Now the virus is fading and Fed officials anticipate a renewed sense of reopening in society and the economy will keep growth strong. 
Trading in futures contracts based on expectations of Fed policy show investors downplaying the chance now of a half-point increase.
But the PCE report is still moving in the wrong direction for Fed officials hoping to avoid the most aggressive measures to control inflation.
""Though diminished, the chance of a 50bp move is still intact,"" wrote III Capital Chief Economist Karim Basta. Inflation at 6% ""would definitely qualify as hot."" 
The main factor tempering arguments for a faster move by the Fed is the economic fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That could for a variety of reasons drive prices higher; it could also pose risks to global economic growth, or rattle financial markets in a way that could make the Fed less inclined to raise rates as fast as it would otherwise.

With the incursions less than 48 hours old that analysis was just beginning.
""In theory, the war has two contrasting effects on Fed policy: It could stoke inflation...and it could slow economic growth,"" wrote Piper Sandler macro analysts Roberto Perli and Benson Durham. ""The Fed is likely to be more concerned about the latter than the former...The war will not delay liftoff...But it could well result in fewer rate hikes this year than the market is currently pricing.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ukraine has asked the International Monetary Fund for emergency financing, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said on Friday, adding that the IMF was exploring all options to aid the war-torn country, including under its existing IMF loan program. 
Georgieva said in a statement that she met with the IMF's executive directors and ""assured them that our staff will continue to work closely with the authorities to support Ukraine in every way we can.""
That includes exploring options for further financial support, including under the remaining capacity of about $2.2 billion in Ukraine's existing $5 billion stand-by loan arrangement.
Georgieva also said the Fund was assessing potential implications for the functioning of the global financial system, on commodity markets and on countries with economic ties to the region.
""We stand ready to support our members as needed, in close coordination with our international partners,"" including the World Bank, she said.
World Bank President David Malpass said on Thursday the bank also was preparing ""fast-disbursing"" financing options for Ukraine.
Earlier on Friday, Georgieva said that Western sanctions against Russia will add to the economic impacts of the war in Ukraine, which are primarily being transmitted through higher energy and grain prices, adding to inflation.
Georgieva, speaking at a Georgetown Law School event on Black History Month, also said that greater financial market uncertainty caused by the conflict may cause capital ""outflows from emerging markets, when we need exactly the opposite -- more financing going there.""
She also said that heightened regional tensions may impact economic activity in countries and regions surrounding Ukraine, such as Moldova and the Caucasus. 
Russia is among the world's biggest oil exporters and also is a major wheat exporter along with Ukraine, whose Black Sea ports have been closed to shipping.

Georgieva also said that she was concerned about her brother, who is married to a Ukrainian woman and who is currently in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, where heavy fighting is taking place.
""When I talked to him, I feel strongly for all -- for his family of course, but for everybody there -- to wake up to the sounds of bombing and to be unsure about what the next would bring,"" said Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist who grew up during the country's communist era.

(Reuters) -Brazil's government cut an industrial tax (IPI) by 25% to fight inflation and help industry recover from a pandemic downturn, the country's official gazette showed on Friday.
The tax cut, with immediate effect, ""is a milestone of the beginning of Brazilian reindustrialization after four decades of de-industrialization,"" said the Economy Minister Paulo Guedes.
It will affect all industrialized products, with the exception of tobacco items. 
Guedes acknowledged the measure has a short-term impact on inflation, but highlighted it was designed as a policy to increase industrial productivity.
Reuters had previously reported that the tax cut was coming.
The minister said it will represent a loss of around 20 billion reais ($3.9 billion) in tax revenue, with the federal government giving up 10 billion reais and the rest coming from state and municipal revenue.
According to the minister, a 50% reduction in the tax was considered, but was not adopted ""out of respect for the industry established in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).""
Companies operating in the Manaus Free Trade Zone are exempt from paying IPI, but can generate credits equivalent to the tax to deduct from the payment of other taxes. The lower the IPI rate, the fewer the credits.
A carbon market that is being designed by the government for the coming months is aimed at greatly benefiting the region, defended Guedes, adding that the goal is to promote a transition from IPI credits to carbon credits.
The IPI is a regulatory tax, so the rate was changed with only a presidential decree.
Earlier on Friday, President Jair Bolsonaro said he would have ""good news"" for Brazilian business in the afternoon regarding ""the industrialization of the country,"" without giving any further details.
The government has consulted the Superior Electoral Court about the feasibility of the measure, which implies a net loss of revenue in an election year, according to three sources heard by Reuters, who requested anonymity. 
The court has not provided guidance yet, the sources said, with two of them noting the consultation was made out of caution, since the court's prior endorsement is not mandatory. 
Guedes has said that the government could give up the revenue from the tax cut, as a run of record tax revenue has boosted fiscal balance in Latin America's largest economy.

Central bank data on Friday showed that public debt as a share of gross domestic product fell to 79.6% in January from 80.3% in December, as surging tax revenue led to the highest primary surplus for any month on record.

The new license represents a shift in U.S. policy that had impeded ordinary commerce with Afghan government agencies headed by U.S. sanctioned Taliban and Haqqani Network leaders since the Islamists seized power in August as U.S.-led forces withdrew.
It maintains prohibitions on transactions with sanctioned leaders and other blocked individuals and excludes transfers of luxury items.
The license makes clear ""that while sanctions on the Taliban remain in place, this action facilitates the private companies and aid organizations working with governing Afghan institutions and paying customs duties, fees and taxes,"" a senior administration official told reporters on a conference call.
Some experts have questioned whether sanctioned Taliban and Haqqani network leaders can be prevented from benefiting from transactions with the agencies they control without efficient oversight mechanisms.
The new license is part of what U.S. officials said are ongoing U.S. efforts to help contain an economic collapse that quickened in August when Washington and other donors cut financial aid underpinning 75 percent of Afghanistan's public spending.
""Our action today recognizes that in light of this dire crisis, it is essential that we address concerns that sanctions inhibit commercial and financial activity,"" Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a statement.

The financial aid cut and a freeze of some $9 billion in Afghan central bank funds - $7 billion by Washington - have fueled a cash crunch and a humanitarian crisis that the United Nations warns has pushed more than half the population of 39 million toward starvation.
U.S. President Joe Biden last week issued an order sequestering half of the $7 billion frozen in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for possible use to recapitalize the crippled Afghan central bank.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, targeting major banks and members of the elite coupled with new export control measures.
Washington warned that more action could follow and that all options are on the table.
The below are some ways in which the United States could further escalate sanctions on Russia.
SANCTIONS ON PUTIN
The United States could take the rare but not unprecedented step of imposing sanctions on a head of state and designate Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The United States has in the past imposed sanctions on heads of state, including on Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro and Syria's Bashar al-Assad.
The EU on Friday agreed to freeze any European assets of Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
SWIFT
Another option could be shutting Russia out of SWIFT - the world's main international payments network - which would hit Russian trade and make it harder for Russian companies to do business.
SWIFT is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments and has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade.
In 2020, around 38 million SWIFT 'FIN messages' were sent each day over the SWIFT platform, according to its 2020 annual review. Each year, trillions of dollars are transferred using the system.
Asked why Washington did not shut Russia out of the payment system in Thursday's action, U.S. President Joe Biden said the sanctions that were rolled out against Russian banks incurred ""equal consequence,"" if not more.
""It is always an option, but right now that's not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take,"" Biden said.
The EU is looking at what the consequences would be of cutting Russia off from SWIFT, France's finance minister said on Friday. Some countries are reluctant over concerns about how payments for Russian energy imports would be made and whether EU creditors would get paid.
OLIGARCHS
The Treasury this week imposed sanctions on what it said were Russian ""elites,"" including on some with ties to Sberbank, VTB, Rosneft and the Federal Security Service (FSB).
Brian O'Toole, a former U.S. Treasury Department official now with the Atlantic Council, said the United States could also impose sanctions on more significant Russian oligarchs.
O'Toole said those listed in Thursday's action were not ""the major tycoons.""
TIGHTENED SANCTIONS ON BANKS, FIRMS
Another option could include tightening sanctions on banks and firms the United States targeted in Thursday's action but did not designate using its most powerful sanctioning tool, the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list.
Washington said U.S. banks must sever their correspondent banking ties - which allow banks to make payments between one another and move money around the globe - with Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, but did not freeze its assets.
It also expanded the scope of existing curbs on U.S. persons dealing in the debt and equity of Russian state-owned enterprises. The restrictions apply to 13 firms, including Gazprombank, the Russian Agricultural Bank, and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).
Washington could tighten the restrictions on those entities and add them to the SDN list, a move that effectively kicks them out of the U.S. financial system, bans their trade with Americans and freezes their U.S. assets.
""We still have all options on the table. We have room to further escalate as Russia's aggression escalates,"" a senior U.S. administration official said.
OIL COMPANIES
Washington could decide to go after Russian oil companies, which it has so far largely held back from doing.

The Biden administration has seemed concerned that its sanctions could trigger higher energy prices and has taken steps to mitigate those effects, including by issuing a general license on Thursday authorizing energy-related transactions involving certain banks until June 24.
The official on Thursday said: ""We know there are going to be some costs that we have to bear, but our goal is to mitigate those and that's why we stayed away from targeting energy.""

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States, Britain and European Union leaders are targeting Russian banks as part of a new package of sanctions following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
Here is a rundown of how sanctions which have already been announced impact banks and investors:
WHAT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED SO FAR?
The U.S. Treasury Department said it was targeting the ""core infrastructure"" of Russia's financial system, sanctioning two of its largest banks - state-backed Sberbank and VTB. Also on the sanctions list are Otkritie, Sovcombank and Novikombank and some senior executives at state-owned banks. 
U.S. banks must sever their correspondent banking ties - which allow banks to make payments between one another and move money around the globe - with Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, within 30 days.
Officials in Washington also wielded the government's most powerful sanctioning tool, adding VTB, Otkritie, Novikombank and Sovcombank to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. The move effectively kicks the banks out of the U.S. financial system, bans their trade with Americans, and freezes their U.S. assets.
The U.S. sanctions also target two Belarusian state-owned banks - Belinvestbank and Bank Dabrabyt - over the country's support for Moscow's attack. 
The U.S. sanctions came soon after the British government said it would impose an asset freeze on all major Russian banks, including VTB, and stop major Russian companies from raising finance in Britain. 
Russian banks would be cut off from sterling markets and clearing payments, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.
Britain also announced asset freezes and travel bans on members of Russia's political and financial elite, including those who have long enjoyed high-rolling London lifestyles. 
More than 100 individuals, entities and subsidiaries will ultimately be sanctioned. 
Britain had earlier imposed sanctions on just three billionaires with close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and five relatively small lenders.
EU leaders have agreed sanctions on Moscow that target 70% of the Russian banking market, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday.
The bloc imposed a ban on issuing bonds, shares or loans in the EU for refinancing Alfa Bank and Bank Otkritie, after freezing assets at Rossiya Bank, Promsvyazbank and VEB earlier in the week.
The top three Russian banks Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank, however, do not face an EU asset freeze.
The bloc also set a cap of 100,000 euros ($112,700.00) for EU bank accounts of Russian citizens, who will not be allowed to buy euro denominated shares.
Refinancing in the EU of Russian state-owned enterprises is also forbidden, with the exception of some utilities. Securities settlement houses in the EU will not be allowed to serve Russian counterparties.
Unlike the United States and Britain, the EU has decided not to stop correspondent banks from dealing with top Russia lenders.
European leaders earlier in the week had agreed to sanction 27 individuals and entities, including banks financing Russian decision-makers and operations in the breakaway territories in Ukraine, but not the biggest lenders.
Washington had imposed sanctions on Promsvyazbank and VEB.
The United States had also ramped up prohibitions on Russian sovereign debt, which U.S. President Joe Biden said would cut the Russian government off from Western financing. 
Swiss financial watchdog FINMA told banks on Friday to freeze assets of people and entities on the EU's sanctions list.
WHAT NEXT?
Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system, meaning any sanctions on the biggest institutions could be felt far beyond its borders. 
The U.S. Treasury said Thursday's sanctions would disrupt billions of dollars worth of daily foreign exchange transactions conducted by Russian financial institutions. Overall, these institutions conduct about $46 billion worth of forex transactions, 80% of which are in dollars. ""The vast majority of those transactions will now be disrupted,"" it said.
The sanctions target nearly 80% of all banking assets in Russia. 
Sberbank said that it was prepared for any developments.
VTB said it had prepared for the most severe scenario. 
""We have worked through several plans to counter the sanctions in ways which minimize the negative consequences for our clients,"" it said in a statement.
Sovcombank, Otkritie and Novikombank did not reply to requests for comment. The Russian embassy in the United States also did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The new sanctions EU leaders are preparing to announce are likely to include freezing Russia's assets and halting access to financial markets by its banks.
WHAT WOULD HIT HARDEST?
What banks and Western creditors fear most is that Russia is banned from the global payment system, SWIFT, which is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries.
Such a move would hit Russian banks hard but the consequences are complex. Banning SWIFT would make it tough for European creditors to get their money back.
The EU said it will assess the consequences of cutting Russia out of SWIFT before deciding whether to use that ""financial nuclear weapon"".
Britain's Johnson said on Thursday he intended to work with allies to shut off Russia's access to SWIFT. U.S. President Joe Biden said it remained an option.
Analysts said Russian institutions are better able to cope with sanctions than eight years earlier, although that does not mean they would not hurt.
The Institute of International Finance, the largest international banking group, said U.S. sanctions on Russia will have a sizeable impact on Russia's economy and citizens and could cause a recession.
WHICH FOREIGN BANKS ARE MOST EXPOSED?
Many foreign banks have significantly reduced their exposure to Russia since 2014 but several Western banks have been involved in deals and have other relationships.
There were big falls in shares of European banks on Thursday, with an index of European banking stocks closing down 8.1%. 
Banks with significant operations in Russia were particularly hard hit, with Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International down 23% and France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) losing 12%.
Italian and French banks each had outstanding claims of some $25 billion on Russia in the third quarter of 2021, based on Bank of International Settlement figures.
Austrian banks had $17.5 billion. That compares with $14.7 billion for the United States.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury yields eased from earlier highs on Friday after the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge rose more than expected in January, but the market's reaction was muted as uncertainty reigned due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 0.6% last month, one-tenth of a percent higher than December, while over the 12 months to January the PCE index rose 6.1%, the largest rise since February 1982.
The so-called core PCE price index rose 5.2% year-on-year in January, up from 4.9% in the 12 months through December. The core's gain last month was the largest since April 1983.
Interest rates normally would trend higher on rising PCE data, but a less risk-adverse mood prevailed in markets, driving equity markets higher after selling off earlier in the week.
""These yields don't seem to overlay well with the inflation picture. And the Fed being behind, it just seems like yields should be higher to me,"" said David Petrosinelli, senior trader at InspereX in New York.
""Rates would be higher today if we hadn't had the invasion, that's for sure,"" he said.
But the outlook for a potential slowdown - or drop in the pace of inflation later this year - also may be in play.
Before the data's release, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 3 basis points higher at 2.002%, the first time the benchmark was above 2% since last week. The 10-year's yield was last down 0.5 basis points at 1.967%. 
Steady rates at the longer-end of the yield curve suggest the market does not believe the Fed can hike interest rates very fast, said Dec Mullarkey, managing director of investment strategy and asset allocation at SLC Management. 
""The 10-year is essentially saying that the market doesn't think we can go as quickly as the Fed might like,"" he said. 
""The Fed is going to have trouble pushing rates up or maybe even being forced to pause at some point. There probably is going to be a big drop-off in inflation later this year,"" he said.
The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with rate expectations, was up 2.8 basis points at 1.574%, but down from a 14-month peak of 1.643% on Wednesday. 
A closely watched part of the yield curve measuring the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasuries, seen as an indicator of economic expectations, was at 39.1 basis points, in line with the highest end of day level this week.
The flattening of the yield curve indicates a slowdown or even recession lies ahead, indicating in some eyes the Fed has been too slow to tackle inflation. The U.S. central bank is expected to raise rates at its next policy-setting meeting on March 15-16. 
""This is a good indicator of a not soft landing, maybe a little bit of a harder landing,"" Petrosinelli said. 
Money markets have priced in a 26.5% probability that the Fed hikes rates by 50 basis points next month, odds that are much lower than before Russia's assault on Ukraine.
The breakeven rate on five-year U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) was last at 2.99%.

The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate was last at 2.563%, indicating the market sees inflation averaging about that rate annually for the next decade.
The U.S. dollar 5 years forward inflation-linked swap, seen by some as a better gauge of inflation expectations due to possible distortions caused by the Fed's quantitative easing, was last at 2.438%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased more than expected in January, offering the economy a strong boost at the start of the first quarter, but price pressures continued to mount, with annual inflation surging at rates last experienced four decades ago.
Growth prospects were further brightened by other data on Friday showing solid demand by businesses for equipment last month. The reports from the Commerce Department suggested underlying strength in the economy that could sustain the expansion as the Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates to quell inflation, and provide a shield against the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
The first rate hike from the U.S. central bank is expected next month. Economists are anticipating as many as seven rate increases this year.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) boosted its first-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 5.4% annualized rate from a 3.8% pace. The economy grew at a 7.0% rate in the fourth quarter. 
""The real economy appears to be in stronger health than we feared, suggesting that the Fed will push on with its planned rate hikes starting in March, although the Ukraine conflict makes a 50 basis points hike less likely,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, surged 2.1% last month after falling 0.8% in December. Spending was driven by purchases of motor vehicles, nondurable goods like apparel and recreational goods as well as outlays on heating amid freezing temperatures across many parts of the country. 
But a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, fueled by the Omicron variant, undercut spending at restaurants and bars as well as at hotels and motels. Spending on air travel also fell.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending rebounding 1.5%. The surge in spending was despite consumer sentiment as measured by the University of Michigan slumping to a more than decade low.
Consumer spending is being supported by massive savings and strong wage growth amid a tightening labor market. That is offsetting a reduction in government money to households, following the expiration of the Child Tax Credit payments.
Personal income was unchanged last month as a 0.5% increase in wages was offset by a decrease in government social benefits. Economists shrugged off the drop in the saving rate, which fell to 6.4%, the lowest since December 2013, from 8.2% in December.
""Households, in aggregate, still have about $2 trillion saved up from earlier in the pandemic, and some of the January drop in saving came from a reduction in Child Tax Credit payments,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Households will adjust to the reduced tax credit and the saving rate will return to above 7%."" 
Stocks on Wall Street rose for a second day. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
INFLATION MARCHES HIGHER
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.6% in January after rising 0.5% in December. 
In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index jumped 6.1%. That was the largest rise since February 1982 and followed a 5.8% year-on-year increase in December. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index soared 0.5% after advancing 0.5% in December. 
The so-called core PCE price index shot up 5.2% year-on-year in January, the biggest rise since April 1983. The core PCE price index increased 4.9% in the 12 months through December.
With inflation well above the Fed's 2% target, households' buying power is being reduced. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation fell 0.5%.
Price pressures could continue to spiral because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Brent crude prices on Thursday soared above $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014, before retreating to below $97 a barrel at one point on Friday.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rebounded 1.5% in January after declining 1.3% in December. 
Some economists believe growth this quarter would be below a 2.0% rate because of the drag from inventories. 
Inventory investment accounted for the bulk of GDP growth in the fourth quarter. The Atlanta Fed is estimating the economy growing at only a 0.6% pace this quarter.
Still, the outlook for growth remains encouraging.
Households accumulated more than $2 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic. Subsiding coronavirus infections are likely to boost spending on services. The United States is reporting an average of 74,668 new COVID-19 infections a day, a fraction of the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. 
The economy got a lift from another report from the Commerce Department showing orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 0.9% last month, beating economists' expectations for a 0.5% gain.
These so-called core capital goods orders rose 0.4% in December. Shipments of core capital goods accelerated 1.9% after increasing 1.6% in December. 

Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.
""It would appear that capital spending is likely to make a solid contribution to first-quarter real GDP growth,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Western sanctions will not halt Russia's invasion of Ukraine and will need to be expanded and sustained for a long time to hurt the Russian economy, economists and analysts believe.
The European Commission said on Friday that sanctions agreed with the United States and allies on Russia's financial and energy sectors and export curbs on technology should limit the ability of the Russian ""regime"" to finance war.
Jacob Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, said export controls on technology might directly impact Russia's military if a protracted conflict left it short of the chips that go into missiles.
But, like others, he sees sanctions as more a long-term broader economic play.
""The way to think about economic sanctions is a tool to encourage regime change in the long run. For this to work, it does not matter how much we do now, but how long we can maintain the unity for,"" said specialist analysis service Eurointelligence.
Guntram Wolff, director of think tank Bruegel, said sanctions needed to be in place for the long-term and a key part of that is Europe's ability to wean itself off Russian gas, which could present a challenge next winter, with sustainable energy unable to make up the shortfall.
""This could mean we have to heat less and break taboos, such as firing up coal or nuclear plants,"" he said.
He also said that a major omission in current sanctions was asset freezes of Russia's oligarchs, a measure not hitting the average Russian and perhaps more likely to cause Putin a headache.
There are already question marks over the unity of planned financial sanctions, which sees the United States targeting Russia's two biggest banks and the EU focused on smaller firms.
Removing Russia from the SWIFT global payments system was one option mooted, which would make it more complicated to transact payments, even though there are new rivals to SWIFT that Russians could use.
EU officials point to the 80 billion euros ($89.9 billion) of exports to Russia that would be lost and problems paying for the natural gas EU members such as Germany and Italy rely on. But there are growing EU voices calling for SWIFT to be included in a further package of measures.
China is also likely to play a major role in the collective sanctions, particularly after it declared a ""no-limits"" partnership with Moscow earlier this month. It has not imposed sanctions on Russia.

""The role of China is key. It has the ability to help Russia circumvent technology sanctions as well as aid the financial sector,"" said Kirkegaard. ""But the EU and the U.S. will learn to finesse these and hit in other ways that crack down on the China path as well.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. credit markets have been churning with more volatility spurred by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, on top of uncertainty around monetary policy shifts, hurting investor returns and complicating borrowers' ability to access financing. 
Concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve may hike rates too aggressively, increasing borrowers' cost of funding, have weighed on the corporate bond market this year.
That weakness worsened this week as Russia invaded Ukraine, pushing markets into risk-off mode and widening spreads - the interest rate premium that investors demand to hold corporate debt over safer U.S. Treasuries. 
On Thursday, the yield spread on the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA U.S. High Yield Index, a commonly used benchmark for the junk bond market, jumped 5.7% to 393 basis points, hitting its highest since January last year.
""The escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict adds to the (already long) list of uncertainties, including inflation and the future path of monetary policy, that have been weighing on credit spreads in recent months"",  Barclays  (LON:BARC) strategists Bradley Rogoff and Dominique Toublan said in a research note this week.
""As such, we expect spreads to remain under pressure and choppy"", they said.
Wild price swings have kept a lid on new debt issuance from high-yield borrowers this year, and this week only one deal priced for $1 billion in the U.S. high-yield market,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Craig Nicol said in a research note on Friday.
That means year-to-date supply of new U.S. dollar-denominated high-yield bonds is at $38.9 billion, which is down 55% year on year. The euro primary market was shut all week, leaving year-to-date supply down 57% year on year, he said.
""Whilst the rally in rates has helped to somewhat offset the damage to returns, the magnitude of spread widening has still resulted in a -0.4% total return for $HY this week"", Nicol said. 

U.S. investment grade corporate debt could become more sensitive to global macro risks than high-yield debt, the Barclays strategists said, because investment grade companies tend to be more global while high-yield credit is more domestically focused.
The yield indicated on the ICE BofA U.S. corporate index, which tracks dollar denominated investment grade rated corporate debt, jumped 6.5% on Thursday.

The centrist coalition government, poised to lead Bulgaria into the euro zone in two years, has pledged to double capital investment to 5.8% of GDP to underpin economic growth and boost living standards in the European Union's poorest member state.
""This budget is unprecedented. There are huge investments which will kick-start the change we promised,"" Prime Minister Kiril Petkov told the parliament after the bill was approved. 
The Balkan country plans to spend over 63 billion levs ($36.27 billion), or 44.2% of GDP this year to build new infrastructure, and to raise state pensions by 6% from July and earmark funds to partially compensate businesses struggling with high energy costs.
The ruling coalition, which took office in December, rejected opposition's concerns that its spending plans constitute a fiscal loosening that could threaten Bulgaria's path to join the euro zone. Bulgaria ended 2021 with a fiscal deficit of 3% of GDP.
Following the Russian invasion in Ukraine, lawmakers voted to provide humanitarian help to ethnic Bulgarians there, including those who wish to be evacuated. 
The government has estimated economic growth at 4.8% this year and saw annual average inflation at about 5.6%.
Prior to the Russian invasion in Ukraine, Finance Minister Assen Vassilev had indicated that a military conflict in Ukraine could prompt revisions in the growth and inflation estimates.

Bulgaria's consumer prices surged to a 13-year high to 9.1% on an annual basis in January, fuelled by a surge in energy and food prices.

Speaking from Brussels, she said Russia's offer of talks with Ukraine to be held in Minsk had not even been discussed at the meeting of European Union foreign ministers she was attending, since it was a ""poisoned offer"".
She told ARD public television that excluding Russia from SWIFT would make it impossible to support civil rights groups in Russia from abroad, or for Russian students abroad to send money to help their grandmothers, she told ARD public television. 
""The sword that looks hardest isn't always the cleverest one,"" she said. ""It's not just oligarchs who do financial transactions... The sharper sword at the moment is listing banks. Government bonds can't be sold abroad any more.""

Sanctions would be effective in the medium or long term against a leader who was ""ruining his country, not just economically, but also for young people who want a future together in Europe"", she said, but admitted they would not immediately stop Russia's attack on Ukraine.
""He (Putin) doesn't want to stop at any price, whether it costs him international isolation, or his country's economic future,"" she said. ""If he violates our values then he can't stay part of the international community.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -EU states agreed to freeze any European assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister on Friday, as Ukraine's leader pleaded for faster and more forceful sanctions to punish Russia's invasion of his country.
The move against Putin and his top diplomat, Sergei Lavrov, came as envoys of the EU's 27 member states agreed on a new wave of measures - their second this week - to hit Russia's elite and thwart operations of 70% of the country's banking system.
""We are now listing President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov as well,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said as she joined her EU counterparts to agree on the new sanctions.
""They are responsible for the deaths of innocent people in Ukraine, and for trampling on the international system. We, as Europeans, do not accept that.""
A senior EU diplomat said that although the Russian leaders may not have extensive assets in Europe, the move against them personally was ""a politically important signal"".
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Putin now joins only two other world leaders sanctioned by the bloc: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus.
Borrell said the latest round of sanctions could be followed by a third, though this would only come if it was needed.
Earlier on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Europe to act more quickly and forcefully in imposing sanctions on Moscow, accusing western allies of politicking as Moscow's forces advanced on Kyiv.
""You still can stop this aggression. You have to act swiftly,"" he said, adding that banning Russians from entering the EU, cutting Moscow off from the SWIFT global interbank payments system and an oil embargo should all be on the table.
The EU ministers' agreement on comprehensive sanctions means the bloc has joined the United States and other Western nations in curbing Russia's access to key technologies and financing.
The EU's measures will also target Russian elites and make it tougher for diplomats to travel, but the bloc opted not to curb Russian energy imports, or - after objections from Germany and Italy, among others - to cut Russia off from SWIFT. 
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, hosting a meeting of EU counterparts in Paris to discuss the economic impact, said removing Russia from SWIFT remained an option, but only as a ""financial nuclear weapon"" of last resort.

He said some EU countries - but not France - have reservations about such a step, and the European Central Bank was expected to deliver an analysis ""in the coming hours"" on the consequences if it was taken.
Baerbock said the SWIFT option risked hurting individuals, such as those trying to send money to relatives in Russia, ""whereas those people who are responsible for the bloodshed will still be able to do their bank business"".

The ministry said it was looking at giving notice at the banks, which would lead to departure in two to three months.
""We will call on other member states from the European Union to take the same course of action,"" the ministry said.
It said the Czech government did not see economic benefits in remaining in the two institutions.

“The direct linkages to the U.S. economy are minimal so I wouldn’t expect that much impact directly on the U.S. economy,” Bullard said Friday during an interview with SiriusXM Business radio. “Of course, we will have to watch this very carefully and see what happens in days ahead.”
Bullard’s remarks chime with comments from other officials since the invasion backing liftoff next month, including his former St. Louis Fed colleague Governor Christopher Waller, who saw a strong case for a half-point move if the economic numbers keep coming in hot.
“The fighting in Ukraine is something that has been around off and on for the last couple of decades, so in that sense it is not really that new,” Bullard said. “This is a bigger, more aggressive Russia here but I think the baseline expectation has to be there will not be a wider war associated with this. There are risks around that.”
Bullard said he is continuing to urge that policy makers start shrinking the balance sheet in the second quarter, in addition to the rate hikes that would include one half-point hike over the next three meetings.
“We haven’t really moved fast enough given the inflation developments,” Bullard said. After raising the policy rate 1 point by July 1, “then we could assess at the point where we are at and what the next steps would be.”
Data on Friday showed the Fed’s preferred gauge of price pressures rising 6.1% in the 12 months through January -- three times their 2% target and the most since 1982. Officials get another important piece of evidence next Friday with February’s employment report.

638,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 12:57PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Reserve warned Friday that inflation could persist longer than expected if labor shortages and fast wage increases continue, casting aside its prior faith in ""transitory"" inflation to paint a more cautionary view of how the U.S. economy may evolve.
In the Fed's latest monetary policy report to Congress, delivered twice a year, the Fed said that price increases had broadened since last year and the forces driving them were no longer limited to supply chain issues that might be quickly and easily resolved.
Rather, U.S. labor shortages and the associated rise in wages were also at work, and if those don't ease then inflation may prove more persistent. 
While saying that some pressure on goods price could still ease in coming months as supply distribution improves, ""if labor shortages continue and wages rise faster than productivity in a broad-based way, inflation pressures may persist and continue to broaden out,"" the Fed report said. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell will discuss the latest report in congressional hearings next week, where he is likely to be questioned closely about inflation. New data released Friday showed the Fed's preferred inflation index rose 6.1% through January, triple the 2% level targeted by the Fed.
To combat rising inflation, the Fed has signaled it will start raising interest rates next month.
""With appropriate policy, inflation is expected to decline over the course of the year,"" the report notes, even as it flagged reasons for caution. 
The Fed acknowledged, for instance, that elevated inflation, initially concentrated in goods prices, has broadened into services, driven by ""strong wage growth in some service sectors and a significant increase in housing rents.""
Productivity gains accelerated during the pandemic due to new business formation, widespread use of work-from-home technology and increased automation, the report noted. 

All else equal, increasing output per worker should reduce inflationary pressures. But the report also said it was unclear if the trend would last in part because people can try extra hard only for so long. 
""Worker effort, which surged in response to employment shortages and hiring difficulties, appears to be elevated, possibly above sustainable levels,"" the Fed said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Afghanistan is inching closer towards economic collapse six months after the Taliban seized power, the Red Cross said on Friday, with a paralysed banking system stymieing international efforts to get financial aid into the war-ravaged country.
Organisations such as the Red Cross have been forced to rely on informal money exchanges to move cash in to pay the salaries of some workers, although most of Afghanistan's estimated 500,000 state employees have now worked without pay for months.
""The banking system is totally paralysed. The central bank is not operating,"" International Committee for the Red Cross Director General Robert Mardini told Reuters, adding that it is paying some 10,000 doctors and nurses using the informal 'hawala' money transfer network. 
Mardini said on a call from the capital Kabul that the international community and the Taliban needed to find a pragmatic solution to get the banking system up and running as Afghanistan was hanging by a thread.
""You cannot just run the country on hawala system. There needs to be a political negotiation for this. But the clock is ticking,"" Mardini added.
Afghanistan's new rulers have appealed to the international community to help the country and have pressed for billions of dollars of frozen assets overseas to be released.
The Afghan economy depended on aid before the western-backed government was overthrown last year by the hardline Islamist Taliban, who are under unilateral sanctions that have made foreign banks reluctant to facilitate aid money transfers.
The United States has sought to allay fears of those providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan of falling foul of sanctions and said it would free up $3.5 billion in frozen Afghan central bank assets on U.S. soil to help Afghans.

Mardini said the Red Cross would soon request an additional $50 million from donors for aid to Afghanistan this year, on top of an already budgeted 150 million Swiss francs ($161 million).

PARIS (Reuters) -Russia's invasion of Ukraine will slow European economic growth this year through higher energy prices and lower business confidence and to some extent trade, but the European Union is ready for it, top EU finance officials said on Friday.
""We know there will be economic costs. These costs will emerge over the coming weeks and months,"" the chairman of euro zone finance ministers Paschal Donohoe said, adding that finance ministers will review fiscal plans in coming weeks to make sure they can support the economy if necessary.
""The impact will be different for different member states,"" he told a news conference after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers and central bank governors.
EU leaders agreed on Thursday to impose new sanctions on Russia's financial, energy and transport sectors, introduce export controls, and blacklist more Russians after Moscow launched an invasion of Ukraine.
This means countries that sell their products to Russia will see trade revenues fall. Russia, Europe's main energy supplier, could retaliate by curbing gas, oil and coal sales to the EU, though this would be costly for Moscow.
But European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde said the main impact of the war in Ukraine was likely to come through higher energy prices and the uncertainty that will hit business confidence and consumption.
""What we know is that the two main channels through which the euro area economy will be affected will be through energy, prices and through confidence or the uncertainty channel; not so much through trade, which is limited between Russia and the euro area,"" she said. ""Persistent uncertainty will probably be a drag on consumption and investment, and will impede growth.""
European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said the Commission was assessing the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the EU economy, but noted that the situation was constantly changing.
""A preliminary assessment we did shows that the crisis will weigh on EU growth, but will not stop EU growth,"" he said.
The ECB's chief economist, Philip Lane, has told fellow policymakers the Ukraine conflict may reduce the euro zone's GDP by 0.3%-0.4% this year.
'WE ARE PREPARED'
The European Commission forecast this month that economic growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro would be 4.0% this year, already below the 4.3% expected last November, because of more COVID-19 infections, supply chain bottlenecks and record inflation caused by energy prices.
The Commission has said the Russian invasion of Ukraine makes the 4.0% growth forecast more uncertain.
But EU governments said they were ready to bear the cost.
""There are of course consequences in the energy sectors for example, but we are prepared,"" German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said. His French counterpart Bruno Le Maire said the sanctions would be painful mainly for Russia.
""It will be the Russian economy that will pay the price for the decision of Vladimir Putin. It will be the Russian oligarchs that will pay for the foolish decisions of Vladimir Putin,"" he told reporters.
The EU is drafting plans to cut its reliance on Russian gas.

""We are proposing common European procurement of natural gas, setting up strategic reserves of gas so that we reduce our dependence on Russian supplies,"" Dombrovskis said.
""We are talking with other suppliers this week. The prime minister of Norway was in Brussels this week. Certainly we need to strengthen our resilience against Russia's possible market manipulation.""

642,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 11:52AM ET</span>","PARIS (Reuters) -The European Union will analyse shortly the consequences of cutting Russia off from the SWIFT international payments system before deciding whether to use that ""financial nuclear weapon"", France's finance minister said on Friday.
In the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, EU nations have already decided on a package of sanctions that would cover 70% of the Russian banking market.
However, some countries are reluctant to go further by cutting Russia's access to the SWIFT interbank money transfer network over concerns about how payments for Russian energy imports would be made and whether EU creditors would get paid.
Therefore EU finance ministers meeting in Paris asked the European Central Bank and European Commission to produce an analysis ""in the coming hours"" on the consequences of such action, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said. 
""Swift is the financial nuclear weapon. SWIFT is what would allow Russian financial institutions to be cut off from other financial institutions worldwide,"" Le Maire told journalists on the sidelines of the meeting in Paris.
""When you have a nuclear weapon in your hands, you think before using it, some member states have reservations, France is not one of them,"" he added.
A German government spokesperson said earlier on Friday that kicking Russia out of SWIFT would be technically difficult to arrange and would have a massive impact on transactions for Germany and German businesses in Russia.
Later at the meeting in Paris, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said: ""We are open, but you have to know what you're doing.""
Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba urged U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday to use all of Washington's influence to sway hesitant European countries, he said on Friday on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

""All options are on the table given the potentially far reaching implications of cutting off Russia from SWIFT,"" European Commision Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said at the finance ministers meeting.
""This option has to be presented to members states also with an assessment of the exact implications so that they can take an informed decision,"" he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine has upended several popular trades, inflicting heavy losses on investors bullish on European stocks and the euro and also those bearish on the Japanese yen and government debt.
The view before the aggression was that global economic recovery was chugging along, company earnings were robust and central banks, facing rising inflation, were on course to raise interest rates several times this year. 
But while the spiking geopolitical tensions continue to fan inflationary pressures via the oil channel, they are undermining some of the biggest consensus trades in markets.
""We just experienced a major pain point: the Russian invasion. That was enough to flush out the more aggressive short term positions"" "" said Aaron Hurd, senior portfolio manager, currency, at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors in Boston. 
Some of the more entrenched bets will come under further pressure if the conflict threatens the broader growth outlook, Hurd predicted. 
Below are five charts showing the main consensus positions in global markets: 
1/SHORT YEN, LONG EUROS
The premise that the Bank of Japan would lag global counterparts in tightening policy had made the Japanese yen every currency trader's preferred short -- hedge funds' net short bets on the yen were just below three-year highs, according to data from Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
The yen's rise to a three-week high on Thursday would have dealt a blow to those positions. 
Another large consensus trade has been long euros where net longs are at six-month highs and rose by $1.2 billion in the latest week, according to CFTC.
Derivative markets show traders were frantically buying puts this week, an option to protect against losses, as the single currency fell below $1.11, its lowest levels since July 2020.
Meanwhile the growing trend to bet against the dollar -- long dollar positions slipped to the lowest since August - also backfired, as the dollar index jumped to a mid-2020 high.

2/ BEARS PROWL, MOOD DOWNBEAT
According to a BofA monthly survey, European stocks were investors' most preferred region with investors a net 30% overweight. 
But it is also the most vulnerable to fallout from the Russia conflict, and accordingly it European stocks slipped on Thursday to the lowest since May 2021, while European bank shares, a popular trade due to ECB rate hike bets, have shed 6.5% this week. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) slashed its European stocks forecast by 8% by end-2022 while the European Central Bank's chief economist said the conflict could shave as much as 0.4% of euro zone GDP. 
As risk aversion takes hold, the price of put options on European stock indexes at 10% below current levels for contracts expiring in March has jumped sharply. Open interest - the number of contracts outstanding, is at the highest level ever.

NOT SO AGGRESSIVE NOW
Convinced that the U.S. Federal Reserve would go big and fast with interest rate hikes in coming months, traders had piled on bets against Treasuries and most major bond markets.
Treasury shorts on the rate-sensitive front-end of the bond curve, jumped, with bearish bets on 2-year note futures at the highest since October. 
Those bets are being rapidly unwound amid the dash for safe trades. Bets of a 50 bps rate hike by the Fed next month have melted by half from a week earlier, according to the CME's Fedwatch tool, while expectations of ECB rate hikes have also dropped.

""Central banks' stagflation trade-off has only become more difficult amid the Russian invasion,"" said Kristoffer Kjær Lomholt, chief analyst at Danske Bank.

644,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 11:42AM ET</span>","PARIS (Reuters) - Ukraine's financing needs after the Russian invasion will be massive and the European Union will have to come up with the money, European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said on Friday.
Speaking after a meeting of European Union finance ministers and central bank governors, Dombrovskis said Ukraine was suffering from investor flight and its access to financial markets has been very problematic.
Also the country's currency, the hryvnia, has come under pressure and central bank reserves were being depleted in market interventions.
""So it is clear that Ukraine's financing needs will be massive, and we will need to match those financing needs,"" Dombrovskis said.
The EU has recently agreed on 1.2 billion euros in macro-financial assistance emergency programme for Kyiv, of which the first half will be disbursed soon, but Dombrovskis said it was clear EU support would have to go far beyond this.

He said before Russia started amassing troops on the Ukrainian border, the estimated financing gap for Ukraine for this year was around 2.5 billion euros. This rose to 5 billion after the build-up of troops as investors fled expecting war.
""Now, the financing needs are off-the chart,"" Dombrovskis said. ""We cannot really estimate them, but we need to be ready to support Ukraine in every way we can.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will use money from its rainy-day fund this year to replace shortfalls caused by a forced reduction in state borrowing, which has grown more costly due to new Western sanctions, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Friday.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United States, Britain and other Western nations have imposed new sanctions targeting Russian banks, sovereign debt and individuals.
Siluanov said Russia's economic and financial situation was stable in general but conceded that sanctions will change the country's borrowing plan, requiring it to tap the National Wealth Fund, which stood at $175 billion as of Feb. 1.
""Due to an increase in borrowing costs the issuing of state debt has been suspended. We are planning to reduce the amount of borrowing this year, will utilise NWF funds for it,"" Siluanov told a meeting with government officials.
As Russian missiles pounded Kyiv, authorities in Moscow were seeking ways to shield the economy from new penalties that sent the rouble to a record low, threatening living standards already hit by high inflation.
The finance ministry said it will offer only a new series of OFZ government bonds and stop offering existing series of debt as the U.S. government slapped restrictions on trading of Russian government debt.
The Russian central bank beefed up the banking sector with extra liquidity and started to sell foreign currency on the forex market after the rouble fell to all-time lows on the day Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine.
The central bank's forex interventions that it started this week for the first time since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, have already born fruit, Vladimir Chistyukhin, central bank deputy governor, said at the same meeting.

""We have a serious safety margin from the financial stability point of view... The central bank is ready to support banks with liquidity,"" Chistyukhin said.
Siluanov said swings on the foreign exchange market were temporary and there was no immediate risk to financial stability.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The rouble firmed on Friday after hitting all-time lows the previous day when Russia began invading Ukraine, while stock indexes rose sharply after their biggest one-day fall on record and the central bank stepped up support for sanctioned banks.
No Russian assets were left unscathed in heavy selling on Thursday. The fighting in Ukraine continued on Friday, with Russian missiles pounding Kyiv, families cowering in shelters and authorities telling residents to prepare Molotov cocktails to defend Ukraine's capital. 
By 1600 GMT, the rouble had gained 2.6% against the dollar to 83.03 after hitting a record low of 89.60 in highly volatile trading on Thursday.
Against the euro, the rouble firmed 2% to trade at 93.27, having hit an all-time low of 101.03 on the interbank market on Thursday.
The currency was supported by the first Russian central bank currency interventions since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.
SANCTIONS BITE
The market was also digesting new harsh Western sanctions against Russia.
The measures stopped short of disconnecting Russia from the SWIFT global interbank payments system or targeting its oil and gas exports, and Russia has spent the past seven years building up formidable financial defences. 
""However, the possibility (of disconnection from SWIFT)remains and uncertainty hurts the market more than the worst sanctions – focus will be on developments in Ukraine, the potential for negotiations, and any further sanctions,"" BCS Brokerage said in a note.
But analysts said Russia's economy is unlikely to withstand the onslaught of coordinated sanctions from the West in the long run.
Clients of some Russian banks under Western sanctions will no longer be able to use their cards abroad or with mobile payment systems from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the central bank said, as it stepped up support for banks.

Russian stock indexes pared heavy losses after Thursday's record one-day fall.
The dollar-denominated RTS index soared 26.1% to 936.9 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index gained 20% to 2,470.5 points, heading away from its weakest level since early 2016 of 1,681.55 that it hit on Thursday.
JP Morgan said it was interested to see what would happen to dividend payments, with the top five listed companies in Russia forecast to dish out $18 billion in dividends. 
""Will a sanctioned Russian financial system be happy to pay away that much money to largely foreign shareholders when they are excluded from the financial system?""
VTB Bank on Friday said it may still pay dividends for 2021, Russian news agencies reported, but would analyse all possibilities between now and April. 
INFLATION
The market expects more action from the central bank, which has to address inflationary risks. The weakening in the rouble after the invasion of Ukraine is expected to dent living standards in Russia and to stoke inflation that is already close to 9%.
The central bank may now carry out an unplanned interest rate hike as it did in late 2014, when it raised the key rate to 17% from 10.5% late at night as the rouble plummeted, analysts say.
""We think a prompt out-of-schedule 400bp or bigger hike by the CBR is likely with the key rate exceeding 13%,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.

Alor Brokerage said the central bank could hike the rate by 2-3 percentage points in the near future, aiming at keeping the rouble near 80 to the dollar and 90 to the euro.
The central bank, which targets inflation at 4%, is next due to consider raising rates at its board meeting on March 18.

(Reuters) - Western economic sanctions to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine heap a new set of unknowables on a global economy already distorted by the coronavirus pandemic and a decade of ultra-cheap money.
The bid to exclude from the trading system whole chunks of the world's 11th largest economy -- and supplier of one-sixth of all commodities -- has no precedent in the globalised age. 
Sanctions unveiled so far will hit Russian banks' business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen. U.S. export curbs will restrict Russian access to electronics and computers while European capitals are fine-tuning similar export controls and measures to target the energy and transport sectors.
For now, they won't condemn the Russian economy to anything like isolation: the gas on which Europe depends will keep flowing and Russia's banks will retain access to the SWIFT global bank messaging system.
But further punitive measures remain possible, while the chaos of conflict and prospective counter-measures by Moscow make it likely there will be some decoupling of the Russian economy and its huge resources.
""The war, sanctions, and the likelihood of meaningful retaliation by Russia together will likely cause a material global recessionary shock,"" political risk consultancy Eurasia Group said in a note.
""Sanctions on Russian banks and trade will likely cause meaningful disruptions to global trade and financial relationships with far-reaching effects.""
The initial impact will be modest, especially after two years of COVID-19 which have seen a global recession give way to a stimulus-fuelled growth spurt that created labour shortages, inflation and global supply chain bottlenecks.
Oxford Economics said it now sees global inflation this year at 6.1%, up from 5.4%, citing the impact of sanctions, financial market disruption and higher gas, oil and food prices. 
While that will add to cost-of-living worries, Oxford reduced its forecast for global output growth by a modest 0.2 points to 3.8% this year and by just 0.1 points to 3.4% in 2023.
That small dose of ""stagflation"" is a headache for central banks trying to reduce stimulus and return base rates to something like normal after a decade near zero.
But for now, the consensus is that tightening can cautiously go ahead.
PIVOT
More profound structural changes will depend on how the sanctions impact plays out in time, notably in the domains of commodities, energy and finance.
Even without excluding Russian banks from SWIFT, the mere whiff of legal consequences for any Western bank found to have breached sanctions could have a ""chilling effect on business"", one specialist lawyer told Reuters.
The same goes for other financial services.
""Brokers are already being instructed by their compliance and market security committees to cease the use of currently approved Russian insurers and find alternative insurers for new (re)insurance policies,"" said Ben Sheppard, senior research analyst at insurance investment adviser Argenta Private Capital.
How sanctions will apply to Russia's vast energy and commodity resources remains opaque.
Russia produces 10% of global oil and supplies 40% of Europe's gas. It is the world's largest grains and fertilisers exporter, top palladium and nickel producer, third-largest exporter of coal and of steel, and fifth-largest wood exporter.
Amrita Sen of Energy Aspects think tank said for now the measures appeared to give Russia some leeway.
""The financial sanctions are designed in a way to allow energy-related payments to continue,"" he said, adding he also expected some exemptions for metals and agricultural goods.
""We just don't see the West having enough appetite for sanctioning Russia at a time when inflation is already super high and energy and food prices are both elevated.""
U.S. President Joe Biden has said the sanctions are designed to have a long-term freezing effect on Russia's economy. So how might Moscow respond to that creeping isolation?
Its Economy Ministry said on Friday it had expected the sanctions pressure faced since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea to intensify, and that it plans to step up trade and economic ties with Asian countries.
Such a pivot would depend notably on Beijing seeing an interest in a China-Russia trading bloc that could emerge as a viable alternative to Western channels.
""It could force companies to have two separate supply chains to serve each one,"" Jacob Kirkegaard at German Marshall Fund said of a development that would reverse decades of attempts to streamline trade channels for efficiency.
Coming after the pandemic-era supply chain problems, that could exacerbate price hikes and goods shortages which are hurting the world economy.
But whether that becomes structurally higher inflation and long-term scarcity depends on how others react. Optimists argue it could be a wake-up call for other big economies to take a look at their strategic interests and economic weaknesses.

""Europe will need to suffer increased prices for oil and gas because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting Western sanctions,"" said Hung Tran at the Atlantic Council think tank.
""If Europe uses this moment to truly diversify its energy sources, it could insulate itself from future shocks planned by the Kremlin.""

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine could derail President Tayyip Erdogan's new economic programme by slashing tourism revenues seen vital to reducing the gaping current account deficit and pushing up inflation via rising energy and grains costs.
The lira fell more than 5% on Thursday as investors worried about the impact on Erdogan's plan to shrink the deficit -- $14.9 billion last year -- by increasing exports and growth while keeping interest rates low despite near 50% inflation.
Russians accounted for 19% of foreign visitors to Turkey in 2021, with 4.7 million people, while Ukraine was the third largest source of tourists at 8.3% with 2 million people. 
Bulent Bulbuloglu, deputy head of the Turkish Hoteliers Federation, said bookings from Russia had fallen 70% in a day after Thursday's invasion.
""There have been no booking cancellations from Russia after the developments, this is pleasing. But the flow has slowed,"" he said, adding that bookings from Ukraine had not begun this year.
A worst-case scenario could see tourism revenues from the two countries fall $5-6 billion in 2022, Bulbuloglu said.
Turkey is aiming for $34.5 billion in revenue this year, as tourism returns to pre-pandemic levels.
COMMODITIES
Commodity prices jumped to multi-year highs on Thursday as investors anticipated tighter supply due to sanctions on Russian exports, transport disruptions and withholding by Moscow of goods such as metals.
Russia and Ukraine account for nearly 80% of Turkey's grain imports but Ankara has said it does not foresee supply shortages due to the conflict and that it could turn to other sources.
""The developments will affect us very seriously. The Black Sea was like our inland sea,"" Rint Akyuz, chairman of agricultural commodity importer Rotel, citing issues in the Sea of Azov and Odessa. ""(Imports) will require much higher financing costs now,"" he said, adding that transportation costs will jump three- or fourfold.
Higher energy costs will also hurt: Turkey spent $51 billion on energy last year and its near-total reliance on imports to meet its needs is one of the main constraints on the economy.
Oil prices have surged 8% since last week, while natural gas prices have soared 45% since the start of the week.

Every $10 rise in the price of Brent crude raises Turkey's energy import bill by $4.5-6 billion, economists calculate.
Turkey's natural gas purchases rose 22% last year, mainly due to a drought that raised the share of gas used for electricity production.

LONDON (Reuters) - Pearson launched a share buyback and set medium-term growth goals on Friday, sending its shares up 11% on hopes that the global education group had finally turned a corner on years of turbulence. 
Demand for assessments, qualifications, virtual learning and in-work training helped the British company to hit a recently upgraded 2021 profit goal and it set 2022 forecasts in line with city expectations.
For the three-year period from 2022 to 2025 it forecast a mid-single-digit compound annual growth rate for revenues, with operating profit margins in the mid-teens by 2025 - the first time it has given medium-term guidance in six years.
The adjusted operating profit margin for 2021 was 11%. 
Chief Executive Andy Bird, a former Disney executive who has sharpened Pearson's focus to sell directly to consumers and not traditional educational outlets, said he believed the firm was putting the upheaval of the last seven years behind it. 
The group is also seeking to expand workforce training services, as companies grapple with the post-pandemic ""great resignation"" of people choosing to seek new careers. 
""The collective momentum in the business is underpinning our continued confidence in growth as we move into 2022,"" Bird told reporters, saying the company of more than 20,000 staff was more integrated and efficient than before. 
The British company saw its business reshaped by the pandemic which lifted demand for online learning services while its exams business was hit by cancellations. 
Then, late last year, the combination of the Omicron wave of COVID-19 cases and a tight U.S. labour market deterred students from enrolling at community colleges.
Prior to that it reported a string of profit warnings as digital sales and second-hand offerings of text books hit its once thriving U.S. higher education courseware. 
Its shares remain 56% below their levels in 2015 when they touched a 14-year high. 
Pearson now has a market value of 5.1 billion pounds. 
It will launch a 350 million-pound ($470 million) share buyback after posting 2021 adjusted operating profit of 385 million pounds. It forecasts a 2022 figure of 416 million pounds.

PARIS (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's chief economist Philip Lane has told fellow policymakers that the Ukraine conflict may reduce the euro zone's economic output by 0.3%-0.4% this year, four people close to the matter told Reuters.
This was the ""middle scenario"" presented by Lane at a Governing Council meeting in Paris on Thursday, hours after Russia invaded Ukraine and as the ECB is grappling with how the crisis may affect its plans to withdraw monetary stimulus measures.
Lane also presented a severe scenario where GDP is reduced by close to 1% and a mild scenario where events in Ukraine had no impact on the 19-country currency bloc, which the sources said was now considered unlikely. 
One source described the estimates as ""back-of-the-envelope"" calculations, another said they were ""very preliminary"" and a third said they were mostly derived from commodities prices.
All sources said Lane would bring more refined forecasts to the ECB's March 10 policy meeting, at which it is expected to decide the future of its long-established Asset Purchase Programme (APP). It has already said it will stop making new bond purchases under a pandemic emergency scheme after March.
Lane did not present new inflation forecasts but he did tell Thursday's meeting there would be a significant increase in the 2022 projection, while hinting that estimates at the end of the horizon could still be below the ECB's 2% target.
An ECB spokesperson declined to comment. At a news conference later on Friday Lagarde said it was ""premature"" to assess the exact impact of the conflict on the economy. 
The ECB's forecast horizon currently stretches to 2024.
The inflation and growth forecasts will be crucial to determine if the ECB can wind down the APP, paving the way for its first rate hike in more than a decade.
Greek central bank governor Yannis Stournaras, a policy dove known for favouring lower rates, told Reuters the ECB should continue buying bonds at least until the end of the year to cushion the fallout from the Ukraine crisis.
Even his hawkish Austrian colleague Robert Holzmann said events in Ukraine may delay the ECB's exit from stimulus measures. 
Inflation has been exceptionally high in the euro zone, hitting 5.1% in January, and many economists expect energy and food price rises resulting from the Ukraine crisis to drive a further increase.

A preliminary reading put the Consumer Price Index at a higher-than-expected 4.1% in France, the euro zone's second largest economy.
Until recently, investors were expecting the ECB to end its bond purchases and raise rates by 50 basis points by December but they have since trimmed their bets.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Clients of some Russian banks under western sanctions will no longer be able to use their cards abroad or with mobile payment systems from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the central bank said on Friday, as it stepped up support for banks.
U.S., EU and British leaders targeted Russian banks with sanctions designed to punish Moscow for sending troops to Ukraine, a move that drew global condemnation and sent the rouble sinking to record lows.
The central bank said the debit and credit cards of sanctioned banks, which it listed as VTB, private lender Sovcombank, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank and Otkritie Bank, would keep working in Russia without restrictions. 
""Cards from these banks will not be able to be used with the ApplePay and GooglePay services, but standard contact or contactless payment with these cards is available in full throughout Russia,"" the central bank said.
The central bank did not mention dominant lender Sberbank, which said late on Thursday it was operating normally and studying the implications of sanctions.
The U.S. Treasury said on Thursday U.S. banks must sever their correspondent banking ties with Sberbank within 30 days, while Britain said it would impose asset freezes against all major Russian banks. 
Sberbank serves nearly 102 million people in Russia and is present in 17 other countries. Russia had 370 banks as of early 2022.
Addressing the impact of sanctions, the central bank announced measures to support the banking sector and the rouble to ensure financial stability. The central bank also eased regulatory requirements for the sector and told banks to consider postponing dividends and bonus payments to managers.
Some of the sanctioned banks sought to assuage customers' fears on Friday by promising that funds were safe. 

""The banking community is prepared for different scenarios: we have enough liquidity to meet demand and there are no restrictions on withdrawing cash either at ATMs or branches,"" Sberbank, VTB, Alfa-Bank and Otkritie said in a joint statement. 
Private lender Alfa-Bank said the penalties have only banned it from issuing shares, which it was not planning to do anyway. Alfa-Bank said it was continuing to carry out cross-border transactions via the SWIFT global interbank payments system.

LONDON (Reuters) - Insurers have raised the cost of providing cover for merchant ships through the Black Sea, adding to soaring rates to transport goods through the region for vessels still willing to sail after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Ship owners pay annual war-risk insurance cover as well as an additional ""breach"" premium when entering high-risk areas. These separate premiums are calculated according to the value of the ship, or hull, for a seven-day period.
Ship insurers have quoted the additional premium rate for seven days at anywhere between 1% to 2% and up to 5% of insurance costs, from an estimated 0.025% on Monday before Russia's invasion began, according to indicative rates from marine insurance sources.
This would mean additional costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars for a ship voyage depending on the destination. 
""Given the Russian offensive from land, sea and air, it would not be surprising if some insurers will be reluctant (to provide cover),"" one insurance source said. 
A Moldovan-flagged chemical tanker was hit by a missile on Friday near Ukraine's port of Odessa, seriously wounding two crew. 
On Thursday, a Turkish-owned ship was hit by a bomb off Odessa with no casualties and the ship sailed safely into Romanian waters. 
Ukraine has appealed to Turkey to block Russian warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits which lead to the Black Sea, after Moscow on Thursday launched a full-blown assault on Ukraine. 
Russian forces landed at Ukraine's Black and Azov Sea ports as part of the invasion. 
Ukraine's military has suspended commercial shipping at its ports although some Russian Black Sea ports remain open, including Novorossiisk, traders said on Friday.
""Due to the sea invasion potential and Crimea's location in the Black Sea, freight destined for surrounding countries will likely see re-routings and longer transit to meet its final destination,"" added Glenn Koepke with supply-chain tracking platform FourKites. 
Mark Nugent, with shipbroker Braemar ACM, citing satellite tracking data, said a number of dry bulk vessels in the Black Sea had reversed course and were sailing towards the Bosphorus to exit the region. 
Freight rates have jumped after shipping companies including the world's top container lines MSC and Maersk and many oil tanker owners suspended sailings through the region. 

Average earnings for smaller aframax tankers trading in the Black Sea jumped to over $100,000 a day on Thursday from $8,000 a day on Monday, shipping sources said. 
Earlier this month, London’s marine insurance market added the Ukrainian and Russian waters around the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to its list of areas deemed high risk, which prompted some shipping companies to hold back on sending vessels into the area.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England policymaker Catherine Mann said she voted for a half percentage point rise in interest rates this month because she saw little sign that public's price expectations were easing, which risked causing inflation to stay too high.
Mann was one of four Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members to vote to raise interest rates to 0.75% from 0.25% this month, rather than the increase to 0.5% backed by the majority of the committee. 
""To me, the data was still showing very robust expectations and I thought it was important to dampen those expectations using a 50 basis point increase,"" she said in an online video discussion with Britain's Society of Professional Economists.
""There was very little in the data that showed any diminution of expected wage increases, expected price increases or for that matter in financial markets ... other than in gilts,"" she added.
British inflation rose to 5.5% in January, its highest in nearly 30 years, and Mann said all MPC members agreed that was ""way, way above our objectives"".
But policymakers differed on the extent to which Britain's economy had recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic and whether there was likely to be lasting damage to the job market in the form of lower employment or participation rates, she said.
""I think it is pretty dangerous to talk about permanent changes to labour force participation at this stage,"" she said.
Official data shows a drop in the proportion of older people in work or looking for a job compared with before the pandemic, and around half a million fewer people in employment overall.
Some of that drop probably also reflects European Union nationals who left Britain after Brexit or during the pandemic, either temporarily or permanently.
Mann said central bankers globally had been blindsided by the pace at which energy prices had risen, partly due to geopolitical factors which they could not predict.
If 2022's inflation dynamics mirrored those of last year, inflation would overshoot the BoE's latest forecasts, which do not see inflation returning to its 2% target until early 2024, she added.

The BoE also needed to keep an eye on policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve and potentially the European Central Bank. While higher rates abroad would tighten British financial conditions, they could also weaken sterling and push up inflation if the BoE lagged behind the curve, she said.
Financial markets currently expect the BoE to raise rates to 0.75% in March and to 1.75% by the end of 2022, with relatively little change despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The measures are part of a long-running economic security policy pushed by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, mainly aimed at threats seen coming from China.
But bill was released at a time of heightened concerns worldwide over the vulnerability of key infrastructure to cyberattacks, particularly in the wake of Russia's assault on Ukraine.
The legislation, which will now be submitted to parliament, would tighten curbs on companies in security-sensitive sectors that procure overseas software.
It would give the government authority to order companies to provide advance information when updating software or procuring new equipment, and vet purchases.
The regulation would target companies in 14 industries critical to national security such as energy, water supply, information technology, finance and transportation.

Under the legislation, the government will also subsidise companies or projects that help build more resilient supply chains for key items such as semiconductors.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian bond yields rose while the rupee fell on the week as Russia's invasion of Ukraine weighed on investor sentiment, while the Indian government's decision to go ahead with the last scheduled debt sale for the year also hurt bonds.
Ukrainian forces are battling Russian invaders on three sides after Moscow unleashed the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, prompting tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.
India's benchmark 10-year bond yield ended at 6.75%, down 1 basis point from its previous close but yields on the week were up 9 basis points.
""The auction went through today but if the government chooses to borrow more this year, we will see yields rising,"" a senior trader with a private bank said. 
The government raised 230 billion rupees at the last scheduled debt auction after having cancelled the last two auctions due to a comfortable cash balance position.
Traders however said the dovish monetary policy committee minutes released post market hours on Thursday were underpinning sentiment despite the negative news flow. 
With economic growth in India having lost some momentum due to a third wave of COVID-19 and with inflation on a downward trend, the country's monetary policy committee chose to retain its policy rate and stance, minutes of its Feb. 10 meeting showed.
""While the recent escalation of geopolitical tensions may further inflame crude oil prices, keeping inflation elevated in the next few months, the MPC members appear unlikely to choose to sacrifice growth to tame pressures arising from global forces,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA.
Economists broadly expect rates to be held steady in the April policy meeting but are expecting some amount of tightening in the rest of the year depending on the evolving inflation situation, particularly if oil prices stay high.
Oil prices slipped on Friday, after sharp rises in the session, on concern over potential global supply disruptions from sanctions on major crude exporter Russia.
India imports more than two-thirds of its oil requirements, and high global prices can push up the current account deficit and also fuel imported inflationary pressures. 
The partially convertible rupee ended at 75.29/30 per dollar stronger compared to its close of 75.65 in the previous session. The unit however dropped 0.8% on the week.

""We expect the SPOT USDINR pair to trade under pressure and test 76-76.25 levels during the coming week,"" analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services wrote in a note.

Investing.com -- Russian troops continued to advance on Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, as Moscow defied the new sanctions levied by Western powers. European stocks rebounded, but Wall Street is set to open lower ahead of a deluge of economic data that could guide the Federal Reserve at next week's policy-setting meeting. Crude prices stabilized as traders digested the new measures. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 25th February. 
1. Russia defies new sanctions, advances on Kyiv 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continued Friday, with its troops advancing on the capital Kyiv, following Thursday’s declaration of war by President Vladimir Putin.
U.S. President Joe Biden responded late Thursday by announcing wider sanctions aimed at impeding Russia's ability to do business in the world's major currencies, along with sanctions against banks and state-owned enterprises.
""This is going to impose severe cost on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time,” Biden stated.
The EU joined in by freezing Russian assets in the bloc and halting its banks' access to the region’s financial markets, measures EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described as ""the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented"".
However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday that the continued Russian aggression showed that sanctions were not enough.
He’s probably right, but it’s difficult to see what could be done that would generate an immediate response from Moscow.
Russia has built up over $600 billion in currency reserves, rising more than 75% since Putin's 2014 Crimea annexation, helped by surging oil and gas prices. Its current account surplus of 5% of annual GDP and a 20% debt-to-GDP ratio are among the lowest in the world, while just half of the Russian liabilities are in dollars, down from 80% two decades ago.
2. European stocks higher; Goldman cuts Stoxx 600 year-end target
European stock markets are showing some resilience Friday, trading higher after the sharp losses of the previous sector.
Investors pumped money into cash and stocks in the week to Wednesday as equity positioning showed ""zero signs of capitulation,” according to Bank of America’s weekly flow report, released Friday.
Global equities saw $7 billion move into cash and $6.2 billion of inflows into equities while investors pulled $3.5 billion from bonds, according to the bank, analyzing EPFR data.
That said, the data collection ended on Wednesday, the day before Putin ordered Russian troops into its southern neighbor.
Goldman Sachs has taken a more cautious view, cutting its year-end target for Europe's major stock index, the pan-European Stoxx 600, saying equities in the region are likely to face risks for some time.
The influential U.S. investment bank now expects the index to hit 490, down from the earlier 12-month target of 530.
At 6:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), the STOXX 600 traded 1.8% higher at 446.64, having closed at 438.96 on Thursday, falling to nine-month lows after Russia invaded Ukraine.
3. Stocks set to open lower; Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock plunges
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower, handing back some of Thursday’s gains as Russian troops move closer towards Ukraine’s capital Kyiv.
By 6:10 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 300 points, or 0.9%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.9% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.8%.
The major indices on Wall Street staged a stunning comeback on Thursday, plunging at the open after Russia invaded Ukraine before closing strongly higher after President Joe Biden announced new sanctions.
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ended almost 100 points, or 0.3%, higher after dropping over 850 points at its session low. The broad-based S&P 500 rebounded to close 1.5% higher, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rallied 3.3% after dropping nearly 3.5% at the lowest level of the day.
Earnings season has mostly wound down, but there are still a few late reporting companies to claim the spotlight. 
 Beyond Meat Inc  (NASDAQ:BYND) stock plunged in premarket trading after the maker of faux meat posted disappointing numbers for the fourth quarter, while Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock is seen lower after the crypto trading platform reported lower volumes and monthly users despite the volatile trading climate. 
4. Economic data deluge
The Federal Reserve holds its next policy-setting meeting next week, and data releases later in the session could provide more clues as to whether it will raise short-term rates, and by how much.
Personal spending and income data for January, the month after the holiday season, are due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). Analysts are forecasting personal spending to grow 1.6% from the prior month, beating December’s reading of negative 0.6%, while personal income is predicted to be down 0.3%, below the previously reported +0.3%.
Durable goods orders for January are also due at the same time, and are expected to rise by 0.8%, after falling 0.7% the previous month, while the core PCE price index, a gauge of inflation the Federal Reserve uses in its deliberations on interest rates, is expected to rise to 5.1% on the year in January. 
Many now expect the central bank to hike by 50 basis points, given the elevated levels of consumer prices and the strength of the U.S. recovery, but the outbreak of war in Ukraine could prompt the Fed to take a less aggressive stance toward raising rates.
5. Crude stabilizes near $100 a barrel
Crude oil prices stabilized Friday after Thursday’s volatile trading after Western powers levied new sanctions on Russia as a punishment for its invasion of Ukraine.
Although a U.S. official was quoted as saying the new measures ""are not targeting and will not target oil and gas flows,"" the sanctions on Russia’s banks and state-owned enterprises are likely to impede the country’s ability to do business in major currencies.
Brent crude prices surged above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 on Thursday but sold off later in the session after U.S. President Joe Biden raised the prospect of a U.S. oil release from its strategic reserves in coordination with other nations.
Also limiting Friday’s gains, was Thursday’s U.S. crude oil supply data from the Energy Information Administration. Released a day later than usual because of Monday’s holiday, this showed a build of around 4.5 million barrels in the week to Feb. 18, suggesting a slowdown in demand from the world’s largest energy consumer.
By 6:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 0.4% at $92.44 a barrel, while Brent Oil Futures were down 0.5% at $94.90 a barrel. 
Gasoline RBOB Futures were down 0.1% at $2.9130 a gallon.",,,,,

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Porsche's potential initial public offering (IPO) could happen as soon as the fourth quarter of 2022, the finance chief of the luxury carmaker's owner Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Friday, providing further details of what could become a record listing.
Volkswagen's rationale for the IPO partly rests on hopes that it will remove some of the carmaker's conglomerate discount and raise its shares, which have underperformed the European sector over the past 12 months.
""There is no guarantee the market value of (Porsche) will translate into the VW share price unless VW addresses more structural issues of brand/product complexity,"" analysts at Jefferies wrote.
Volkswagen's sprawling structure, which among others includes the Audi, Ducati and Lamborghini brands, has long been seen as weighing on the valuation of Europe's largest carmaker.
Outlining key steps of a Porsche IPO, finance chief Arno Antlitz said Volkswagen, which has embarked on an ambitious shift towards electric vehicles (EV), batteries and software, would update markets about the progress and timeline in late summer.
""For me, this marks an inflection point and the ideal timing for the potential transaction in order to ignite our EV shift momentum,"" Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess said.
Volkswagen shares and its top shareholder Porsche SE rose as much as 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively, after the companies late on Thursday fleshed out details of a possible Porsche listing.
These include plans to list up to 25% of Porsche AG's preferred stock, selling 25% plus 1 ordinary share in the carmaker to Porsche SE and paying out 49% of IPO proceeds to Volkswagen's shareholders as a special dividend.
Assuming a Porsche value of 90 billion euros ($101 billion), this would result in proceeds of around 23 billion euros for Volkswagen - 11 billion via the placement of preferred shares and 12 billion via the sale of ordinary shares to Porsche SE at a premium.
Under the special dividend plans, Porsche SE, which owns 31.4% of Volkswagen, would stand to receive 3.6 billion euros, or around 30% of what it would pay for its Porsche AG stake.
Porsche SE, the holding company of the Porsche and Piech families that holds 53.3% of Volkswagen's voting rights, ""still looks like the main beneficiary"", the Jefferies analysts wrote.

Porsche AG itself will not receive any proceeds under the current plans.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp has accepted labour union pay demands, Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda told reporters late Thursday, wrapping up annual wage negotiations with unusual speed amid calls by the government for firms to lift wages.
""We have made an offer that fully met the union's demands,"" Toyoda said after a meeting with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
Neither Toyota or its union have disclosed the size of the pay rise that has been agreed. 
Kishida is counting on profitable Japanese firms to raise wages to help push his 'new capitalism' agenda of wealth distribution and help the world's third largest economy recover from the pandemic.
The Yomiuri newspaper has reported that the union asked for bonuses equivalent to 6.9 months of annual pay and hikes to monthly wages ranging from 1,600 yen to 4,900 yen ($14-$43)depending on the job.
Japan's spring labour talks known as 'shunto' are currently in full-swing at major firms and normally conclude around mid-March.
""It was a positive move by a leading company like Toyota,"" Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""Toyota may want to offset last year's decline caused by the COVID-19 crisis and compensate its employees given rising inflation. The question is whether other companies can afford to follow suit.""
Toyota has long served as bellwether of the spring labour talks, with other major firms taking a lead from its pay settlements.
Last year, as COVID-19 pandemic hammered corporate profits, 
pay increases were the lowest in eight years, with major Japanese companies awarding hikes below 2%.
Japan's biggest business lobby, Keidanren, has urged companies to raise wages, following Kishida's call for uniform pay hikes of 3% or more by profitable firms.
Rengo, Japan's largest labour confederation, has demanded 4% wage hikes, including a 2% rise in base pay.

Toyota has remained upbeat about its full-year profit prospects as tight car supplies caused by a global chip shortage allowed Japan's biggest automaker to charge its customers more.

""We will step up the implementation of macro policies to stabilise the overall economy,"" Xinhua said. 
China will strive to achieve its economic and social targets for this year, Xinhua said. 
China's economy rebounded strongly from a pandemic-induced slump in 2020 but cooled over the course of last year as a property downturn hurt investment and strict measures to contain COVID-19 flare-ups weighed on consumer confidence and spending.
The Politburo discussed the 2022 government work report that will be submitted to the National's People's Congress, or the parliament, for deliberation, Xinhua said.
The annual parliament meeting will open on March 5, when Premier Li Keqiang will deliver the work report.
China aims to fend off systemic risks and safeguard financial stability, seeking to combine fighting corruption in the financial sector with preventing risks, Xinhua said.

The agency made no mention of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which rattled global financial markets, drove energy and commodity prices higher and heightened uncertainty about global economic outlook. 
Chinese anti-corruption inspectors from the ruling Communist Party have uncovered a number of weaknesses and irregulatirites in the financial sector in a two-month investigation, Xinhua news agency said on Thursday.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan said on Friday it would scrutinise factors behind the country's low inflation and the divergence of price trends from other parts of the world in a series of workshops that kicks off next month.
The move underscores the challenge the BOJ faces in dealing with stubbornly low inflation that is forcing it to maintain massive stimulus, even as other major central banks eye raising interest rates to cope with rising inflation.
The workshops will gather academics and monetary policy experts, as well as BOJ staff, for discussions on Japan's price trends on March 29 and May 30, the BOJ said in a statement.
""The global inflation landscape is experiencing big changes, with U.S. and European consumer inflation accelerating sharply,"" the central bank said.
However, Japan's wholesale inflation had hit a 40-year high while consumer inflation remained below a target of 2%, it added.
""There's a renewed need to deepen analyses on Japan's recent price moves, including the divergence in domestic and overseas inflation made clear by the COVID-19 pandemic, and factors behind them.""

The BOJ's two deputy governors, Masayoshi Amamiya and Masazumi Wakatabe, will deliver remarks at the March 29 workshop. The central bank said it will post a summary of the discussions on its website.
While soaring raw material costs have pushed up wholesale prices in Japan, core consumer inflation stood at 0.2% in January as weak household spending and wage growth keep firms from passing on the higher costs to consumers.

World markets may have recovered some of their worst losses after Russia's attack on Ukraine but a sombre mood prevails as what was seen as tail risk event for investors just a few weeks ago became a reality.
Asian markets rebounded and European stock futures are sharply higher after U.S. stocks rebounded in late Thursday trade as the United States unveiled fresh new sanctions against Russia.
For many investors it's a case now of wait and see what unfolds in the days ahead, such as the extent of sanctions, where energy prices settle and how central banks react.
Comments in the last 24 hours suggest major central banks will stick to their plans to tighten monetary policy in the face of inflation running at its highest level in decades.
Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Thursday laid out the case for raising U.S. interest rates by a full percentage point by mid-summer.
Some European Central Bank officials have suggested the invasion doesn't fundamentally change the economic outlook.
Still, a fresh wave of uncertainty means caution is likely.
The most aggressive rate hike bets baked into markets have been dialled back further, lifting sovereign bond markets.
But no doubt, with oil prices shooting above $100 a barrel following the invasion, another upward near-term shock to inflation is likely. 
European natural gas soared more than 60% at one point on Thursday before settling to close just over 30% higher. 
Russia's rouble, which took a beating on Thursday, meanwhile clawed away from record lows and was about 0.7% stronger against the dollar at 84.72 early London trade.
Russia has spent the past seven years building up formidable financial defences, yet in the long run, its economy is unlikely to withstand the onslaught of coordinated sanctions from the West.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday: 
- Companies shut Ukraine operations, assess impact of sanctions on Russia

ZURICH (Reuters) -Holcim is confident it can handle energy price spikes caused by the Ukraine crisis, CEO Jan Jenisch said on Friday, after the world's biggest cement-maker reported fourth-quarter earnings slightly ahead of forecasts.
The Swiss company expects ""very limited"" direct impact from the conflict, which has driven fuel costs higher, retaining its upbeat assessment for the construction sector in 2022.
""We have no operations in Ukraine and only a small, local business in Russia which makes up less than 1% of group sales,"" Jenisch told reporters.
""We don't depend on Russian gas, our European plants don't use it,"" he said. ""The direct influence is very limited at this time.""
Energy to run its cement and clinker plants made up about 13% of  Holcim  (SIX:HOLN)'s operating costs in 2021, Holcim said, slightly more than a year earlier. But the company offset the increases with its own price rises, Jenisch said.
He expects post-COVID infrastructure spending projects to materialise this year and support the construction sector, while potentially higher interest rates were not a concern as a brake on building activity.
In 2022 Holcim expects growth to continue in all regions, especially as countries further relax or exit pandemic restrictions, with sales expected to rise by more than 6%.
For the three months ended Dec. 31, sales rose 17% to 6.99 billion Swiss francs ($7.57 billion), Holcim reported, better than the 6.73 billion francs expected by analysts. Recurring operating profit of 1.09 billion francs was also slightly ahead of forecasts.
For 2021 it proposed a dividend of 2.20 francs, up from 2.00 francs for 2020 after its full-year net profit rose 35.4%.

Shares in the company, whose performance are seen as an indicator for the broader construction sector, were up 3.6% in premarket activity.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia has spent the past seven years building up formidable financial defences, yet in the long run, its economy is unlikely to withstand the onslaught of coordinated sanctions from the West.
Europe and the United States are raining down reprisals after President Vladimir Putin sent tanks into Ukraine, adding to sanctions already pledged in response to his decision to recognise the independence of two breakaway Ukrainian provinces.
""The view Russia will be unaffected is wrong. The negative effects may not be felt up front but sanctions will hobble Russia's potential in the longer run,"" said Christopher Granville, managing director at consultancy TS Lombard and a veteran Russia watcher. 
Steps by the West include sanctions and asset freezes on more Russian banks and businessmen, a halt to fundraising abroad, the freezing of an $11 billion gas pipeline project to Germany and limiting access to high-tech items such as semiconductors.
Russia has dismissed sanctions as counter to the interests of those who imposed them. And they won't immediately dent an economy with $643 billion in currency reserves and booming oil and gas revenues.
Those metrics have earned Russia the ""fortress"" economy moniker, alongside a current account surplus of 5% of annual GDP and a 20% debt-to-GDP ratio, among the lowest in the world. Just half of Russian liabilities are in dollars, down from 80% two decades ago.

https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgpdwxzkxvo/Pasted%20image%201644935695631.png 
Those statistics result from years of saving since sanctions imposed after Putin's 2014 Crimea annexation.
According to Granville, surging oil prices will offer Russia an extra 1.5 trillion rouble ($17.2 billion) windfall this year from taxes on energy companies' profits.
But this kind of autarky has a price -- deepening isolation from the world economy, markets and investment, he noted.
""Russia will essentially be treated as a hostile state cut off from global flows, investment and other normal economic interactions that build living standards, incomes, productivity and company profitability.""
Signs of economic vulnerability are already present. Russian household incomes are still below 2014 levels and in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, annual economic output was valued at $1.66 trillion, according to the World Bank, far below the $2.2 trillion in 2013.
Sergei Guriev, economics professor at France's Sciences Po and former European Bank for Reconstruction and Development chief economist, pointed out that Russian nominal per capita GDP, double China's in 2013, was now behind.
""In 2013 Russia was a high-income country and was actively negotiating OECD accession. Russia is now back to the middle-income status,"" he said.

DIMINISHING CLOUT
Foreign investors in Russia are a dwindling tribe too. 
A JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) client survey showed foreign holdings of rouble bonds at the lowest in two decades; equity investment has never returned to pre-Crimea levels in absolute terms, Copley Fund Research estimated.
The premium demanded by investors to hold Russian dollar debt surged on Thursday to over 13 percentage points above U.S. Treasuries, almost triple the emerging markets average. 
""Sanctions are going to force Russia to self-finance more and more activity, constraining investment in industry and the military,"" said Jeffrey Schott, a trade and sanctions expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Bigger assaults could include ending Russian access to international payments system SWIFT and outright banning investment in Russia. 
Losing access to SWIFT would complicate export and import payments, and could even prevent paying bond coupons, triggering technical default. JPMorgan projects sanctions will slice up to 3.5 percentage points from GDP growth in the second half of 2022. 
Limited access to foreign capital leaves oil companies reliant on prepayment deals and facing significantly higher cost of capital, the bank added. 
The slow erosion in living standards also risks fanning popular discontent, threatening an administration that has already faced sporadic protests. Spillover may be inevitable.
""Autarky is no recipe for progress,"" analysts at investment bank Berenberg wrote. ""Coping with a heavily armed Russia mired in relative economic decline will remain a key challenge for Europe and the United States for the foreseeable future.""

Outbound shipments in February were expected to increase by 18.2% from a year earlier, according to the median forecast of 11 economists, while imports were expected to rise 25.2%.
""We expect a solid growth in sales of key exporting items, including semiconductors, but with a continued rise in oil prices, the trade balance will remain in the negative territory,"" said Park Sung-woo, an analyst at DB Financial Investment.
The economy reported a $4.83 billion trade deficit in January, as imports increased by 35.3%, outpacing a 15.2% rise in exports.
Economies around the world have suffered from a global chip supply shortage and other production bottlenecks because of the rapid spread of the highly infectious Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
The supply chain disruption from the Russia-Ukraine conflict is seen limited for now, but it could pose further risks in longer term, with the chip industry taking a hit.
The full-month trade data will be published on Tuesday at 9 a.m. (0000 GMT).
In the same Reuters poll, economists projected the consumer price index in February would rise 3.5% from a year earlier, slower than in January but not far from a decade-high 3.8% rise in November.

The Bank of Korea sharply upgraded its inflation forecast for 2022 to 3.1% from 2% and signalled the bank may need a quicker pace of tightening should price pressures build further because of the Ukraine crisis.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Consumer inflation in Japan's capital accelerated in February at the fastest annual pace in more than two years, suggesting that soaring fuel and food costs will weigh on consumption and the country's fragile economic recovery.
Analysts expect the crisis in Ukraine to further pace up inflation in coming months through a spike in global energy and commodity prices, adding to woes for Japan's economy that is heavy reliant on raw material imports.
""Import costs were already rising, so any further rise in raw material prices from the Ukraine crisis would deal a huge blow to Japan's consumption and corporate profits,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
The overall consumer price index (CPI) for Tokyo, considered a leading indicator of nationwide trends, rose 1.0% in February from a year earlier, marking the fastest pace since December 2019, government data showed on Friday.
The Tokyo core CPI, which excludes volatile fresh food but includes energy costs, increased 0.5% in February from a year earlier, accelerating from a 0.2% gain in January. It compared with a median market forecast for a 0.4% gain.
A 24.2% spike in energy prices was the key driver of the rise in core CPI, underscoring the pain higher fuel costs are inflicting on households and retailers.
Prices also rose for a range of foods and services, though the increase was moderated by a temporary drag from cuts in cellphone fees, the data showed.
""If energy prices continue to rise, Japan's core CPI may hit 2% in April and may not slow much thereafter,"" Shinke said.
Prices for international crude benchmark Brent shot above $105 a barrel after Russia, one of the world's top oil producers, attacked Ukraine.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the government was ready to take further steps to curb fuel costs, on top of subsidies already put in place, to cushion the blow to households.
But there is uncertainty on how much such moves could support consumption with rising raw material costs already leading to higher prices for various grocery products including snacks, soy sauce and cooking oil.

Japan's economy has recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic's initial hit thanks to robust global demand, though curbs on economic activity to combat rising cases of the new Omicron variant have weighed on consumption.
Sluggish consumption and weak wage growth have discouraged firms from passing on higher costs to households, keeping consumer inflation distant from the central bank's 2% target.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Shaken by a liquidity crunch among developers, China's property market is expected to stay soft in the first half of 2022 before rebounding later in the year as policies aimed at encouraging buyers helps sentiment recover, a Reuters poll showed.
Having been a pillar of strength for the world's second largest economy, the heavily indebted property sector faltered last year as Beijing mounted a deleveraging campaign that caught out several major developers, disrupting project deliveries and chilling buyer sentiment.
Aside from struggling with a rapidly cooling property sector, China has also encountered sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks that could deal a blow to factory output and consumption.
Average home prices are estimated to fall 1.0% on year in the first half, according a Reuters survey of 17 analysts and economists conducted between Feb. 16-23. The estimate was unchanged from that of a Reuters poll in November.
For the full year, home prices are expected to rise 2.0%.
""Home prices are likely to rise if curbs are relaxed,"" said Li Qilin, chief economist at Hongta Securities, adding the credit environment and regulatory policies on real estate have marginally eased since the beginning of this year.
""Property transactions in first- and second-tier cities, supported by their economic and demographic advantages, will be remarkably better than third- and fourth-tier cities.""
Authorities have unveiled a slew of measures to boost sales and sentiment, including giving developers easier access to escrowed pre-sale funds, requiring smaller down-payments for first-time home buyers, and allowing commercial banks to lower mortgage rates.
Analysts are more upbeat on housing demand and supply than in the last Reuters survey, though they said sentiment has not fully recovered and real estate firms still face financing pressure.
For demand, property sales are seen slumping 14.0% in the first half, narrowing from a 16.0% fall in November's poll. Sales are expected to decline 7.5% for the full year.
Many respondents said policies regulating demand, especially genuine demand, will be loosened, but for now sellers were relying on offering discounts.
""Home buyers' confidence has not yet been restored, and discounts are still a key marketing tool,"" Huang Yu, vice president of China Index Academy, a Beijing-based property research institute.
""First- and second-tier cities will see an increase in the scale of new home transactions, driving a structural rise in nationwide home prices.""
China's housing minister on Thursday pledged to keep the real estate market stable this year and ensure genuine demand for homes is met.
Investment by real estate firms is expected to fall 2.0% in the first half and gain 1.5% for the whole year. Reuters previously forecast investment would drop 3.0% in the first half of 2022. 
Property investment grew 4.4% in 2021, the slowest pace in 17 months, while real estate firms' sales by area rose 1.9%.
""Real estate companies with capital pressure will move cautiously on land purchases and property investment,"" said Lu Wenxi, chief analyst with property agency Centaline.
Daniel Yao, head of research for China at JLL, a commercial property services provider, expected authorities to issue more loans to property firms for project development and allow them to issue bonds more easily to relieve the liquidity pressure and stabilise the outlook.

Among the 17 respondents, 13 said China will delay rolling out a real estate tax pilot given the strain on its economy.

(Reuters) - The well-scripted turn by global central banks towards tighter, post-pandemic monetary policy has been thrown into doubt by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a geopolitical upheaval likely to be felt differently across the world's major economic centers.
Risks policymakers face globally include a near immediate spike in the price of oil to above $100 dollars a barrel, and longer-term imponderables of what a European land war could do to confidence, investment, trade and the financial system.
Central banks had been positioned for a head-on fight against inflation while expecting continued strong economic growth.
But now, they may now see growth ebb even as prices continue to surge, a conundrum not easily resolved with standard monetary policy strategies.
""For the major advanced economy central banks the intensification of the war now leaves them in a distinctly worse position,"" Oxford Economics analysts wrote.
""The high starting point for inflation...will make it hard for central banks to ignore the near-term upward forces on inflation. But at the same time, they will be aware that the latest developments increase the risks of very low inflation in late 2023 or 2024 due to a weaker growth outlook.""
High inflation in the United States and elsewhere makes it unlikely the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England will fully pause what has been a joint turn towards tighter monetary policy.
Indeed less than 24 hours after Russia's invasion began, Fed Governor Christopher Waller laid out the case for raising U.S. interest rates by a full percentage point by mid-summer.
""Of course, it is possible that the state of the world will be different in the wake of the Ukraine attack, and that may mean that a more modest tightening is appropriate, but that remains to be seen,"" he said.
The Bank of Japan is set to keep monetary policy ultra-loose for the foreseeable future. While an expected rise in fuel would push up inflation closer to its 2% target, concern over the damage to consumption will likely exceed the need to combat inflation with tighter policy, analysts say.
""Rising fuel costs would hurt the economy so tightening policy would be difficult. But the hurdle for easing policy is even higher,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. ""That means the BOJ will maintain the status quo for some time.""
INFLATION AGGRAVATOR
Still, analysts said the new level of uncertainty brought on by Russia's actions could put policymakers in a more cautious mode, likely to settle at the margins for a bit less policy tightening than a bit more.
The Fed would now likely limit itself to a quarter percentage point rate increase at its March meeting, ruling out the half point hike some policymakers have favored, wrote analysts with Evercore ISI.
The Bank of England might also pare its next expected increase, and the ECB delay making any firm promises about its tightening plans.
The path could be more diverse for central banks in Asia.
Singapore's central bank is likely on track for a policy tightening as it assesses inflationary outcomes in the run-up to its next semi-annual meeting in April, said Selena Ling, an analyst at OCBC Bank.
The war in Ukraine will have mixed implications for commodity exporter Australia, prompting its central bank to keep rates steady next week as it scrutinizes the impact of the crisis.
""While commodity price impacts are likely to be positive for Australia's terms of trade, higher petrol prices could weigh on consumer spending, as could a negative wealth shock from falling stockmarkets,"" aid Felicity Emmet, a senior economist at ANZ.
""We are happy keeping our pick of a September lift-off for rate hikes.""
Other central banks, however, may be forced to focus more on downside risks to growth.

Nomura analysts said a sustained rise in oil and food prices would hit some Asian economies by weakening their current account and fiscal balances and squeezing growth, with India, Thailand and the Philippines likely the main losers.
""Central banks in developed Asia are likely to tighten policies due to the risk of second round effects amidst an already strengthening economy, while central banks in emerging Asia are likely to prioritize still-weak growth,"" Nomura analysts wrote in a research note.

Industrial production likely declined 0.7% in January from the previous month, the median forecast in the poll of 18 economists showed, after a 1.0% fall in December.
""The outbreak of COVID-19 Omicron variant since the start of the year forced output cuts to carmakers, which had already suffered from chip and parts shortage,"" Shumpei Fujita, an economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting, wrote in a note.
Major automakers including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd have reduced production in their Japanese plants due to Omicron-related disruptions, such as infected workers and component supply bottlenecks.
Japan's new COVID-19 infections peaked in early February, but deaths are still rising.
Meanwhile, retail sales were seen rising 1.4% in January from a year earlier, following a revised 1.2% growth in December, according to the poll.

The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry will release both industrial production and retail sales data on Feb. 28 at 8:50 a.m. (Feb. 27 at 2350 GMT).
Japan's unemployment rate and jobs-to-applicants ratio likely stayed flat in January from the prior month at 2.7% and 1.16, respectively, the poll also showed. Job figures are due on Mar. 4 at 8:30 a.m. (Mar. 3 at 2330 GMT).

(Reuters) - The United States on Thursday restricted exports to Russia of a broad set of U.S.-made products as well as foreign-produced goods built with U.S. technology, following the invasion of Ukraine.
Here is how the rules are expected to affect U.S. tech companies, according to six experts on U.S. trade law. 
What technology is newly restricted from export to Russia?
U.S. companies must now obtain licenses to sell computers, sensors, lasers, navigation tools, and telecommunications, aerospace and marine equipment. The United States will deny almost all requests.
""We expected something sweeping, and this was certainly sweeping,"" said Ama Adams, partner at law firm Ropes & Gray. 
The new rules also force companies making tech products overseas with U.S. tools to seek a U.S. license before shipping to Russia. 
A similar restriction was first applied in recent years to companies shipping to Chinese technology giant Huawei, to great effect.
Which U.S. companies will be most impacted?
Many companies may opt to suspend all sales to Russia out of caution, legal experts said. Dan Goren, partner at law firm Wiggin and Dana, said a client that makes electronic equipment had already held shipments to a Russian distributor on Thursday.
U.S. exports to Russia were limited to about $6.4 billion last year, U.S. census data show, with machinery and vehicles among big categories in past years. 
The most severe tech hits to Russia could come from curbs on foreign goods.
For example, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), which represents U.S. chipmakers, noted that ""Russia is not a significant direct consumer of semiconductors"" and that Russia's communications and tech spending ""totaled only about $25 billion out of the multi-trillion global market"" in 2019. 
But many products made in Asia and destined for Russia include chips made with U.S. tooling. Over two dozen members of the European Union, as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, are imposing similar export restrictions to limit Russia's options.
How will Russia be affected?
Emily Kilcrease, senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and former deputy assistant U.S. Trade Representative, said the restrictions will freeze Russia's technology where it is today.
""You won’t be able to get new tech into the country,"" she said.
William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Commerce Department export official, expects a slow escalation of impact.
""Eventually they will be hurting, but maybe not for months,"" he said. ""It’s not an immediate body blow.""
The curbs and sanctions are not as comprehensive as U.S. trade actions on Iran and North Korea, but they could have bigger consequences globally because Russia is more intertwined with the world economy, attorneys said.
What technology is not covered by new restrictions?
The measures include carve-outs for consumer items such as household electronics, humanitarian goods, and technology necessary for flight safety. Cell phones are permitted as long as they are not sent to Russian government employees or certain affiliates.
Also not restricted are consumer encryption technologies, which one attorney described as a sign that the United States and its allies do not want to disrupt protesters and media.
Nothing precludes the U.S. from later extending sanctions to more items.
South Korea was not listed among countries partnering on the rules, and its assistance would be important for blocking Russia's access to chips from there, Kilcrease said.
A senior U.S. administration official said Thursday that more countries were expected to join.
The South Korean Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
South Korea said on Thursday it would join in unspecified multilateral economic sanctions on Russia in response to its military operations in Ukraine, but is not considering adopting unilateral measures.

Which companies could benefit from the new rules?
Kilcrease and legal experts expect that Chinese technology companies may want to fill some voids created by restrictions on Western tech companies, though Kilcrease said the U.S. rules would discourage them. But the senior U.S. administration official said that China cannot supply Russian crucial military needs, especially for the most advanced chips.

The People’s Bank of China injected a net 290 billion yuan ($45.8 billion) into the financial system via seven-day reverse repurchase agreements Friday, the most since September 2020. The operation is aimed at keeping liquidity stable at month-end, it said.
“The injection is in response to tighter liquidity condition at month-end and also to send a reminder that the easing cycle is still under way,” said Ken Cheung, chief Asia FX strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. “The geopolitical tensions posed mounting uncertainties and banks may have preference to keep extra liquidity.”
China’s seven-day repo rate had risen to its highest in nearly a month on Thursday, signaling cash tightness in the financial system. The demand for cash typically increases toward the end of the month as corporates borrow to pay taxes and banks hoard funds for regulatory checks.
The PBOC made net injections of 190 billion yuan each into the banking system in the previous two sessions to alleviate the cash crunch. It had been draining liquidity in the last two weeks, which is what it tends to do after the Lunar New Year holiday.

(Reuters) -Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller on Thursday laid out the case for a ""concerted"" effort to rein in inflation, calling for raising interest rates a full percentage point by mid-year, starting with a half-percentage-point hike in March if data in coming weeks continues to point to an ""exceedingly hot"" economy.
""I believe appropriate interest rate policy brings the target range up to 1 to 1.25 percent early in the summer,"" Waller said at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Economic Forecast Project. The Fed should also start trimming its $9 trillion balance sheet ""no later than"" its July meeting, he said. 
Once initial rate hikes are made, further increases would be in order if inflation stayed high, Waller said, or could slow or pause if inflation moderates in the second half as he expects. 
""Of course, it is possible that the state of the world will be different in the wake of the Ukraine attack, and that may mean that a more modest tightening is appropriate,"" Waller said. 
But, he said, it is still far too early to read the impact of the conflict on the U.S. or world economy. And with consumer prices rising the fastest in 40 years, the Fed ""must respond decisively to the data so as to maintain our credibility that we will bring down inflation."" 
Over the past week or so, Fed policymakers largely signaled a preference for beginning the coming round of U.S. interest rate hikes with a modest quarter-point hike, and after Russia's invasion of Ukraine traders slashed bets on a bigger March hike.
BALANCE SHEET A BIG QUESTION
But Waller's remarks - which echo the views of St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, his former boss - suggest Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be contending with a divided policy-setting committee when it meets on March 15-16. 
As Waller made what he called a ""strong case"" for a 50-basis-point rate hike in March against the backdrop of an economy at full employment and ""alarming"" inflation, interest rate futures traders boosted bets on such an increase, putting the probability at about 25%, about double what was seen earlier in the day.
Two more inflation reports - one of which comes Friday - and a report on the labor market will, along with the situation in Europe, feed into the Fed's policy decision. At issue is not just whether to ""frontload"" rate hikes as Waller and Bullard suggest, but also how far to raise rates and how fast to trim the Fed's balance sheet to tighten monetary policy enough to slow demand and rein in inflation. 
On Thursday, Waller said the Fed should allow the balance sheet to run off much faster than in 2017 when it last let its holdings shrink, in light of the much stronger economy now and what is now a much bigger balance sheet. 
The Fed should not put any caps on how quickly to let mortgage-backed securities run off, he said. 
""With large caps and sizable amounts of securities maturing over the course of the next year or two, I do not see the need to consider asset sales anytime soon,"" Waller said, though ""down the road"" the Fed could consider sales of MBS. 

As the Fed makes decisions on policy, Waller said, it must ""urgently"" watch the data, noting how few had foreseen how much inflation would rise in 2021, and his own surprise at how little the most recent COVID surge had slowed the economy. 
""I will continue to monitor the geopolitical situation to assess the appropriate timing of this near-term monetary policy tightening,"" Waller said. ""These actions will get us into the second half of the year, when we will have six months of inflation data, and we can assess what the appropriate path will be for the rest of 2022.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Volkswagen and its top shareholder Porsche SE on Thursday fleshed out details of a possible listing of luxury carmaker Porsche, edging closer to what could become one of the world's largest stock market debuts.
In case of an initial public offering, the share capital of Porsche AG would be equally split into preferred and ordinary shares and up to a quarter of the preferred stock would be placed on the market, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said, confirming an earlier Reuters story.
This implies a potential placement and free float of up to 12.5% of Porsche AG's total share capital, or more than 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) when using a valuation of around 90 billion.
Ordinary shares, which would solely be owned by Volkswagen and Porsche SE under the plans, would not be publicly listed, a spokesperson said.
""The automotive industry is changing fundamentally. Volkswagen is determined to play a leading role in a world of zero-emission and autonomous mobility,"" Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess said.
""An IPO of Porsche AG would give us additional flexibility to further accelerate the transformation. Porsche AG would gain more entrepreneurial freedom and at the same time continue to benefit from group synergies.""
According to the framework agreement, Porsche SE, which owns a 31.4% equity stake in Volkswagen and 53.3% of the voting rights, would buy 25% plus one share of Porsche AG's ordinary shares from Volkswagen at a 7.5% premium to the placement price of the preferred shares.
The would give the Porsche and Piech families, which control Porsche SE, a blocking minority in the listed carmaker that was founded by their ancestor Ferdinand Porsche in 1931.
Volkswagen said it would propose that shareholders, which apart from Porsche SE include Qatar and the German state of Lower Saxony, receive 49% of the gross proceeds the carmaker will generate via the sale of preferred and ordinary shares.
Qatar, which owns 14.6% in Volkswagen and 17% of its voting rights, would also become a strategic investor in Porsche AG's preferred shares in case of an IPO, Volkswagen said.

Stephan Weil, state premier of Lower Saxony, Volkswagen's third-largest shareholder, said the state was supporting the presented framework agreement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The World Bank said on Thursday it was preparing options to provide immediate support to Ukraine's government, as the development lender and the International Monetary Fund assess the economic fallout from the conflict in Ukraine.
""We stand ready to provide immediate support to Ukraine and are preparing options for such support, including fast-disbursing financing,"" World Bank President David Malpass said in a statement, adding that the institution was ""horrified by the shocking violence and loss of life"" in Ukraine.
The statement came after Malpass told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday that the bank was preparing a $350 million disbursement to Ukraine for budget support by the end of March.
It was unclear, however, what resources may be available to aid Ukraine's people if Zelenskiy's democratically elected government is deposed by Russian forces.
In recent cases of abrupt shifts of government power by force, including coups in Myanmar and Sudan, the World Bank has suspended dealings with military-installed governments.
But in Afghanistan, which the Taliban took by force last August, the bank is seeking to use around $1 billion in a frozen Afghanistan trust fund for education, agriculture, health and family programs to ease a worsening humanitarian crisis.
NO REFERENCE TO AN ""INVASION""
For Ukraine, Malpass said the World Bank was mobilizing a global crisis group to coordinate among its divisions and development partners to work on a rapid response. The bank is also coordinating closely with the IMF to assess the ""far-reaching economic and social costs.""
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a tweet https://twitter.com/KGeorgieva/status/1496858061797011456?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet that she was ""deeply concerned"" about the conflict in Ukraine, which ""adds significant economic risk for the region & the world.
""We are assessing the implications & stand ready to support our members as needed,"" Georgieva said, echoing comments she made earlier this month.
Neither leader used the term ""invasion"" in their statements. Russia and Ukraine are members of both institutions, which were created at the end of the last major conflict in Europe, World War Two. The United States holds controlling interests in both organizations.
Malpass said the World Bank was also in active dialogue to support neighboring countries affected by the conflict ""and will make additional resources available.""
The IMF and the World Bank also said they were working to keep remaining employees in Ukraine safe. Most of the World Bank's Ukraine staff have relocated outside the country, though some remained for personal and family reasons.

""We will continue to identify options for those who have decided to not leave the country at this point,"" Malpass said in an internal memo to the bank's nearly 16,000 global employees.
A spokesperson for the IMF said the fund had been in contact with remaining local staff in the country.

701,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 07:02PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States and the European Union have opted not to cut Russia off from the SWIFT global interbank payments system as part of their sanctions against Moscow for invading Ukraine, but could revisit that issue, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday.
Asked why that step was not taken, Biden told reporters the sanctions imposed against Russian banks exceeded the impact of cutting Russia off from SWIFT, and other countries had failed to agree on taking the additional step at this point.
""It is always an option,"" Biden said. ""But right now, that's not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.""
Several EU sources had told Reuters before the sanctions were announced that the EU was unlikely to agree to the move, despite calls from various quarters to do so. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany - a key trading partner of Russia - opposed cutting off Russia's access to the payment system at this point, but also suggested such a step could still follow at a later stage.
""It is very important that we agree those measures that have been prepared - and keep everything else for a situation where it may be necessary to go beyond that,"" Scholz told reporters, responding to a question on SWIFT, as he arrived to an emergency summit set to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The foreign ministers of the Baltic states, once ruled from Moscow but now members of NATO and the EU, called on Thursday to stop Russia's access to SWIFT.
Other EU member states are reluctant to make such a move because, while it would hit Russian banks hard, it would make it tough for European creditors to get their money back and Russia has in any case been building up an alternative payment system.
""Urgency and consensus is utmost priority at the moment,"" said an EU diplomat, adding that at this stage it meant no move on SWIFT, because doing so would have such wide-ranging consequences, also in Europe.
Another EU diplomat said: ""I am not aware of an agreement (on SWIFT sanctions) at this point.""

Data from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) shows that European lenders hold the lion's share of the nearly $30 billion in foreign banks' exposure to Russia.
Belgium-based SWIFT, a messaging network widely used by banks to send and receive money transfer orders or information, is overseen by central banks in the United States, Japan and Europe.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia's attack on Ukraine sparked volatility and fresh uncertainty in markets on Thursday, as investors scrambled to assess the conflict's longer term implications for asset prices. 
After sinking earlier in the session, U.S. stocks surged later in the day while haven assets such as gold and Treasuries unwound some of their earlier gains. Oil prices, which breached $100 for the first time since 2014, also eased. 
Markets have already taken investors on a bumpy ride this year, with the S&P 500 down around 10% year-to-date on worries over a more hawkish Federal Reserve and heightened geopolitical strife.
The attack on Ukraine will likely add another layer of uncertainty to markets, increasing the potential for more gyrations, investors said.
""We are going to churn here for a while,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors. ""We are going to have very volatile days and weeks ahead.""
In the United States, the benchmark S&P 500 reversed earlier losses and closed up nearly 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 3.3%.
President Joe Biden unveiled harsh new sanctions against Russia on Thursday afternoon, but held back from imposing sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin himself and from disconnecting Russia from the SWIFT international banking system.
""Hard-hitting sanctions would not only punish Russia but also Europe, so the afternoon rebound embraced the not-so-hard second round of sanctions,"" said OANDA's Edward Moya in a note to investors.
The market's initial knee-jerk reaction was typical of that seen during past geopolitical flare ups. Gold prices jumped to their highest in more than a year and the dollar surged more than 1% against a basket of its peers as investors piled into so-called safe haven assets. 
Yields on U.S. Treasuries, another popular destination for nervous investors, initially tumbled more than 10 basis points. 
""Heightened volatility on the escalation of the conflict shows markets had not fully priced in the likelihood of deeper conflict,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Thursday report.
The geopolitical uncertainty and wild asset price gyrations could mitigate expected monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve and other central banks in coming months, some market watchers believe. 
OPPORTUNITY?
For some investors, the sharp equity market falls offered a buying opportunity.
""There are a lot of people talking about buying the dip so I'm sure there are a lot of portfolio managers out there with shopping lists,"" said Matthew Tuttle, chief investment officer at Tuttle Capital Management. 
""We... bought a little more into shippers and dropped more energy but not doing a whole lot beyond that,"" said Tuttle, who is bearish on stocks over the longer term.
With price pressures across major economies already at their highest in decades, others dashed for inflation trades. 
In addition to the surge in oil prices, wheat futures jumped to their highest since July 2012, soybean futures gained to a nine-year peak, and corn futures hit an eight-month high. [GRA/] 
""Whether there will be a full-blown war or not, the simple strategy is to bet on a spike in inflation,"" said Yuan Yuwei, a Chinese hedge fund manager at Water Wisdom Asset Management. ""That means buying oil and agricultural products, and shorting consumer shares and U.S. growth stocks."" 
Some investors were also looking at assets linked to Ukraine and Russia, which have been hit hard in recent days.
One portfolio manager at a U.S-based asset manager, who asked not to be named, reckoned Ukraine's beaten-down bonds were a bargain ""unless Putin fully occupies Ukraine.""
The premium demanded by investors to hold Ukrainian debt relative to U.S. Treasuries soared to 15 percentage points - the widest since the country underwent a debt restructuring in 2015.

Russian assets also took a beating - the dollar-denominated RTS stock index crashed 40% to 489 points, its lowest since 2016, while yields on Russian sovereign bonds soared. But bargain hunters were not expected to rush in. 
""Buying the dip may be the right response to geopolitics but it's not necessarily true for the part of the world where the fire is actually burning,"" said Dirk Willer, head of global macro and asset allocation at Citi.

(Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers on Thursday signaled the conflict in Ukraine will not budge them from their expected course of rate hikes ahead.
But the impact on the U.S. economy could be felt in sundry ways, from the price people pay for gasoline at the pump to a hit to household wealth. Here is a look at a few of them. 
HIGHER ENERGY COSTS
Oil prices rose on Thursday following the attack, with Brent topping $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014. Those higher energy prices could eat in to consumers’ budgets and add more pressure to inflation that is already at the highest levels in 40 years. 
GRAPHIC: U.S. oil prices surge after Russia invades Ukraine - https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/USA-FED/jnvwebywyvw/chart.png 
If oil prices stay at about $100 a barrel, energy costs for U.S. households could rise by $750 on average this year from last year, leaving them with less money to spend on other goods and services, said Gregory Daco, chief economist for EY-Parthenon. Those added expenses could also be a drag on economic growth, said Daco, who projects that higher oil prices could lift inflation by 0.6 percentage point this year and slow economic growth by 0.4 percentage point. 
Consumer prices last month rose 7.5% from a year earlier, the fastest pace in nearly 40 years.
""A lot of people, especially lower-income folks, a huge amount of their income goes towards gasoline,"" Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin told reporters after an economic symposium in Colonial Heights, Virginia. ""So if those prices go up it dampens consumer spending and dampens the economy.”
TRADE AND SUPPLY CHAINS
Russia and Ukraine combined account for much less than 1% of U.S. imports and exports, so there will be no large trade hits on the economy from the conflict. The United States, unlike its European allies, is also a natural gas exporter, which should limit outsized effects on those prices.
But with American consumers already straining against steep rises in the cost of living for everything from autos to food as supply chains continue to be snarled by the COVID-19 pandemic, the invasion and any further escalation in the conflict could help keep inflation pressures elevated. 
For example, Russia's Nornickel is the world's largest supplier of palladium, used by automakers for catalytic converters and to clean car exhaust fumes. The price of palladium rose to its highest level since July on Thursday, and any disruption of Russian supplies would impact auto production, still suffering from pandemic-related supply shortages of semiconductor chips.
Russia and Ukraine also export more than a quarter of the world's wheat, and Ukraine is a major corn exporter. Although the knock-on effect of higher agricultural commodities costs to consumer prices tends to be quite weak, it could still add between 0.2 to 0.4 percentage point to headline inflation in developed economies in the next few months, according to a client note by analysts at Capital Economics.
And U.S. trade and foreign investments may be negatively impacted indirectly by any upheaval in Europe, according to AEI economist Michael Strain.
STOCK DROP DRAG
Major U.S. stock indexes dropped in the hours after Russia's Ukraine invasion, and though they recovered after U.S. President Joe Biden announced sanctions on Russia, ""absent any improvement in the situation (in Ukraine), they may have further to run,"" wrote Capital Economics' Jonas Goltermann. 
Any drop erodes - at least on paper - a mainstay of U.S. household wealth, potentially dealing a blow to consumer confidence and squelching demand. After an initial plunge at the start of the pandemic, stocks have doubled in value, and direct holdings of stocks and mutual funds swelled to account for a record share of household wealth.
That could drive consumer sentiment gauges - some of which are already at a decade low due to stiff inflation - even lower still and threaten the outlook for consumer spending. 
GRAPHIC: Household exposure to stocks - https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/USA-ECONOMY/movandkwapa/chart.png 
That being said, as Monetary Policy Analytics' Larry Meyer wrote, ""weak demand in the U.S. is far from being a concern,"" and with inflation already high, policymakers may be less sanguine about the jump in energy prices than would otherwise be the case. ""Should demand weaken substantially, the Fed would certainly have tough decisions to make, and we think the Fed would react,"" he wrote. ""But today’s risk environment does not afford them the luxury of focusing only on downside risks when it comes to risk management.""
OTHER IMPACTS
Some analysts clanged alarm bells. 

High Frequency Economics' Carl Weinberg said he expected Vladimir Putin's move into Ukraine to shift the economies of Europe, and possibly the United States, onto a ""wartime footing,"" resulting in goods shortages and further upward price pressure. He also warned that Russia could try to counter sanctions with cyber attacks on U.S. or European financial infrastructures, among other possibilities. 
Another economist, Carl Tannenbaum of  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS), wrote, ""a broader conflict in Eastern Europe could provoke a wholesale reevaluation of the outlook"" for monetary policy, fueling uncertainty and pushing down sentiment. But he added: ""For now, risks are tilted to the upside, and central banks will be tightening policy in response.""

(Reuters) -Beyond Meat Inc forecast annual revenue below estimates on Thursday, hitting its share price, as it faced stiffer competition amid flat demand for plant-based protein.

Sales to U.S. grocers, convenience stores and other retailers declined 19.5% in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.
Rivals including  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) and Kellogg (NYSE:K) recently entered the fray with big discounts to get more people to trial their products.
U.S. retail sales in the plant-based meat category fell 0.4% last year versus 45% growth in 2020, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said during an earnings call.
""We experienced intense increased competition during the period when the size of the prize did not expand,"" he said.
Those remarks echoed comments made by rival Maple Leaf Foods Inc, parent of Lightlife Foods, earlier on Thursday.
Maple Leaf Chief Operating Officer Curtis Frank said during an earnings call that many consumers tried plant-based proteins early on but did not repeat purchases.
Beyond Meat posted a larger than expected loss of $1.27 per share in the fourth quarter, versus estimates for a loss of 71 cents, as it spent heavily on marketing and incurred high manufacturing costs due to supply chain disruptions.

Net revenue was $100.7 million in the quarter, compared with $101.9 million a year earlier. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected $101.4 million.
Brown said growth should resume this year, in part as Beyond Meat executes on partnerships with McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) and KFC and launches a new product line with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc in coming weeks - which Brown said he was snacking on during the call.

The central bank's Financial Stability Committee, which met on Thursday, also stressed that the national financial system exposure to the effects of current international geopolitical tensions is ""low"", given the country's reduced currency exposure and dependence on external funding.
""The Committee is attentive to the recent evolution of the international scenario and remains prepared to act, minimizing any disproportionate contamination on the prices of local assets, in particular through the exchange market channel,"" it wrote in a statement.

The Brazilian real fell 1.99% against the dollar in reaction to a surge in global risk aversion. Still, it remains among the world's best-performing currencies to year-to-date, with financial inflows being attracted by cheap equity valuations and high debt yields amid an aggressive monetary tightening to tame double-digit inflation.
Policymakers have hiked the country's benchmark interest rate to 10.75% from its record-low of 2% last March and already signaled the need for additional increases.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -European Union leaders agreed on Thursday to impose new economic sanctions on Russia, joining the United States and Britain in trying to punish President Vladimir Putin and his allies for unleashing a full-scale attack on Ukraine.
However, the bloc held back from taking the harshest measures sought by Ukraine and split over just how far to take the sanctions, leaving details to be worked out in the coming days. 
Russia's forces rained missiles on its southern neighbour through the day in the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two..
Leaders of the 27-nation bloc lambasted Putin at an emergency summit in Brussels, with Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins describing him as ""a deluded autocrat creating misery for millions"".
The EU will freeze Russian assets in the bloc and halt its banks' access to European financial markets as part of what EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described as ""the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented"".
The sanctions will also target Russia's energy and transport sectors among others, and seek to stifle its trade and manufacturing with export controls. 
""Our sanctions will hurt the Russian economy in its heart,"" said Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo.
But a sense of powerlessness was tangible after Western failed to to stop a war that they leaders had seen coming. 
""We were not successful enough, not decisive enough, to prevent Russia from this step, which is a tragedy for Ukraine, a tragedy for Europe and a tragedy for Russia itself,"" said Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda.
There are differences within the EU over how far to go with sanctions, with countries that would face the biggest economic backlash keen to keep the most severe steps in reserve.
""Hopefully, we will make big strides tomorrow on how these sanctions will look specifically,"" said Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra. ""For the Netherlands, SWIFT is part of the discussion.""
'MASSIVE AND SEVERE CONSEQUENCES'
An EU diplomat said the bloc, like the United States, would stop short of taking steps to cut Russia off from the SWIFT global interbank payments system.
Ukraine and the EU's ex-Soviet Baltic states had been pushing to remove Russia from the system. But asked about SWIFT, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said: ""We need to keep sanctions ready for later times.""
Germany has already put approval of the Russian-owned Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline on ice.
In a statement agreed at the summit, EU leaders said the new round of sanctions ""will impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its action, in close coordination with our partners and allies"".
Russian assets in the EU would be frozen and Russian banks' access to Europe's financial markets would be blocked.
An EU diplomat said Italy, Germany and Cyprus were among those that preferred a step-by-step approach, while central European and Baltic states - those closest to Russia - wanted a harder stance.
""Russia needs to feel that the price of aggression is significant,"" said Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa, wearing a tie with the Ukrainian flag's yellow and blue colours. 
The EU had already approved a first round of sanctions on Wednesday, including blacklisting Russian politicians and curbing trade between the EU and two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine whose independence Moscow has recognised. 
The EU will also prepare a new aid package for Ukraine and new sanctions against Belarus, used by some of the Russian invaders to enter Ukraine. 

Separately, the bloc also promised support to Moldova, another ex-Soviet republic where a pro-Western government is at odds with its former overlord Moscow. 
""If he (Putin) can attack Ukraine, it could be any other European country. The democratic ideas, if they were to get to Russia, they would overturn his government. He is fighting for power,"" said Latvia's Karins.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration announced sweeping export restrictions against Russia on Thursday, hammering its access to global exports of goods from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts.
The controls, announced by the Commerce Department and first reported by Reuters, rely on a dramatic expansion of the so-called Foreign Direct Product Rule, forcing companies making high- and low-tech items overseas with U.S. tools to seek a license from the United States before shipping to Russia.
The measures also instruct the Commerce Department to deny almost all of those license requests.
In a White House speech announcing the new controls, President Joe Biden said they would ""impose severe costs on the Russian economy both immediately and over time,"" noting that allies including 27 members of the European Union such as France, Germany and Italy, as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, had joined in the response to maximize its impact. 
""Between our actions and those of our allies and partners, we estimate that we will cut off more than half of Russia's high-tech imports,"" he said. 
Biden's announcement came as Ukrainian forces battled Russian invaders around nearly all of the country's perimeter on Thursday after Moscow mounted an assault by land, sea and air in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.
Under the export curbs announced on Thursday, U.S. suppliers would also have to obtain licenses for certain Russia-bound items that do not currently require them, such as civil aircraft parts. 
Those license applications, in turn, will face a strict ""policy-of-denial"" standard of review, meaning only in rare cases would the administration approve them.
By far the most sweeping measure is the expansion of the Foreign Direct Product Rule, or FDPR, for Russian buyers. The move takes a page from restrictions placed on Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd under then-President Donald Trump.
""This is the most complex export control rule ever written,"" former Commerce Department official Kevin Wolf said. ""Many companies may choose to simply avoid dealing with Russia to avoid the potential for a mistake.""
Under the new measures, Russian companies listed as so-called military end users for their alleged ties to the Russian military, including a handful of aircraft producers, will be added to a trade blacklist known as the entity list. That will broaden the scope of items the companies would need licenses to obtain.
Washington is also using an additional expansion of the FDPR to dramatically broaden the scope of products that would need approval from the United States when sent to Russian military end users. It subjects to U.S. license requirements to all items made abroad with U.S. tools and destined for companies that support the Russian military.
The measures includes carveouts for consumer items such as household electronics, humanitarian goods, and technology necessary for flight safety. Consumer communications devices, like cell phones, are also permitted as long as they are not sent to Russian government employees or certain affiliates.
Cordell Hull, a former Commerce Department official, predicted the rules, though ""significant,"" would be difficult to enforce. 

Speaking at a virtual event hours before the rules were published, Matthew Axelrod, the Commerce Department’s Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement, vowed to ""enforce those severe sanctions aggressively.""
The export curbs were coupled with fresh sanctions against major Russian banks, including the country's two largest lenders, Sberbank and VTB, aimed at limiting Russian access to the U.S. financial system.

(Reuters) -Airlines scrambled to adapt to conflict in Europe on Thursday as Ukraine closed its airspace, fuel prices soared and carriers were urged to ""exercise caution"" deep inside Russia hours after Moscow's military invaded Ukraine.
Moldova, southwest of Ukraine, also halted flights, while Belarus to the north said civilian flights could no longer fly over part of its territory after Russian President Vladimir Putin authorised the dawn operation. 
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said Ukraine's skies and airspace in Russia and Belarus within 100 nautical miles of borders with Ukraine could pose risks.
""In particular, there is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft,"" the agency said. 
""The presence and possible use of a wide range of ground and airborne warfare systems poses a high risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels.""
It later issued an update on a broader area of Russian airspace, advising airlines to ""exercise caution"" when flying in air traffic regions controlled from Moscow or Rostov-on-Don.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration expanded an area in or near Ukraine where U.S. airlines cannot operate.
The aviation industry has taken heightened notice of the risks conflicts pose to civil aviation since Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014.
EASA said Russia's defence ministry had sent Ukraine an urgent message warning of a high risk to flight safety due to the use of weapons and military equipment, and asked Ukraine's air traffic control to stop flights.
Websites, which before the escalation had shown multiple intelligence-gathering flights over or near Ukraine as the West showcased support by transmitting detectable signals in recent weeks, showed empty space as civil flights halted and analysts said any military flights went dark..
Airlines skirted the whole country in crowded corridors to the north and west, leaving a hole in the aviation map.
An El Al flight from Tel Aviv to Toronto made a U-turn out of Ukraine's airspace around the time of its closure, the tracking website FlightRadar24 showed. 
A LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw to Kyiv turned back, as did Kyiv-bound flights operated by Air India and Aegean Airlines.
AIRSPACE CONCERN
Ukraine International Airlines, which sent part of its fleet to safety abroad last week, diverted one Kyiv-bound flight to Moldova. Some of its planes remained grounded in Kyiv.
Hungary's Wizz Air said it was trying to evacuate Ukrainian-based crew, their families and four aircraft.
In the London insurance world, underwriters acted swiftly to contain their risks.
Leading war-risk insurers cut the notice period to 24 hours for cancellation of policies for Ukrainian airlines, said Bruce Carman, chief underwriting officer at Hive Aero in London.
Airline shares fluctuated, with an index of major European carriers down 6% and U.S carriers erasing early losses, as some analysts warned of a sanctions war forcing carriers to fly longer routes.
Britain said it had banned all Russian airlines including Aeroflot which operates daily to London, from entering its airspace or landing on its soil.
Airlines and companies that control jets worth billions of dollars have voiced concerns about the risk of Russia closing its own airspace as part of tit-for-tat sanctions.
""While that would be Russia shooting itself in the foot, I can't dismiss it once the sanctions start to bite,"" said airline analyst Robert Mann. 
Air corridors between parts of Europe or North America and Asia stretch across Russia, generating overflight fees.
The crisis also cast a shadow over wider travel demand for the third northern summer in a row, after two years of pandemic.
U.S. carriers have been boosting capacity, expecting a surge in demand to Europe. But the conflict might force travellers to change plans, Mann said.
Those that do fly are likely to face higher ticket prices after oil jumped above $100 a barrel on Thursday.
The head of major French aerospace supplier  Safran  (PA:SAF), said pent-up travel demand remained strong, however. 

Russia meanwhile suspended domestic flights to and from several airports near its border with Ukraine, including Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar and Stavropol, until March 2.
A notice to pilots said the move was ""to provide safety"" for civil flights.

LONDON (Reuters) -Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled Britain's largest-ever package of sanctions against Russia on Thursday, targeting banks, members of President Vladimir Putin's closest circle and wealthy Russians who enjoy high-rolling London lifestyles.
Western nations are coordinating action to impose tough sanctions against Russia in response to its all-out invasion on neighbouring Ukraine by staging missile strikes on cities and pouring its troops into the country.
Speaking to Parliament just hours after Putin declared war with Ukraine, Johnson said the Russian leader would be condemned by the world and by history for his invasion, never able to cleanse the ""blood of Ukraine from his hands"".
""This hideous and barbarous venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure,"" he told parliament when announcing the new sanctions, announcing a which saw sanctions being imposed on more than 100 Russian individuals and entities.
""For our part today the UK is announcing the largest and most severe package of economic sanctions that Russia has ever seen."" 
After the West was criticised for earlier, weaker sanctions this week in response to Russia recognising two breakaway republics in Ukraine, Johnson said leaders had agreed to work together to ""maximise the economic price"" Putin will pay.
A government official said the coordinated sanctions would knock percentage points off the Russian economy in the next 12 to 18 months.
END OF LONDONGRAD?
In the 10-point sanctions package, the British government said it would impose an asset freeze on some major Russian banks, including state-owned VTB, its second-biggest bank, and stop major Russian companies from raising finance in Britain.
""Sanctions have been a reality for us over the past few years, and another round of politically motivated anti-Russian sanctions came as no surprise,"" VTB said in a statement.
""We have had time to learn the lessons and prepare for the most severe scenario, we have worked through several plans to counter the sanctions in ways which minimise the negative consequences for our clients.""
Since the fall of the Soviet Union three decades ago, London's capital markets have been the favoured destination for Russian companies seeking to raise money outside Moscow.
Among the people targeted by the second wave of sanctions included Kirill Shamalov, Putin's once son-in-law. 
Pyotr Fradkov, chairman of Promsvyazbank, was also under sanctions. The finance ministry has accused Fradkov of working to transform the bank into one that serves the defence industry.
Britain will also ban Russia's flagship airline Aeroflot from landing in Britain, suspend dual export licences to Russia and ban exports of some high tech exports and parts of the extractive industry.
Johnson also went further than some other Western countries, calling for Russia to be excluded from SWIFT, the inter-bank messaging network which is the backbone of international finance - a demand made by Ukraine.

At home, officials said the sanctions were aimed at preventing wealthy Russians from using London, often dubbed 'Londongrad' or Moscow-on-Thames, as their playground, reducing their ability to store large amounts of cash in Britain's banks.
""These are people who have international lifestyles,"" a diplomatic source said. ""They come to Harrods to shop, they stay in our best hotels when they like, they send their children to our best (fee-paying) schools, and that is what's being stopped.""

711,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 03:36PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Institute of International Finance, the largest international banking group, said on Thursday that U.S. sanctions on Russia will have a sizeable impact on Russia's economy and citizens and could cause a recession. 
""The bottom line is that these sanctions will have a significant impact Russia's overall economy, and average Russians will feel the cost,"" the group said in a statement.
""These sanctions target Russia's domestic financial system, causing bank runs and forcing Russia's central bank to continue hiking rates. As a result, we are likely to see negative growth in an economy that has already been hindered by increasing isolationism.""
After Russia launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden imposed new sanctions against Russian banks and state-owned enterprises, which will impede the country's ability to do business in the world's major currencies.

Biden said the sanctions, which apply to Russia's two largest banks and would limit the country's ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen, are designed to have a long-term impact and to minimize the impact on the United States and its allies. 
The sanctions unveiled on Thursday, which add to some announced earlier in the week, do not target Russia's access to payment provider SWIFT, which is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) Governor Adrian Orr said on Friday that countering inflation pressures early prevent the need for even higher rates in the future.

""In other words, we are taking our foot off the accelerator now to minimise having to use the brakes harder in future,"" Orr said in a speech at the Waikato University Economics Forum.
Orr said market pricing of future central bank policy rates continue to indicate that New Zealand is expected to tighten policy sooner than many other comparable economies.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Australia's central bank will raise interest rates for the first time in over a decade in the third quarter, slightly earlier than thought a month ago, according to a Reuters poll of economists who see rates by year-end at 0.50%, up from 0.25% previously.
Nearly every other central bank among its peers will have hiked rates from record lows by the end of March. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has already lifted them several times in the current cycle. 
But the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) keeps waiting for signs of wage inflation before responding to broad inflationary pressures. 
Underlying inflation in Australia, which surged at its fastest annual pace since 2014 in the December quarter, suggests that price growth was not as temporary and or as benign as had been predicted by the RBA.
""Inflation will remain elevated for at least the first half of the year...the RBA can't afford to 'be patient' any longer,"" said Wouter van Eijkelenburg, an economist at Rabobank.
In the latest Feb. 18-24 Reuters poll, economists brought forward their rate hike expectations for a fourth straight month and expect the RBA to raise its key interest rate by 15 basis points to 0.25% in the July-September quarter.
Seven of 28 economists forecast rates would go up to 0.50% and two expected them to reach 0.75% in the third quarter. If realised, that would bring borrowing costs back to their pre-pandemic level.
More interest rate rises are on the way, with the benchmark rate expected to reach at least 0.50% by the end of this year according to 21 of 28 economists and 1.25% by the end of 2023, the poll showed.
In the previous survey, published last month, rates were only expected to reach 1.0% by the end of next year. 
Along with keeping rates at record lows to support an economy rocked by multiple lockdowns related to the pandemic, the RBA has been aiming to drive unemployment to 4% or lower in the hope of reviving wage growth after years of sub-par growth. 
It is near to that goal. 
Australian wages picked up to 2.3% in the last quarter as a rapidly tightening labour market drove intense competition for workers, but annual growth was short of the 3%-plus levels that policymakers say would justify a rise in interest rates.
The tightening labour market, combined with rising inflation, also suggests a rate rise is getting closer. Governor Philip Lowe this month said it was plausible a hike could come later in the year should the economy recover as expected.
Money market traders are betting on a rate rise to 0.25% as early as June, climbing to 1.50% by year-end. Among the major local banks, CBA is tipping a first rise in June, Westpac sees August, ANZ says September and NAB November.
""We don't completely rule out wages growth...and GDP data showing sufficient momentum by Q1 to convince the RBA it should move sooner than our September expectation,"" wrote David Plank, head of Australian economics at ANZ.

But some analysts said there was another domestic reason why the RBA appears to be moving more slowly in tightening policy compared with its other central bank peers. 
""We expect the Bank to refrain from hiking ahead of the federal election in May...(and) to start hiking in June in response to stubbornly high inflation,"" wrote Marcel Thieliant, senior Australia and New Zealand economist at Capital Economics.

714,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 02:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown said Thursday he will try again next week to advance President Joe Biden’s five Federal Reserve picks past a blockade led by ranking Republican Pat Toomey on Sarah Bloom Raskin’s nomination to vice chair of supervision.
“We’re going to have another meeting next Wednesday morning. I am hopeful Republicans show up,” Brown said on Bloomberg Television’s “Balance of Power with David Westin.” He said he’s never seen before one party try to block a confirmation vote with a boycott in the Banking Committee. 
“You go to the Senate, you do not have three choices, ‘Yes or no or I will boycott.’ You either vote yes or no. That is what the public expects,” the Ohio Democrat said.
Toomey continues to insist on getting more information from Raskin and the Fed over her role in lobbying for granting a master account to Colorado fintech firm Reserve Trust while she served as a director. Toomey contends it is a textbook example of Washington’s “revolving door” where former regulators -- Raskin is a former Fed governor and former deputy Treasury secretary -- get wealthy working for companies they regulated.
Raskin has said she can’t remember whether she helped the company get a master account. The Kansas City Fed has said it’s routine to discuss issues with directors of financial institutions, and the White House has said Raskin did nothing wrong. But Toomey said he’s been mostly stonewalled by the Fed for a full explanation on why the master account status was granted.
Toomey, of Pennsylvania, has argued that Democrats including Brown have boycotted other committee markups, including Finance Committee markups for Trump Cabinet picks Tom Price and Steven Mnuchin in 2017 in a dispute over their business dealings.
That boycott, however, didn’t result in a stalemate because the then-GOP majority was able to still vote the picks out of committee. In this 50-50 Senate, nominees can’t be sent to the floor without a quorum in the evenly-divided committees, requiring at least one Republican to show up for a vote.

(Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials on Thursday began taking stock of how the unfolding conflict in Ukraine might influence the economy and their planned shift to tighter monetary policy, with investors and some officials suggesting it could slow but likely not stop a planned round of interest rate increases.
Oil and commodity price shocks and a possible blow to global growth and confidence were clear risks, analysts said, and one Fed policymaker said the events of the last 24 hours could weigh on upcoming Fed decisions. 
""The implications of the unfolding situation in Ukraine for the medium-run economic outlook in the U.S. will also be a consideration in determining the appropriate pace"" for raising interest rates, said Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester.
Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the case for U.S. rate increases remained ""robust,"" but also called the invasion an ""unsettling"" event that would force policymakers to think through what might happen.
The risks could be as obvious as high oil prices weighing on consumer spending and raising inflation even further, or as unknowable as how Russia might respond to U.S. sanctions.
""Underlying demand is strong. The labor market is tight. Inflation is high and broadening,"" Barkin said, describing the basic case for rate increases. ""But I will say that it is unsettling to hear the news. As always happens you have to start and think through where could this thing go that you might not have forecast originally."" 
The Fed plans to raise interest rates beginning in March as it battles inflation that has hit multi-decade highs.
Fed policy has already been complicated by the unpredictable impact of a once-in-a-century pandemic, and must now account for a likely energy price shock and other uncertainty following Russia's military move into Ukraine.

GRAPHIC: U.S. oil prices surge after Russia invades Ukraine - https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/USA-FED/gdvzybqwypw/chart_eikon.jpg 
Investors have now all but ruled out a larger half-percentage-point rate increase at the Fed's March meeting. CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) widely followed FedWatch tool was signaling at one point that the probability of a hike that large had fallen overnight from about 33% to less than 10%. A quarter-point increase is still anticipated as the Fed begins to lift its target policy rate from the near zero level set at the outset of the pandemic.
STAGFLATION RISK
But the events overnight have dealt the central bank an unexpected new dynamic, an echo of the oil price shocks of the 1970s that were also driven by geopolitical conflict. In that case it was war and other tension in the Middle East, and came at a time when the U.S. economy was far more dependent on imported energy, and U.S. industry far less energy efficient.
Still, Fed officials were beginning to think through the implications of an event that had the potential to both slow growth and add to inflation.
""We'll be watching this closely here in Atlanta and across the Federal Reserve system to assess the economic and financial impacts,"" Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said during a virtual event. Still, he said the Fed's first-order problem now is controlling inflation, and that he is ready to raise rates by as many as four quarter-point increments this year, ""and depending on how things go it may be more than that.""
A few hours before the invasion was reported, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said that with U.S. inflation as high as it is and the labor market strong, the Fed should go ahead with rate hikes even with the uncertainty of a Ukraine-Russia conflict. ""I really don't see, unless things get materially worse...that this is going to have an effect"" on the Fed's decision to start raising rates in March, she said at an event Wednesday in Los Angeles.
But officials may now tread a touch more carefully until the breadth of Russia's actions, and how they affect oil prices, financial markets, and the broader economy, become clearer.
""We think probably now we have reached a tipping point where this is a situation that could start to have impacts on confidence...we know that it's affecting financial markets,"" said Jennifer McKeown, Head of Global Economics Service at Capital Economics. 
It is unlikely to derail tightening plans, but ""central banks are probably more likely now to be starting to err on the side of caution and worry about the adverse effects on their economy."" 
The immediate economic risk appears larger for Europe than the United States, with European Central Bank policymakers convening Thursday in a previously scheduled ""informal"" gathering that may become a crisis meeting. 
Still, the crisis threatens to delay the resolution of prominent factors that have fanned U.S. inflation higher such as global supply bottlenecks, which could keep price pressures high while denting growth prospects. 
GRAPHIC: Fed policy rate and inflation hit a record gap - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/FEDFUNDS/movandmydpa/chart.png 

Beyond the very near term, ""the impact of the stagflationary shock is ambiguous and could be net hawkish,"" Evercore ISI analysts wrote. ""Both the adverse sides of the macro distribution move up: the right tail risk of continued excess inflation in the medium term and the left tail risk that efforts to curb this inflation...end up causing a recession.""
""In the context of the sizeable disruptions to supply chains and energy prices already, this will...complicate the policy response of central banks,"" wrote analysts with TD Securities. ""The Fed and the U.S. may be removed enough to keep to hiking as planned, though risks shift in terms of 25 (basis point) increments rather than anything more aggressive.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors piled into U.S. government debt on Thursday, pushing Treasury yields sharply lower, after Russia invaded Ukraine, but early declines narrowed as investors assessed the assault's impact on the economy and capital markets. 
Ukraine reported columns of troops pouring across its borders from Russia and Belarus and landing on its coast from the Black and Azov seas, in the biggest attack by one country against another in Europe since World War Two.
World stock markets fell and investors fled to safe havens such as U.S. Treasuries and gold. The U.S. dollar strengthened more than 1% against major currencies, and oil rose more than 7% before trimming gains.
The decline in Treasury yields narrowed after U.S. trading opened, as did yields on German 10-year debt as markets closed in Europe. 
If the Russian incursion is contained to Ukraine and doesn't cross into any NATO-related country, tensions likely will shift, especially for U.S. assets, said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy at WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF).
""In the near term, uncertainty will reign. You will see volatility in the market that will result in a back-and-forth flight-to-quality, safe-haven trade,"" Flanagan said.
While the invasion of Ukraine is of a far more different scale than Russia's move into Crimea in 2014, it is still more of a Euro-centric issue at the moment, Flanagan said. 
""It won't affect U.S.-based behavior for consumers and for businesses unless things spiral into another phase,"" he said.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell 4.8 basis points to 1.929% after earlier touching 1.846%. The benchmark note had been on track for its biggest daily drop since late November. 
A closely watched part of the yield curve measuring the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasuries, seen as an indicator of economic expectations, was at 41.7 basis points.
History has shown over the past 50 years that geopolitical events rarely have a long-term sustainable impact on capital markets, said Stan Shipley, strategist at Evercore ISI.
""They do move some sectors, whether you’re talking about financial, banking or energy prices,"" Shipley said. ""But the trends we were seeing will probably continue after a short-term pause."" 
The Federal Reserve, which will hold its next policy meeting on March 15-16, has preferred in the past to delay major policy decisions until uncertainty driven by geopolitical risks has diminished, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said. 
But the current situation is different as inflation risk has created a more urgent reason to tighten, though uncertainty has lowered the odds of a 50-basis-point interest rate hike in March, Goldman said. But Goldman said it sees rates steadily rising by 25 basis points at upcoming meetings.
Money markets priced in an 18.5% probability of a 50-basis-point rate hike in March, or half the odds of such an increase as was registered on Wednesday.
The Ukraine invasion complicates the policy outlook for the Fed as energy and some grains prices will likely rise further if the attack deepens, said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management.
""The silver lining is that the decline in risk markets has helped prevent bond yields from rising to new yearly highs,"" he said. 
Across the U.S. Treasury curve, yields were sharply lower on the day, with the two-year note down 9.2 basis points at 1.508%. 
This echoed moves in European sovereign debt markets, where German Bund yields were set for their biggest daily drop since March 2020 - when the outbreak of COVID-19 threw world markets into turmoil.
Oil prices surged, with international benchmark Brent breaching $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014, as the attack on Ukraine exacerbated concerns about disruptions to global energy supplies.[O/R]
As investors rushed to protect against inflation risks, yields on inflation-linked bonds fell.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) was last at 2.6%, indicating that the market sees inflation averaging about 2.6% a year for the next decade. 
GRAPHIC: US Treasury yields slide as Russia launches Ukraine invasion - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkvlgagnrpb/USTagain.png 
The breakeven rate on five-year TIPS was last at 3.067%.

The U.S. dollar five-years forward inflation-linked swap, seen by some as a better gauge of inflation expectations due to possible distortions caused by the Fed's quantitative easing, was last at 2.369%.
The Treasury's sale of $50 billion in seven-year notes was strong, with the yield at 1.905%.

718,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 02:07PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -The Democrat heading the Senate Banking Committee will try again next Wednesday to advance President Joe Biden's slate of nominees to the U.S. Federal Reserve who have been held up by a Republican boycott of the confirmation vote, according to a tweet from a Bloomberg reporter on Thursday.
Spokespeople for Sherrod Brown, chair of the Senate Banking Committee, did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment. 
Republicans last week refused to show up for a vote on the slate, which includes Jerome Powell for a second term as Fed chair, over objections to Sarah Bloom Raskin to be the central bank's head of financial regulation.
The other nominees are Fed Governor Lael Brainard, whom Biden wants to make Fed vice chair, along with Michigan State University's Lisa Cook and Davidson College's Philip Jefferson. 
The Fed is expected to start raising interest rates next month to fight high inflation, a course of action the proposed new additions to the Fed have indicated they would support. 

Republicans oppose Raskin because they see her as a champion of climate change activism who would try to cut lending to oil and gas companies. The Senate panel's top Republican, Pat Toomey, has held up the vote for all nominees over what they say are ethical questions around Raskin's actions as a director for a financial firm in 2017, and has proposed putting aside her nomination while going forward with a vote on the others.
Democrats and Raskin herself say there were no ethical lapses, and Brown wants all Fed nominees to come for a vote at the same time.

MONTREAL (Reuters) -Canada's second-biggest pension fund, Caisse de depot, said on Thursday it had sold positions in Russia and would avoid exposure as the country faces additional sanctions due to its invasion of neighboring Ukraine.
Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, which had C$420 billion ($327 billion) in assets at the end of 2021, said in a statement it had disposed of certain investments that were acquired before sanctions were passed.
""There's no interest in investing directly and being exposed to the strategies when it comes to Russia, that's the main principle,"" Charles Emond, its chief executive, told reporters.
Emond said it was difficult to eliminate exposure given the global nature of indexes and investments.
""We are very active to correct the situation, to replicate our indices internally and to leave Russia,"" he said.
Ukrainian forces battled Russian invaders on Thursday after Moscow mounted a mass attack by land, sea and air in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday banned Canadians from all financial dealings with the Ukraine separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which Moscow recognized as independent early this week. He also banned Canadians from purchasing Russian sovereign debt, as part of the first round of economic sanctions on Russia.
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the country's largest pension fund, said it had no direct exposure to Russia and any indirect exposure is minimal after making a ""conscious decision"" years ago to avoid Russia, a spokesperson said by email.
Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, which manages pensions for Canadian police among others, said it does not comment on changes in specific shareholdings but complies with applicable sanctions laws. It has investments in two London-based companies, V Group and AMS, that have offices globally, including in Russia, according to its website.
PSP Investments declined to comment, while the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, British Columbia Investment Management Corp., and Alberta Investment Management Corp. did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Caisse said earlier it had generated a weighted-average return of 13.5% on its depositors’ funds in 2021, compared with 10.7% for its benchmark.

U.S. President Joe Biden has said Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction that its attack on Ukraine will bring.
In a televised meeting with business leaders, Putin told Alexander Shokhin, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, that Moscow had been forced into taking action and knew that sanctions would follow. 
""We all understand the world we live in and were prepared in one way or another for what is now happening from the point of view of sanctions policy,"" Putin said. ""Russia remains a part of the global economy."" 
Shokhin said Russia should stimulate extra demand for government debt from private investors, given new Western sanctions on Russian state bonds, warning new sanctions would be tougher than previous ones and may disrupt logistics and supply chains.

He also urged Western nations not to apply sanctions on climate projects. 
""I want to thank you for what has been done so far in rather difficult conditions,"" Putin told Shokhin.

723,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 12:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials signaled they remain on track to raise interest rates next month despite uncertainty posed to the global economy by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
While acknowledging the risks created by the conflict, which has triggered one of the worst security crises in Europe since World War II and caused oil prices to surge, U.S. central bankers stressed the need to confront the hottest U.S. inflation in 40 years.
“Barring an unexpected turn in the economy, I believe it will be appropriate to move the funds rate up in March and follow with further increases in the coming months,” Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Thursday at an event hosted by Lyons Companies and the University of Delaware. 
“The implications of the unfolding situation in Ukraine for the medium-run economic outlook in the U.S. will also be a consideration in determining the appropriate pace at which to remove accommodation,” she said.
Fed officials prior to the Russian invasion had vigorously signaled their readiness to raise interest rates when they meet March 15-16 to confront inflation, while keeping their options open on how far or how fast they move following liftoff.
Mester was among five U.S. central bankers scheduled to speak publicly on Thursday and her sentiment was echoed by Atlanta’s Raphael Bostic, who said that he currently still expects to raise rates in March provided the economy evolves as he anticipates. 
“If the numbers come in close to that I think that can we continue with our liftoff plan,” he said during the Atlanta Fed’s Banking Outlook Conference. “We’ll just have to see where things go. I know we have seen over the past several weeks that oil prices have increased dramatically, as have natural gas. That could have ripples.”
Traders and economists alike still see the Fed kicking off rate hikes in March, though the geopolitical risks make a half-point move less likely. Interest-rate futures show a quarter-point increase next month is more than fully priced in. 
“The current situation is different from past episodes, when geopolitical events led the Fed to delay tightening or ease, because inflation risk has created a stronger and more urgent reason to tighten today than existed in past episodes,”  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). economists Joseph Briggs and David Mericle wrote in a note to clients.
Soaring energy costs could push headline inflation even higher, although the Fed typically looks at them for what they mean for household spending -- with higher oil price hitting Americans in the pocketbook, dampening demand.
1970s Shock
But lessons from the 1970s oil shock are likely to also weigh on policy makers grappling with high inflation that they worry could become entrenched, and that concern is expected to dominate.
“Geopolitical events add upside risk to the inflation forecast even as they put some downside risk to the near-term growth forecast,” Mester said. “The ultimate pace at which monetary policy accommodation is removed will need to be data driven and forward looking.”
Earlier on Thursday Richmond Fed chief Thomas Barkin said that “time will tell” whether Ukraine changes the outlook for policy, while affirming his inclination to start normalizing policy to counter price pressures.
Barkin said that U.S. links to the Russian economy and the exposure of U.S. banks to the county appear to be limited, though officials would examine the impact on energy and commodity markets for potential spillovers to the U.S. He also noted that when Russia annexed the Crimea in 2014 the fallout had been limited.
“So if this evolves like 2014 I don’t think you are going to see much change to the underlying logic that I talked about. But this is uncharted territory. So we will have to see where the world goes.”

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -European Central Bank policymakers are gathering on Thursday for what may have become a crisis meeting as Russia's invasion of Ukraine threatens to derail economic growth in the euro zone and complicate the ECB's path out of negative interest rates.
The ECB's ""informal get-together"" was aimed at preparing a decision on March 10 on the likely end of the ECB's bond-buying stimulus programme, paving the way for the first rate hike in more than a decade to tackle surprisingly high inflation.
But Russia's invasion of Ukraine overnight has changed the picture by raising the prospect of higher energy costs, financial turmoil and lower trade for the euro zone, which relies on Russian gas for 40% of its needs.
""In my view it is going to have a short-term inflationary effect – that is prices will increase due to higher energy costs,"" ECB policymaker Yannis Stournaras told Reuters.
""But in the medium to long term I think that the consequences will be deflationary through adverse trade effects and of course through the rise in energy prices,"" the Greek central banker added. 
Stournaras, among the 'doves' of the ECB's Governing Council who favour an easier monetary policy stance, added the central bank should continue buying bonds at least until the end of the year to cushion the impact of conflict in Ukraine.
Even his Austrian peer Robert Holzmann, seen as a 'hawk', said events in Ukraine may delay the ECB's exit from stimulus measures, Bloomberg reported later.
Isabel Schnabel, an ECB board member who is also seen as a hawk, said the ""shock of war"" had clouded the outlook for the economy just as inflation was taking hold in the euro zone and allowing the ECB to withdraw its stimulus measures.
LIKELY TO SLOW DOWN
European Union leaders will impose new sanctions on Russia, freezing its assets, halting its banks' access to European financial markets and targeting ""Kremlin interests"" over its invasion of Ukraine, senior officials said on Thursday.
The exact economic fallout was hard to quantify before the full extent of the conflict and the ensuing economic sanctions were known, potentially including the financial isolation of Russia through its exclusion from the SWIFT payment system.
But analysts concurred that the ECB was now likely to slow down the withdrawal of its support measures.
""It will make the ECB more cautious and may delay the decision on tapering bond purchases,"" said Frederik Ducrozet, a strategist at Pictet.
Daiwa Capital Markets' head of research Chris Scicluna said the crisis would ""slow the pace of (ECB policy) normalisation"".
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the ECB may refrain from giving an end date to its Asset Purchase Programme on March 10.
NEW AGENDA
Thursday's meeting started with a lunch and is scheduled to end at around 10 p.m. (2100 GMT), before a gathering of European Union finance ministers the following day.
The ECB had not shared a meeting agenda with policymakers but they had been expected to discuss the economic outlook, their next policy moves as well as some operational matters.
Instead, the Ukraine crisis would likely dominate the discussion.
""This is now something completely different,"" ING's Carsten Brzeski. ""It takes away the pressure for the ECB to rush into action.""
An ECB spokesperson said a ""comprehensive assessment"" of the economic outlook would be carried out at the March 10 meeting.
With euro zone banks flush with cash and only marginally exposed to Ukraine, the ECB was not expected to have to step in to support the financial sector despite heavy falls on the stock market on Thursday.
Euro zone banks can tap the central bank for unlimited liquidity against collateral under a facility created during the last financial crisis. 
But euro zone lenders may still be in for a rough ride if the Ukraine conflict hits economic activity in the euro zone.
""Direct exposures are limited but second round effects could be material,"" Marco Troiano, a managing director at Scope Ratings, said. ""For example, the increase in energy prices can have knock on effects on growth in Western Europe and on banks' operating conditions."" 

The ECB's top bank supervisor said earlier this month an exclusion of Russia from SWIFT would be ""most impactful"" https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/speeches/date/2022/html/ssm.sp220210~b95041902b.en.html on euro zone banks and urged banks to prepare, including for the risk of cyber attacks associated with the geopolitical situation.
Cutting Russia off from SWIFT is unlikely to happen at this stage, senior officials said.

""The data may come in perhaps more pessimistic in terms of how well we are doing on inflation and if it does I'm going to move my view, maybe 4 (hikes), and depending on how things go it may be more than that,"" Bostic said during a virtual event hosted by the Atlanta Fed.
Bostic's latest comments comes two weeks after he said that he was leaning towards an outlook of supporting four interest rate increase compared to his assessment in December that three would be needed in 2022.
The central bank is gearing up for an interest rate liftoff at its next meeting on March 15-16 as it begins a tightening cycle amid inflation that is at a 40-year high and a tight labor market.
On Wednesday, San Francisco Fed Bank President Mary Daly said she expects the central bank will need to raise rates at least four times this year, and likely more, to stop high inflation from getting worse. She previously forecast three rate increases. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine could complicate matters and Fed officials will be sifting through the economic and financial impacts on the global and U.S. economy, Bostic said, although he added his expectation at the moment is that he doesn't see it impacting a March liftoff.

""We'll just have to see where things go. I know that we've seen over the last several weeks that oil prices have risen dramatically, as have natural gas, and that could have ripples. We are just going to have to monitor that very closely,"" Bostic said.
On the Fed's plans for its balance sheet, Bostic said he wants to see the central bank raising rates a couple of times before it begins to reduce it ""as aggressively as possible.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stablecoins, which are virtual tokens pegged to traditional currencies such as the U.S. dollar, held gains on Thursday in the midst of a sell-off in risk assets such as stocks and bitcoin after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Most stablecoins were slightly higher on the day. Their market capitalization was up 0.3% at $182.5 billion, according to cryptocurrency data tracker coinmarketcap.com. Its daily trading volume, though, surged 75% to $108.1 billion.
In contrast, both bitcoin and ether dropped to one-month lows. Bitcoin was last down 3.1% at $36,121, while ether slid 4.1% to $2,475, following Russia's invasion.
Ukrainian forces battled Russian invaders around nearly all of the country's perimeter on Thursday after Moscow mounted a mass assault by land, sea and air in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.
""You have a risk-off environment that's been happening for months now, and that in some ways has increased the demand for digital dollars, and so we've certainly seen into the end of last year and through today pretty significant growth in demand for USDC,"" said Jeremy Allaire, cofounder and chief executive officer of Circle, referring to the stablecoin USD coin, pegged to the U.S. dollar on a 1-to-1 basis.
The USD Coin was up 0.1% at $1, coinmarketcap data show. Some of the biggest stablecoin gainers were Fei USD, a stablecoin in the decentralized finance space, which was up 1.2%, and Liquity USD, which rose 1.4%.
""While stablecoins have a much tighter range and less volatility than other crypto assets, in reality their supply is limited,"" said Joe DiPasquale, chief executive officer at BitBull Capital, which manages crypto funds.
""When there is a spike in demand for assets like USDC on exchanges, it's possible to see their value go up a fraction of a percent, as we've seen in the last 24 hours,"" he added.
The Russian invasion has dampened the notion that bitcoin is a safe haven, analysts, said. In fact, the world's largest cryptocurrency has behaved more like a risk asset. Since the beginning of the year when the Russia-Ukraine crisis started percolating, bitcoin has lost 22% of its value against the dollar.
Investors have flocked to Treasuries and the U.S. dollar, and even gold, the asset that has been compared to bitcoin.

The benchmark U.S. Treasury yield fell about 4 basis points to 1.9425%, as prices rose, while the dollar index rose to its highest since late June 2020. It was last up 1.2% at 97.382.
Gold surged to its highest since September 2020. It last changed hands at $1,922, up 0.8%.

Mester’s remarks come after Russia’s launch of a full-scale invasion of its neighbor Ukraine, a move that’s roiled financial markets and sent energy costs soaring.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has stepped up pressure for tougher economic sanctions on Moscow, including potentially shutting the country out of SWIFT - the world's main international payments network - hitting Russian trade and making it harder for Russian companies to do business. 
WHAT IS SWIFT?
SWIFT, or the ""Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication"", is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments, making international trade flow smoothly. 
Banks which connect to the SWIFT system and establish relationships with other banks can use SWIFT messages to make payments.
The messages are secure so that payment instructions are typically honoured without question. This allows banks to process high volumes of transactions at speed. 
It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, around 38 million SWIFT ‘FIN messages’ were sent each day over the SWIFT platform, according to its 2020 Annual Review. Each year, trillions of dollars are transferred using the system.
WHO OWNS SWIFT?
SWIFT, founded in the 1970s, is a co-operative of thousands of member institutions which use the service. 
Based in Belgium, SWIFT makes a modest profit -- €36 million in 2020, based on its 2020 Annual Review. It is run principally as a service to its members.
WHY WOULD A SWIFT BAN BE SO SERIOUS?
If SWIFT were to exclude Russian banks, it would restrict the country’s access to financial markets across the world.
Russian companies and individuals would find it harder to pay for imports and receive cash for exports, borrow or invest overseas.
Russian banks could use other channels for payments such as phones, messaging apps or email. The would allow Russian banks to make payments via banks in countries which have not imposed sanctions but since alternatives are likely to be less efficient and secure, transaction volumes could fall and costs rise.
HOW WOULD A SWIFT BAN ON RUSSIA AFFECT OTHER COUNTRIES?
If Russian banks were cut off from SWIFT, exporters would find selling goods to Russia riskier and more expensive.
Russia is a big buyer of manufactured goods. The Netherlands and Germany are its second and third biggest trading partners, based on World Bank data, although Russia is not a top 10 export market for either country.
Foreign buyers of Russian goods would also find it more difficult, potentially prompting them to seek alternative suppliers.
But when it comes to Russian oil and gas, foreign buyers could find it harder to find replacement suppliers.
Russia is the main EU supplier of crude oil, natural gas and solid fossil fuels, according to the European Commission. 
Banning Russia from SWIFT is unlikely to be agreed at this stage, several EU sources have said.
WHAT WILL SWIFT DO?
In the past, SWIFT has resisted calls to impose bans on certain countries. 
It describes itself as neutral and has said it would not take a decision to disconnect institutions as a result of political pressure. 
IS SWIFT BOUND BY ECONOMIC SANCTIONS?
Belgium-based SWIFT is bound by Belgian and European Union rules, which would include economic sanctions.
SWIFT's website says: “Whilst sanctions are imposed independently in different jurisdictions around the world, SWIFT cannot arbitrarily choose which jurisdiction’s sanction regime to follow.”

In March 2012, the European Union barred SWIFT from serving Iranian firms and individuals which had been sanctioned in relation to Tehran’s nuclear programme. The list included the central bank and other big banks.
A SWIFT spokesman declined to say how the organisation would respond to any U.S. sanctions.

(Reuters) - The conflict unfolding in Ukraine could have an effect on the U.S. economy in the medium term and should be factored in as Federal Reserve policymakers remove accommodation, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on Thursday. 
Such geopolitical events can worsen inflation and be damaging to economic growth in the near-term, said Mester, who has a vote this year for monetary policy decisions. 
""The implications of the unfolding situation in Ukraine for the medium-run economic outlook in the U.S. will also be a consideration in determining the appropriate pace at which to remove accommodation,"" Mester said in remarks prepared for a virtual event organized by the Lyons Companies and the University of Delaware. 

Mester reiterated her view that the pace of rate increases will depend on what happens with inflation, and that it should speed up if inflation does not moderate by the middle of the year and slow down if inflation comes down faster than expected. 
The Fed official said she expects inflation will moderate this year as demand moderates and capacity constraints are resolved, but remain above 2% this year and next.

With inflation pressures building quicker than expected, the ECB is now openly discussing an end to copious bond buys later this year, opening the door to a potential interest rate hike this year, the first increase in over a decade.
But the war in Ukraine will complicate a policy decision due on March 10 with some policymakers already calling for caution in unwinding support.
""The shock of war hanging over Europe has clouded the global outlook,"" Schnabel, the head of the ECB's market operations, said in a speech that she said reflected the state of the economy before Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier on Thursday.
""The economy is evolving in ways that suggest that, after a long period of very subdued price pressures, inflation is increasingly likely to stabilise in close proximity to our 2% target over the medium term,"" she said.
The ECB had long argued that inflation, now above 5%, is likely to drop below its 2% target next year, but Schnabel challenged this narrative as price pressures are becoming increasingly broad and the currency union is enjoying its strongest labour market on record.
""It is now becoming increasingly likely that, in the medium term, inflation will approach our 2% target from above, rather than from below,"" she said. 
This combination of a strong labour market and broadening price pressures calls for a ""gradual normalisation"" of monetary policy that reflects the bank's effort in getting inflation back to target, Schnabel added.

The first step in unwinding stimulus will be to end bond purchases while the next move should be raising interest rates, rather than unwinding the ECB's oversized balance sheet, Schnabel added.
""Our key policy rates are best suited for influencing output and prices in the euro area during the normalisation process,"" she said. ""Balance sheet adjustments may thus not be well-suited as the main instrument for controlling the overall stance.""

Ukrainian forces battled Russian invaders around nearly all of the country's perimeter on Thursday after Moscow mounted a mass assault by land, sea and air in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two. 
EU leaders will announce new sanctions after an emergency summit on Thursday evening that will freeze Russian assets, halt its banks' access to European financial markets and target ""Kremlin interests"", senior officials said.
""The Russian aggression will definitely feature prominently in tomorrow's discussions and the main focus for all finance ministers will be to assess the economic consequences of the escalation as it evolves,"" an EU official said. 
France's finance ministry, which is hosting the talks, said in a letter to attendees that the meeting would be an opportunity to demonstrate EU unity. Sessions on Saturday were cancelled.
IMPACT 
The ministry said the ministers would discuss the impact of the Russian invasion on their economies and especially the impact on energy prices. 
They will also discuss the sanctions that EU leaders are set to agree on Thursday evening as well as potential Russian counter-sanctions.
Before the invasion, the ministers had been due to discuss the post-pandemic economic recovery, changes to their fiscal rules and speeding up the development of EU capital markets. 
""The focus has shifted now,"" a second official said. 
""Finance ministers will discuss the economic outlook for Europe, but the EU Commission's winter forecast is rather obsolete now,"" the official said.
The European Commission forecast earlier in February that economic growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro would be 4.0% this year, less than the 4.3% expected last November, because of another wave of COVID-19 infections, supply chain bottlenecks and record high inflation caused by energy prices.
But the war in Ukraine creates a new risk factor for the economy, not only because many EU exporters will no longer be able to sell their goods to Russia under the sanctions regime, but also because Moscow may retaliate by curbing gas and oil deliveries to Europe. Russia is the EU's main energy supplier.

European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said before the full-scale Russian invasion that developments in Ukraine made the 4.0% growth forecast more uncertain.
Over the last year, Russia has not raised spot gas deliveries to Europe despite soaring demand, which helped boost energy prices and euro zone inflation to record highs. Fast price growth has become a political problem for EU governments.

(Reuters) - Ukraine's government is lobbying the Biden administration to cut Russia off from U.S. software updates, to ban Russian flights, and to block the supply of goods to Russia's civil aviation industry in an effort to rally support for drastic sanctions while the Kremlin pushes deeper into Ukrainian territory.
The demands, which a Ukrainian diplomat in Washington circulated on Thursday in a brief 14-point memo to American officials, go beyond export control measures promised by the White House, which has vowed to spare Russian consumers from the brunt of sanctions. 
The Ukrainians asked their American counterparts to bar U.S. companies from ""supplying and updating software in the interests of Russian consumers"" or from supplying U.S. telecommunications products, including microelectronics, to Russia. In addition, the Ukrainians called on the United States to bar the supply of goods and technologies, including software for use in the Russian aviation industry, including civil aviation.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that the Biden administration was working on a plan to cut Russia off from a vast swath of low- and high-tech U.S. and foreign-made goods, from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts. 
The U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. Treasury Department or White House. 
Some of the demands made by the Ukrainian government have already been made public. On Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the world should impose ""devastating sanctions on Russia NOW,"" including disconnecting the country from the SWIFT financial transaction network.

Some of the suggested actions in the 14-point memo, such as ""expelling Russian ambassadors worldwide"" and ""removing Russia from UN Security Council,"" were unlikely to be implemented. Others, such as the ban on the supply of ""any goods, including hardware and software"" to Russia's oil, gas, coal, mining, and nuclear sectors, would also be tall orders.
Late on Wednesday, President Joe Biden said the United States and its allies would impose severe sanctions on Russia after its military forces launched an attack on Ukraine, engaging in battle around nearly all of the country's perimeter.

The Treasury, releasing demographic data on the program for the first time, said that during the fourth quarter of 2021, more than 40% of primary applicants receiving assistance self-identified as Black, and more than 20% as Latino
Female-headed households accounted for nearly two-thirds of rental assistance during the quarter, according to the Treasury data. Research by Princeton University's Eviction Lab shows similar rates of eviction proceedings against these groups, Treasury said. 
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a statement that the $46.6 billion program created in COVID-19 aid acts passed in December 2020 and March 2021 was aimed at preventing an eviction crisis among the most vulnerable.
He said the data show that ""the vast majority of rental assistance has gone to keeping the lowest-income families in their homes during the pandemic.""
The program, which got off to a slow start as local communities scrambled to create infrastructure for approving aid, disbursed $20.6 billion during 2021, with about $2.4 billion disbursed during December.

It defines ""very low income"" as people earning 50% of an area's median income or below.

(Reuters) -Euro zone bonds rallied on Thursday as investors rushed into safe assets after Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine sent European stock markets into a downward spiral. 
Germany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro area, fell as much as 10 basis points (bps) to its lowest level since the European Central Bank (ECB) on Feb. 3 opened the door to rate hikes this year. Yields move inversely to prices.
The yield was set for the biggest daily fall since the height of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, but gradually trimmed its losses towards the end of the session. 
At 1554 GMT, Germany's 10-year yield was down about 7 bps at 0.151%. 
Inflation-linked bonds saw the biggest rally, with Germany's 10-year real yield falling 17 bps. 
Yields on inflation-linked bonds, which investors use to hedge against price rises, have fallen faster than conventional bond yields this week.
Energy prices have spiked on the back of the crisis in Ukraine, stoking worries about inflation, already at a record high in the euro zone. 
A market gauge of shorter-term inflation expectations rose sharply on Thursday, while longer-term expectations also touched a five-week high. 
""The conflict ... takes us a sizeable step towards stagflation where we see higher prices but slower growth. It's a significant continuation of a series of remarkably numerous unrelated negative supply (chain) shocks,"" said Richard McGuire, head of rates strategy at Rabobank. 
Yields on two-year bonds - sensitive to near-term inflation and interest rate expectations - fell less than longer-dated bonds. That flattened the two-year/10-year yield curve to the narrowest since Feb. 10 in a sign of concern on the growth outlook. 
The focus was on what the Ukraine conflict means for the ECB. Economists prior to the invasion expected an end to ECB bond purchases by September and interest rates to rise this year in response to record-high inflation. 
Money markets continued to trim bets on ECB rate hikes, but are still pricing in around 34 bps of hikes by the end of the year, compared with around 40 bps before the invasion. 
The invasion ""does increase the conundrum which (central banks) have already been grappling with and capitulated to, which is higher cost-push inflation,"" McGuire at Rabobank said. 
ECB policymakers were gathering for an informal meeting on Thursday, announced last week. 
In the most cautious statement from a policymaker yet, Greek central bank governor Yannis Stournaras said the ECB should continue bond buying until at least year-end and keep it open-ended to cushion any fallout from Ukraine as the economic outlook is ""much more uncertain.""
Analysts noted the conflict could prompt the ECB to slow the withdrawal of its stimulus. 

One sign was a smaller-than-expected reaction in southern European bonds, leading beneficiaries of ECB stimulus. In Italy, the closely-watched risk premium over German bonds at one stage rose to 177 bps, before slipping back to 162 bps. 
In credit markets, the cost of insuring exposure to a basket of European high yield corporate bonds touched the highest since October 2020.

(Reuters) -Sterling crashed against a surging dollar in its worst day since March 2020 as investors rushed into safe-haven assets after Russian forces invaded Ukraine.
Missiles rained down. Ukraine reported columns of troops pouring across its borders from Russia and Belarus and landing on the coast from the Black and Azov seas.
Safe-haven currencies such as the yen and U.S. dollar were in demand, while riskier currencies, including sterling, dived.
The pound fell 1.8%, its biggest daily decline since March 2020, to $1.3302, its lowest since December 22. 
""As for sterling, it's a spectator,"" Kit Juckes forex analysts at SocGen said.
""The UK is less vulnerable economically than the Euro zone, but not invulnerable. I expect EUR/GBP to continue trading in a relatively narrow range,"" he added.
Sterling was down 0.1% versus the euro at 83.59 pence in choppy trade.
The narrative about future interest rates was also in focus, and investors' views remained mixed.
BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill provided another dovish comment on Thursday by saying the central bank would seek to bring fast-rising inflation down in a ""measured way"" and one ""that doesn't disturb the rest of the economy"".
MUFG analysts said ""the (Ukraine) conflict is likely to encourage market participants to scale back expectations for monetary tightening from major central banks in the near term.""
""We would expect the UK and U.S. rate markets to continue to adjust expectations more in favour of smaller 0.25 point hikes being delivered at their next meetings in March,"" they added.
British finance minister Rishi Sunak said he had spoken with Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey on Thursday to ensure financial stability after Russia's invasion.
Money markets are pricing in a 55% chance of a 50 basis point (bp) rate hike from the BoE in March and fully pricing a rate increase of 125 bps by year-end.
""We doubt they (BoE officials) will want to further push back on aggressive pricing of the BoE cycle, which is providing support to GBP and helping to insulate against higher energy prices,"" ING analysts said.

The UK rate market had already scaled back expectations in recent days for a 0.50 point hike following less hawkish comments from BoE Monetary Policy Committee officials.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said on Wednesday that markets should not get carried away about the likely scale of interest rate rises, while policymaker Silvana Tenreyro said she saw the case for further modest tightening.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina is poised to ""imminently"" send an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to the country's Congress for approval, government spokeswoman Gabriela Cerruti said on Thursday, signaling the critical debt deal is drawing near.
The South American country reached an understanding with the IMF in late January over a new deal to help push back over $40 billion in debts the country owes and cannot pay. That agreement still needed to be ironed out before getting final approval.
""We hope it will happen in the next few days, so we have to wait just a few more days or a few more hours,"" Cerruti told a news conference when asked about submitting the agreement to Congress.
""Let's say it's imminent, I couldn't tell you exactly when.""

Argentine President Alberto Fernández needs Congress to approve the details of the deal, with pressure rising ahead of repayments to the IMF of over $2.8 billion due mid-March. The deal will also need to be approved by the IMF's board.
In January, Argentina's government announced it had reached an understanding in principle with the IMF to replace a $57 billion failed loan granted in 2018. The IMF head Kristalina Georgieva said then there was still much work to be done.

WASHINGTON/VIENNA/LONDON (Reuters) -European banks on Tuesday were bracing for the fallout from fresh global sanctions as the Ukraine crisis escalated, although U.S. bank executives said they expected the industry to be insulated from major disruption after pulling back from Russia in recent years.
Europe's banks - particularly those in Austria, Italy and France - are the world's most exposed to Russia, and for weeks have been on high alert should governments impose new sanctions against the country.
HSBC warned of market contagion and Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) said it was preparing ""crisis plans."" 
Britain was the first on Tuesday to move in retaliation for Russia recognising two breakaway regions of Ukraine and sending troops. Britain hit five banks and three individuals, a relatively mild package that Prime Minister Boris Johnson said allowed him to ""reserve further powerful sanctions"" for whatever ""Putin may do next"".
The European Union also agreed sanctions that will blacklist more politicians, lawmakers and officials, ban EU investors from trading in Russian state bonds, and target imports and exports with separatist entities.
""This package of sanctions... will hurt Russia, and it will hurt a lot,"" the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told a news conference. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he was halting the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, an important future energy source for Europe's largest economy.
Then on Tuesday afternoon U.S. President Joe Biden announced sanctions targeting two Russian banks, the country's sovereign debt, and Russian elites and family members, and warned that Russia would pay an even steeper price if it continued its aggression.
Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, the United States and European Union have blacklisted specific individuals, sought to limit Russia's state-owned financial institutions' access to Western capital markets, and imposed bans on weapons trade and other limits on the trade of technology, such as that for the oil sector. 
That caused banks, particularly in the United States, to reduce their exposure to Russia, making some bankers less concerned about the threat of sanctions on their business and more focused on the market impact of geopolitical tensions.
The boss of HSBC, one of Europe's largest banks, said on Tuesday ""wider contagion"" for global markets was a concern, even if the bank's direct exposure was limited.
""It's clear that there is a likelihood of contagion or some second-order effect, but it will depend on the severity of the conflict and the severity of the retaliation if there is a conflict,"" Noel Quinn told Reuters in an interview.
U.S. banks, meanwhile, are not expecting global sanctions to have a major impact on American bank businesses or spark contagion risk, given lenders have little exposure to the Russian economy, said four executives familiar with industry thinking.
According to the Bank for International Settlements, U.S. lenders had outstanding claims of just $14.7 billion on Russia in the third quarter of 2021. 
U.S. banks and financial industry lobby groups have held meetings with the Biden administration to discuss sanctions in recent days, three of the sources said. One said banks had spent the past 24 hours identifying who might be the potential targets of the sanctions so they could move quickly. 
Another said the administration had reached out to executives in the industry before Christmas and had kept banks apprised of its thinking. 
This person added that one area of potential concern was the disruption that might be created if the U.S. decides to target Russia's access to the SWIFT international payment network, although that is seen as unlikely in the near future. 
That's because cutting Russia off from the international payments network could seriously hurt its economy and everyday citizens, and would create enormous complexity and compliance risks for the global banking industry. 
RBI, which has significant operations in Russia and Ukraine, said business was now normal, but ""in the event of an escalation, the crisis plans that the bank has been preparing over the past few weeks will come into effect"". 
Shares in the Austrian bank fell 7.48% on Tuesday. 
Dutch lender ING, which has a large presence in Russia, said: ""A further escalating conflict could have major negative consequences.""

One Danish pension fund said it would immediately halt new Russian investments in the wake of Putin's move into Ukraine.
With several jurisdictions rolling out new sanctions, bankers said they hoped governments would coordinate as they drafted the fine print, in order to reduce complexity for the industry.

""We are at the end – I hope - of an economic crisis, I hope a geopolitical crisis won't reach us - but we've managed to get through this crisis in a stronger position,"" said Arnault, outlining plans to add new sites before the end of the year, bringing the label's total to 20 in France.

SCHWERIN, Germany (Reuters) - In the north German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where former Chancellor Angela Merkel had her constituency, ties to Russia run deep – so deep, in fact, its leaders have defended a Kremlin project that the United States says helped cripple Ukraine.
At issue is a new gas pipeline project, which Germany halted on Tuesday in retaliation for Russia's decision to recognise two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, shortly before it invaded and brought Europe to the brink of a major war. 
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is the landfall site for the line, Nord Stream 2, which bypasses the former Soviet Republic. The United States long argued the line would weaken Ukraine; Germany and Russia insisted the project was purely commercial. Nonetheless, in 2019 Washington set sanctions on some companies and individuals who were helping to build it, maintaining the line is a tool for Russia to support aggression against Ukraine.
Last January, the regional premier, Manuela Schwesig, took action to support the Russian project. At her initiative, the state parliament voted to set up a special foundation whose charter said it could acquire, manage, own, provide or let land, tools and machines to help the completion of the pipeline. 
https://graphics.reuters.com/RUSSIA-UKRAINE/zgvomzwaxvd/graphic.jpg
""We believe that it is right to build the pipeline,"" Schwesig told reporters in January 2021. Advocating for the pipeline in the state parliament last January, Schwesig said the U.S. sanctions were self-interested. ""Nobody who is working on building the pipeline is doing anything wrong,"" she said. ""The ones doing something wrong are those who are trying to stop the pipeline.""
Nord Stream 2 would double the amount of gas Russia can pump directly to Germany, its biggest customer for gas, make Germany and Europe less vulnerable to supply interruptions caused by disputes between Russia and Ukraine, and bring economic benefits to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a relatively deprived region that used to be in the German Democratic Republic. 
But this year as Russia stepped up pressure on Ukraine, questions mounted around the Foundation, called Klima-und Umweltschutz MV (Climate and Environment Protection Foundation). It would not reveal who was running its sanctions-busting operation beyond saying that the person was appointed by Nord Stream 2 AG, a company owned by Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) PAO, which is fully controlled by the Russian state. 
Asked who that was, Swiss-based Nord Stream 2 did not respond. Gazprom did not respond to a request for comment. 
The state auditor, the Court of Auditors, told Reuters on Feb. 9 it was concerned that Mecklenburg-Vorpommern had largely given up control over the Foundation's assets. This meant there was no guarantee that the Foundation would always work in the public interest, said Sebastian Jahn, the court's spokesman, in a telephone interview.
The Foundation said on Wednesday it would stop helping the pipeline project, but declined to say exactly what it had done to aid it so far. In an account of its first year on its website, it said that to complete the pipeline, ""the U.S.'s illegal threats had to be countered with a wide range of measures, which for obvious reasons cannot be made the subject of public explanation.""
Public records show it purchased a ship which entered the Baltic last July and which a U.S. State Department report to Congress last November said had engaged in pipe-laying activities, on Nord Stream 2 or another sanctioned project. 
""We did what is necessary, the pipeline is practically completed,"" Foundation Chairman Erwin Sellering told German broadcaster NDR on Wednesday, adding that this involved helping small and medium-sized companies do their work. ""We can say we fulfilled our mandate,"" he added.
As Russia continues to pressure Ukraine, other questions are mounting about the links between the pipeline, Germany's ruling Social Democrat Party (SPD), and Moscow. The regional premier Schwesig is, like Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a member of the SPD, which traditionally advocates rapprochement with Russia. 
So, too, is Gerhard Schroeder, a former Chancellor who has described himself as Putin's personal friend. One of his last acts in office in 2005 was to sign the deal creating the Nord Stream 2 project. Soon after, he became chairman of the company behind it – the first of several directorial positions he has taken at Russian energy companies.
Now, opposition to his lobbying is becoming increasingly heated across Germany. Schwesig and Schroeder declined to comment for this story. 
In 2019, Scholz rejected the U.S. sanctions as interference in Germany's affairs. On Tuesday, after Russia formally recognised the two breakaway regions, he decided to halt certification of the pipeline. 
But some analysts say the damage to Germany is already done.
""Russia has succeeded in using the personal interests of prominent German political figures against Germany,"" said Marcel Dirsus, Non-Resident Fellow at the Institute for Security Policy at Kiel University. 
""All this is doubly dangerous for Germany: It allows an adversarial foreign power to influence decision-making and it raises questions about Germany's reliability among the country's allies."" 
TRANSPARENCY CHALLENGE
The Foundation, housed in a grey townhouse next to a kebab shop, was funded from 200,000 euros ($227,000) given by Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, plus 20 million euros from Nord Stream 2. It said its prime goal was to act against climate change, arguing that even though gas is a fossil fuel, it's needed as a clean alternative to coal until Germany can manage on renewable energy. 
It promised a free tree and 500 euros to every kindergarten in the state, and said its secondary goal was to make sure the Nord Stream 2 pipeline was completed, ""regardless of external efforts."" Even though Nord Stream 2 made up the majority of the Foundation's funding, the Foundation would not reveal any information about its activities to beat U.S. sanctions.
""Transparency is very important to us,"" Foundation Chief Executive Christine Klinger said in a telephone interview. But she added in a later email that as a foundation, her group was not obliged to respond to requests under the regional Freedom of Information laws. 
In German law, an endowed foundation must spend all it earns from its capital on a public good: Deutsche Umwelthilfe, an environmentalist group, argues the Foundation was in violation of this law. The group brought a legal challenge against the Foundation in March 2021, arguing that it served the interests of the Nord Stream 2, a private business, not the public. That case continues. 
Transparency watchdog Transparency International (TI) said the Foundation may have violated anti money-laundering legislation, since its claimed purpose was different from its actual purpose, which was to help Nord Stream 2. 
""The mere fact that a foundation that is meant to be devoted to climate and environmental protection is ... supporting the efforts of a Russian state company to build a gas pipeline and dodge international sanctions is questionable,"" said Transparency International's finance expert Stephan Ohme. ""But the fact that the Foundation obscures who it is actually benefiting is a possible violation of German and European money-laundering laws.""
TI also argued that others with influence over the Foundation, such as Gazprom's Chief Executive Alexei Miller and the Russian state, should also have been listed on the Foundation's records in Germany's national transparency register.
Foundation Chair Sellering dismissed TI's claims as ""total nonsense"" in his TV interview, saying it was not true that the Foundation's financial backers had any influence over its actions and that it was simply not wise to comment step-by-step when ""disputing a world power."" He was referring to the United States. 
The state government is not responsible for listing names in the transparency register or for policing it, a government spokesperson said, and declined further comment. 
At least three senior members of the regional SPD are closely linked to the Foundation: Schwesig, the premier who backed legislation creating it; Sellering, its chairman, a former state premier; and Christian Pegel, a lawyer and former economy minister who introduced the legislation in the regional parliament and whom political colleagues describe as the brains behind it.
Sellering told Reuters earlier this month the Ukraine crisis was being used as an excuse by ""significant forces in the United States and Germany who have always opposed the pipeline."" None of the politicians responded to Reuters requests for comment on Wednesday. 
""GAS, NOT BLOOD""
As Chancellor Scholz suspended Nord Stream 2, pressure grew on him to take his predecessor Schroeder to task for lobbying for Gazprom. 
Politicians from the opposition and junior coalition party the Free Democrats called on the government to strip Schroeder of his privileges as a former chancellor, such as an office with car and staff. Some said he should repay taxpayer money spent in previous years if the spending can in any way be linked to his lobbying activities.
Last week, at a meeting with Scholz in the Kremlin, Putin lavished praise on Schroeder and Scholz distanced himself from the former Chancellor. ""He speaks for himself, not the government,"" he said.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, support for Nord Stream 2 is broad-based, including the regional CDU – Merkel's party. Merkel, who has been critical of Putin, did not respond to a request for comment. People in the region have a different relationship to Russia from those in western Germany, said Franz-Robert Liskow, CDU parliamentary leader. 
Just over 70% of regional respondents to a January 2021 poll by Forsa for the Ostsee Zeitung newspaper thought the pipeline would be important for Germany's energy supply. In eastern Germany more broadly, 74% backed the pipeline last year, another poll found. After the U.S. moved to sanction the line, a third poll found 24% of East Germans thought Germany should respond with counter-sanctions. 
The region's ties to Russia are ancient. Even in the Middle Ages the cities of the German Baltic coast were intimately linked with Russia by sea. For many years, the region's Baltic Sea ports had direct ferry and cargo routes to the Russian ports of St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad.
Its sea port of Mukran, the East German government's last major infrastructural project, started in 1982, was meant to create a direct trade link to Russia bypassing Poland, then in a state of turmoil following the declaration of a state of emergency.
Deprived of its purpose after the Soviet Union collapsed, Mukran played an important role in construction of a previous pipeline and was used as a place to store materials before they were shipped to lay Nord Stream 2, a spokesperson told Reuters.
For Torsten Koplin, regional head of the hard-left Die Linke party that is the successor to the East German Communist Party, the Russian connection goes beyond economic gains. He argued that local people see the trade Nord Stream 2 represents as an opportunity to preserve peace.
On the street near the Foundation, office worker Roland Bentler echoed that view. He wondered aloud if freezing the pipeline ""really was the most urgent decision"" that Germany's government needed to take in the Ukraine crisis.

""Positions will harden,"" he said, ""but I hope that reason will win out in the end and that gas will flow, not blood.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British government bonds were on course for their biggest daily gains since late November on Thursday, joining a broader rally in safe-haven assets after Russia invaded Ukraine.
Benchmark 10-year gilt yields were 8 basis points lower on the day at 1.40% at 1223 GMT and earlier in the day fell as low as 1.375%, as prices rose in line with German Bunds and slightly lagged behind U.S. Treasuries. 
Ten-year gilt yields last fell more on Nov. 26, when they dropped 14 basis points on the day due to concerns about the Omicron variant of coronavirus.
""Inflation in the UK will now probably rise beyond the 7.5% peak we had expected in April and will remain higher for longer,"" Thomas Pugh, economist at accountants RSM UK, said.
Russia and Ukraine account for a quarter of world wheat exports and the conflict risked pushing up food prices in Britain, he added.
""All this will exacerbate the cost of living crisis and depress GDP growth,"" he said. 
Two-year gilt yields, which are sensitive to interest-rate expectations, dropped 7 basis points on the day to 1.24% and earlier touched their lowest since the BoE's last policy statement Feb. 4 at 1.199%.
Financial markets still expect the BoE to raise interest rates again after its next meeting ends on March 17, taking the Bank Rate to 0.75% from 0.5%.
""The conflict will not derail plans for policy tightening this year, but the events of the past 24 hours have tipped the balance towards erring on the side of caution,"" Capital Economics said in a note. 

""The risks are greatest for the euro-zone because of its closer ties to Russia."" 
As tensions between Russia and Ukraine have increased in recent days, markets have scaled back their expectations of how high rates will rise this year to 1.75% from around 2%, and see less chance of a half-point rate rise at future BoE meetings.

The 39-year-old economist purchased an attached row house in Philadelphia by herself in April 2020.
Move over, couples. Single females now comprise 19% of buyers, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. That is up from 18% in 2020 and 15% in 2015. Single males, for their part, represent another 9% of the market.
""I didn’t imagine I would be buying a house by myself,"" Crane says. ""But now I’m glad I have one, because I can work from home, enjoy my backyard, build equity, and do whatever I wish.""
Indeed, when Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) recently surveyed potential homeowners, the findings were unmistakable. Singles have very little interest in putting off homebuying decisions.
""Two-thirds of single women would rather not wait until marriage to buy a home,"" says Kathy Cummings, Bank of America’s senior vice president for affordable housing programs.
A couple of broader societal factors are behind this trend, Cummings says. One is that Americans have been putting off getting married and having children.
Another is that the gender wage gap has been closing over decades, which gives single women more financial resources to make such a major life purchase.
There is also the reality that singles represent a growing proportion of the nation as a whole. Compared to past decades, the notion of being single by choice has become more socially acceptable.
""More and more single people are embracing their single lives, and living their single years fully,"" says Bella DePaulo, a social scientist and author of books such as ""Singled Out."" ""You can see this in the attitudes revealed in the [Bank of America] report: Nearly nine out of 10 single women dismiss the idea that they should be married before buying a home. They see that as old-fashioned thinking.""
MAKING THE MATH WORK
Coming up with a down payment and mortgage approval can be a steeper hill for one person than for two, especially since the housing market is so red-hot. National median prices rose 14.6% in 2021’s fourth quarter compared to a year prior, according to data from NAR. 
In addition, singles often feel discriminated against by the lending industry.
""I felt like banks never believed I had the means to do what I wanted to do,"" says Dottye Holt, a retiree in McKinney, Texas who has purchased homes as a singleton. 
Holt's advice? ""Be prepared for a lot of questions, almost to a suspicious level.""
Here are four tips for single homebuyers.
DO THE ADVANCE PREP
If it is just your balance sheet that the lender is looking at, without the help of a partner’s second income, then your financial house needs to be tidy. 
Work on boosting your credit score, which will qualify you for the most attractive mortgage rates, potentially saving you tens of thousands over the life of the loan. Then when the time comes to make a bid, come in armed with bank preapprovals to act fast.
AVOID DOWN PAYMENT DOUBTS
Coming up with a 20% down payment might seem like a very high bar right now. And while that is certainly a wise goal to aim for – it can allow you to sidestep private mortgage insurance, for instance – it's a ""myth"" as a must-have, says Cummings. 
These days there are fixed-rate mortgage products like Freddie Mac’s Home Possible program with down payments as low as 3%.
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LENDER-SPECIFIC PROGRAMS 
Yes, housing costs can seem daunting right now, especially for singles. But you might be surprised at the number of opportunities available to you: Cummings points to Bank of America’s Home Grant Program of up to $7,500 for closing costs and Down Payment Grants of up to 3% of the purchase price or $10,000 (whichever is less) in select markets.
GIVE YOURSELF A CUSHION

Without a second income to fall back on, single buyers should be careful about not stretching finances too far, advises financial planner Michelle Gessner of Houston. 
Income should be ""sufficient to cover not only the mortgage payments, but the property taxes, the homeowner's insurance, and the ongoing repair and maintenance,"" she says. ""Unfortunately, people forget about that and focus only on the mortgage payments when deciding if they can afford the house they want to buy.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain and its allies would unleash a massive package of economic sanctions to hobble the Russian economy after the Kremlin launched an all-out invasion of neighbouring Ukraine on Thursday.
Western nations are expected to announce coordinated sanctions after earlier this week imposing a limited initial package that was criticised by some as a weak response to Russia's recognition of two breakaway regions in Ukraine. 
""Today, in concert with our allies, we will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy,"" Johnson said in a televised address to the nation.
He said the West must end its reliance on Russian oil and gas which had given Russian President Vladimir Putin a grip over Western politics.
""Our mission is clear: diplomatically, politically, economically, and eventually military, this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure."" 
In earlier comments on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), the British leader called the invasion a ""catastrophe"" for Europe, and said he would talk to other G7 group of rich nations. 
""I will also speak to fellow G7 leaders and I am calling for an urgent meeting of all NATO leaders as soon as possible,"" he said.
Foreign minister Liz Truss said she had summoned the Russian ambassador to explain Moscow's actions in Ukraine.
Britain, like the United States and European Union, had threatened to impose tougher sanctions on Russia if it invaded Ukraine, a move Russian President Vladimir Putin had earlier said Moscow would never do.
On Wednesday, Johnson told finance chiefs he wanted to impose the ""toughest possible next tranche"" of sanctions on Russia, an action he described as being able to ""make a difference and change the outcome"".
In his address on Thursday, he told Russians he did not believe the invasion was being carried out in their name, while he vowed to support Ukraine until the flame of freedom ""burns bright again"".

""I don't believe that the Russian dictator will ever subdue the national feeling of the Ukrainians and their passionate belief that their country should be free,"" he said.
""I say to the British people, and all who have heard the threats from Putin against those who stand with Ukraine: We will of course, do everything to keep our country safe.""

(Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine and how the world reacts could have wide-ranging repercussions for the European economy, from rising energy and food prices to economic sanctions that hit trade and investment.
That in turn will affect how quickly the economy gets back on its feet after two years of the coronavirus pandemic and the ability of policy-makers, among them the European Central Bank, to wind down emergency support measures. Following are some key variables and vulnerabilities.
WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT ON INFLATION?
The escalation of tensions into outright conflict has the potential to generate immediate and rapid fuel and food price inflation.
European Union countries buy 41.1% of their imported gas from Russia and 27% of their oil: thus, any restriction of supplies would quickly lead to higher energy prices. That would ripple through the economy from higher heating and fuel bills to costlier transport and power for businesses.
Food supplies would also likely be hit. Natural gas is the main component in many fertilizers, so higher gas costs would likely push up all crop prices. Separately, Ukraine exported over 33 million tons of grain last year so any disruption there would reverberate across global markets - including in Europe.
Overall, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities estimates an escalation could push euro zone inflation up 1 point to 4% for 2022.
AND ON TRADE AND INVESTMENT?
This will depend on the new sanctions due to be studied by EU leaders at an emergency summit on Feb. 24. They will be ""the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented"", the bloc's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrel said.
The euro zone's export exposure to Russia has roughly halved since the confrontation over Crimea in 2014, as European firms looked to secure alternative trading partners.
EU exports to Russia now amount to 80 billion euros ($89.31 billion) worth of goods annually, worth 0.6% of EU GDP. They are mainly machinery and cars, chemicals and manufactured goods.
Among EU countries, Germany is both Russia's biggest exporter and importer; France, the Netherlands, Poland, Italy, Belgium all have sizeable trade.
""Coming with strong sanctions against Russia is going to have some impact on the EU economy and we need to be ready for this,"" European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told Reuters on Feb. 23 
The EU is also the largest foreign investor in Russia with total direct investment of 311.4 billion euros in 2019. That pales though compared with 2.16 trillion euros EU companies have invested in the United States. 
Russian investment in the EU is yet smaller at 136 billion euros. Depending on the severity of any sanctions and counter-sanctions, some or all of the European presence in Russia could be impacted. 
""On paper it is a lot, but this is only a small fraction of overall foreign direct investment of EU companies,"" said Daniel Gross, head of the CEPS think tank in Brussels, who added he saw little risk of Moscow wanting to expropriate plants run by EU companies because of the complexities entailed in running them.
SO WHAT IS THE OVERALL IMPACT TO THE EURO ZONE ECONOMY?
Clearly negative. Higher energy and food prices would sap household purchasing power and erode confidence. Consumption would be hit quickly and investments would likely fall in the weeks and months afterwards.
""The geopolitical clouds that we have over Europe, if they were to materialise, would certainly have an impact on energy prices and, through energy prices, an increased cost throughout the whole structure of prices,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said in early February, citing hits to consumption and investment.
Moreover, since high energy prices hit lower income families the hardest, governments are likely to introduce subsidies, which in turn would put more pressure on state coffers already stretched by pandemic support measures.
The Bank of America study reckoned an escalation would put at risk 0.5 percentage point of Europe's output directly through the drag on private consumption. Many consumers have built up buffers in the form of excess savings amassed during the pandemic, but some of those savings have already been eroded by soaring fuel bills.
WHAT WOULD THE ECB DO?
The challenge for the ECB, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries sharing the euro, is that the Ukraine conflict has the potential both to add inflationary pressures and depress economic activity.
Normally, ECB policy-makers look past short-term volatility because policy is only effective 12 to 18 months out.
Still, with inflation already at a record high 5.1% and the ECB planning to unwind stimulus in the coming months, it could come under pressure to act faster to try and counter further price rises even if that risked hitting future output.
Others argue this is precisely the reason to stay cautious and not set a fixed date to end ECB's main Asset Purchase Programme - as some ECB policymakers did ahead of the Russian invasion. 

""Judging the situation from today’s point of view, I would rather favour a continuation of the APP at least until the end of the year, beyond September,"" Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras, a member of the ECB's Governing Council, told Reuters.
That is what ECB policymakers are likely to debate when they meet in Paris on Feb. 24 for what had initially been billed an informal get-together. It will help shape their decisions at the next policy meeting on March 10.

LONDON (Reuters) - Western capitals have started putting in place fresh restrictions on Russia's sovereign debt as they seek to ratchet up pressure on Moscow over the conflict with Ukraine.
The United States and its allies introduced an initial round of sanctions after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine on Monday. A string of harsher measures is expected after he launched a full-scale invasion on Thursday. 
Access to Russian bonds had become increasingly restricted. U.S. sanctions imposed following the 2014 annexation of Crimea made future Russian dollar-denominated debt ineligible for many investors and key indexes. 
In April 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden barred U.S. investors from buying new Russian rouble bonds over accusations of Moscow meddling in the U.S. election.
Here is an overview of what measures have already been added and what impact they might have: 
WHAT ARE THE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON SOVEREIGN DEBT? 
Washington announced a ban on U.S. entities participating in secondary markets for both rouble and non-rouble debt issued by Russia's central bank, the national wealth fund and the finance ministry after March 1.
The European Union agreed new sanctions that will target the ability of Moscow to access the bloc's capital and financial markets as well as services, and ban EU investors from trading in Russian state bonds. Canada's government said it would bar its citizens from engaging in purchases of Russia's sovereign debt.
Britain said on Wednesday it would stop Russia selling sovereign debt in London - one of the world's major financial centres for such transactions. The measures would require additional legislation, according to Western officials, and clearing transactions would also be affected. However, there was no indication on whether Britain would stop trade in outstanding sovereign debt. 
The coordinated measures are aiming to curb Russia's ability to raise new foreign financing and plug some loopholes. Despite the limitations in the United States, Russia had been able to issue bonds in European markets. 
Analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) calculate that Russia has issued a combined 3.5 billion in euro-denominated bonds since 2020. 
IMPLICATIONS FOR INVESTORS 
Analysts see limited implications for holders of existing hard-currency bonds. 
They, however, predicted the new U.S. sanctions on local sovereign bonds, so-called OFZs, would lead to the creation of two different classes of OFZs. 
In response to the U.S. curbs on local sovereign bonds, the finance ministry said it would offer only new series of OFZs starting from Feb. 22 and stop tapping issues registered before this date ""to lower risks of forced selling of circulating state securities by particular categories of foreign investors.""
JPMorgan said that bonds which had been sold since mid-June had a 10-25 bps premium over existing issues, though this divergence faded, likely due to bonds being added to the most widely used emerging fixed income benchmark. 
""However, premia may be more persistent this time given that new OFZs will not be index eligible,"" said Nicolaie Alexandru-Chidesciuc at JPMorgan. ""As long as local banks can freely transact with foreigners the basis between the two curves should remain relatively narrow (within 20-30bp).""
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR CAPITAL FLOWS? 
Latest data shows that Russia has just under $40 billion in dollar and euro-denominated bonds outstanding, with just over half held by foreign investors. Positioning in those bonds by foreign investors looked light and the most underweight in two decades, according to a JPMorgan emerging market client survey. 
Meanwhile foreign investors held around 18% or 2.8 trillion roubles ($34.4 billion) of overall outstanding OFZs, according to ING.
The new U.S. sanctions are not expected to trigger forced selling in OFZs. However, capital flows have shown investors ditched the bonds as tensions over Ukraine have escalated since late last year.
""Russia is now experiencing the fifth consecutive month of foreign portfolio outflows from OFZ,"" said Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING. ""In October-January it totalled $5.4 billion, and since the beginning of February, some $1.1 billion were withdrawn.""
Russia currently has a weight of 6.8% in JPMorgan's local sovereign debt benchmark, though given the U.S. measures would see no new issues added while existing ones would mature, the weighting was expected to shrink to below 5% in just over three years, the bank projected. 

JPMorgan, which runs some of the most widely-used hard and local currency fixed income indexes in emerging markets, said on Wednesday it was reviewing the impact the new U.S. curbs may have on its emerging market benchmarks.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Wintershall Dea, one of the co-funders of Gazprom (MCX:GAZP)'s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, on Thursday said cancelling the project on political grounds would enable its operator to lodge compensation claims.
The group's remarks come as Moscow launched an invasion of Ukraine only days after Germany pulled the plug on certifying the pipeline in a first wave of sanctions on Russia, where Wintershall Dea has been active for more than three decades. 
The Germany-based oil and gas firm, which is co-owned by BASF and Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman's LetterOne investor group, on Thursday cancelled its annual press conference in light of current events.
""The latest military escalation also shakes the economic cooperation between Russia and Europe that has been built up over decades and will have far-reaching consequences,"" CEO Mario Mehren said in a statement.
""To what extent cannot yet be foreseen.""
Wintershall Dea along with Uniper, Shell (LON:RDSa), Engie and OMV  is one of the financial backers of Nord Stream 2.
It has previously said its loan payments to the project amounted to 730 million euros ($821 million).
Uniper, whose shares hit a 14-month low on Thursday, a day earlier said it was assessing whether the pipeline's suspension would trigger impairments on its 1 billion euro exposure to the project.
""Should the commissioning of Nord Stream 2 be prevented by political intervention, we assume that the project company will be able to enforce compensation claims,"" the company said in its annual report, referring to pipeline operator Nord Stream 2 AG.
""Currently, Wintershall Dea sees no reasonable scenario in which there will be political intervention without compensation,"" it added.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz earlier this week revoked a security assessment by the country's Economy Ministry, saying a new one was needed in light of current events and effectively suspending the pipeline for the foreseeable future.
Wintershall Dea said that even if the certification process by the German regulator was delayed it expected Nord Stream 2 to fulfil its contractual obligations towards its financial investors, without elaborating.
""I appreciate your understanding that today is not a day to discuss hypotheticals and unknowns,"" Wintershall Dea finance chief Paul Smith told analysts on Thursday after presenting the company's full-year results.

He said instead of a questions-and-answers session that is typical for this sort of investor call, the group would set up individual calls in the coming weeks ""as and when there is some greater clarity around the events which are unfolding as we speak and we can deal with facts, rather than speculation"".

Peskov said all necessary measures were being taken to ensure that the market reaction was as brief as possible. 
The rouble bounced off all-time lows on Thursday as the central bank announced FX interventions after President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian forces to invade Ukraine, a move expected to trigger new harsh sanctions against Moscow.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. banks were well-prepared for the Western sanctions announced so far over Russia's aggression towards Ukraine, but they are still nailing down details and worry that new measures could increase the cost and complexity of enforcing the new restrictions, lawyers and industry executives said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized a military operation in eastern Ukraine on Thursday in what appeared to be the start of war in Europe over Russia's demands for an end to NATO's eastward expansion.
U.S. President Joe Biden said he would announce further sanctions on Russia on Thursday, in addition to financial measures imposed this week.
The United States, the European Union and Britain on Tuesday announced new sanctions on Russia after Moscow's recognition of two separatist regions in Ukraine. Chief among their targets: Russian banks and their ability to operate internationally.
Washington imposed the harshest measures on Monday prohibiting trade and investment between U.S. individuals and the two breakaway Ukraine regions and moving on Tuesday to cut off Russia state-owned Promsvyazbank and Vnesheconombank and 42 of their subsidiaries from the U.S. financial system. 
The U.S. Treasury also barred trading in newly-issued Russian sovereign debt, and ordered that assets relating to a handful of Russian elites and their family members be frozen.
Financial institutions are the primary enforcers of sanctions.
In the past they have paid hefty fines for falling down on the job but since 2014 when countries sanctioned Russia for annexing the Crimea, banks have pulled back from the region and beefed up their sanctions compliance programs.
U.S. banks spent an estimated $35.2 billion on financial crime compliance - including sanctions, anti-money laundering checks and controls against other illegal activities - in 2020 alone, according to a LexisNexis survey.
As tensions in the region rose, the Biden administration was in touch with the industry for several weeks on potential measures and alerted banks ahead of Tuesday's announcement so the industry could prepare, three industry sources said.
""The new U.S. sanctions should not be hard to implement because, at least for now, the Russian bank designations are fairly discrete and, post-Crimea, U.S. and global banks have had ample time to address the nuances of these kinds of sanctions,"" including identifying beneficial asset owners, said Mario Mancuso, international trade partner at Kirkland & Ellis LLP.
Still, industry executives starting to implement the rules on Wednesday said they were seeking additional clarity from the Treasury on some details, most importantly the precise geographic boundaries of the breakaway territories.
""Those jurisdictions are defined under Ukraine law but they may or may not be what the breakaway jurisdictions assert is within their alleged sovereignty and that may change,"" said Andrew Shoyer, a partner at law firm Sidley Austin. 
He added that the 30-day deadline the Treasury had given companies to comply was the toughest it dishes out. 
A spokesman for the Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
MORE TO COME 
The White House and other nations said Tuesday's measures are just the start. Some additional sanctions, like expanding their scope to include more Russian banks or individuals would be relatively simple to handle.
But executives flagged concerns that jurisdictions might diverge in their sanctions approach if disputes arose over how to address Russian aggression. Reuters reported last week that the U.S. and its allies are not agreed on how they should respond to non-military Russian aggressions, like identifiable cyber attacks. 
""I think more financial sanctions on big Russian banks are probably inevitable, and that will hurt everyone in Russia who relies on them to do business with the outside world,"" said Nick Turner, a lawyer specializing in sanctions and anti-money laundering at Steptoe and Johnson in Hong Kong.
""It's hard to predict the consequences because it's not often you see major institutions being carved out of the financial system. As far as the U.S. and E.U. banks are concerned it is the equivalent of having a major counterparty disappear, and whatever financial impact that would have would be the same.""
Conflicting sanctions regimes would be more complex and expensive to implement, executives said. 
Another major question is whether Biden imposes ""secondary sanctions"" on overseas parties that do business with the underlying sanctioned entities. Those are also trickier to implement because of the complexity of identifying business ties. 
Some financial industry executives have also told the administration that they oppose any sanctions that would target Russia's access to payment provider SWIFT, which is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries.
Such a move could hurt Russian banks but it would also be disruptive for the global payments system and make it tough for creditors to get their money back from Russia.

While the White House has downplayed that option, lawmakers could pursue it. Although Congress is on recess this week, Isaac Boltansky, policy director for brokerage BTIG, said he expected lawmakers to advance legislation to challenge Russia's action soon.
""There will also be an effort to ban Russia from the international payments infrastructure SWIFT, but there are concerns that doing so could harm Russian creditors awaiting funds,"" he added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials agree inflation is too high and that interest rates should be increased at the upcoming meeting in March.
But if everyone seems a ""hawk"" for now, determined to bring down the highest inflation rates in 40 years, the 14 policymakers currently participating in Fed debates still have different ideas about the risks the U.S. economy is facing and how quickly the central bank needs to raise interest rates and take other steps to tighten credit.
The ""doves"" haven't gone away.
Rather, they are keeping a wary eye on how quickly inflation may slow, and how employment, wages and economic growth respond to rising interest rates. Depending on how these play out as the year progresses, the natural tension between hawks and doves may reemerge.
Indeed what distinguishes a Fed dove from a hawk these days is more a matter of nuance - a bit more faith, perhaps, that world supply chains will get sorted and ease inflation, or, on the other side, a bit more willingness to raise rates faster now just in case they don't. 
Fed hawks and doves - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/HAWKSANDDOVE/byprjeokgpe/chart.png 
It's captured perhaps most vividly in the divide between a Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, betting the Fed will get away with ""less ultimate financial restrictiveness"" than in prior years, and a James Bullard, head of the St. Louis Fed, thinking the Fed will have to carry more of the load in inflation control and that ""it's important to get moving."" 
Fed officials are also drawing lines around what to do with its stash of asset holdings, with some saying that outright sales of the portfolio might be needed as a way to further tighten financial conditions
WHY ARE INTEREST RATES RISING?
Yet even Evans agrees the Fed's current policy is ""wrong-footed"" given that consumer prices are rising 7% annually. The Fed aims to hold inflation to 2%. While the central bank uses a slightly different measure for its inflation target, that too has been running far above the Fed's comfort zone.
Monetary policy, meanwhile, remains at full throttle, stoking an economy that at present has no shortage of cash to spend and no lack of desire to spend it. The target interest rate remains near zero, where it was set at the start of the global coronavirus pandemic to fight a sharp economic downturn. While the Fed has curbed the pace of its monthly bondbuying - aimed at stabilizing financial markets and keeping borrowing rates low - there is no firm plan yet to shrink the nearly $9 trillion in government securities the central bank now holds. 
Fed policy rate and inflation hit a record gap - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/FEDFUNDS/movandmydpa/chart.png 
Given the situation, increases in the Federal Reserve's target interest rate are inevitable, and will likely be approved in quarter point increments at the next several Fed meetings. 
As the Fed raises its policy rate, other interest rates tend to rise as well. Home and auto loans become more expensive as a result. Companies may pay more to finance their operations.
In theory that all helps slow the pace of price increases.

Both hawks and doves will be watching.

Investing.com -- Russian President Vladimir Putin authorizes an invasion of Ukraine, resulting in U.S. indices moving into correction territory, the ruble falling to a six-year low and Brent crude climbing above $100 a barrel for the first time in over seven years. U.S. GDP is set to climb to 7% in the fourth quarter, while drinks giant AB InBev impresses with its forward guidance. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 24th February. 
1. Russia invades Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered an all-out invasion of Ukraine, announcing early Thursday on state TV ""a special military operation"" against his country’s southern neighbor, seeking its “demilitarization and denazification.”
Russian forces have reportedly fired missiles at several Ukrainian cities and landed troops on its south coast, while Ukraine’s defense minister said there has been intense shelling of Ukrainian units in the east, as well as military control centers and airfields.
The full scope of the Russian offensive is not yet clear, but U.S. President Joe Biden vowed the United States and its allies would respond decisively to the ""unprovoked and unjustified attack.""
European Union leaders are set to meet at an emergency summit in Brussels later Thursday to decide how to react, but European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said “we will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to key technologies and markets.""
""In addition, we will freeze Russian assets in the EU and stop the access of Russian banks to the European financial market.""
This could mean barring Russia from the SWIFT financial messaging system, which could have long-term effects on global economic growth.
2. Ruble falls to six-year low
The ruble took the brunt of the market’s shock at Putin’s decision to order Russian forces into Ukraine, falling to its lowest level since early 2016, leading the Moscow Exchange to suspend trading.
By 6:05 AM ET (1115 GMT), USD/RUB traded 3.1% higher at 83.6669, having climbed earlier as high as 87.9909.
The Russian central bank has taken measures to try and stabilize its financial markets, increasing daily dollars offered via foreign exchange swap operations with banks to $5 billion from $3 billion.
It also said that it will intervene in the foreign exchange market for the first time in years and would provide additional liquidity to banks by offering 1 trillion rubles ($11.5 billion) in an overnight repo auction. 
Elsewhere, safe havens were in demand, with the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, climbing 0.7% to 96.880, its highest level since Jan. 31.
EUR/USD fell as low as 1.1209, the lowest level since late January, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD slumped 0.8%. 
3. Stocks set to open sharply lower; Dow set to drop over 800 points
U.S. stock markets are set to open sharply lower, moving deeper into correction territory as investors react to the Russian aggression towards Ukraine.
By 6:05 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 815 points, or 2.5%, while S&P 500 futures were down 2.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 3.1%.
This weakness follows on from a downbeat session on Wall Street on Wednesday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average falling almost 500 points, or 1.4%. The broad-based S&P 500 fell 1.8%, ending around 12% below its Jan. 3 record close, below the 10% retreat that marks a correction. The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.6%.
The DJIA is heading towards a correction from its early January high, while the Nasdaq is on course to shed 20% from its November record closing high, i.e., bear market territory.
Stocks in focus Wednesday include  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) after the world's largest brewer forecast bigger profits in 2022, while ecommerce giant eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) issued earnings and revenue guidance for both the first quarter and the full year that fell below expectations.
Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) will also be in the spotlight after the online travel agency reported still weak gross bookings and room nights booked, key parameters still behind pre-COVID levels.
4. U.S. GDP to reach 7.0%
Aside from the turmoil in Eastern Europe, the main issue on investors’ minds is whether the Federal Reserve will raise short-term rates when it meets next month, and by how much.
Many now expect the central bank to hike by 50 basis points, given the elevated levels of consumer prices and the strength of the U.S. recovery. 
Further evidence of this arrives later Thursday, with the fourth quarter quarterly GDP figure, due at 8:30 AM ET, set to rise by 7% from 6.9% growth in the previous quarter. 
The weekly jobless initial claims are due at the same time, are are expected to fall to 235,000 from 248,000 the previous week.
5. Crude breaks through $100/barrel
Crude oil prices soared over $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 after Russian troops launched an invasion of Ukraine, prompting fears of a major disruption to global energy supplies.
The Western powers announced sanctions on a number of Russian banks and individuals close to Putin on Wednesday after he recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, but new, more severe measures look set to follow Thursday’s move.
“While Western governments probably will exempt energy transactions from sanctions, the blizzard of new restrictions will force many traders to be exceedingly cautious in handling Russian barrels,” said analysts at Eurasia Group, in a note. 
Russia is the world's second largest oil producer and is the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, providing about 35% of the latter's supply.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Thursday it would join in unspecified multilateral economic sanctions on Russia in response to its military operations in Ukraine, but is not considering adopting unilateral measures.
Russian forces fired missiles at several cities in Ukraine and landed troops on its coast on Thursday, officials and media said, after President Vladimir Putin authorised what he called a special military operation in the east.
President Moon Jae-in said at a National Security Council meeting that Ukraine's sovereignty, territory, and independence must be respected, press secretary Park Soo-hyun told a briefing.
South Korea will support international efforts to restrain armed aggression and seek a peaceful resolution, including by joining in economic sanctions, Park quoted Moon as saying.
A foreign ministry official who later briefed reporters mentioned export controls as part of possible international sanctions.

""Of course some countries are considering unilateral sanctions including financial measures but we are not considering that.”
Discussions are under way to finalise details, the official added.

Rates traders caught between inflationary pressures spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the potential impact on economic growth aren’t bailing on their tightening bets yet.
While wagers were trimmed slightly on Thursday, six quarter-point hikes are still expected by the Federal Reserve, five by the Bank of England and one by the European Central Bank by year-end. That’s in line with what was priced before Russia launched a barrage of missile, artillery and air attacks across Ukraine, sending Brent crude above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014. 
Underpinning the steadfast positioning is concern that military operations could disrupt key energy and commodity supplies and continue to push prices higher. A gauge of one-year inflation expectations in the euro area and the U.K. both surged to a record.
“The question is at what point, if ever, does the rates market narrative around the Russia-Ukraine crisis shift from one that is narrowly focused on short-term inflation risks, to one that is more concerned about the potential medium-term deflationary impact,” said Vanda Research’s global macro strategist Viraj Patel.
Policy makers have had to juggle the highest price pressures in decades with growth concerns as they wind down stimulus unleashed to keep their economies afloat during the pandemic. March is a major month for monetary policy with investors bracing for clues on the speed and extent of tightening that’s to come.
Money markets have fully priced a quarter-point rate hike from the Fed on March 16 and the BOE a day later and are hedging for the possibility of a larger increase. Meanwhile, the ECB is expected to sketch out its policy path at its March 10 meeting, when it also presents new economic forecasts. 
A gauge of one-year inflation expectations in the euro area and U.K. jumped 37 basis points and 88 basis points respectively on Thursday. Still, some analyst expect the latest developments will prompt investors to scale back their bets on the pace of rate hikes needed. 
“The conflict is likely to encourage market participants to scale back expectations for monetary tightening from major central banks in the near-term,” said Lee Hardman, a foreign exchange strategist at MUFG in London. 
“We would expect the U.K. and U.S. rate markets to continue to adjust expectations more in favor of smaller 0.25 point hikes being delivered at their next meetings in March rather than 0.50 point hikes to reflect the heightened uncertainty,” he said.

There remains 100 billion baht available to help the economy and a new borrowing plan was not yet considered, Arkhom said.
The government will mainly borrow domestically due to high liquidity and will borrow about $500 million from Japan this year, he said, adding more foreign loans would be considered if necessary later.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank should continue its bond-buying stimulus programme at least until the end of the year and keep it open-ended to cushion the fallout from any conflict in Ukraine, ECB policymaker Yannis Stournaras told Reuters.
He was the first ECB official to spell out how events in Ukraine, where fears of a full-on Russian invasion are rising, may affect plans by the euro zone central bank to stop its asset purchases and raise interest rates to curb high inflation.
In the exclusive interview, Greek central bank chief Stournaras also said the ECB should formally take rate cuts off the table but also give itself greater leeway over the timing of any hike.
Investors are expecting the ECB to announce plans to end its long-established Asset Purchase Programme (APP) at its next policy meeting on March 10, paving the way for a rate hike by the end of the year.
But Stournaras said the economic outlook was now ""much more uncertain"", meaning the ECB should err on the side of caution. 
""Judging the situation from today's point of view, I would rather favour a continuation of the APP at least until the end of the year, beyond September, rather than bringing the end closer,"" he said.
""I wouldn't be in favour of announcing the end of APP in March."" 
Europe relies on Russia for roughly 40% of its natural gas needs and imports grains from it and Ukraine.
Stournaras said the crisis was bound to depress prices ""in the medium to long term"" after an initial spike. 
""In my view it is going to have a short-term inflationary effect – that is prices will increase due to higher energy costs,"" Stournaras said.
""But in the medium to long term I think that the consequences will be deflationary through adverse trade effects and of course through the rise in energy prices."" 
OPTIONS OPEN
The ECB said in December it would run its APP at least until October and end it ""shortly before"" raising interest rates.
Traders were until recently pencilling in increases worth 50 basis points to the ECB's deposit rate, which would take it to zero after eight years in negative territory, although they have trimmed those bets since the escalation in Ukraine.
Stournaras - one of the ""doves"" favouring lower interest rates on the ECB's 25-member Governing Council - said the central bank should ""increase (its) flexibility"" by taking out ""shortly"" from its guidance, as also suggested by French central bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau.
He also backed changing the ECB's policy message, which says rates will stay at ""present or lower levels"", to rule out a rate cut but without opening the door to an increase.
The Greek governor said he remained to be convinced that the deflationary tendency that prevailed in the euro zone for several years before the coronavirus pandemic had disappeared.

He blamed current, exceptionally high euro zone inflation - 5.1% in January - on ""a series of supply shocks"".
""Monetary policy is not well suited to tackle these shocks,"" he said. ""It can do it, but at a very high cost in terms of output and employment. That's why I would urge caution.""

Prices of homes fell and new construction starts tumbled after regulators stepped up their deleveraging campaign against the bloated property sector, triggering defaults at some heavily indebted companies and threatening the delivery of some new residential housing projects.
Authorities have since stepped in with a slew of measures to boost sales and sentiment, including requiring smaller down-payments for first-time home buyers and allowing commercial banks to lower mortgage rates.
""China's genuine demand for housing is relatively strong,"" as more than 11 million people are newly employed in urban areas each year, Wang Menghui, head of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, said at a news conference.
Wang also believed that a large number of people are eager to live in spacious homes, partly driven by strict COVID-19 control measures.
China aims to offer 2.4 million units for affordable rental housing this year, Wang said, after 942,000 units in 40 cities with high population inflows helped meet demand from 3 million people last year. 
Property regulations are unlikely to be loosened across the board, analysts say. 

""China will maintain the continuity and stability of policy measures while strengthening the precision and coordination of such measures,"" Wang said.

On the Czech central bank's interest rates, Nidetzky said they could still rise.
""I can imagine that there still will be some moderate tuning (of rates),"" Nidetzky said in the interview.
""Then it will rather be about how long the interest rates will remain at higher level, and when we will start debating that we would start cutting them towards some neutral equilibrium around 3%,"" he said.
The Czech National Bank has lifted its key two-week repo rate by 425 basis points to a 20-year high of 4.50% since last June. That has included 375 basis points worth of hikes at the last four meetings.
The bank, the most aggressive among central European peers in tackling sharp price growth, has signaled a slowdown in its tightening even as inflation soared to 9.9% in January.
Nidetzky said that the Ukraine-Russia crisis was creating more uncertainty.
""When I take a look from our entirely economic point of view, I see (the crisis) as an uncertainty, which will have an inflationary impact overall,"" he said.
""This conflict will prop up inflation mainly via higher gas and oil prices, and subsequently of other energies.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Indian economy likely grew at a slower pace in the final quarter of 2021, primarily due to lacklustre manufacturing output and investment, according to economists in a Reuters poll.
Asia's third largest economy expanded 6.0% in the October-December quarter compared with the same period from a year ago, the median forecast of 38 economists polled Feb. 21-23 showed, losing more steam even before disruptions from the Omicron variant of the coronavirus came into play.
The economy expanded 20.1% in the April-June quarter and 8.4% in July-September, mostly because of weak performances in the same quarters in 2020 when the pandemic took hold.
""The industrial production numbers, specifically capital and infrastructure goods production, point to a substantial slowdown (in 2021 Q4),"" said Miguel Chanco, senior Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
India's Industrial output grew a mere 0.4% in December, a much slower pace than expected.
""The sort of rebound in Q3 after the Delta (virus variant) wave in Q2 was never going to be sustainable. But in any case, the exhaustion of momentum in Q4 particularly on the investment side was quite sharp, so that's the largest reason for a much sharper slowdown,"" Chanco added. 
The latest 6.0% growth estimate was also a downgrade from 6.3% anticipated a month ago in a separate Reuters poll. Ten of 15 common contributors downgraded their forecasts or left them unchanged. The remaining five upgraded.
Forecasts were in a wide range, from 3.0% to 7.5%. 
The latest GDP data is due at 1200 GMT on Feb. 28.
""Growth rates will still be muddied by base effects, so gauging momentum will be slightly difficult,"" said Dhiraj Nim, economist at ANZ.
Growth in the current January-March period, partially crimped by restrictions due to Omicron, is projected at 5.0%, putting the financial year's annual average at 9.2%, according to a separate survey taken last month.

The Reserve Bank of India has been prioritising growth and held interest rates at record lows at its February meeting, despite inflation breaching the upper limit of its target range.
""Economic activity is expected to broaden going forward ... Progressively the pandemic is taking less of a toll on economic activity. Seen from this perspective, the RBI should have already taken the plunge to normalise monetary policy,"" said Prithviraj Srinivas, chief economist at  Axis Capital  (NYSE:AXS).

HAVANA (Reuters) -Cuba, a close ally of Russia, has sharply criticized the United States for imposing ""the progressive expansion of NATO towards the borders of the Russian Federation"" and called for a diplomatic solution to preserve international peace.
One of the worst crises in Europe in decades is unfolding as Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/kremlin-says-no-concrete-plans-summit-with-biden-over-ukraine-2022-02-21 into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine after recognizing them as independent, prompting fresh sanctions https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-allies-step-up-sanctions-pressure-russia-over-ukraine-2022-02-23 from Western nations including the United States. 
In a statement late on Tuesday, Cuba's foreign ministry said the United States, Havana's long-time rival, had ramped up threats against Putin, aggravating the crisis. The Cuban statement did not specifically mention Russian advances into the separatist regions of eastern Ukraine.
""The US government has been threatening Russia for weeks and manipulating the international community about the dangers of an 'imminent massive invasion' of Ukraine,"" the Cuban statement said. ""It has supplied weapons and military technology, deployed troops to several countries in the region, applied unilateral and unjust sanctions, and threatened other reprisals.""
Communist-run Cuba for decades has been an ally of Russia and the Soviet Union before that, with close economic ties. 
Cuba's statement came just hours after Russia agreed to postpone debt payments https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/russia-postpones-cuba-debt-payments-amid-warming-relations-2022-02-23 owed to it by Cuba until 2027.

Vyacheslav Volodin, chairman of Russia's Duma, or lower house of parliament, said during a visit to Cuba Wednesday that the United States was seeking to suppress both countries with unwarranted sanctions, according to a translated statement broadcast on Cuban state television.
""They don't want to see a strong Russia, they don't want Russia to be self-sufficient, and the same for Cuba, they don't want to see a free people, they don't want to see an independent country,"" Volodin told Cuban lawmakers.
The Cuban statement on Tuesday said ""constructive and respectful dialogue"" was necessary to resolve the Ukraine crisis. 

""We call on the United States and NATO to seriously and realistically address the well-founded claims for security guarantees of the Russian Federation, which has the right to defend itself,"" the statement said.
""The determination of the United States to impose the progressive expansion of NATO towards the borders of the Russian Federation constitutes a threat to the national security of this country and to regional and international peace,"" it added.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada will raise interest rates by 25 basis points on March 2, earlier than previously thought and ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve, according to economists surveyed in a Reuters poll, which also showed expectations that rates will be higher by year-end than previously thought.
Just one month ago, economists predicted the BoC would wait until the second quarter to hike rates. But persistently higher inflation, which accelerated to a 30-year peak in January, prompted them to bring forward expectations.
Other major central banks, including the Fed and the Bank of England, are also expected to raise rates in March to tackle inflation which is at multi-decade highs, with some economists calling for an aggressive 50 basis-point move by the Fed.
The poll, which was conducted Feb. 17-23, found only a 20% median probability of a 50 basis-point rate rise at the BoC's March meeting, with all 25 economists predicting a 25 basis-point hike to 0.50%.
""I would say they're not behind the curve because inflation expectations are well-anchored,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities. ""I think that's probably the best way of framing this. But it is imperative they do hike rates now because if they wait any longer, they will be behind the curve."" 
GRAPHIC: Bank of Canada monetary policy outlook - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/gkplgamrxvb/Reuters%20Poll%20-%20BoC%20monetary%20policy%20outlook.png 
BoC Deputy Governor Timothy Lane said last week there was a risk inflation could continue to be more persistent than forecast, adding that the central bank would be nimble and potentially ""forceful"" in tackling it. This would set the stage for a possible aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes.
Median forecasts in the poll showed the BoC would raise its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 1.00% next quarter and end the year with the rate at 1.25%, higher than an end-year prediction of 1.00% in a January poll but lower than current financial market expectations.
The median forecast showed the central bank would take interest rates higher by another 50 basis points in the second quarter followed by another 25 basis points in the third quarter, but economists were split on their views.
For the second quarter, 11 of 24 economists predicted a 25 basis-point rate rise and the rest expected rates to rise by at least 50 bps. The same number said rates would climb to 1.00% in the third quarter, while seven predicted rates to reach 1.25% and six said 1.50%.
While the fourth-quarter median showed rates at 1.25%, 11 of 24 respondents said rates would be at least 1.50%, including one who said 2.00%.
All 14 economists who responded to an extra question said the bank would start reducing the size of its balance sheet this year, with a majority saying in April. The others were split between March and June.
Unlike the Fed, the BoC - which owns about 42% of Canada's sovereign debt - has never previously attempted to shrink its balance sheet, a process known as quantitative tightening (QT).
""The Bank will begin QT in April, shortly after its first rate hike in the prior month, and start to shrink its balance sheet by allowing maturing bonds to roll off without reinvesting the funds,"" said Tony Stillo, director of Canada economics at Oxford Economics.
Nearly 55% of respondents, or seven of 13, who answered a separate question said inflation would not fall to the BoC's 2% target until the second half of next year or later. Six said it would in the first half of 2023.
Respondents also expected this to be a short interest rate cycle as they put both the terminal rate and their estimated neutral rate at 2.00%, according to median forecasts from additional questions.
""The tightening cycle is playing out fast, with markets expecting an increasing and front-loaded number of rate hikes. However, household and corporate imbalances remain elevated,"" said Dominique Lapointe, economist at Laurentian Bank.

""Combined with anticipated risk aversion and tighter overall financial conditions, we believe this will prevent the BoC and other central banks from hiking as much as the market currently predicts.""

775,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 06:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) -San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said on Wednesday she expects the U.S. central bank will need to raise rates at least four times this year, and likely more, to stop high inflation from getting worse.
""There is broad agreement that inflation is too high and the policy rate is too low,"" Daly said at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council & Town Hall. 
It is important, she told reporters after the event, to have ""a little more urgency"" on raising interest rates; a rate hike every other meeting ""doesn't satisfy the moment,"" she said, and neither does waiting until later in the year to start reducing the Fed's $9 trillion balance sheet.
Daly's embrace Wednesday of a series of four or more rate hikes was a notably hawkish shift from her previous support for a less aggressive stance. 
She also said the Fed may need to consider a bigger-than-usual half-percentage-point rate hike down the road, although for now quarter-point rate hikes remain her expectation.
""Raising rates at least four times -- at least -- would be my preference, but it most likely will need more than that"" to bring demand back into line with supply -- unless consumer demand falls more than she expects, or supply chains get fixed faster than she anticipates. 
Financial conditions are more accommodative now than they should be, given the strength of the economy and the pace of job gains, she said. 
And while the geopolitical situation with Ukraine and Russia adds to uncertainty, she said, it will not change the Fed's plans to raise rates unless conditions get sharply worse. 
Once the Fed has begun raising rates, she said, it will then begin to reduce its $9 trillion balance sheet, a process that will further tighten policy, and work to slow inflation. 
Inflation by the Fed's preferred gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 5.75% last year, the highest in about 40 years and more than twice the Fed's 2% goal. 
""We need to demonstrate to the American people that we are committed to having that not be a perpetuating spiral,"" Daly said. 
Still, she said, raising rates does not mean the Fed is slamming on the brakes, but rather allows economic growth to continue by easing inflation.
""The last thing you want is an economy that's going too fast, overruns what's possible, and then you do have to bridle it back; but that's not where we are at,"" she said. ""We're doing the handoff from intense COVID-related support to gradually moving the policy rate up and getting this policy accommodation right-sized for the economy that we have."" 
Eventually, Daly said, she does expect pandemic-disrupted supply chains to heal and at least some workers to return to the labor force as public health improves, so for now there's little need for the Fed to raise rates steeply.
""If we run first and do everything at once... then we will have overcorrected,"" she said. ""We need to get policy in line, but we can’t be impatient about doing it all today.""
Among data she'll be watching, she said, is the transition from pandemic COVID-19 to an endemic state; how quickly disrupted supply chains recover; how rapidly workers sidelined by COVID-19 return to the workforce; and how quickly the fiscal support that bolstered the economy's recovery from the pandemic shutdowns fades.
TRANSPARENCY
Daly also expressed hope that the Fed's ability to communicate its inflation-fighting intentions and thus shape inflation expectations will keep an upward price spiral from taking hold as it did in the 1970s.
Back then, she said, the more prices rose, the more people expected them to continue to rise, and the Fed -- as was its custom - offered little guidance on what it would do in response. The Fed would have policy meetings, but did not even announce their decisions afterwards, for instance.
That silence, she said, allowed the situation to snowball: inflation continued its rise until the Fed put in a series of steep interest rate hikes that knocked it back but also sent the economy into recession.
Since then, she said, things have changed - not just in the economy itself, but more importantly with the Fed's approach to communications. The central bank now has a 2% target for inflation and an explicit framework for adjusting policy to reach its goals; it publishes Fed policymaker forecasts, and policymakers like Daly routinely go out and give speeches about their views. 

That transparency, she said, has locked down inflation expectations despite the current rise in actual inflation, potentially reducing the need for the kind of aggressive action needed decades ago.
""Greater transparency and a strong commitment to achieving our goals assures Americans that periods of high inflation or unemployment will not last forever; that there is an end in sight.""

776,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 04:26PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Poorer Americans are seeing the benefit from strong U.S. economic growth, the Biden administration said on Wednesday, citing research suggesting that COVID stimulus and other measures may have eased inequality.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, used new tools to evaluate growth in national income, and their data showed the economy was delivering gains to the bottom half of the income ladder, even without counting the pandemic aid.
After adjusting for inflation, adult labor and capital income - before taxes and government benefits - rose by 5.6% overall in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to a year earlier, but it jumped by 10.9% for adults in the bottom half of the earning scale, it showed.
The data was highlighted in a blog published on Wednesday by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. 
In recent decades, U.S. economic growth has increasingly rewarded the richest disproportionately, but Biden administration officials say the new data shows their policies are rebuilding a pandemic-scarred economy more equitably.
The data showed that so-called ""market"" incomes excluding government benefits for the bottom half of earners fell 25% in the second quarter of 2020 due to COVID-19 shutdowns, but rebounded by the fourth quarter of 2021, after adjusting for inflation, and were now 4% higher on average.
Income including government cash and other transfers also rose sharply due to pandemic relief, but has since tapered off, although it remains above pre-pandemic levels, the blog said. 
Market incomes for the bottom 50% were 2% higher on average in the fourth quarter of 2021 than they before the pandemic, while disposable incomes were up 11%.

While all income groups saw incomes rising in 2021, those between the 50th and 90th percentile saw their market income grow more slowly than those in the bottom half or the top 10%.
The blog noted that Americans were not necessarily feeling better off, despite the income growth, and that many appeared concerned that inflation could wipe out these gains.

The BoE forecasts inflation will peak at a 30-year high of around 7.25% in April when a 54% rise in regulated household energy bills takes effect.
Financial markets expect the BoE to raise rates to nearly 2% this year from 0.5% now.
Bailey said there were clear upside risks to the BoE's central inflation forecast if the historic surge in energy prices led to higher wage deals and businesses passing on the costs to consumers.
""It's not just wage setting, it's also price setting ... it's both,"" Bailey told lawmakers. ""There is very clearly an upside risk there. The upside risk ... comes through from the second-round effects.""
Bailey sought to defend earlier remarks - widely criticised by trade unions and politicians - in which he urged pay restraint to avoid a cycle of rising prices and wages.
A combination of higher wages and higher inflation would favour workers with greater bargaining power who tended to be better off, Bailey said.
""This real thing that worries me here is that it's those with the least bargaining power in the labour market who lose out in this situation,"" he said.
Nonetheless, lawmakers on the House of Commons' Treasury Committee challenged Bailey over whether he truly understood the scale of the challenge faced by the lowest-paid workers.
Angela Eagle from the opposition Labour Party asked him to state how much he earned. Bailey he said he could not remember precisely before confirming it was 575,538 pounds ($783,422) a year including pension contributions.
INFLATION RISKS
The BoE became the world's first major central bank to raise borrowing costs after the coronavirus pandemic in December and it raised its benchmark Bank Rate again this month to 0.5% from 0.25%. Four of its nine monetary policymakers voted for an increase to 0.75%.
Investors are fully pricing in another 25 basis-point rate hike next month, followed by another in May.
Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said the surge in energy prices was likely to be twice as big in 2022 as in any year in the 1970s, when high inflation plagued many economies.
""This is the most challenging period for monetary policy since inflation targeting began in 1992,"" Broadbent said.
Bailey also highlighted downside risks to the BoE's inflation forecasts if energy prices fell as fast as markets expect next year.
Silvana Tenreyro, an external Monetary Policy Committee member, said the BoE's forecasts showed inflation in three years' time would be only just above its 2% target if rates did not rise, implying only ""really modest"" tightening was needed.
Bailey said: ""It is a message to markets not to get carried away.""
He and BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill have previously mooted scaling back guidance to markets.
However, the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday warned the BoE that clear communication was key to avoid a repeat of November's turmoil when markets believed the BoE had signalled a rate hike, only for rates to stay on hold.
Bailey said the MPC's split in February over how much rates needed to rise should not be read as signalling a big disagreement on how high they would need to go in total.

MPC member Jonathan Haskel, part of the minority that voted for a rise in Bank Rate to 0.75%, said it was ""a very, very finely balanced decision"".

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will be ready to launch a second package of sanctions against Russia, including export controls, if Russian troops move beyond the Ukrainian regions held by Russian-backed separatists, European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told Reuters on Wednesday.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognised the independence of two breakaway regions in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine that adjoin Russia.
Moscow sent troops there on Tuesday, prompting the EU, the United States and Britain to slap sanctions on Russian politicians and banks and curbing the government's ability to raise capital via the EU's financial markets.
But the EU is concerned Russia may continue its invasion beyond the areas controlled by the separatists and EU leaders will hold an emergency summit on Thursday to discuss what to do next.
""Russia decided to go for a major escalation of this conflict by the recognition of the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk Republics and clarifying that they mean this in the territory of not what is actually controlled by the so-called republics, but the entire Donbass territory, so we are facing a major escalation,"" Dombrovskis said in an interview.
""If there is further Russian aggression and further incursion into Ukraine territory we are willing to step up our response also in terms of sanctions.""
Asked what such a stepping up would mean, Dombrovskis said:
""It would concern economic sanctions in the area of trade, for example export controls. The EU has been working on a sanctions package for several weeks, so there are ways how we are able to act quickly and further step up sanctions and do this in cooperation with the United States, Britain and other countries.""
He said the conflict, the sanctions and potential Russian counter-sanctions would have economic repercussions for the EU, but that the seriousness of what is at stake meant the 27-nation bloc would have to accept them.

""Coming with strong sanctions against Russia is going to have some impact on the EU economy and we need to be ready for this,"" Dombrovskis said.
""But here we have the security and territorial integrity of Ukraine at stake, and we have the broader security architecture at sake, so we need to be able to react and also take some economic cost, if it is necessary.""

MOSCOW/DONETSK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Western nations and Japan on Tuesday punished Russia with new sanctions for ordering troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine and threatened to go further if Moscow launched an all-out invasion of its neighbour.
The United States, the European Union, Britain, Australia, Canada and Japan announced plans to target banks and elites while Germany halted a major gas pipeline project from Russia in one of the worst security crises in Europe in decades.
Bitter about Ukraine's long-term goal to join NATO and claiming it as historic Russian land, Russian President Vladimir Putin has amassed more than 150,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, according to U.S. estimates, and ordered soldiers into the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions to ""keep the peace"".
The United States dismisses that justification as ""nonsense"".
""To put it simply Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine,"" U.S. Presidnt Joe Biden said on Tuesday.
""This is the beginning of a Russian invasion."" 
Satellite imagery over the past 24 hours shows several new troop and equipment deployments in western Russia and more than 100 vehicles at a small airfield in southern Belarus, which borders Ukraine, according to U.S. firm Maxar.
The Ukrainian military said early on Wednesday one soldier had been killed and six wounded in 96 incidents of shelling by pro-Russian separatists in the east over the previous 24 hours. It said separatist forces used heavy artillery, mortars and Grad rocket systems.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian cancelled separate scheduled meetings with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday as weeks of frantic diplomacy failed to end the crisis.
Plans announced by Biden to bolster Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania include sending 800 infantry soldiers and up to eight F-35 fighter jets to locations along NATO's eastern flank, a U.S. official said, but are a redistribution, not additions. 
Putin did not watch Biden's speech and Russia will first look at what the United States has outlined before responding, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, cited by Russian news agencies.
Putin said he was always open to finding diplomatic solutions but that ""the interests of Russia and the security of our citizens are unconditional for us."" 
Moscow is calling for security guarantees, including a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO, while the United States and its allies offer Putin confidence-building and arms control steps to defuse the stand-off. 
Lavrov brushed off the threat of sanctions.
""Our European, American, British colleagues will not stop and will not calm down until they have exhausted all their possibilities for the so-called punishment of Russia,"" he said.
GAS PIPELINE HALTED
In perhaps the most significant measure announced on Tuesday, Germany halted the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline owned by Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), a move likely to raise gas prices in Europe. 
Built and awaiting German approval, the pipeline had been set to ease the pressure on European consumers facing record energy prices but critics including the United States have long argued it would increase Europe's energy dependence on Russia.
German Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned that gas prices in Europe were likely to rise in the short term. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president and now deputy chairman of its Security Council, suggested prices could double.
""Welcome to the new world where Europeans will soon have to pay 2,000 euros per thousand cubic metres!"" he said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The Kremlin said it hoped the Nord Stream delay was temporary and Putin said Russia ""aims to continue uninterrupted supplies"" of energy to the world.
U.S. sanctions target Russian elites and two state-owned banks, excluding them from the U.S. banking system, banning them from trading with Americans, and freezing their U.S. assets. They also seek to deny the Russian government access to Western financing. The U.S. sanctions applied to VEB bank and Russia's military bank, Promsvyazbank, which does defence deals. Russia's two largest commercial lenders, Sberbank and VTB, would face American sanctions if Moscow proceeded with its invasion of Ukraine, a U.S. official said.
Biden said that while more sanctions were being prepared in the event of a full-scale invasion, it was critical to ensure such measures did not hurt Americans in the form of steeper energy costs. 
Crude oil futures on Tuesday reached their highest levels since 2014. A U.S. State Department official said sanctions that could be imposed in the near future ""will not target oil and gas flows"". 

Britain announced sanctions on three billionaires with close links to Putin, and five smaller lenders including Promsvyazbank. 
The European Union has agreed to blacklist banks involved in financing separatists in eastern Ukraine and to cut the Russian government out of its debt markets.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England policymaker Silvana Tenreyro said on Wednesday that she - like other BoE policymakers - saw a case for higher interest rates to tackle inflation near a 30-year high, but the extent of tightening needed was uncertain.
Financial markets currently price in BoE interest rates reaching nearly 2% by the end of this year, but central bank forecasts at the start of the month showed inflation would undershoot its target if rates reached 1.4%.
Tenreyro, in a speech to be delivered to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), noted that inflation was forecast to fall almost back to target without raising rates above their current 0.5%, and that rates had only been 0.75% before the pandemic.
""This metric would also suggest only a small amount of policy tightening will ultimately be required, reflecting the small share of the overall stimulus in the pandemic provided by monetary policy in the UK,"" Tenreyro said.
Government fiscal policy had been the main source of support for Britain's economy during the pandemic, she said.
Tenreyro voted against the BoE's rate rise in December, its first since the start of the pandemic, saying she preferred to wait a few weeks for clarity on the impact of the rapidly spreading Omicron variant of coronavirus.
In February she joined the majority in voting to raise rates to 0.5% from 0.25%.

""The outlook and the risks had shifted in favour of a more front-loaded tightening,"" she said. 
""With the inflation pick-up from higher tradeable goods price inflation now set to be larger and likely more persistent than previously expected, I thought an earlier tightening would strike a better balance between inflation and output volatility,"" she added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Governments across the world should beef up their insolvency systems and prepare to restructure or liquidate badly scarred firms as they withdraw massive support provided during the height of the COVID-19 crisis, the IMF said on Wednesday.
The International Monetary Fund said corporate debt reached $83 trillion, or 98% of global gross domestic product, at the end of 2020, with advanced economies and China accounting for 90% of the nearly $9 trillion increase in 2020.
Now that central banks are raising interest rates to address inflation, firms’ debt servicing costs will increase and declining fiscal support will expose corporate vulnerabilities, the IMF's strategy chief Ceyla Pazarbasioglu and Rhoda Weeks-Brown, the fund's general counsel, wrote in a new blog.
""Governments were right to support firms financially through the worst of the pandemic,"" they said. ""Now policymakers should calibrate financial support and direct it efficiently to companies that are in need. They should also be prepared to restructure or liquidate badly scarred firms.""
They said that while many countries, including Brazil, France, Turkey and the United States, had strengthened their insolvency systems, corporate debt in many emerging economies was more vulnerable and insolvency systems there were weaker.
Almost 40% of advanced economies with vulnerable corporate debt also had insolvency systems that could struggle in the event of a large number of restructurings, the IMF officials said.
They said countries should adopt strong governance and transparency safeguards to mitigate risks and have clear exit plans from the start, while ensuring the involvement of private creditors.
Countries with limited fiscal space and ineffective insolvency systems should rely more on out-of-court or hybrid restructuring schemes, while tackling deeper reforms over the medium-term.

Those with fiscal leeway could provide more support but should avoid creating “zombie” firms that survived only with state assistance, they said.
The IMF also urged asset quality reviews at banks, warning that generous regulatory and accounting forbearance policies adopted to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic had increased the risk potential non-performing loans were not reflected in their balance sheets.

Germany’s economy minister said the country could do without Russian gas. But that won’t be easy.
Europe’s industrial powerhouse currently relies on Russia’s Gazprom PJSC (OTC:OGZPY) for more than half its gas. And if anything, demand will only grow as the country phases out nuclear and coal-fired electricity. No. 2 supplier Norway is already pumping at full tilt, and Germany has no means of importing liquefied cargoes.
“Germany have shot themselves in the foot with nuke and coal closures,” Tim Partridge, head of energy trading at DB Group Europe, said Wednesday. It’s vulnerable when renewable output falls short and gas is in short supply, pushing up prices as seen last year, he said.
Economy Minister Robert Habeck told Deutschlandfunk radio Wednesday that “the possibility that Germany gets enough gas and enough resources beyond Russian gas imports is there.” 
He was speaking after Chancellor Olaf Scholz effectively froze approval for Russia’s controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany amid a dramatic escalation of tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine.
Ukraine Update: Putin Says Still Open to ‘Diplomatic Solutions’
Minister Habeck cautioned against “too much speculation,” saying energy ties with Russia have survived previous crises. He also said the halt to the Nord Stream 2 certification process doesn’t mean the pipeline is off the table for good.
Germany is gradually taking its remaining reactors and coal-fired plants offline as it ditches nuclear and looks to move away from the dirtiest fossil fuel. An increase in gas use could help fill that gap. Yet that potentially conflicts with efforts to curb reliance on Russia -- and on fossil fuels in general -- while plans to start importing liquefied natural gas have faced numerous hurdles.

Bringing in LNG “will never be enough to replace Russian gas fully,” said Hans van Cleef, a senior energy economist at ABN Amro Bank NV. “Perhaps they replace it a bit, with longer and more use of coal-fired power plants, but that obviously conflicts with the climate goals.”

LONDON (Reuters) -London's Heathrow airport, Britain's busiest, saw its lowest number of passengers since 1972 last year and suffered wider losses as the coronavirus pandemic slashed demand for business travel and holidays.
Passenger numbers fell to 19.4 million in 2021. Heathrow also recorded a pretax loss of 1.79 billion pounds ($2.43 billion) for 2021, taking total loses during the pandemic to 3.8 billion pounds due to the drop in passengers and high fixed costs.
Chief Executive John Holland-Kaye said Heathrow expected to meet its target of more than doubling passengers to 45.5 million this year, although demand would be ""quite peaky"" and focused on British school holidays. 
Passenger numbers were currently 23% behind forecast, but he said there were signs of recovery, with the airport seeing some of its busiest days in two years as families went skiing during the school break last week.
""Summer in particular we think will be quite busy,"" he said in an interview. ""After two years of staycations, people want to get some guaranteed sunshine.""
He said Heathrow was working with airlines to scale-up its operations and reopen Terminal 4 for the summer peak.
But while outbound tourism had been boosted by the removal of restrictions in Britain, Holland-Kaye said inbound tourism and business travel remained suppressed, including transatlantic routes, because of testing requirements in other countries.
He said he did not expect travel to return to pre-pandemic levels until all restrictions had been removed and passengers were confident they would not be reimposed.
Heathrow is awaiting the aviation regulator's final proposals on what it can charge passengers for the 2022-2027 period, after it criticised the airport's plan to raise charges by nearly half. Airlines have also voiced their opposition.
Holland-Kaye said if the regulator did not rectify ""major mistakes"" in its initial proposals, there could be a return to the ""Heathrow hassle"" of 15 years ago.

""If we get it right, we can continue to have the seamless journeys that people have been used to, and the price for doing that is less than 2% on the ticket price,"" he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday proposed a law to make large companies operating in the EU check that their suppliers around the world respect environmental standards and do not use slave or child labour.
The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence law will also oblige directors of European Union firms to ensure that their business strategy aligns with limiting global warming to 1.5 Celsius, as agreed under the Paris climate agreement.
""We can no longer turn a blind eye on what happens down our value chains,"" EU justice commissioner Didier Reynders said.
Under the proposal, EU firms will have to assess their supply chains at least once a year and before major business decisions or starting new activities, for risks including forced labour, child labour, inadequate workplace safety, and environmental impacts like pollution and ecosystem degradation.
If a company identifies such issues it must take appropriate action to prevent or stop them, such as by developing a corrective action plan that the supplier must agree to follow.
The Commission proposal will only become EU law after lengthy negotiations with the European Parliament and EU governments that are likely to take more than a year. 
It would apply to around 13,000 EU firms, including the EU's biggest companies - those that employ more than 500 people and have net turnover of more than 150 million euros. 
Companies in high-impact sectors like clothes, animals, forestry, food and beverages, and the extraction of fossil fuels and metals are also covered if they have more than 250 employees and 40 million euros in net turnover. 
Still, that means 99% of Europe's firms would be exempt. 
EU lawmaker Lara Wolters, who led a Parliament report last year calling for the law, welcomed the proposal but said small companies in high-risk sectors could still contribute to abuses, and should be covered.
The law would also apply to around 4,000 companies from outside the EU, but whose operations within the EU meet the turnover thresholds.

Compliance would be monitored by governments in the 27 EU member states. Companies ignoring the law would face fines.
EU firms could also be liable for damages if their suppliers commit an offence that could have been prevented or ceased with due diligence measures by the EU company.

The vast majority of Turkey's mainstream media outlets are seen as close to the government with coverage favouring President Tayyip Erdogan and his allies. Turks have increasingly resorted to alternative outlets, some of which are foreign-owned, and social media for news.
On Monday, the RTUK media watchdog, which is responsible for inspecting television and radio broadcasts, gave Deutsche Welle, Voice of America and Euronews 72 hours to apply for an online broadcasting licence to operate in Turkey.
Peter Limbourg, director general of Deutsche Welle, said the move was an attempt to restrict international media, adding that the company will apply to Turkish courts regarding the decision.
""(The measure) gives Turkish authorities the option to block the entire service based on individual, critical reports unless these reports are deleted. This would open up the possibility of censorship,"" he said.
RTUK, whose policy-making board is dominated by Erdogan's AK party and its allies, frequently fines broadcasters critical of the government for their coverage. Recently, it fined Tele 1 broadcaster for inciting hatred after journalist Sedef Kabas used a palace-related proverb on a TV programme.
Kabas was jailed pending trial over the comments, which prosecutors said amounted to insulting the president, considered a crime in Turkey.
Voice of America said there were concerns that the broadcasting licence would enable censorship of unfavourable press coverage.
""VOA could not comply with directives from a regulator to censor or remove content; nor then could VOA willingly agree to subject itself to such censorship,"" it said in a news release.
Voice of America shared an article on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) regarding ways to view the website if access if blocked to it.
Ilhan Tasci, a RTUK board member from the main opposition CHP, said the deadline is 1230 GMT on Thursday and the council would apply to a court to ban access to the websites if they have not applied for a licence by then.

""There is a dominant mindset in Turkey that does not want a voice, thought or different perspective to be expressed other than what the government wants. This is sliding from a domestic level towards international broadcasters,"" he told Reuters.
Western allies and rights groups have accused Erdogan's government of using a failed military coup in 2016 as a pretext to muzzle dissent. The government denies this, saying its measures are needed due to security threats facing Turkey.

786,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 07:30AM ET</span>","BEIJING (Reuters) - Ukraine, which is locked in a security crisis with Russia, has seen growing investment from China in recent years.
China has a strategic interest in Ukraine because of its location, a free trade deal between Ukraine and the European Union, and the former Soviet republic's supply of mineral and agricultural resources.
China has expressed concern about the ""worsening"" situation in Ukraine and called for all parties to show restraint and resolve differences through dialogue. 
Below are some of China's main business and economic interests in Ukraine. 
TRADE TIES
Trade relations between China and Ukraine have grown significantly since a state visit to China in 2013 by then President Viktor Yanukovych. 
China leapfrogged Russia to become Ukraine's biggest single trading partner in 2019, with overall trade totalling $18.98 billion last year, a nearly 80% jump from 2013, according to data from the State Statistics Service of Ukraine. 
Ukrainian exports to China, mainly commodities such as iron ore, corn and sunflower oil, stood at $8.0 billion in 2021, while imports from China, largely machinery and consumer goods, totalled $10.97 billion, the data showed. 
China became the largest importer of Ukrainian barley in the 2020-21 marketing year. About 30% of China's corn imports last year, more than 8 million tonnes, came from Ukraine, Chinese customs data showed.
Increased bilateral trade also facilitated the launch of direct rail freight service between the two countries, although the frequency remains low. Ukraine is also a stop on the China-Europe Railway Express service, which has helped ease logistics headaches for Chinese firms during COVID-19 pandemic. 
BELT AND ROAD
Ukraine is an important hub within the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature infrastructure and foreign policy project, which Kyiv joined in 2017. In 2020, the two sides signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation in areas including the financing and construction of infrastructure projects.
Big Chinese companies with operations in Ukraine include state food conglomerate COFCO Corp, state-run builders China Pacific Construction Group and China Harbor Engineering Co (CHEC), and telecoms gear giant Huawei Technologies.
Direct investment by Chinese firms in Ukraine totalled $150 million by end-2019, according to Chinese data. In the first three quarters of 2020, Chinese firms invested $75.7 million on projects in Ukraine, according to Ukraine's embassy in China. 
COFCO in 2016 launched a grain terminal at Nikolaev sea port worth of $75 million in southern Ukraine. In 2019, CHEC completed a dredging project at the port of Chornomorsk.
China Pacific Construction Group in 2017 signed a deal to build a metro line in the capital Kyiv and Huawei, which has helped Ukraine to develop its mobile networks, in 2019 won the bid to install the 4G network in Kyiv's subway.
Huawei was chosen in 2020 to help ensure and improve cyber defence and cybersecurity in Ukraine.
In 2021, China Longyuan Power Group Corporation , the country's largest wind power producer, built and put into operation a large wind farm in the city of Yuzhne.
Not every investment has gone smoothly.

Ukraine said last year that it would halt the takeover of a local aircraft engine maker by Chinese aerospace company Skyrizon due to U.S. concerns of forced technology transfers to the Chinese state. 
Power Construction Corp of China also signed a deal to construct an 800 MW wind power plant worth $1 billion with local partners in Donetsk which would be Europe's biggest onshore wind park.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - From Luxembourg to New Zealand, global house prices have been surging as pandemic stimulus and a shift to work from home added fuel to a multi-year boom driven by historically low interest rates.
But whereas authorities from Auckland to Stockholm have shown they can pull monetary and regulatory levers to tame property prices, the euro zone's fragmentation into 19 national markets means the European Central Bank's hands are tied.
Five of the 10 countries worldwide that experienced the biggest increase in house prices in 2020 were in the euro zone, according to International Monetary Fund data.
This is raising concerns at the ECB about a new housing bubble that could wreak economic and financial havoc just as memories of the 2008 crash start to fade.
But the ECB cannot jack up interest rates too fast or far to help some euro zone members because it would hammer the most indebted euro zone countries, such as Italy and Greece, and the central bank is keen to avoid another debt crisis.
Instead, it must rely on often reluctant governments to cool off property markets with so called macro-prudential tools, which also have the benefit of targeting real estate directly rather than the economy at large.
They range from making banks build up extra capital when they make home loans to introducing deeply unpopular caps on the size of mortgages based on the purchase price or the income of the buyer. 
""Especially in the euro zone, with one rate for different countries, macro-prudential tools are much better suited to fighting housing bubbles,"" said Grégory Claeys, a senior fellow at the Bruegel think-tank.
The trouble is the ECB cannot apply these brakes directly and can only issue warnings and recommendations via the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), the European Union's financial stability watchdog.
In the latest such move, the ERSB - which is based inside the ECB and headed by Christine Lagarde - urged Germany and Austria to impose limits on mortgages and raise capital demands for banks.
But its prescriptions are not binding. Germany's finance minister, for example, pushed back on the recommendation to introduce a loan-to-value ratio for home buyers. 
Euro zone house prices are booming - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgpdwambdvo/Pasted%20image%201645601339690.png 
SUCCESS?
History shows this type of regulation can work.
South Korean authorities were able to slow down house price growth by imposing a debt-to-income ratio in the early 2000s.
And Sweden briefly managed to bring down the cost of a dwelling in 2018 by demanding that homeowners repay at least 1% of their loan balance every year if they took mortgages greater than 4.5 times their household income.
""That would have a very strong impact and very fast,"" said Matthias Holzhey, who co-authors UBS's annual Global Real Estate Bubble Index.
Yet it would also require some unpopular choices, like making mortgages all but unaffordable to poorer households.
This is why national regulators in the euro zone, who often include government officials who would pay the electoral price of public backlash, have been dragging their feet.
Germany for example has only just announced plans to apply some brakes, a decade after the start of its housing boom and with house prices already 20%-35% over-valued according to the Bundesbank.
""When you implement tough macroprudential measures, you disturb the party,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG)'s chief economist Joerg Kraemer. ""It requires a very independent position.""
The ESRB said this month that Finland and the Netherlands were not doing enough to curb mortgage lending despite its recommendations. 
""There’s no cost for a politician for not acting,"" said Bruegel's Claeys. ""We need an independent financial stability council that can bite."" 
Mortgage lending is booming - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/myvmnxmlkpr/Mortgage%20lending%20is%20booming.png 
DOUBTS
Yet research shows monetary policy still matters and can either make macro-prudential regulation more effective if it supports it or it can trump if it works in the opposite direction.
That could be the case in the euro zone, some economists say, doubting regulation will make much of a difference as long as mortgage rates remain below inflation, making property investments appealing for households and professional investors alike.
Borrowers were locking in an annual mortgage interest rate of just 1.3% for 10 years in December, according to the latest ECB data, compared to an expected inflation rate of just under 2% over that period.
Commerzbank's Kraemer is one of many economists who expect these negative real yields to persist, blunting the effect of regulatory curbs.
""When rates are too low it’s an uphill struggle,"" he said.
Ireland is a case in point. 
Home prices there rose by 14.4% last year despite tough limits introduced in 2015, which cap mortgages at 3.5 times a borrower's gross annual income. 

With that in mind, some ECB policymakers suggest the central bank should give house prices greater weight when estimating inflation and setting interest rates, as it happens in New Zealand.

""We will look at the (macroeconomic) data, the projections and then we will readjust asset purchases if needed and will see when an interest rate hike can take place,"" De Guindos told a financial event in Madrid.

Earlier on Wednesday, European Central Bank policymaker Robert Holzmann said that the ECB could begin increasing interest rates before ending its bond purchasing programme, challenging the bank's long-held view on the sequence of its upcoming policy moves.
With inflation hitting fresh record highs in recent months, the ECB recently walked back on a pledge not to raise rates this year but has long maintained that ending bond purchases comes first, before any interest rate increase.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Hong Kong will offer tax breaks, handouts and subsidies to small businesses and residents, to mitigate the impact of the most stringent social restrictions imposed in the city to curb the spread of COVID-19, Finance Secretary Paul Chan said.
The 2022/23 budget proposals were announced as hundreds of bars, restaurants and small retailers warned they were months away from closure, and shopping malls were deserted while the city endured its worst COVID-19 outbreak so far.
""Hong Kong is currently experiencing its hardest time in the fight against the epidemic, and we are facing enormous challenges,"" Chan told legislators via videoconference on Wednesday. 
Total spending in 2022/23 was estimated at HK$807.3 billion ($103.47 billion) and revenues were estimated at HK$715.9 billion, returning Hong Kong's budget to a deficit after a HK$18.9 billion surplus in 2021/22.
Hong Kong usually runs balanced budgets or surpluses, since its pegged currency system commits it to fiscal prudence, but still has ample reserves.
Fiscal reserves are estimated at HK$940 billion at the end of the government's current term in June, and are expected to grow above HK$1 trillion in the coming five years.
Chan said ""countercyclical measures"" to support the economy totalled more than HK$170 billion, with spending on anti-epidemic measures put at more than HK$54 billion.
The global financial hub has doubled down on its ""dynamic zero COVID"" strategy, which aims to eradicate all outbreaks, following mainland China's lead even as the rest of the world adjusts towards ""living with the virus.""
Given the city is facing thousands of infections a day and the numbers are growing, some analysts predict at least one or two quarters of economic contraction after recovering last year from the city's most prolonged recession in 2019-2020.
Bars, gyms, beauty parlours and 12 other types of venues are closed, while restaurants cannot operate beyond 6.00 pm. Apart from grocery stores, most shops are deserted as residents are back working from home. The border is virtually shut with the finance sector complaining this has caused an exodus of talent and made operating a regional hub out of Hong Kong difficult.
The restrictions will last until at least April 20.
TAX CUTS
The budget measures include a 100% reduction in salaries tax, capped at HK$10,000, handouts of HK$10,000 consumption vouchers, financial aid for the unemployed, and subsidies for directly impacted businesses.
Residents will get tax deductions related to rent payments, as well as subsidies for transport and utilities.
A 100% reduction in profits tax capped at HK$10,000 is expected to benefit 151,000 firms, Chan said. In addition, the government will help companies with loan guarantees, export financing, and debt repayment holidays.
New legislation will be introduced to prevent landlords from terminating rents of struggling firms for up to six months.
Funds worth HK$1.26 billion will be given to firms in the tourism industry, reeling from two years of inactivity with no near-term prospects of recovery.
Hang Seng Bank Chief Economist Thomas Shik said the measures will ease pressure on the economy in coming months but he might still cut his 3.3% growth forecast for 2022.
""We are reviewing the situation .. given the impact of Omicron as well as the uncertainty from external factors,"" Shik said.
The ""anti-epidemic"" measures include HK$22 billion to boost COVID-19 testing capacity, HK$6 billion for vaccines, and HK$12 billion to build more health facilities, among others.
Hong Kong's economy is expected to grow 2.0% to 3.5% this year after expanding 6.4% in 2021, Chan said, adding the forecast takes into account a recovery in the second part of the year once the epidemic is brought under control.

""The successful control of the epidemic is the key to safeguarding our economy and people's livelihood,"" Chan said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will offer only new series of OFZ government bonds and stop offering existing series of debt, the finance ministry said on Wednesday, after the United States prohibited buying Russian government bonds issued after March 1.
The U.S. government slapped restrictions on trading of Russian government debt on Tuesday in a bid to punish Moscow for ratcheting up its conflict with Ukraine, extending its existing sanctions on buying of Russian debt to the secondary market.
Addressing the new sanctions, the Russian finance ministry said it would offer only new series of OFZ bonds starting from Feb. 22 and stop offering OFZ bonds registered before this date.
The decision was made ""in order to lower risks of forced selling of circulating state securities by particular categories of foreign investors,"" the ministry said in a statement.
The new sanctions did not ban U.S. entities from holding Russian OFZ bonds they had purchased previously.
The ministry said it was flexible with borrowing as it had enough free funds in the amount of more than 4.5 trillion roubles ($56.7 billion) on its treasury account, more than double the 2022 net borrowing plan.
Russian OFZ bonds fell further after the sanctions, with yields on 10-year OFZ bonds, which move inversely to prices, hitting their highest since early 2016.
OFZ bonds are designed to plug budget holes but Russia has no urgent need in borrowing and runs a record high current account surplus thanks to high prices for oil and gas, its main export.
The finance ministry cancelled weekly auctions of OFZ bonds this week as the Russian market took a hit from President Vladimir Putin's decision to recognise two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, a move condemned by the majority of countries.
On Wednesday, the finance ministry said it would study the market situation when deciding on the resumption of auctions and would tend to offer more instruments with shorter tenors and thus a lower percentage risk.
OFZ bonds used to be popular among foreign investors due to their relatively high yields but non-residents have cut exposure to Russia in recent months as geopolitical tensions increased.
U.S. financial institutions were already barred from buying rouble-denominated Russian sovereign bonds directly from Russia, in addition to sanctions that banned them from buying non-rouble sovereign bonds.
The finance ministry said it was monitoring the financial market situation together with the central bank, adding they both were ready to take extra measures to beef up financial stability.

The central bank has said it is ready to take all necessary measures to support financial stability, as Russian assets were hammered after Putin ordered the deployment of troops to two breakaway regions in Ukraine.

LONDON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund told the Bank of England on Wednesday to be clear about its plans to withdraw stimulus for Britain's economy, following criticism of the central bank's communications in recent months.
In an annual review, the IMF said high inflation and Brexit could hurt growth in Britain in the years ahead.
While IMF directors backed the BoE's decision to raise interest rates in December and February and start winding down its 895 billion pounds ($1.22 trillion) quantitative easing programme, they had some communications advice for the BoE.
""They supported moving the policy toward a more neutral setting while emphasizing that the pace of the policy withdrawal should weigh the risks to inflation and growth,"" the IMF directors said in their report.
""In this regard, they emphasized that predictability and clear communications about forward guidance would improve policy effectiveness.""
The advice comes after some investors and economists accused the BoE of mixed messaging, after it wrong-footed people who expected a rate hike in November and then raised borrowing costs in December.
The IMF noted that the BoE's actions had caused ""turbulence in markets and some surprises"".
Before December's rate rise, the IMF had advised the BoE to avoid an ""inaction bias"" on policy but said it would need to communicate carefully with markets to prepare them for faster rate rises.
Financial markets currently expect BoE rates to hit nearly 2% by the end of this year - much higher than BoE forecasts this month implied would be necessary to tame inflation. 
In contrast to BoE Governor Andrew Bailey's suggestion last month that the central bank could scale back its guidance further, the IMF advised the reverse on Wednesday.
""Clearly communicated forward guidance would have an important role to play in limiting the proliferation of second-round effects,"" the IMF said, referring to the possibility that high inflation becomes engrained in expectations.
Inflation looked set to peak at around 7% in the coming months and looked set to return to the BoE's 2% target midway through 2024, the IMF said.
It stuck to its growth forecasts published in January, with the economy set to grow 4.7% this year and 2.3% next year - slightly more optimistic than the consensus of economists polled by Reuters. [ECILT/GB]
But the IMF said there were big risks to growth in coming years.
""In the medium term, it may prove difficult to return to the inflation target without a period of compressed incomes and below-average growth,"" the IMF said.
""Meanwhile, trade problems with the EU and higher domestic adjustment costs to structural transformations may increase scarring and even reduce potential growth.""
With energy bills set to rise by more than half in April, the IMF urged the government not to stand in the way of price rises but to ramp up support for the worst affected households.
On the government's keystone 'Levelling Up' policy to reduce regional inequalities, the IMF saw room for greater ambition, although it said this would need to come from taxes on high earners and the wealthy.

In response, the British government told the IMF it thought current spending plans would be enough.

Investing.com -- Western powers have responded to Russia’s move into eastern Ukraine by levying sanctions, but stocks are set to open higher with investors responding positively to the measured nature of the response. Eurozone inflation remains elevated, meaning the European Central Bank will soon join the Bank of England in having difficult monetary policy decisions to make. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 23rd February. 
1. Limited Western sanctions 
The West has responded to Russian troops entering eastern Ukraine, after Russian President Vladimir Putin officially recognized two regions as independent republics, by levying sanctions targeting Russian banks as well as members of Russia’s elite with close ties to the Kremlin.
However, they fall well short of the severe economy-crippling measures the U.S. and its allies had promised if Russia was to enter Ukraine.
By holding back, the West is trying to maintain leverage over Moscow in an attempt to prevent an invasion of the whole of Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv. 
However, it could also be seen as a sign of weakness amid concerns over whether the global economy will be able to cope with surging energy prices as well as rising interest rates, creating the potential for stagflation.
2. British monetary policy challenges
The extent of the difficulties the Bank of England is currently facing was laid bare by the central bank’s Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent in an annual report to Parliament Wednesday.
""This is the most challenging period for monetary policy since inflation targeting began in 1992,"" he stated.
The BOE raised interest rates to 0.5% this month from 0.25%, its second hike in the last two meetings, and investors are pricing in another rate hike at the bank's next scheduled meeting in mid-March.
Broadbent said there was no guarantee that the inflationary impact of rising import prices would fade quickly.
This view was matched by Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden, speaking at the National Farmers' Union annual conference on Tuesday.
""Some further modest tightening in monetary policy is likely to be appropriate in the coming months,"" Ramsden said, but “new shocks can arise - we did not foresee the recent rise in energy prices, and as we meet today the crisis in Ukraine is intensifying - and so we should remain humble about the possibility that things might turn out differently.""
3. Stocks set to open higher; S&P to bounce from correction territory
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher later, rebounding after recent hefty losses as investors take a more sanguine view of events in Eastern Europe.
By 6:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 210 points, or 0.6%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.7% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1%.
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped almost 500 points, or 1.4%, on Tuesday, its fourth consecutive losing session. The broad-based S&P 500 fell 1%, resulting in the index dropping into correction territory, more than 10% below its record close in early January. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.2%, also its fourth straight negative session.
There are no major economic data releases due Wednesday, but there is likely to be a lot of focus on the auctions of $35 billion of 119-day bills, $53 billion of 5-year notes, and $22 billion of 2-year floating-rate notes given the uncertain geopolitical situation.
Stocks in focus Wednesday include cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), which beat expectations with its second quarter earnings released late Tuesday, and Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE), after the space company reported a smaller-than-expected fourth quarter loss.
4. Eurozone inflation puts focus on March ECB meeting
Eurozone inflation remained highly elevated in January, with the annual CPI figure confirmed at 5.1%, a gain of 0.3% on the month. This raises the pressure on the European Central Bank to rein in monetary policy that still includes a bond-buying program.
The ECB is widely expected, when it next meets in March, to signal an end to bond purchases in the third quarter, opening the door to a rate hike before the close of the year.
However, ECB policymaker Robert Holzmann challenged that sequence by saying in a press interview that the central bank could begin increasing interest rates before ending its asset purchasing scheme.
The head of Austria's central bank is one of the more hawkish members of the ECB’s governing council, but his comments bring the meeting on March 10 firmly into focus.
5. Crude retreats from seven-year highs
Crude oil prices handed back some of the previous session's gains Wednesday, falling from seven-year highs as the West stopped short of targeting Russia’s energy market while levying sanctions on Moscow for sending troops into eastern Ukraine.
“Sanctions announced up until now should not have much impact on Russian oil exports,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Local banks which are heavily involved within the commodities industry have been left untouched.”
At the same time, Western powers and Iran appear to be close to reviving a nuclear agreement, which in return for Tehran limiting its nuclear ambitions would result in the Persian Gulf country’s crude exports returning to the global market.
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later Wednesday after the holiday weekend. Last week, the industry-funded body reported a draw of just over one million barrels.
By 6:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 0.9% at $91.12 a barrel, while Brent crude futures were down 0.7% at $93.16 a barrel, having climbed to their highest level since September 2014 on Tuesday. 
Gasoline RBOB Futures were down 0.3% at $2.8472 a gallon.",,,,,

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -The cost of raising a child in China stands at nearly seven times its per capita GDP, far more than in the United States and Japan, highlighting the challenges facing Chinese policymakers as they try to tackle rapidly declining birth rates, new research showed.
Experts warn China's ageing population will put huge pressure on its health and social security system, while a dwindling workforce could also severely limit growth for the world's second largest economy in the coming decades. 
Although new policies allow families to have as many as three children, China's birth rate dropped to 7.52 births per 1,000 people in 2021, the lowest since the National Bureau of Statistics began recording the data in 1949.
The sky-high costs of child-rearing have helped prompt a crackdown by Beijing on the private tutoring industry while some regions have been giving couples cash for having a second or third child.
Beijing-based YuWa Population Research Institute said in a report published on Tuesday that the average cost of raising a child to the age of 18 in China in 2019 stood at 485,000 yuan ($76,629) for a first child, 6.9 times China's per capita GDP that year. 
China ranks second highest among the 13 countries included in the study, behind only South Korea, which has the lowest birth rate in the world. The U.S. figure, based on 2015 data, stood at 4.11 times per capita GDP while Japan's figure, based on 2010 data stood at 4.26.
Child rearing costs are even higher in China's major cities, reaching more than 1 million yuan in Shanghai and 969,000 yuan in Beijing. Birth rates in the two cities are even lower than the national average.
One mother, writing under the username ""Maning"" on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) microblog site, said she believed child-rearing costs in Beijing were probably even higher than the report suggested.
""With such calculations, I can barely imagine a second child and any family that wants a third is just amazing,"" she said. 
YuWa warned the declining birth rate would ""profoundly affect"" China's economic growth potential, its ability to innovate and its welfare burden.
China would need to spend at least 5% of its annual GDP to create incentives for couples to have more children, including education subsidies, preferential mortgage rates, tax breaks, equal paternity and maternity leave, as well as the construction of more childcare centres, it added.
On Weibo, another user writing under the name Lawyer Zhang, said that action needed to be taken to address the disproportionate burden faced by women, who are expected to give birth and raise children as part of their natural ""motherhood"".

""That's why the cost of childbirth is mostly borne by women, making women live in an unfair competitive environment for a long time.""

The Ukraine crisis may be tempering the most aggressive rate hike bets but New Zealand's latest interest rate rise suggests central banks remain firmly on the path towards tighter policy. 
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Wednesday delivered its third straight rate increase, taking key policy rates to 1%. And it signalled a more aggressive tightening path to counter inflation, lifting the Kiwi dollar to a one-month high.
It also revealed plans to wind down its NZ$50 billion ($33.82 billion) bond holdings.

Still, tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine do complicate the outlook for policy, especially at the ECB. Germany's decision to put Nord Stream 2 certification on hold sent European natural gas futures sharply higher.

805,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 02:52AM ET</span>",,,,,,"ZURICH (Reuters) -The European Central Bank could begin increasing interest rates before ending its bond purchasing programme, ECB policymaker Robert Holzmann said, challenging the bank's long-held view on the sequence of its upcoming policy moves.
With inflation hitting fresh record highs in recent months, the ECB recently walked back on a pledge not to raise rates this year but has long maintained that ending bond purchases comes first, before any interest rate increase. 
This stance on ""sequencing"" has not been challenged so far and all policymakers speaking in public have accepted the order, focusing their discussion on when bond purchases, known as quantitative easing, should end.
""When it comes to the interest rate outlook, the ECB has always signalled that an interest rate hike should not take place until shortly after the bond purchases have ended,"" Holzmann said in an interview with Swiss newspaper NZZ.
""But it would also be possible to take a first interest rate step in the summer before the end of the purchases and a second at the end of the year. I would favour that,"" the hawkish head of Austria's central bank said in remarks published on Wednesday. 
The argument in favour of the ECB's sequencing is that a rate hike before the end of bond buys would mean the ECB is stepping on both the accelerator and the brake at the same time.
It would also flatten the yield curve, hurting bank profitability, as they utilize the gap between short and long-term borrowing costs.
The ECB will next meet on March 10 and economists expect the sequencing to be upheld. Policymakers are also expected to signal an end to bond purchases in the third quarter, opening the door to a rate hike before the close of the year.
Calling an exit from the negative interest rate era an ""important signal"" to society and markets, Holzmann said he would like to see two interest rate increases by end-2022 or early 2023.
""Some of my colleagues would perhaps be even more progressive here, while others would be more cautious,"" Holzmann said.
He said a policy rate of around 1.5% would be a benchmark for neutral monetary policy. 
""I think that a key interest rate of very roughly 1.5% in 2024 could be realistic, although that may well shift forward or backward somewhat,"" he said.

ECB policymakers will meet in an informal gathering in Paris on Thursday and hold their next policy meeting on March 10.
Economists polled by Reuters now expect policymakers to end bond purchases in the third quarter of the year while the first rate hike could come in either the third or fourth quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is poised to unleash a wider array of sanctions against Russia if Moscow escalates the conflict in Ukraine, denying key Russian financial institutions and companies access to U.S. dollar transactions and global markets for trade, energy exports and financing.
But the United States and its allies have never before attempted to cut a $1.5 trillion economy out of global commerce, and it is unclear how much pressure even unified Western sanctions can put on Moscow.
A review of World Bank and United Nations trade data shows that since lesser sanctions were imposed in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea, China has emerged as its biggest export destination.
New sanctions could prompt Russia to try to deepen its non-dollar denominated trade ties with Beijing in an effort to skirt the restrictions, said Harry Broadman, a former U.S. trade negotiator and World Bank official with China and Russia experience.
""The problem with sanctions, especially involving an oil producer, which is what Russia is, will be leakage in the system,"" Broadman said. ""China may say, 'We're going to buy oil on the open market and if it's Russian oil, so be it.'""

Under an executive order signed by President Joe Biden on Monday, any institution in Russia's financial services sector is a target for further sanctions, the White House said, noting that more than 80% of Russia's daily foreign exchange transactions and half its trade are conducted in dollars.
Biden, in announcing an initial raft of sanctions on Tuesday to penalize Russia for ordering troops into two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, said he would ""take robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy, not ours.""
That may be easier said than done, with Russia among the world's top exporters of oil, natural gas, copper, aluminum, palladium and other important commodities. Oil prices hit new highs not seen since 2014 on Tuesday.
Russia accounted for 1.9% of global trade in 2020, down from 2.8% in 2013, according to the World Bank data. Its 2020 GDP 11th globally, between Brazil and South Korea.
A review of Russian trade data in the World Bank's World International Trade Solution database shows that Russia's dependence on trade has declined over the past 20 years.

Russia's export destinations have changed as well. The Netherlands was the top export destination a decade ago, due to oil trade, but it has been supplanted in that role by China. Germany and Britain's purchases from Russia have held largely steady, while Belarus' imports have risen.
China remains Russia's top supplier of imports, with mobile phones, computers, telecommunications gear, toys, textiles, clothing and electronics parts among top categories. Its share of Russian imports has risen since 2014, while those from Germany have declined markedly. Ukraine's exports to China fell markedly over the past decade, while Belarus' shipments have changed little.
Ukraine's top exports to Russia in 2020 were aluminum oxide, railway equipment, coal, steel and uranium, according to the World Bank data.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. government broadened restrictions on trading of Russian government debt on Tuesday in a bid to punish Moscow for ratcheting up its conflict with Ukraine, a move that analysts said might have a moderate impact near-term but could be a step toward harsher measures.
The U.S. Treasury said it was prohibiting participation in the secondary market for bonds issued after March 1.
The increased restrictions on dealings in Russia's sovereign debt are aimed at ""further cutting Russia off from sources of revenue to fund its government or President Putin's priorities, including his further invasion into Ukraine,"" it said in a statement. 
The new restrictions followed Russia ordering troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine. Western countries have threatened to go further if Moscow launches an all-out invasion of its neighbor.
""The message from the U.S. is clear, we don't want you to hold Russian assets,"" said Tim Ash, senior EM sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. ""'Get out now' is the clear-cut message.""
U.S. investors have been banned from buying new dollar-denominated Russian debt since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. U.S. banks have also been barred from taking part in the primary market for non-rouble sovereign bonds since 2019.
Last year, Biden also barred U.S. financial institutions from taking part in the primary market for rouble-denominated Russian sovereign bonds.
""So we have primary and secondary new issue rouble and dollar debt sanctioned,"" said Ash. ""The next logical step if Russia invades full-scale is sanctioning existing issues secondary."" 
Biden said that Russia would pay an even steeper price if it continued its aggression.
The latest measures on the rouble debt known by their Russian abbreviation, OFZ, could further stress the bonds. Yields on the 10-year benchmark broke through the 10% watershed last week and are currently at almost 11% - a six year high. 
Russian dollar bonds extended their losses a little after the announcement of U.S. sanctions, while the premium demanded by investors to hold Russian debt over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries blew out to 329 basis points, the widest since the COVID market rout in spring 2020. 
The impact of curbs on secondary trading has been played down in Moscow. Andrey Kostin, head of state bank VTB, said in November that U.S. sanctions on Russia's secondary OFZ treasury bond market would not be a ""serious threat"" for the country's financial stability as state banks are much bigger holders of the bonds than U.S. investors. 
According to a research note by analysts at VTB on Monday, the foreign share of OFZ holdings was 18%. 
Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, said the sanctions on sovereign debt were likely to have a limited economic impact. 
""Russia’s fiscal position is in surplus and Russian authorities are overfunding,"" Ribakova said. 
Ribakova said total foreign ownership of Russian debt was about $64 billion, and Russia’s reserves are in excess of $630 billion, while Russian banks have a surplus liquidity of about $11 billion that they could use to buy OFZ as foreign investors exit.
""However, the U.S. administration has clearly signaled further sanctions are possible, and this is only the first tranche of U.S. sanctions in coordination with its partners,"" Ribakova added. 
Ratings agency Fitch said this month that while secondary market sanctions would hamper Russia's fiscal financing flexibility and foreign investment in the country, this would not significantly impact macro stability thanks to ample reserves and buffers. 

Still, a ban on secondary trading of new OFZs and new sovereign Eurobonds - especially if extended to non-U.S. people - ""could have a material impact on yields,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Jahangir Aziz wrote in a research note ahead of the announcement.
""Although Russia's financing needs are low, at around 1.5% of GDP, this would increase government financing costs and the risk premia for the private sector,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden said on Tuesday the United States was imposing a first tranche of sanctions against Russia for launching an invasion of Ukraine and promised that more would come if there are further incursions. 
Biden, speaking to reporters at the White House, said the United States would impose sanctions against two large Russian financial institutions and Russian sovereign debt. Sanctions were imposed against Russian elites and their family members as well, administration officials said.
President Vladimir Putin on Monday told Russia's defense ministry to deploy what he called peacekeeping forces into two breakaway regions of Ukraine after recognizing them as independent, raising fears of imminent war in Europe.
""This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" Biden said. ""Russia has now undeniably moved against Ukraine by declaring these independent states.""
The United States had promised severe sanctions against Russia if it invaded Ukraine, which the White House previously defined as any movement of troops across the border.
The United States deployed its most powerful sanctioning tool, placing Russian elites and two banks on the Specially Designated Nationals list, effectively kicking them out of the U.S. banking system, banning them from trading with Americans, and freezing their U.S. assets.
Biden said the sanctions in the initial tranche applied to VEB bank and Russia's military bank - Promsvyazbank, which does defense deals. He said the sanctions against Russia's sovereign debt meant the Russian government would be cut off from Western financing.
""As Russia contemplates its next move, we have our next move prepared as well,"" Biden said. ""Russia will pay an even steeper price if it continues its aggression, including additional sanctions.""
Putin did not watch Biden's speech and Russia will first look at what the United States has outlined before responding, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, cited by Russian news agencies.
Biden said the United States would continue to provide ""defensive assistance"" to Ukraine but had no intention of fighting Russia. He said he authorized additional movements of U.S. forces already stationed in Europe to strengthen Baltic allies Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Biden, who is facing concerns at home about inflation and high energy prices, said his administration was closely monitoring energy supplies for disruptions and working on a ""collective investment to secure stability and global energy supplies"" with major oil producers and consumers.
""This will blunt gas prices. I want to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me,"" he said.
SANCTIONS TRIGGERED
On Monday a senior administration official said Russia sending troops to the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine did not represent a further invasion because Russia had troops there previously. But on Tuesday, White House officials changed their language to say an invasion had begun.
Washington slapped sanctions on VEB and Promsvyazbank Public Joint Stock Company, as well as 42 of their subsidiaries, accusing the two banks of being ""state-owned institutions that play specific roles to prop up Russia's defense capability and its economy.""
The sanctions on the banks come on top of designations of Russian ""elites"" the Treasury Department accused of being close to Putin, including Aleksandr Bortnikov, director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), and Petr Fradkov, the chairman and chief executive of Promsvyazbank Public Joint Stock Company.
Also hit with sanctions was Sergei Kiriyenko, a former prime minister of Russia.
""They share in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies and should share in the pain as well,"" Biden said of Russian elites.
Brian O'Toole, a former Treasury Department official now with the Atlantic Council, said Tuesday's sanctions will have impact, but questioned whether it would be immediate enough.
""I think the risk they run by not going after a big state-owned commercial bank is that Putin thinks that the West is not going to be willing to bear the pain of big economic sanctions, and therefore that he can safely expand his ambitions,"" he said.
Russia's Sberbank and VTB would face American sanctions if Moscow proceeds with its invasion of Ukraine, a senior U.S. administration official told reporters. 

The official also said Russian elites not sanctioned on Tuesday should be on notice and noted that the Biden administration was fully prepared to implement export control measures with a large number of countries if Russia invades further.
""Further Russian assault into Ukraine remains a severe threat in the days ahead,"" Biden said. ""The United States and our allies and partners remain open to diplomacy if it is serious.""

WELLINGTON (Reuters) -New Zealand's central bank delivered a third straight interest rate hike on Wednesday that took borrowing costs back to pre-pandemic levels and signalled a more aggressive tightening path to counter rising inflation.
All but one of the 20 economists in a Reuters poll predicted the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) 25-basis point hike in the official cash rate (OCR) to 1.0%. One poll respondent expected a 50-basis point hike.
While markets had priced in the 25-basis point hike, the bank's forecast for a higher peak in the tightening cycle sounded a hawkish signal that sent the New Zealand dollar soaring.
The RBNZ also revealed plans to wind down its NZ$50 billion ($33.82 billion) bond holdings acquired under the Large Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) programme, through both bond maturities and managed sales.
The RBNZ said it would not reinvest the proceeds of the maturing bonds and that it plans to reduce the such holdings at a pace of $5 billion a year.
ANZ Bank chief economist for New Zealand Sharon Zollner said RBNZ's tone was hawkish with downside risks to growth getting a lot less airplay than upside risks to inflation.
""Headwinds for economic activity are clear, but the OCR nonetheless needs to be raised in a pretty relentless fashion if the credibility of the inflation target is to be maintained,"" Zollner said in a note. ""Buckle (NYSE:BKE) up; it could be a rough ride.""
The central bank lifted the projected OCR track to 3.35% by the end of 2024, much higher than the 2.6% endpoint prediction released in November.
Markets now see rates reaching 2.5% by year end, up from 2.25% previously, while two-year swap rates surged 12 basis points to 2.695% and heights last visited in early 2016. [RBNZWATCH]
CLOSE CALL
The RBNZ said it came close to moving ahead with a 50 basis point hike, and at a news conference later Governor Adrian Orr did not rule it out in the future, highlighting the need for rates to rise significantly.
""We will not rule out larger moves in the future... but it is a function of how the markets respond,"" Orr said.
In a record of the meeting, the committee noted that a 50-basis point OCR move was strongly considered and members saw this as a ""finely balanced decision.""
The RBNZ hiked rates at its last two meetings and signalled further tightening as it looked to cool a heated economy.
Global supply constraints pushed New Zealand's inflation to 5.9%, almost double the top of the bank's 1-3% target range, while the jobless rate has hit a record low of 3.2%. House prices have also soared to historic highs.

But uncertainties remain over the outlook as the Omicron variant spreads more rapidly through New Zealand and the market braces for any global economic fallout from potential conflict in the Ukraine.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's economy would continue to recover in 2022, but a rebound would remain fragile and uneven, as an Omicron outbreak puts less pressure on activity than earlier COVID-19 waves, according to minutes of the central bank's last policy meeting.
While upside inflationary risks had increased and headline inflation could exceed the upper side of the target range of 3% in early 2022, the risks of persistent increases in inflation remained low, the minutes https://www.bot.or.th/English/MonetaryPolicy/MonetPolicyComittee/ReportMPC/Minutes/MPC_Minutes_12022_9ylhzvxs.pdf published on Wednesday said.
On Feb 9, the Bank of Thailand (BOT)'s monetary policy committee unanimously voted to leave the benchmark interest rate at a record low for a 14th straight meeting, maintaining support for a fragile economy.
""The Thai economy would continue to recover, but the recovery would remain uneven across sectors and would take time to return to the pre-pandemic levels,"" the minutes said.
The BOT forecast Southeast Asia's second-largest economy would expand 3.4% this year, after 1.6% growth in 2021, which was among the slowest growth rates in the region.
It will next review monetary policy and economic forecasts on March 30. Most economists see no policy change through 2022.
According to the minutes, the central bank would continue to put emphasis on the economic recovery and that government measures and policy coordination would be critical.

The baht remained volatile and financial market could see more volatility ahead due to factors including faster-than-expected rate hikes by many central banks, the minutes said. 
""Monetary policy divergence could lead to volatilities in exchange rates and capital flows. However, the impact on Thailand’s financial markets was judged to be manageable due to strength on the external stability front,"" the minutes said.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) -The Indian government may hold more debt auctions after its last scheduled tender for the fiscal year on Friday, two people familiar with the matter said, to take advantage of the relatively low cost of borrowing.
The government had cancelled its last two weekly debt sales, each worth 240 billion rupees ($3.2 billion), as global yields surged and it had achieved a comfortable cash balance for the fiscal year ending on March 31.
But in a move that surprised markets, the government said on Monday it would borrow 230 billion rupees at the last bond sale for the current fiscal year on Feb. 25.
The sources said that while the government had a comfortable cash position even without further auctions, it would consider completing its planned borrowing if market conditions were appropriate.
""(We) will not commit if this would be our last borrowing for the year. We are watching the yields and will take a call accordingly,"" a senior official directly involved in the matter told Reuters.
A second source said that for the government to borrow now would allow it to take exploit such lower yields.
The sources sought anonymity because the discussions were private.
The 10-year benchmark yield hit a 2-1/2-year high of 6.95% after the government announced record borrowing of 14.95 trillion rupees for 2022/23 in the Feb. 1 federal budget.
The yield, however, has retraced almost all its post-budget gains after the auction cancellations, to stand at 6.73% by 0648 GMT.
The finance ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. 
India's 10-year benchmark 6.54% bond moved up to 98.43 rupees, yielding 6.76% after the Reuters report, versus 98.90 rupees, and a yield of 6.69% on Monday. [IN/] 
Although the government cited a comfortable cash balance as the official reason for the cancelled auctions, sources had told Reuters at the time that officials were concerned about the sharp market reaction to the announced borrowing plan.
Traders warned new auctions could keep pushing yields higher.
""The belief is that we are done with the borrowing for this year. If the government decides to borrow towards the cancelled auctions later, it will lead to a lot of pressure on bonds, especially in the current geopolitical backdrop,"" said a senior trader at a foreign bank.

""If we have more auctions this year, yields will likely climb back to 6.95% levels,"" said a trader at a private bank.

(Reuters) -The United States and its allies are coordinating new sanctions on Russia after Moscow recognised two regions in eastern Ukraine as independent, officials said.
Details have started to emerge on the steps taken or planned by the United States, European Union, Britain and other Western powers.
Below are details on the curbs proposed so far and what other sanctions could target Russia: 
BANKS & FINANCIAL FIRMS
Britain announced sanctions on five banks - Bank Rossiya, Black Sea Bank, Genbank, IS Bank and Promsvyazbank - all are smaller lenders, with only Promsvyazbank on the central bank's list of systematically important lenders.
U.S. President Joe Biden announced sanctions on VEB bank and Russia's military bank, referring to Promsvyazbank, which does defence deals. The Treasury Department said: ""All assets under U.S. jurisdiction will be immediately frozen and U.S. individuals and entities are prohibited from doing business.""
A senior U.S. administration official added that Sberbank, and VTB Bank would face sanctions if the Russian invasion proceeds.
Bank Rossiya is already under U.S. sanctions from 2014 for its close ties to Kremlin officials. 
The European Union has agreed to blacklist banks involved in financing separatist activities in eastern Ukraine. 
Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system, meaning sanctions could be felt far beyond its borders. Data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) shows that European lenders hold the lion's share of the nearly $30 billion in foreign banks' exposure to Russia.
According to data from Russia's central bank, total Russian banking foreign assets and liabilities stood at $200.6 billion and $134.5 billion respectively with the U.S. dollar share amounting to around 53% of both, down from 76%-81% two decades ago. 
SOVEREIGN DEBT & CAPITAL MARKETS
The package of measures from the EU will ""target the ability of the Russian state and government to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services, to limit the financing of escalatory and aggressive policies,"" according to a statement by the bloc.
It will ban EU investors from trading in Russian state bonds. 
The United States also increased restrictions on dealings in Russia's sovereign debt. Americans, who had already been barred from investing in Russian sovereign debt directly, will now also be banned from purchasing it in the secondary market after March 1.
Britain threatened last week to block Russian companies from raising capital in London, Europe's financial centre for such transactions, though has stopped short of doing so in its announcements on Tuesday. 
Even before the latest events, access to Russian bonds had become increasingly restricted. 
U.S. sanctions imposed in 2015 made future Russian dollar debt ineligible for many investors and key indexes. In April 2021, Biden barred U.S. investors from buying new Russian rouble bonds over accusations of Russian meddling in the U.S. election. 
The curbs have cut Russia's external debt by 33% since early 2014 - from $733 billion to $489 billion in the third quarter of 2021. Lower debt improves a country's balance sheet on the surface, but deprives it of financing sources that could contribute to economic growth and development.
INDIVIDUALS
Sanctioning persons via asset freezes and travel bans is a commonly used tool and the United States, the EU and Britain already have such sanctions in place against a number of Russian individuals. 
The EU on Monday imposed sanctions on five people who were involved in a Russian parliamentary election in annexed Crimea in September 2021.
On Tuesday, the bloc said it would blacklist all lawmakers in the lower house of the Russian parliament who voted in favour of the recognition of the breakaway regions, freeze any assets they have in the EU and ban them from travelling to the bloc. 
Meanwhile Britain has imposed sanctions on three men, Gennady Timchenko and billionaires Igor and Boris Rotenberg - all of whom are allies of President Vladimir Putin from St. Petersburg whose personal fortunes grew precipitously following Putin’s rise to the presidency. All three men are already sanctioned by the United States. 
The United States also imposed sanctions on Tuesday against Russian elites close to Putin. 
Those hit by sanctions include Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the Federal Security Service, Russia’s powerful domestic security and counterintelligence service.
His son, Denis Bortnikov, the deputy president of Russian-state owned financial institution VTB Bank Public Joint Stock Company and a chairman of the bank's management company, was also targeted in Tuesday's move.
Also designated was Putin’s first deputy chief of staff and former Russian Prime Minister, Sergei Kiriyenko. He was previously targeted by the United States, EU and Britain in response to the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. His son, Vladimir Kiriyenko, was also designated Tuesday.
The chairman and chief executive of Promsvyazbank was also targeted. The Treasury accused Petr Fradkov of working to transform the bank into one that serves the defense industry.
While the United States has used the SDN designation in the past to sanction oligarchs deemed to be ""bad actors,"" it has become more cautious in recent years after 2018 sanctions on the owner of Rusal saw aluminium prices skyrocket and forced Washington to backtrack. 
A bill unveiled by U.S. Senate Democrats in January aimed for sweeping sanctions against top Russian government and military officials, including Putin, and President Biden has said he would be ready to consider personal sanctions on the Russian president.
Moscow has said any move to impose sanctions on Putin himself would not harm the Russian president personally but would prove ""politically destructive.""
ENERGY CORPORATES & NORD STREAM 2
The United States and the EU already have sanctions in place on Russia's energy and defence sectors, with state-owned gas company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), its oil arm Gazpromneft and oil producers Lukoil, Rosneft and Surgutneftegaz facing various types of curbs on exports/imports and debt-raising. 
Sanctions could be widened and deepened, with one possible option being to prevent companies settling in U.S. dollars. 
Nord Stream 2, a recently completed pipeline from Russia to Germany, was awaiting regulatory approval by EU and German authorities before Berlin put its certification on ice. 
Europe's dependence on Russian energy supplies weakens the West's hand when considering sanctions in this sector. 
CURBING CHIPS 
The White House has told the U.S. chip industry to be ready for new restrictions on exports to Russia if Moscow attacks Ukraine, including potentially blocking Russia's access to global electronics supplies.
Similar measures were deployed during the Cold War, when sanctions kept the Soviet Union technologically backward and crimped economic growth.
SWITCHING OFF SWIFT 
One of the harshest measures would be to disconnect the Russian financial system from SWIFT, which handles international financial transfers and is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries.
A senior U.S. official said they are not taking SWIFT sanctions off the table. 
In 2012, SWIFT disconnected Iranian banks as international sanctions tightened against Tehran over its nuclear programme. Iran lost half its oil export revenue and 30% of its foreign trade, the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank said.
Among Western countries, the United States and Germany would stand to lose the most from such a move, as their banks are the most frequent SWIFT users with Russian banks, said Maria Shagina at the Carnegie Moscow Center.

Calls to cut Russia's SWIFT access were mooted in 2014 when Moscow annexed Crimea, prompting Moscow to develop an alternative messaging system, SPFS. 
The number of messages sent via SPFS was about one-fifth of Russian internal traffic in 2020, according to the central bank, which aims to increase this to 30% in 2023. However, SPFS has struggled to establish itself in international transactions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday touted progress by government and private industry to boost American production of minerals used to make electric vehicles and other renewable energy products, but stressed that new mines must benefit host communities and not damage the environment.
Washington has grown increasingly concerned that low U.S. production of minerals essential for the construction of future technologies could leave it beholden to China and other nations that have heavily invested in mining. 
That has sparked a range of attempts by Biden, as well as his predecessors, to boost U.S. output of lithium, rare earths and other strategic minerals while balancing opposition from environmental and indigenous groups.
""We can't build a future that's made in America if we ourselves are dependent on China for the materials that power the products of today and tomorrow,"" Biden said at a White House event.
Even still, the president emphasized he would not support new U.S. mines unless ""the historical injustices that too many mining operations have left behind"" are avoided. 
""Environmental protections are paramount,"" said Biden. ""We have to ensure that these resources actually benefit folks in the communities where they live, not just shareholders.""
Biden, who spoke just after outlining the latest U.S. response to Russian aggression against Ukraine, was joined virtually by industry and labor leaders, as well as California Governor Gavin Newsom. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and national climate adviser Gina McCarthy joined in person.

To address environmental concerns, the White House said it would form a committee to recommend changes to the 1872 Mining Law, which has governed hard rock mining across much of the United States since the 19th Century.
Biden also announced a $35 million grant from the U.S. Defense Department to MP Materials Inc to process rare earths, which are used to make magnets found in consumer goods and weapons. 
The Pentagon has already awarded roughly $10 million to MP, which controls the only U.S. rare earths mine but depends on China for processing. 
The Las Vegas-based company said it will invest $700 million of its own funds and create more than 350 jobs by 2024. The company has said it aims to begin processing rare earths in California by the end of the year.
Jim Litinsky, MP's chief executive, told Biden the investments will help the company produce enough rare earth products to build 500,000 EVs domestically by 2025.
Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Energy Renewables said at the event it will break ground this spring on a California facility to test sustainable ways to produce lithium from geothermal brines found underneath California's Salton Sea and elsewhere. 
Biden also announced that the Pentagon plans to boost its stockpile of strategic minerals, a development that Reuters reported last week. 
His comments on Tuesday were the clearest to date about the rubric administration officials deploy when determining whether or not to support a proposed U.S. mining project. 
""It's my hope and my expectation that those communities ... get the benefit of being able to be employed and being able to generate a living from what's going to be happening and are protected environmentally,"" Biden said.
Last month, the Biden administration blocked a proposed Minnesota copper mine from  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc. It has also taken steps to slow down development of a lithium mine in Nevada from ioneer Ltd and a copper mine in Arizona from Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Ltd.
Other announcements at the event included a $140 million pilot project to recover rare earths from coal ash, with funding from the recently passed infrastructure law. 

The White House has also touted an agreement between Talon Metals Corp and the United Steelworkers to train workers in northern Minnesota near Talon's Tamarack nickel project. Talon signed a nickel supply deal with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc last month. 
Talon has also agreed to remain neutral in any union organizing effort, the White House said. Biden has been a large supporter of organized labor throughout his presidency.

(Reuters) - Directors at three regional Federal Reserve banks voted in January to increase the interest rate charged to commercial banks for emergency loans by a quarter of a percentage point, minutes of their discount rate meetings showed on Tuesday. 
The rate-hike recommendations -- from directors of the Cleveland, St. Louis, and Kansas City Feds -- were overruled two weeks later when U.S. central bankers determined to keep the Fed's policy rate in its current range of 0-0.25%. The last time Fed regional banks split over discount-rate views was in October 2019, when the U.S. central bank was cutting rates. 
Directors at the Fed banks who supported an earlier rate hike did so ""in response to elevated inflation or to help manage economic and financial stability risks,"" the minutes showed. Inflation has been running at more than twice the Fed's 2% target.
Directors at the nine other banks wanted to leave the rate unchanged to continue to support the economy, the minutes said. 
But even at those banks, the minutes said, ""a number of directors noted that it might soon become appropriate"" to begin removing accommodation in light of inflation pressures and strong labor market conditions. 
At the Fed's January meeting, policymakers threw out a similar signal, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying policymakers were ""of a mind"" to begin raising interest rates in March. 

Fed bank directors are not policymakers and do not determine the Fed's interest rate, but they do meet regularly with their respective Fed presidents who say their directors' views help shape their own outlooks.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard has been among the most hawkish voices at the Fed in recent months, pushing for 100 basis points worth of rate hikes over the next three meetings.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -If Russia further invades Ukraine, the Biden administration could deprive it of a vast swath of low- and high-tech U.S. and foreign-made goods, from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
President Joe Biden would achieve that by expanding the list of goods that require U.S. licenses before suppliers can ship them to Russia, and his administration would then deny those licenses, the people said.
The measures, whose details have not previously been reported, are part of a suite of export control penalties that the United States has prepared to damage Russia's economy, targeting everything from lasers to telecoms equipment and maritime items.
They were not announced on Tuesday as part of a round of sanctions unveiled by Biden to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for recognizing two breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent and deploying troops into the regions to ""keep the peace.""
But a senior administration official said, “if Putin escalates further, we will escalate further, using both financial sanctions and export controls, which we’ve yet to unveil.”
The official added: ""Export controls are really potent because we’re talking about critical technology inputs that Russia needs to diversify its economy.” 
The official added that the United States is ""fully prepared with a very large number of countries across the world to implement those export control measures if the invasion proceeds."" 
The White House, and the Commerce Department, which oversees U.S. export controls, did not respond to requests for comment on details of the potential restrictions.
The package, which was still being fine-tuned over the weekend and could change, could come even as some White House officials have pledged to spare the Russian consumer from the brunt of the penalties.
The goal of the export control measures ""is really to degrade Russia's ability to have industrial production in a couple of key sectors,"" Peter Harrell, who sits on the White House's National Security Council, said in a speech last month. He said the administration was focused on industrial production and high-tech sectors ""rather than how do we sort of target the Russian people writ-large."" 
The administration has been vowing to hit Moscow with a potent cocktail of banking sanctions and export controls for weeks, in response to a massing of hundreds of thousands of Russian troops along Ukraine's borders.
Reuters reported on Saturday that the Biden administration had also prepared a package of sanctions against Russia that includes barring U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for major Russian banks.
By far the most sweeping measure contained in the export controls package would take a page from restrictions placed on Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd under former President Donald Trump. It would dramatically expand the scope of the so-called Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR), requiring firms that use U.S. tools to make technology overseas to obtain a U.S. license before shipping them to Russia.
""It's extraordinarily novel and has the potential for being far more significant than controls just on exports of these items from the United States,"" said Washington lawyer Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce Department official.
U.S. suppliers would also have to obtain licenses for certain Russia-bound items that do not currently require them, such as civil aircraft parts. Whether Europe would follow suit with similar measures remains to be seen.
Japan said on Tuesday it stood ready to join the United States and other G7 industrialised nations in slapping sanctions on Russia.
On Tuesday, Biden said the United States would impose sanctions against two large Russian financial institutions and Russian sovereign debt and against some Russian elites and their family members.
On Monday, as an initial response to Putin's moves into eastern Ukraine, Biden vowed to end investment in and trade with the regions while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced initial sanctions targeting Russian banks and billionaires.
Under changes proposed in the U.S. export control package, the license applications, in turn, would face a strict ""policy of denial"" standard of review, meaning only in rare cases would the administration approve them. 
In addition, Russian companies listed as so-called military end users for their alleged ties to the Russian military, including a handful of aircraft producers, would be added to a trade blacklist known as the entity list. That would broaden the scope of items the companies would need licenses to obtain.

Finally, Washington would expand the scope of products that would need approval from the United States when sent to Russian military end users through an even broader application of the FDPR rule, subjecting to U.S. licenses requirements all items made abroad with U.S. tools and destined for companies that support the military.
U.S. exports to Russia were under $5 billion in 2020, according to the Commerce Department, and already face many curbs. But the use of the FDPR rule dramatically expands the impact of the restrictions included in the package.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazil's central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said on Tuesday that higher interest rates to combat double-digit inflation are supporting financial inflows, strengthening the Brazilian currency.
Addressing a conference hosted by investment bank BTG Pactual, he also said positive fiscal figures are helping to attract investment to the country, among other reasons that explain the recent exchange rate behavior.
In the year, the real has already risen more than 10% against the dollar, the best global performance for the period, easing pressures on consumer prices after inflation reached 10.4% in the 12 months through January.
""In the exchange front, I think there are several variables. There is a variable that is the higher interest rate itself, which brings flows because of the interest rate differential,"" said Campos Neto.
Conducting an aggressive monetary tightening to tame inflation, the central bank has put interest rates at 10.75% from its record-low 2% last March, already signaling the need for extra adjustments ahead.
According to the central bank chief, a ""relevant"" part of the movement in foreign exchange comes from the shift in global flows, with investors moving from more leveraged companies to businesses that perform well in environments of higher inflation.
He pointed out that established and large companies in emerging markets operate with this profile and policymakers have seen inflows to the Brazilian stock market.

Local banks also ended unwinding their so-called 'overhedge' position due to new regulation in the country, a move that pressured the currency over the last two years.
Campos Neto said that inflation in Brazil would begin to fall faster between April and May, noting that this does not mean that it will reach its peak in these months.

Johnson slapped sanctions on five private banks including Bank Rossiya, which the government said was ""privately owned by elite Russian billionaires with direct links to Putin"", but spared Russia's largest state banks for now.
The government mistakenly listed Bank Rossiya's address as ""Neglinnaya, 12, Moscow, 107016, Russia"" which is the address of Russia's central bank, known in Russian as ""Bank Rossiya.""
The private Bank Rossiya is based in the northern Russian city of St Petersburg. Neglinnaya Street in Moscow has been home to a Russian or Soviet central bank office for at least a century. 

The British foreign office later issued an update to make ""administrative corrections to two listings under the Russia sanctions regime"" which gave the bank's correct address.

With euro zone inflation rising to record highs in recent months, the ECB has given up on a pledge not to raise rates this year and several policymakers are openly advocating an end to bond purchases this year, a prerequisite for any rate hike.
Reinesch, one of the longest serving members of the ECB's Governing Council, argued that current price pressures could boost wages while the economy could return to full capacity quicker than forecast, both potentially adding to inflation pressures.
""It would not be entirely groundless to consider that the end of net asset purchases under the current Asset Purchase Programme could come sooner than might have been expected on the basis of the December assessment,"" Reinesch, the central bank governor of Luxembourg, said in a blog post.
He added that while inflation risks are mostly in the near term, higher readings are also possible further out, impacting the bank's policy horizon.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain on Tuesday imposed sanctions on Gennady Timchenko and two other billionaires with close links to Vladimir Putin after the Russian president deployed military forces into two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russia was heading towards ""pariah status"" and that the world must now brace for the next stage of Putin's plan, saying that the Kremlin was laying the ground for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
He told parliament that five banks - Rossiya, IS Bank, GenBank, Promsvyazbank and the Black Sea Bank - were being sanctioned, along with three people - Timchenko, and the brothers Igor and Boris Rotenberg. 
But the Conservative prime minister refrained from targeting Russia's biggest state banks, cutting off capital for Russian companies or ejecting other prominent so-called Russian oligarchs from Britain.
""It is absolutely vital that we hold in reserve further powerful sanctions...in view of what President Putin may do next,"" Johnson said in response to calls for tougher action.
Of the five targeted banks only Promsvyazbank is on the Russian central bank's list of systemically important credit institutions.
Shares in Russia's two largest lenders, Sberbank and VTB reversed early losses to trade higher after escaping the British sanctions.
The British government said Timchenko was a major shareholder in Bank Rossiya, which played a role in the destabilisation of Ukraine after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.
""Bank Rossiya has supported the consolidation of Crimea into the Russian Federation by integrating the financial system following the annexation of Crimea,"" said a statement listing the sanctions.
Timchenko is a close ally of Putin, as are the Rotenbergs, Johnson said.
Hundreds of billions of dollars have flowed into London and Britain's overseas territories from Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, and London has become the Western city of choice for the super-wealthy of Russia and other former Soviet republics.
""We want to stop Russian companies from being able to raise funds in sterling or indeed in dollars,"" Johnson said. 
PUTIN'S CIRCLE 
Though Johnson warned Putin more sanctions would follow, Britain's initial package goes little further than what the United States did in 2014 and 2018 when it sanctioned Timchenko and the Rotenbergs.
""The risk is that today's slap on the wrist will not deter anything,"" opposition Labour Party lawmaker Liam Byrne said. ""The prime minister's got to recognise that pulling our punches does not work with President Putin.""
A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Britain would also limit Russian access to sovereign debt markets and its ability to clear transactions.
The U.S. Treasury said in 2014 that Bank Rossiya shareholders included members of Putin's inner circle and that Boris Rotenberg had amassed a fortune under Putin. 
Johnson saluted German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's decision to halt the Nord Stream 2 pipeline despite Europe's reliance on Russian energy supplies. 

He later spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron and they agreed they needed to work in ""lockstep to target Russian individuals and entities bankrolling President Putin’s aggressive approach"", Johnson's spokesperson said.
Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith asked Johnson to go further on sanctions and said that China would be watching the West's response carefully.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union agreed new sanctions on Russia that will blacklist more politicians, lawmakers and officials, ban EU investors from trading in Russian state bonds, and target imports and exports with separatist entities.
However, EU foreign ministers chose not to sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said following a meeting in Paris on Tuesday.
Russia's formal recognition of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine was an unacceptable breach of Ukraine's sovereignty, Borrell said.
""This package of sanctions that has been approved by unanimity by the member states will hurt Russia, and it will hurt a lot,"" Borrell told a news conference alongside France's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian at a meeting in Paris.
Separately, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told Reuters that further Russian aggression in Ukraine would result in more sanctions, in coordination with the United States.
The package of sanctions includes all members of the lower house of the Russian parliament who voted in favour of the recognition of the breakaway regions, freezing any assets they have in the EU and banning them from travelling to the bloc.
It was not immediately clear when the sanctions would take effect, but diplomats expect them in the coming hours or days, when names and details will be made public.
Borrell also said: ""We are going to target 27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukrainian territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence.""
Borrell said those individuals and entities were in Russia's defence, banking and financial sector.
""We target the ability of the Russian state and government to access our capital and financial markets and services,"" Borrell said.
Banks involved in financing separatist activities in eastern Ukraine would also be targeted.
The two regions could also be removed from a free-trade deal between the EU and Ukraine, ""to ensure that those responsible clearly feel the economic consequences of their illegal and aggressive actions,"" an EU statement said.
PRAISE FOR GERMANY
Borrell congratulated Germany's decision to put the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project on ice, arguably the most far-reaching reaction to Moscow's move late on Monday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also praised Berlin.
Taking steps to limit or ban Russia's access to the Belgium-based SWIFT global interbank payments system used for Russian money flows was not immediately part of the EU sanctions.
The EU had repeatedly said it was ready to impose ""massive consequences"" on Russia's economy if Moscow invaded Ukraine but has also noted that, given the EU's close energy and trade ties to Russia, it wanted to move in stages. 
Not all of the bloc's 27 member states have the same relation to Russia or dependency on its gas, which could eventually complicate the adoption of further sanctions.

EU officials and diplomats have said some EU countries, including Austria, Hungary and Italy, Russia's closest allies in the bloc, would prefer more limited sanctions in response to Putin's move on eastern Ukraine.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, whose country relies on Russia for much of its gas, told a news conference in Rome that any sanctions should not include energy imports.

The IHS Markit flash composite purchasing managers index advanced 4.9 points to 56, the group reported Tuesday. In January, the measure faltered as the omicron variant restrained activities and exacerbated worker shortages. Readings above 50 indicate growth.
The report showed firms are passing on higher materials, transportation and labor costs. A measure of prices charged for goods and services rose to the highest in data back to 2009, illustrating persistent supply and demand imbalances brought on by the pandemic.
“With growth rebounding sharply amid resurgent demand, and price pressures rising again to an all-time high, the survey will add to expectations of a more aggressive policy tightening” by the Federal Reserve, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
The group’s gauge of services led the February rebound in the composite measure with a 5.5-point gain on expanding inflows of new business and stronger employment. The manufacturing index rose two points, reflecting firmer production, employment and orders growth.
The composite index, which dates back to 2009, peaked at a reading of 68.7 last spring on strong pent-up demand among pandemic-weary consumers, but lost some momentum in subsequent months as new strains of the coronavirus and supply-side challenges disrupted business operations.
The February figures -- including a measure of future output hitting a 15-month high -- support economists’ projections the economy will find stronger footing after the omicron-related hit to first-quarter growth.
In a sign that transportation bottlenecks may be ameliorating somewhat, a measure of supplier deliveries at U.S. factories improved to a nine-month high. Still, shipping delays remain a challenge.

The Conference Board’s index decreased to 110.5 from a downwardly revised 111.1 reading in January, according to the group’s report Tuesday. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had called for a reading of 110.
Americans are experiencing the highest inflation since the early 1980s, which is well outpacing wage growth. The Russia-Ukraine conflict may further take a toll on confidence, especially if gasoline prices continue to rise, and surging mortgage rates are making housing that much less affordable.
The Conference Board’s expectations index dropped to 87.5, also a five-month low, while the gauge of current conditions improved to 145.1.
Concerns about the prospects for inflation worsened in February after easing in the prior two months, the group said. That contributed to declining confidence among Americans age 55 and over, some of whom are on fixed incomes, as well as those earning less than $35,000.
“Despite this reversal, consumers remain relatively confident about short-term growth prospects,” Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement. “While they do not expect the economy to pick up steam in the near future, they also do not foresee conditions worsening.”
The share of consumers who expect their incomes to rise in the next six months fell to the lowest level since January 2021. Buying plans for autos, homes and appliances also softened in February. Fewer Americans said they were planning to take a vacation in the coming months.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England will need to raise interest rates slightly more over the coming months, but their longer-term path is hard to predict due to uncertainties including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Tuesday.
The BoE raised interest rates to 0.5% this month from 0.25%, but Ramsden was part of a minority who voted for a bigger increase to 0.75%, which would have been the first half-point rise since BoE independence in 1997.
Investors are pricing in another rate hike at the BoE's next scheduled meeting which concludes on March 17.
""Some further modest tightening in monetary policy is likely to be appropriate in the coming months,"" Ramsden told the National Farmers' Union annual conference, echoing recent language from the BoE.
""The word 'modest' is significant here though - I do not envisage Bank Rate rising to anything like its pre-2007 level of 5% or above, let alone to the kind of levels we used to see before the MPC was formed in 1997,"" he added.
Financial markets currently price in BoE rates rising to nearly 2% by the end of this year -- well above the levels which the BoE's forecasts published on Feb. 3 suggested would be needed to get inflation back to its 2% target by early 2024.
""New shocks can arise - we did not foresee the recent rise in energy prices, and as we meet today the crisis in Ukraine is intensifying - and so we should remain humble about the possibility that things might turn out differently,"" Ramsden said.

""(This) makes it particularly difficult to make predictions about where monetary policy might be headed in the medium term,"" he added.
British inflation hit its highest in nearly 30 years in January at 5.5%, and the BoE expects it to peak at around 7.25% in April when a 54% rise in regulated household energy tariffs takes effect.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Escalating tensions between global crop heavyweights Russia and Ukraine are likely to force wheat, corn and sunflower oil buyers to seek alternative shipments, driving up world food prices already near multi-year highs, analysts and traders said.
Global stock markets tumbled while crude oil surged on Tuesday as Europe's eastern flank stood on the brink of war after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine. [MKTS/GLOB][O/R] 
With the two countries accounting for around 29% of global wheat exports, 19% of world corn supplies, and 80% of world sunflower oil exports, traders worried that any military engagement could impact crop movement and trigger a mass scramble by importers to replace supplies from the Black Sea region. 
Chicago wheat futures jumped more than 2% on Tuesday, corn hit a seven-month high and soybeans also gained ground. All three key food and feed ingredients have rallied around 40% from 2021 lows, lifted by a decline in global production and robust demand. [GRA/]
""Disruptions in supplies from the Black Sea region will impact overall global availability,"" Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), told Reuters. ""Buyers in the Middle East and Africa will be seeking alternative sources.""
Around 70% of Russia wheat exports went to buyers in the Middle East and Africa in 2021, according to Refinitiv shipping data.
Traders say the stepped-up tensions have already caused some buyers to divert vessels to other suppliers over concerns that any outbreak of war would lead to lengthy loading delays.
""Ships are avoiding entering the Black Sea because of the war risk,"" said one Singapore-based trader. ""Supply disruptions are already taking place.""
A lack of supplies from the Black Sea region could lift demand for the bread-making ingredient from the United States and Canada.

World food prices already hover near 10-year highs, led by strong demand for wheat and dairy products, the U.N. food agency said late last year.
There is additional support for agricultural markets stemming from a rally in crude oil prices, with increasing use of farm goods in making alternative fuels.

LONDON (Reuters) -Fast-rising inflation is pushing up the British government's debt interest bill sharply and limiting finance minister Rishi Sunak's options to ease a cost-of-living squeeze in a tax and spending announcement next month.
Data published on Tuesday showed a smaller-than-usual budget surplus in January, a month when income-tax revenues flood in, and economists said inflation's continued acceleration would limit the room for manoeuvre that Sunak has for his budget.
Excluding state banks, the surplus totalled 2.9 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) last month, below an average forecast of 3.5 billion in a Reuters poll of economists.
It was the first time the monthly budget figures did not go into the red since the pandemic struck two years ago.
But the surplus was smaller than usual for the start of the year. In January 2020, it was nearly 10 billion pounds.
Inflation, which is running at a 30-year high and looks set to top 7% in April, took the government's interest bill to 6.1 billion pounds in January, up by 4.5 billion over the same month last year, mostly because of inflation-linked bonds.
In the first 10 months of the 2021/22 financial year ending on March 31, interest payments jumped by 80% to nearly 60 billion pounds, exceeding Britain's entire budget deficit in the year before COVID-19 hit.
INFLATION STRAIN 
The inflation leap, caused by surging energy prices and the after-effects of the pandemic on the global economy, is straining British households' finances too.
Sunak has already announced measures to soften the blow from April's 54% increase in energy tariffs, but he is under pressure to do more in a budget statement expected on March 23, shortly before social security contributions go up.
A think tank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, estimates the payroll tax hike, combined with higher inflation, could drive a 30% rise in destitution in Britain.
Tuesday's data showed Sunak has some wiggle room.
Tax revenues were 29 billion pounds above official forecasts in the first 10 months of the 2021/22 financial year while spending, on inflation-linked bonds plus public services and rail subsidies, was 9 billion pounds higher.
Accumulated borrowing between April last year and January was about half its level in the same period of 2020/21 when the pandemic crisis was at its most severe.
But Sunak pointed to the need to prepare for risks ahead.
""Our debt has increased substantially and there are further pressures on the public finances, including from rising inflation,"" he said.
""Keeping the public finances on a sustainable path is crucial so we can continue helping the British people when needed, without burdening future generations with high debt repayments.""
Britain's fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said ""large upside surprises in spending (on debt interest costs) relative to our October forecast will follow in the coming months.""
Britain's stock of public debt stands at 2.32 trillion pounds, and has risen to nearly 95% of gross domestic product, from about 82% immediately before the pandemic struck Europe. 
Bethany Beckett, an economist with Capital Economics, said the public finances were likely to end the financial year in better shape than the official forecasts that underpin Sunak's budget, but next year's deficit looked on course to overshoot by 30 billion pounds.
The Bank of England is widely expected to raise interest rates for a third meeting in a row next month as it tries to stop the rise in inflation from becoming entrenched.

Michal Stelmach, an economist at KPMG UK, said the early 2022 fiscal performance was probably better than Tuesday's data suggested because about 20% of taxpayers had taken advantage of a month-long extension for filing their tax returns.

The vehicle tax measures include reducing import duty this year and next by as much as 40% for completely built EVs priced up to 2 million baht ($61,805), and by 20% for those priced between 2 million and 7 million baht.
The government will cut excise tax on imported EVs to 2% from 8%, which is expected to add 7,000 EVs in the first year, Finance minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith told a news conference.
Also approved was the slashing of income tax rates sharply from 35% to 17% for skilled foreign professionals in targeted industries or economic zones, under a previously announced plan to draw a million wealthy foreigners, including pensioners. 
The EV scheme for 2022-2025 was approved last week as part of a zero-emission vehicle policy and a goal of ensuring 30% of Thailand's total auto production are EVs by 2030.
Thailand is a major regional automaker and typically produces about 2 million regular vehicles per year, for firms that include Toyota, Honda and Mitsubishi.
Eligible car manufacturers will also receive subsidies of between 70,000 baht and 150,000 baht for each EV and 18,000 baht for electric motorcycles, Arkhom said.
""This is to encourage investment and employment. It's necessary, otherwise we won't be able to keep pace as car manufacturers and others will overtake us,"" Arkhom said.

The plan to lure foreigners deemed high value seeks to add 1 trillion baht ($31 billion) to domestic spending, boost investment by 800 billion baht and increase tax revenue by 270 billion baht over a five-year period.

KUWAIT (Reuters) -Kuwait's government owes 2.35 billion dinars ($7.78 billion) in late payments to public entities, according to the finance ministry, in a sign of a deepening cash crunch the oil-exporting nation has faced since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
The ministry, which was responding to a parliamentary query, said in a letter dated Feb. 16 and seen by Reuters, that late payments were due to the lack of liquidity in the Treasury's accounts.
""These payments will be successively paid when liquidity is available,"" it said. The arrears are equal to nearly 11% of Kuwait's budget for the fiscal year that starts on April 1.
Local newspaper Al Qabas first reported on the letter.
While a recovery in oil prices have offered some relief, the Gulf country has been unable to issue international debt since 2017 when a public debt law expired and successive parliaments and cabinets have failed to replace it with a new one.
The government has relied since on alternative sources of funding such as asset swaps between its huge sovereign wealth fund and the treasury. It faces a payment of $3.5 billion on March 20 when international bonds issued in 2017 come due. In a Feb. 10 document, the finance ministry said extending the bonds' maturity was ""completely unlikely"" as it would lead to a downgrade of Kuwait's sovereign and bank ratings, raising the state's funding costs.
Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund said the same document that despite high prices of oil - hydrocarbons often account for nearly 90% of state revenues - Kuwait still needs the debt law. 
""The easy and available solutions to enhance liquidity have been exhausted,"" the Kuwait Investment Authority said, calling for economic reforms and a law regulating withdrawals from the Future Generations Reserve Fund, which is meant to conserve oil wealth for the long term. 
The late government payments include 1.29 billion dinars for the finance ministry and public accounts, making up 55% of the total. Out of that amount, 862 million dinars are owed to public and independent entities, including those responsible for housing and social security payments.

Fitch Ratings downgraded Kuwait last month to 'AA-' from 'AA', citing ""ongoing political constraints"" that hinder the oil producer's ability to address structural problems.

It also comprises sanctions on several hundred members of Russia's state Duma who voted for the recognition of the break-away regions in eastern Ukraine, as well as on companies and banks involved in the financing of separatist activities in the these regions.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Investors are reviving one of the most unprofitable wagers of the past two decades and betting that a combination of politics and price pressures would prompt the unthinkable: a hawkish shift at the Bank of Japan, perhaps as soon as the summertime.
The modern pioneer of quantitative easing has given no such hint. But rising inflation, an election on the horizon and a falling yen, which is driving up the cost of living, have roused a bond market dulled by years of intervention.
Yields have leapt to their highest since the BOJ began its policy of targeting interest rates in 2016, as traders figure that something has got to give, and there is mounting pressure on both sides of the central bank's targeted 10-year tenor. 
""It's a binary outcome so interest in this trade from the macro community, particularly the offshore accounts, has grown since the end of last year,"" said David Beale, head of institutional client coverage in Asia at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
He said bets were being laid on volatility in rates and on Japan's yield curve steepening as longer-dated yields go up. Investors see a chance that the central bank lifts its target yield, or shifts it down the curve to the five-year tenor.
Price moves have opened the gap between 10-year and 30-year yields to its widest in more than three years this month, while at the shorter end five-year bonds suffered their longest selling streak since 2008. [JP/]
The currency is also in focus as investors see it as a pressure point for the BOJ and are positioning for it to slide at first, while using options to wager that things get bumpy later.
""Vol is starting to move in dollar/yen for the first time in quite some time,"" Beale said, referring to volatility gauges that have ticked steadily higher since September.
Equity investors are also preparing their portfolios for the possibility of currency moves.
Kartik Ramachandran, managing partner of Corestrat, a London-based private wealth manager, is bullish on Japanese stocks, but has now started looking for firms that benefit from a weaker yen and has one eye on the policy risks.
""We think the risks are balanced. Now, if the balance of risk shifts up, driven by the higher commodity prices and a weaker yen, combined with the slow and low wage growth, the BOJ will act,"" he said.
WIDOWMAKER
Emboldened by the abrupt abandonment of yield curve control in Australia, bond traders think the next few months are crucial because inflationary pressure and an upper-house election due by July are possible triggers for a policy shift.
Wholesale inflation is running near four-decade highs and heading for consumers. Economists expect headline inflation to leap in April, when last year's one-off falls in mobile phone bills start rolling out of the reporting period.
Rising yields globally also mean that anchored rates in Japan are weighing on the yen, and as that feeds further into energy prices and living costs it is likely to increase pressure on policymakers and politicians to do something about it.
""The situation is completely different from the past 20 or 30 years, so that's why people have started thinking that this time could be different,"" said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan Markets Research at J.P. Morgan in Tokyo.
""Weak yen and a higher oil price are going to be very negative for Japan, so that could also be a catalyst for a change in BOJ policy.""
Bets on a policy shift or debt crisis in Japan are termed ""widowmaker"" trades as previous attempts to call a top in the bond market almost half-owned by the BOJ have proven wrong.
There is no clear consensus that this time is any different, either, but there is enough turmoil in the market that a showdown seems to be in the offing.
YEN SQUEEZE
The yen is perhaps already in the firing line.
Trading around 114.70 per dollar, it is already down nearly 5% in five months. Latest data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) shows leveraged funds are the most bearish on the currency since November, while speculators have also scaled up short yen trades.
Fidelity portfolio manager Ian Samson said far more pressure on the yen or from inflation would be needed to break the BOJ's resolve. ""Come back when the yen is 15% weaker, and then maybe,"" he said. 
Colin Asher, senior economist Mizuho in London, says investors will pay closer attention to the BOJ's next policy meeting, pointing to the 2018 precedent when markets tried to test the 10-year bond's outer bound and the central bank responded with a quick widening of that band. 
In any case it seems that both the BOJ and the market are strapping in for a prolonged tussle.

""We ... see an increase in investor bets that dollar/yen volatility will rise or at least remain high,"" said Shafali Sachdev, head of FX in Asia at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Wealth Management.
""This would be consistent with a view of the market repeatedly testing the BOJ's resolve on the cap, and having them defend it.""

Investing.com -- The decision of Russian President Vladimir Putin to recognize two breakaway regions in Ukraine and send his troops in is having a widespread impact.  Stocks are set to open lower, with eyes also on earnings from  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Macy’s (NYSE:M). The ruble has seen volatile trading while crude and natural gas prices soar. CB confidence numbers are due for release, while the German Ifo surprised to the upside, for now at least. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 22nd February. 
1. Russia moves into eastern Ukraine
Tensions between the West and Russia saw a dramatic escalation late Monday after Russian President Vladimir Putin officially recognized two self-proclaimed republics in the east of Ukraine and ordered his forces to go into the regions.
This follows weeks of Russia massing troops on the Ukraine border as well as holding extensive military exercises in neighboring Belarus, prompting the U.S. to warn that an invasion of Ukraine was imminent. 
U.S. President Joe Biden promptly issued executive orders prohibiting trade with the two breakaway regions, and further sanctions on Russia are expected to follow from the U.S. and its European allies.
Investors are now looking to see if Putin stops his troops in the east of Ukraine, or if an invasion of the whole of the country, including the capital Kyiv, in his sights. The latter move would be sure to result in even more severe sanctions from the West, even if some European nations have been wary of the economic fallout they could face from penalizing Russia, especially given their reliance on it for gas imports.
2. Ruble hits 15-month low, then rebounds
The financial repercussions of Putin’s move into Ukraine are already being felt, with the Russian ruble sinking to a more than 15-month low on Tuesday before paring some losses.
At 6 AM ET, USD/RUB fell 0.9% to 79.0274, after climbing to 80.5825 in early trade, the pair’s strongest level since Nov. 2, 2020.
Helping the ruble climb off lows were comments from the Russian central bank, which said it was ready to take all necessary measures to support financial stability.
The central bank said banks would be permitted to use the market value of stocks and bonds in their portfolios as of Feb. 18, i.e., before the move into Ukraine, in earnings reports until October.
JPMorgan also downgraded its stance on Russian equities to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"", expecting further stock market declines in the near future. Russia may not pay out to foreign shareholders in the event of severe sanctions, the bank added.
3. Stocks set to open lower on Eastern European concerns
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower later, as U.S. investors return from the long weekend to try and digest the escalation of tensions in Eastern Europe.
By 6 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 55 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.5%.
The corporate earnings season is drawing to a close, and just under 80% of the around 400 of the companies listed on the S&P 500 have beaten analysts’ expectations, according to data from FactSet.
More results are expected today from the likes of Home Depot and Macy’s before the bell, and Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) after the close.
Elsewhere, eyes will be on  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) after the conglomerate’s stock slumped on Friday’s losses following a cautious outlook. HSBC (NYSE:HSBC) will also be in focus after the lender reported a near doubling of fourth quarter profit after tax to $2 billion, but also a $500 million charge, mostly due to its exposure to Chinese commercial real estate. 
4. U.S. consumer confidence up next after German Ifo shines
The economic data slate in the U.S. Tuesday includes both services and manufacturing PMI numbers for February, which are expected to show a slight improvement from the previous month, and the CB Consumer Confidence release, also for February.
In Europe, the widely followed Ifo institute said German business morale improved in February across all sectors, rising to 98.9 from an upwardly revised 96.0 in January, the highest level since August last year.
""While such a strong reading would normally spread optimism, last night's Russia-Ukraine developments have probably made this prominent leading indicator rather backward-looking,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said, in a note.
5. Crude, European natural gas prices soar 
Crude oil and European natural gas prices soared on the news of Russian troops entering eastern Ukraine after President Vladimir Putin officially recognized two breakaway regions in the east of the country as newly-formed republics.
Russia’s move is a dramatic escalation in its standoff with the West over Ukraine, and a conflict could threaten Russian gas supplies to Europe, about a third of which typically travel through pipelines crossing Ukraine. This could prompt Western European countries to seek alternative energy sources, including the purchase of crude from the global market.
Additionally, the U.S. and its European allies could well impose sanctions on Russia, with curbs to Moscow’s ability to trade in foreign currency likely to disrupt energy markets.
By 6 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 4.1% at $93.97 a barrel, while Brent crude futures were up 2.6% at $95.41 a barrel, having earlier climbed to its highest level since September 2014. 
Gasoline RBOB Futures were up 3.8% at $2.9191 a gallon.",,,,,

Speaking at an economic conference, Gentiloni said ""uncertainty remains around us"", adding: ""The violation of international law through Russian recognition of two separatist territories in Ukraine will strongly increase this uncertainty."" 

Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine on Monday, deepening Western fears of a new war in Europe. Moscow's move will trigger EU sanctions against it and Russia is likely to respond with counter-sanctions.
On Feb. 10, the European Commission cut its growth forecast for the 19 countries sharing the euro to 4.0% this year from 4.3%, citing a new wave of COVID-19 infections, high energy prices and continued supply-side disruptions.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine wants to launch talks with the International Monetary Fund on a new programme in April to reassure markets that have been rattled by tensions with Russia, Central Bank Governor Kyrylo Shevchenko told Reuters. 
Speaking in an interview in his office late on Monday, Shevchenko ruled out imposing any administrative restrictions on the hryvnia currency, saying these would be counterproductive by agitating markets rather than offering stability. 
He also said the central bank would remain ""hawkish"" on fighting inflation, leaving open the possibility of raising interest rates beyond the planned hike to 11% at the next monetary policy meeting in March. 
The threat of major war in Ukraine after Russia massed troops and announced their deployment in Moscow-controlled separatist regions has pummelled Ukrainian assets. The hryvnia fell by more than 1% in early trading on Tuesday.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's administration has stressed the importance of shielding the economy from the fallout, while the central bank has sold more than $1.4 billion in forex reserves to keep the hryvnia stable since January. 
""We need to discuss a new programme with the IMF now, there will be a very good platform - the spring meeting of the IMF in April,"" Shevchenko said.
The current $5 billion stand-by expires in June, and Ukraine expects to receive the remaining $2.2 billion in the first half of the year, including $700 million in March.
""It will be a good signal for the markets that we expect the IMF mission to start soon,"" Shevchenko said.
Ukraine is relying on such assistance as spiking yields have hobbled borrowing on external capital markets.
""We hope that in the next few months the country will have the opportunity to compensate for the complicated access to foreign markets with sources of official funding,"" he said
NO RESTRICTIONS ON CURRENCY MARKET
Shevchenko said that the central bank would continue the floating exchange rate policy.
The hryvnia has weakened by 6% against the U.S. dollar since the start of the year as a result of outflows of more that $600 million of foreign capital from the domestic bonds and increased demand from energy importers.
The bank believes that mainly psychological factors, not macroeconomic reasons, triggered market volatility.
""We are deeply convinced that now there is no need to introduce any administrative restrictions. From our point of view, administrative restrictions, on the contrary, provoke a stir,"" Shevchenko said.
According to him, international currency reserves, currently at $28 billion, allow the bank to continue interventions to smooth out fluctuations in the market. 
""The National Bank does not have either a target for the exchange rate or a corridor that it would target. The rate will depend on supply and demand in the market,"" he said.
He said that, due to the interventions, the volume of net international reserves fell below the level agreed in the memorandum with the IMF. But he did not think this would derail Ukraine's prospects of securing the next tranche. 
He suggested the IMF would be open to discussing a revised target level of reserve.
"" ... naturally, no one expected that Ukraine would need to spend significant amounts from reserves in order to smooth out currency fluctuations at the beginning of 2022,"" Shevchenko said.
HAWKISH MONETARY POLICY
Shevchenko said that the bank was ready to continue a tight monetary policy to bring inflation back to the target range of 5%, though he believed that inflation already peaked last September. 
""We said that we forecasted further rate hikes and are prepared to act more decisively if we see pro-inflationary pressure. We are ready to further tighten monetary policy in order to bring inflation back to the target,"" he said.

The bank has increased the rate six times since last March to 10% from the historical law of 6% to restrain persistently high inflation. Inflation slowed to 10% in December and January from a 2021 peak of 11% in September.
Asked if the central bank may raise the rate higher than the envisaged 11% in March, Shevchenko said: ""We are still hawkish. The National Bank has such readiness. High inflation hits the pocket of every person"".

The rouble hit a near two-year low after President Vladimir Putin ordered the deployment of troops to two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine after recognising them as independent.
The sharp drop in the rouble from levels around 70 to the greenback seen just four months ago is expected to fuel already high inflation, one of the main concerns among Russians, which would dent the country's already falling living standards.
""The Bank of Russia is keeping the development of the situation on the financial market under control and is ready to take all necessary measures to support financial stability,"" the bank said in a statement.
It also announced some easing of requirements for banks, saying lenders would be permitted to use the market value of stocks and bonds in their portfolios as of Feb. 18 in earnings reports until October.
But the central bank, which does not target a particular exchange rate for the free-floating rouble, fell short of saying what other measures it could take as Russia braced for a new round of Western sanctions that could target Russian banks and state debt.
""Volatility would obviously increase in this situation (of new sanctions), and it would be worth the Bank of Russia considering entering the market with interventions at some points,"" said Egor Susin, managing director at Gazprombank Private Banking.
""The central bank has the key interest rate and interventions in its arsenal,"" said Evgeny Suvorov, an economist at CentroCreditBank.

The central bank has raised rates by a hefty 100 basis points at two board meetings in a row and is expected to hike the rate again from 9.5% on April 29 as inflation stands near 8.8%, far above the 4% target.
The bank, which said on Tuesday it still expects inflation to slow to 4% target in mid-2023, did not reply to a Reuters request for comment on possible FX selling to ease downside pressure on the rouble.

Mortgage rates in 87 out of 103 cities surveyed by Beike Research Institute have come down, with 30 of them, including Beijing, leading with cuts of 5 basis points on average, in line with a similar decline in the five-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) in January, the group said in a report published on Monday.
The mortgage rate reductions by commercial lenders followed two rounds of cuts in the benchmark LPR by the central bank in December and January, aimed at shoring up slowing growth in the world's second-largest economy. 
""Mortgage rates in Beijing and Shanghai fell for the first time month-on-month since mid-2020,"" said Xu Xiaole, an analyst at the Beike institute, adding that there was more room for cuts. 
China's four biggest banks lowered mortgage rates in the southern city of Guangzhou by 20 basis points on Monday, sources told Reuters.
Mortgage rates in smaller cities such as Hohhot, Zhongshan and Huizhou were cut by 30 basis points, according to the Beijing-based institute.
""This change of policy does not mean the government already gave up the long-term goal of 'houses are for people to live in, not for speculation',"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. 
""Once growth stabilises in the second half and the important government meeting ends in the fourth quarter, the priority will likely shift back to the long-term objective,"" Zhang said. 
The ruling Communist Party is set to hold its once-in-five-years congress late this year.
Since late 2021, authorities have taken a slew of measures to avert a hard landing for the property sector, including steps to support buyers such as newly married couples. 
Last week, some banks started to require smaller down-payments in a handful of cities not constrained by regulatory restrictions on purchases.
The People's Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
The Shanghai branch of the central bank has told commercial lenders in the financial hub to accelerate real estate-related loans, said two sources with knowledge of the matter. 

At Shanghai banks, the monthly growth of property loans, including mortgages, must not lag behind the growth of other loans, and the balance of real estate loans at the end of each month must not decline from a year earlier, the sources said.
The Shanghai branch of PBOC declined to comment.

WASHINGTON/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States is coordinating with allies and will announce new sanctions against Russia on Tuesday after Moscow recognized two breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent and sent ""peacekeeping"" forces there, U.S. officials said on Monday.
""Tomorrow, the United States will impose sanctions on Russia for this clear violation of international law and Ukraine sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told reporters after a U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday evening.
""We can, will, and must stand united in our calls for Russia to withdraw its forces, return to the diplomatic table and work toward peace.""
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized two breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent and told Russia's defense ministry to deploy troops into the two regions to ""keep the peace,"" heightening tension with the West over Ukraine.
Biden administration officials said Putin's move did not trigger a broad package of sanctions that the United States and its allies have been working on if Russia invades Ukraine because Russia already had troops in the region.
Instead the White House announced separate, less severe and more targeted sanctions, in response. 
President Joe Biden issued an executive order that White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said would ""prohibit new investment, trade, and financing by U.S. persons to, from, or in the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine,"" referring to the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic. 
Psaki said additional measures would come on Tuesday. Those, according to another White House spokesperson, would be directed at Russia.
Reuters could not determine what sanctions or export controls might be announced on Tuesday, but the Biden administration has prepared an initial package of sanctions against Russia that includes barring U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for major Russian banks, people familiar with the matter said over the weekend.
The measures aim to hurt the Russian economy by cutting the ""correspondent"" banking relationships between targeted Russian banks and U.S. banks that enable international payments.
The United States will also wield its most powerful sanctioning tool against certain Russian individuals and companies by placing them on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, effectively kicking them out of the U.S. banking system, banning their trade with Americans and freezing their U.S. assets, the same sources said.
The Biden administration plans to spare everyday Russians from the brunt of U.S. export controls if Russia invades Ukraine, and focus on targeting industrial sectors, a White House official said in late January. Still, ""key people"" will also face ""massive sanctions,"" White House national security official Peter Harrell said in a speech in Massachusetts.

Export control measures could also be announced as part of the package but would probably not have the same immediate impacts, and instead ""degrade Russia's ability to have industrial production in a couple of key sectors."" 
Harrell did not detail the sectors, but other White House officials have mentioned aviation, maritime, robotics, artificial intelligence, quantum computing and defense.

The United Kingdom does not require vaccinated passengers to take a COVID test, while Gulf state Bahrain this month said those arriving would no longer needed to be tested.
""I do expect across the world, the testing regime for travel will start to disappear pretty quickly and we're hopeful that there will be an announcement over the next few weeks from many different places,"" Chief Executive Paul Griffiths said.
""The whole idea of having to have tests for travel will give way to vaccination certificates.""
Griffiths did not say when Dubai would ease its own testing requirements. 
Dubai airport is forecasting passenger traffic to more than double this year to 57 million from 29.1 million in 2021. 
That is still far below the 86.4 million passengers the airport handled in 2019, the year before the pandemic struck.
Griffiths said bookings for the next three months were among the strongest the airport had ever seen and the 57 million target for this year could end up proving conservative.
""The outlook for the future now is particularly good.""
Dubai will also reopen its second airport, Al Maktoum International in May to scheduled, commercial passenger flights for the first time since the pandemic began, Griffiths said.

Thailand, a $544 billion economy before the pandemic hit, needs an innovation-led growth model and to address existing foreign investment constraints to create better jobs and become a high-income country, it said in a statement.
Adopting a circular economy, which involves producing, leasing, repairing, upgrading and recycling as much as possible, could generate as much as $1.6 billion of cost savings and additional revenue for the private sector, especially for agriculture, construction, and electronics, the bank said.
An additional $1.8 billion a year could be generated from accelerating use of digital technology, it added, mostly from new investments and expansion of sectors where Thailand is well-positioned, like e-commerce and fintech. 
""With COVID-19, digital and disruptive technologies have been key in keeping businesses afloat,"" Thai Finance Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith was quoted as saying in the World Bank statement.

The tourism- and consumption-led economy, Southeast Asia's second biggest after Indonesia, grew 1.6% last year, among the slowest in the region, and the government predicts growth of 3.5-4.5% this year.
Strengthening structural reforms will boost businesses and promote investments in digital innovation and circular technology, the World Bank added.

ASHFORD, England (Reuters) - After work in the evenings, Nicola Frape turns off the heating and huddles under a blanket with her daughter and a hot water bottle. Adding a layer costs nothing, she says, but leaving the boiler on drains her inflation-hit bank account.
Treats such as cinema tickets have been scrapped as the 38 year-old care worker's food and fuel bills climb, and she has tried to cancel her pay-TV service but cannot get through to her provider: she assumes everyone is doing the same thing. 
Frape is one of millions of normally financially comfortable Britons who are facing a cost-of-living crisis as a double-whammy of accelerating inflation - driven by soaring energy bills - and tax increases kicks in this year.
Fast-rising prices are inflicting what the Bank of England says will be the biggest one-year fall in disposable income, adjusted for inflation, in at least 30 years.
After a decade of stagnant living standards - and in stark contrast to promises of a high-wage economy by Prime Minister Boris Johnson - Frape, like others, is bracing for a further hit to her finances in April.
That is when energy bills are due to jump 54% to around 2,000 pounds ($2,723) a year per household - only some of which will be offset by emergency government support - and when social security contributions paid by workers are also due to increase, all against the backdrop of rising interest rates.
Frape says spending on food and petrol has already risen by 20 pounds a week. She and her 14-year old daughter have had to limit car journeys to help accumulate some savings for April. The little flags pinned to a wall map that show their previous holiday destinations are unlikely to be added to this year. 
""There's just too much going up at once,"" Frape told Reuters in her immaculate home in Ashford (NYSE:AINC), a town in south-east England, not far from the entrance to the Channel Tunnel. ""The pressure is just going to be even worse in April.""
INFLATION'S CLIMB
With economies around the world rebounding from coronavirus lockdowns, prices for everything from food and clothes to haircuts and rent, as well as energy are going up, fuelled by resurgent demand and shortages due to supply chain disruptions.
Accurate national comparisons of changes in living standards are hard to make but concerns about inflation are emerging as a big factor in elections including France's presidential race in April and U.S. midterm elections in November.
Britain's consumer price inflation rate hit 5.5% in the 12 months to January, the highest since 1992 when the economy was feeling the after-effects of a late-1980s spending boom driven by Margaret Thatcher's tax cuts and big pay deals.
The CPI is set to top 7% in April. The BoE thinks it will then start to slow but will still be above 5% in a year's time.
Inflation in the United States has already surpassed 7% to reach its highest since the early 1980s, and in the euro zone it hit a record 5.1% in January.
Frape, who works as housekeeper in a care home and has been in the industry since she was 18, is being urged by colleagues as their union representative to demand a pay rise above April's government-mandated 6.6% increase in the minimum wage. 
Wage demand pressure, and the risk that it drives a self-perpetuating high inflation problem, is a big worry for the BoE.
Governor Andrew Bailey drew howls of protests from unions this month when he called for restraint in pay talks. 
The BoE thinks underlying wage growth will hit almost 5% this year before easing.
Lower-income households are feeling the inflation pinch harder than higher earners, many of whom made big savings during the pandemic on commuting, holidays and going out.
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a think tank, estimates the combination of April's payroll tax increase and higher inflation could drive a 30% rise in destitution in the world's fifth-largest economy. 
The Trussell Trust, which supports a network of food banks, said delivery of food parcels rose 11% between April and September last year compared with the same period of 2019, and hit one of its highest ever levels in December.
At Dad's House, a food bank in west London, some people who used to donate are now among the 500 families who get support each week. Jackie Gordon, 52, said she often goes without food. ""I have to pay my bills,"" she said. ""I'm behind with my rent and I don't want to get evicted."" 
SHARP BUT SHORT?
The government is hoping the cost-of-living squeeze, while sharp, will be short-lived. 
It will spread some of the fuel price increase over the coming years and cut a tax for people in lower-value properties to provide support through 2022.
Capital Economics believes household disposable income, adjusted for inflation, might recover as soon as early 2023 as inflation drops more quickly than the BoE expects and unemployment remains lower.
The consultancy forecast a peak-to-trough fall in real wages of 2.6% between September 2021 and April 2022 compared with a drawn-out drop of 13.5% after the global financial crisis as wages rose by less than inflation between 2008 and 2014.
But Rebecca McDonald, senior economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which campaigns on poverty issues, said 2022 was likely to leave a lasting mark on poorer households even if inflation falls sharply. 
""It's going to feel like a much more longer-term issue because this year is going to be incredibly difficult,"" McDonald said, predicting many families would resort to debt or going into arrears this year. 
Frape said she was routinely checking her bank balance after the strains on her budget intensified earlier this year. The extra outlays keep on coming: her daughter's annual bus pass is expected to rise by 80 pounds, or more than 20%. 
She works three days a week but said she would lose income from tax credits if she worked longer hours. Frape says her cautious approach has served her well for now, although it underscores why so many retailers and hospitality outlets expect a torrid 2022. 
Soon, she said, the government will need to go further.

""I think it's a really sad situation that people are struggling to live. They're working so many hours and draining themselves and still can't make ends meet,"" Frape said. ""Something's got to give.""

COLOMBO (Reuters) -Sri Lanka is open to discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other multilateral lenders for assistance, a cabinet spokesman said on Tuesday, as it faces its worst economic crisis in years.
""Sri Lanka has sought IMF assistance multiple times in the past and we are still open to that option,"" cabinet spokesman and Plantation Minister Ramesh Pathirana said.
Sri Lanka's foreign exchange reserves have plummeted to $2.36 billion, hitting imports of essential goods, including fuel, and inflation is quickening.
The island nation of 22 million people also faces debt repayment obligations of about $4 billion this year, and opposition leaders and economists are pushing the government to seek assistance from the likes of the IMF.
""We are keeping lines of communication open with the IMF and other multilateral lenders such as the Asian Development Bank,"" Pathirana told reporters.
Some opposition members have also urged the government to table in parliament an upcoming IMF assessment of the economic and financial situation, conducted as part of its regular Article IV consultations.
""It is essential that the government table this document before parliament and clearly state their plan for addressing this crisis in a sustainable manner,"" said opposition member of parliament Harsha de Silva.
'HOPE AND PRAY'
With fuel stocks sufficient for supplies for only a few days, Pathirana said the central bank had been directed to release funds for fuel shipments.
Sri Lanka is trying to arrange a payment of $35 million for a shipment of 40,000 tonnes of diesel, which would still only meet demand for about six days.
The fuel shortage is also hitting power supply, with the power regulator warning of five to six hours a day of rolling power cuts known as load shedding over the next few days unless supplies to thermal power plants increase. 

Pathirana said any further increase in global oil prices would make the situation even more difficult.
""We hope and pray no war in Ukraine as soaring oil prices will really hurt Sri Lanka,"" he said.

Tax fee cuts will be larger in 2022 than last year's 1.1 trillion yuan ($173.56 billion) in reductions, Liu told a news conference without specifying the size of the planned cuts.
""This year, the central government will significantly increase the size of transfer payments, especially general transfer payments, continue to favour regions with difficulties and underdeveloped areas,"" Liu said.
Planned transfer payments to local governments will help largely offset the impact from tax and feed cuts on local governments' revenues, he said, adding that such transfer payments topped 8 trillion yuan in 2021.
China's strong economic recovery from its sharp pandemic-induced slump started losing momentum in the middle of last year, weighed by debt problems in the property market and strict anti-virus measures that hit consumer confidence and spending.
Liu acknowledged the difficulty of increasing spending to spur the economy amid declining growth in fiscal revenues.
""We want to properly resolve these issues and hopefully that could be achieved this year,"" Liu added.
He said the transfer payments from the central to local governments will continue to favour areas facing difficulties and less developed regions.
Local governments have issued 484.4 billion yuan in special bonds under the 2022 advance quota of 1.46 trillion yuan, vice finance minister Xu Hongcai told the same news conference.
""At present, China's economy is facing new downward pressure, which requires the strength of fiscal policy to be appropriately front loaded,"" Xu said.
At a planning meeting in December, top leaders called for infrastructure investment to be frontloaded to help cushion the slowdown, which looks set to worsen in the first half of this year.

The size of the tax and fee cuts and special bond issuance for 2022 will be unveiled at the annual meeting of the National People's Congress, or the parliament, which commences on March 5.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Bank of Korea will leave rates on hold on Thursday after back-to-back hikes at the previous two meetings, according to economists in a Reuters poll who said elevated inflation would lead it to resume raising borrowing costs next quarter.
Consumer price inflation in Asia's fourth-largest economy jumped to a near-decade high of 3.6% in January, remaining above the central bank's 2% target for a 10th month.
To tame those price pressures, as well as to curb rampant house price growth and surging household debt, the BOK has raised interest rates three times since August last year.
The Feb. 15-21 poll showed all but one of 28 economists expected the BOK to leave its base rate unchanged at 1.25% at the Feb. 24 policy meeting. Only one predicted a 25 basis point increase at the upcoming meeting.
""Inflation, GDP (gross domestic product), monthly industrial activity and employment all support the BOK's current hawkish stance,"" noted Oh Suktae, economist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
He forecasts no change on Thursday, saying three consecutive rate hikes would be ""too burdensome for policymakers"". But he expects rates to climb to 2.0% by year-end.
""We should be aware that the chance of more hikes is rising given the increasing upside risks to inflation. Like economists in many other countries, we are also not so sure about our ability to forecast inflation in this case,"" he said.
Economists said another reason for the BOK to remain on the sidelines on Thursday was the country was about to elect its next president in a national vote slated for March 9. Thursday's meeting will also be BOK Governor Lee Ju-yeol's last.
The latest survey found the BOK would hike in Q2 and Q4 of this year, taking the base rate to 1.75% by end-2022 and another increase next year to put it at 2.00% by end-2023.
That was an upgrade from a January survey that put the base rate at 1.50% by the end of this year.
A little under three-quarters of contributors who provided forecasts through the end of this year in both this month's and last month's poll, 16 of 22, expected at least one more hike by year-end.

That would keep the BOK well ahead of its major Asian peers and the U.S. Federal Reserve, which have yet to hike in this cycle following dramatic cuts during the pandemic.
Inflation in South Korea was estimated to average between 2.1% and 2.8% until Q3 and then drop, staying below the central bank's 2% target from Q4 2022 through to at least the end of 2023, a separate Reuters poll found.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan will watch how rising interest rates in Western nations could affect its economy, the finance minister said on Tuesday, as higher bond yields would boost borrowing costs for the industrial world's heaviest public debt burden.
Shunichi Suzuki made the remark as the parliament's powerful lower house is set to approve the fiscal 2022/23 budget with a record $940 billion in spending on Tuesday, setting the stage for the budget's full passage through the legislature in March.[nL1N2UW073]
""As interest rates rise, interest payments will rise as well, straining Japan's budget,"" Suzuki told reporters after a cabinet meeting.
""If trust in our fiscal management is called into question, we cannot rule out a possibility that it could have a big impact on policy implementation and people's livelihoods.""
Japanese government bond (JGB) yields were recently at multi-year highs, partly driven by bets that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may have to scale back monetary stimulus in response to the tightening campaigns of global central banks. The yields have since retreated somewhat as Ukraine tensions send investors seeking safe-haven assets. 

The BOJ stepped into the market this month by offering unlimited bond purchases at a fixed rate to stem a rise in the key 10-year JGB yield toward its implicit 0.25% tolerance ceiling under its yield curve control policy.
Suzuki also said Japan will coordinate with the Group of Seven advanced economies in dealing with the Ukraine situation while carefully watching how it could affect its economy.

851,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 08:31PM ET</span>",,,,,,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank is shaking up the way it provides liquidity to the banking system as it ceases quantitative easing and prepares for the day when it will eventually raise interest rates.
Speaking at an online event, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Assistant Governor Christopher Kent emphasised changes to its open market operations (OMO) were not a signal on the future course of monetary policy.
""Rather, they will ensure that OMO remains fit for purpose as liquidity conditions, the economic outlook and the Bank's monetary policies evolve,"" Kent said.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe recently said it was plausible the 0.1% cash rate could rise later this year if the economy continues to improve, while financial markets are wagering on a rise as early as June.
Financial institutions typically use the OMO to borrow from the RBA for short-term liquidity, though the need has dwindled sharply in the last couple of years as the RBA flooded the system with cash through longer-term loans and bond purchases.
Now that the RBA has ceased buying bonds, this excess liquidity will slowly subside and OMOs will likely become more important again.
To prepare for this, Kent said the interest rate the RBA charges on OMO loans would change from a fixed rate to a floating rate based on the average cash rate over the term of the loan.
Kent said the RBA wanted to hear feedback from market participants before enacting this measure.

In the meantime, the RBA would charge a hurdle rate based on term-matched overnight indexed swaps plus a spread of 5 basis points. This change would happen on March 30.
The maximum tenor of OMO loans would shorten to be typically four weeks, but could be lengthened if needed.

The office of Prime Minister Ariel Henry on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) posted a sliding scale of wage hikes that vary by economic activity, with the greatest increase going to workers in areas such as the electricity and telecommunications industries. 
Employees in the clothing manufacturing sector, which export finished products to U.S. retailers, received a 37% increase. That takes their wages to just under $7.50 per day, compared with the $15 per day that union leaders had demanded.
For decades, Haiti has promoted itself as a center for clothing manufacturing thanks to low wages and proximity to U.S. markets. 
Workers over the years have complained that pay is too low to cover basic goods, which are often more expensive than in other countries due to weak infrastructure and gang violence. 

A group of U.S. members of Congress in November said they were asking the heads of 62 American companies that import garments from Haiti for information on ""protections in place for workers employed by their companies and suppliers.""
Haitian officials have in the past said that increasing wages by too much would leave the garment industries at risk of losing competitiveness with respect to other countries such as the neighboring Dominican Republic.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said on Monday consumer prices continue to trend higher as core inflation speeds up despite aggressive monetary tightening by policymakers.
""We actually see an inflation trend that is still growing,"" he said in an online event hosted by television channel AgroMais.
He noted that only Brazil and Russia's current interest rates are above the neutral level, which supports the economy at full employment without pressuring or decelerating inflation. A higher than neutral level is necessary to cool inflationary pressures and bring prices closer to central bank targets, Campos Neto said.
The Brazilian central bank has already raised rates to 10.75% from an all-time low of 2% in March last year, and indicated further adjustments to tame inflation that hit 10.4% in the 12 months through January.
Despite rising borrowing costs, Campos Neto said he believed analysts who are forecasting meager growth for Brazil this year will adjust their numbers upwards due to recent domestic data.

According to him, the most crucial point for the central bank today is to understand how the normalization of monetary policy will take place in an environment of higher global inflation, in which energy inflation ""seems more persistent.""
He stressed that the central bank was looking to analyze what effect this, along with China's slowdown, would have on emerging markets.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - The European Union must impose sanctions on Russia immediately after it recognised two Ukrainian breakaway regions as independent, the governments of the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said after Russia's announcement.
Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities on Monday, upping the ante in a crisis the West fears could unleash a major war.
The three Baltic states, unlike Ukraine, are all members of NATO and the European Union.
""The EU must impose sanctions immediately,"" Latvian Foreign minister Edgars Rinkevics wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
""I remain convinced such a course of escalation should be met with sanctions,"" his Lithuanian counterpart Gabrielius Landsbergis wrote in a tweet.
In a joint statement, Rinkevics and Latvia's president and prime minister called on the international community ""to take the strongest possible measures to stop Russia’s aggression and offer assistance to Ukraine"".
Separately, Estonia's president called on the European Union to impose sanctions for what he called the ""gross and unjustifiable trampling on international law"".
Lithuania's speaker of parliament will table a parliamentary motion to ""never recognize"" any change of status of the breakaway region, she said on Monday.
""Recognition of Donetsk & Luhansk separatist 'republics' by Russia is an intolerable violation of international law. It also means unilateral withdrawal from Minsk agreements"", said Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, referring to the Donbass ceasefire documents.

The Baltic States said on Jan. 21 they will provide Ukraine with U.S.-made anti-armour and anti-aircraft missiles, days after receiving clearance from the U.S. State Department to send U.S.-made missiles and other weapons there.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission will unveil on Wednesday a proposal to make large companies operating in the European Union check that their suppliers from around the world do not use slave or child labour and that they respect environmental standards, a draft of the law showed.
The proposal, called Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence, will also oblige boards of EU firms to ensure that their business model and strategy align with limiting global warming to 1.5 Celsius, as agreed under the Paris climate treaty. 
EU firms will have to make sure that their suppliers are not using forced labour, child labour, of inadequate workplace health and safety, exploitation of workers, or environmental offences like greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, or biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. 
The Commission proposal, seen by Reuters, will only become EU law after lengthy negotiations with the European Parliament and EU governments that are likely to take more than a year. 
""The law could be a true game-changer for corporations’ impact on the planet, or it could be a damp squib if big business lobbies get their wishes,"" non-governmental organisation Friends of the Earth Europe said in a statement.
The proposal estimates it would apply to 13,000 EU firms. The main criterion would be that a firm employs more than 500 people and has net turnover of more than 150 million euros. 
The threshold would be lower -- 250 employees and 40 million turnover -- for firms in high-impact sectors like clothes, shoes, animals, wood, food and beverages, oil, gas, coal, metals and metal ores, construction materials, fuels or chemicals. 
Still, that means 99% of Europe's firms would be exempt, as they do not reach these thresholds. 
The law would also apply to around 4,000 companies from outside the EU, but operating in the 27-nation bloc. 
For them, the 150 million net turnover would have to be generated within the EU, or, if they fall in to the high-impact sector category, 40 million euros of turnover within the EU.
Compliance with these goals would be monitored by EU governments. Companies ignoring them would face fines.
EU firms would also face civil liability if the offence against human rights or the environment was committed by its supplier with whom they have lasting and frequent cooperation.
The private lawsuit against an EU company for misconduct of its supplier would, however, have to show the offence could have been foreseen, prevented, ceased or mitigated with appropriate due diligence measures by the EU firm. 
""It will in practice be difficult to prevent all risks through global value chains,"" the Commision draft said. 

""Based on what we know this is a massive step in the right direction in the fight against corporate abuse,"" said Aurelie Skrobik, Corporate Accountability Campaigner at Global Witness.
""This said, we need to ensure that the law holds companies liable for harms throughout their entire supply chains and that there are no loopholes. There should be no ambiguity in the final text - victims must be able to seek justice through EU courts,"" she said.

The consensus forecast of 12 analysts surveyed was for inflation to grow to 7.17% from 7.01% in late January. If the prediction is correct, it would be the first increase since late November, when inflation hit a 20-year high.
The core rate of inflation, which strips out some volatile food and energy items, was seen accelerating to 6.46%, which would be the highest rate since August 2001.
The Bank of Mexico targets inflation of 3%, with a one percentage point tolerance range above and below that. Earlier this month the bank raised its benchmark interest rate for the sixth consecutive time, citing inflation.
Its next monetary policy decision is scheduled for March 24, a week after the United States' Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates after years of sitting near zero.

Compared to the previous month, Mexican consumer prices are estimated to have increased by 0.40% in the first half of February with the core price index seen advancing 0.35%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Requiring regulators to keep the financial sector globally competitive following Brexit must not bring back the damaging booms and busts of the past, a senior Bank of England official said on Monday.
Britain's finance ministry has said it will add a formal objective for the central bank and the Financial Conduct Authority to support financial sector competitiveness and long-term economic growth, without damaging their ability to keep firms and markets safe, or protect consumers.
The financial sector says it will help London remain a global financial centre after it was largely cut off from the European Union following Britain's departure.
Critics warn of a return to the 'light touch' regime that ended with taxpayers bailing out banks in the financial crisis over a decade ago.
Much hinges on how the new objective is worded, said Vicky Saporta, an executive director at the central bank.
""If one wanted to avoid short term boosts in financial services exports that might result in busts that are not good for long term economic growth, one would nest competitiveness into the long-term economic growth objective,"" Saporta told parliament's Treasury Select Committee.
The BoE and FCA currently need only 'have regard' to competitiveness, a weaker requirement.
Britain's review of ""Solvency II"" insurer capital rules inherited from the EU is seen as a litmus test of how far it can exploit its ""Brexit freedoms"" to write its own rules, but Saporta warned it must not dilute protection for policyholders.
The BoE will consult around mid-year on implementing changes once the government has set out its plans, Saporta said.
The new competitiveness objective could also influence other reforms such as implementing new global bank capital rules, and making Britain's wholesale capital market more attractive to global investors.

""Long term growth and competitiveness is not achieved by having low standards,"" FCA director of wholesale markets Edwin Schooling Latter told lawmakers.
""There is nothing specific on the table where I am worried that Treasury, for example, is pressing us to have lower standards than we think is appropriate,"" Schooling Latter said.

LONDON (Reuters) -The European Union's 19 trillion euro ($21.6 trillion)investment funds industry is failing to exploit the bloc's single market, saddling investors with high costs and opaque selling practices, the European Court of Auditors said in a critical report on Monday.
A full review of EU investment fund rules is needed by 2024 as minor revisions will not be enough to create a better market, according to the independent EU body which looks after the interests of the bloc's taxpayers.
The EU's single market seeks to tear down cross-border barriers to trade and offer customers more choice and competition.
The pan-EU funds sector was born in 1985 and is second only to that in the United States, but individual EU funds remain smaller than their U.S. equivalents.
Almost 70% of the market remains concentrated in four of the bloc's 27 states - Luxembourg, Ireland, Germany and France - with little cross-border investment, the auditors said.
""The objective of a true single market for investment funds has not been met, and cross-border activities remain rare,"" they said.
""Funds are still not supervised consistently across all member states, investor protection remains weak, and systemic risks are not adequately monitored.""
A spokesperson for the European Commission said it regretted that the ECA did not fully recognise the achieved benefits of the single market for investment funds.
The timing of the audit also did not allow for recent changes and new legislative proposals to be evaluated, including rules to remove barriers, the spokesperson said. ""The EU has a robust regulatory and supervisory framework governing collective investment funds in place.""
In their report, the auditors said that many of the expected gains for investors, such as lower fees and greater choice, have not yet materialised as costs continue to be high and difficult to compare between EU countries.
Greenwashing, or companies overstating their sustainability credentials, is also a problem as such labelling is unregulated, they added.
The EU's executive European Commission has made several amendments to EU investment fund rules over the years, but it was not always able to show their merits, and benefits may have overestimated, the report said. The commission's own performance measurement for the sector does not comply with its own criteria.
The EU executive should carry out a comprehensive fitness check on legislation covering investment funds by 2024 and, depending on its outcome, take steps to achieve the objectives of the single market more effectively, the report said.

The bloc should also consider giving its securities watchdog ESMA powers by 2024 to force national regulators to supervise the funds sector properly and consistently, it said.

(Reuters) -Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said on Monday that she will assess incoming economic data over the next three weeks in deciding whether a half percentage point interest rate rise at the central bank's next meeting in March is needed, a stance that underscores divisions among policymakers on how aggressively to begin its tightening cycle.
""I, as all of my colleagues will as well, will be watching the data closely to judge the appropriate size of an increase at the March meeting,"" Bowman said in remarks to an American Bankers Association conference in Palm Desert, California. ""I intend to support prompt and decisive action to lower inflation.""
In a question and answer session that followed her speech, Bowman said it was ""very important that we continue to watch how the economy develops and to understand whether or not things are improving or getting worse as we are approaching that decision.""
Before the next meeting, there will be another inflation report and monthly jobs figures for the central bank to digest, as policymakers also keep an eye on escalating geopolitical tensions on fears Russia will invade Ukraine. 
Bowman's firmly open mind on the March 15-16 policy meeting is at odds with some other senior Fed officials at the core of the Fed's rate-setting body, who in comments last week pushed back against what had been rising market expectations of a possible bigger-than-usual half-percentage point initial hike to help kickstart a campaign to rein in inflation at a 40-year high.
Investors currently see an 83% probability of a quarter-percentage point rate hike next month. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard had initially prompted market expectations to price in a more aggressive move after he called 11 days ago for the Fed to raise rates by a full percentage point by its June meeting, a rate path that would require at least one half-point hike between now and then.
In her speech, Bowman also said she expects additional rate increases will be needed in the coming months in keeping with her view that ""much too high"" inflation will not begin to moderate until the second half of this year. She noted there is a substantial risk price pressures may persist.
Elsewhere, she called for the Fed's balance sheet to be reduced to an appropriate and manageable level in order to help bring down inflation, but as with rate increases, for now, she remains data dependent on the timeline.

""Looking beyond this spring, my views on the appropriate pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction for this year and beyond will depend on how the economy evolves,"" Bowman said. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been publicly silent since January, will likely provide an update on his own thoughts when he appears before Congress on March 2 and 3, where he will give an update on the economic outlook.

(Reuters) - It is too early to know if the Federal Reserve will need to start its tightening cycle at its next policy meeting in March with a half percentage point rate rise, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said on Monday, as she pointed to upcoming data as the deciding factor.
""Between now and then it's very important that we continue to watch how the economy develops and to understand whether or not things are improving or getting worse as we are approaching that decision,"" Bowman said when asked at an American Bankers Association conference in Palm Desert, California, if she supported a larger initial rate rise in light of stubbornly high inflation. ""At this point I think it's too soon to tell.""

""Exports will keep benefiting from buoyant growth in the United States, and consumption will grow thanks to an increasing share of the population being vaccinated and the gradual improvement in the labor market,"" the OECD said in a report.
The OECD expects Mexico's gross domestic product (GDP) expanding by 2.3% in 2022 and 2.6% in 2023, after the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain snags including a shortage of semiconductor chips took a hit on the economy.
The inter-governmental economic group said there was a high level of uncertainty over its projections, with risks including a potential COVID-19 spike, persistent inflation and the possibility of crime increasing.
The OECD recommended that Mexico's central bank keep raising interest rates in light of high headline inflation, although the group said it foresees that prices will ""trend down"" throughout the year.
Rising prices hit a two-decade high in December with headline inflation at 7.07%, above the Bank of Mexico's 3% target.
The OECD also cautioned that concerns over a contentious proposed reform to strengthen state control of the power market has hindered investment that had already been falling since 2019.
""Uncertainty particularly increased following proposals to reform the electricity market,"" the report said.
Still, it signaled Mexico could recover investment through clear policy decisions.
""Of particular importance are reforms to provide certainty about existing contracts and regulatory stability,"" the report said.
The OECD also expressed concern toward highly indebted state oil company Pemex, saying it remains a ""significant risk for the sovereign.""

The amount approved was 2.9 trillion won more than the sum unveiled last month.
The bill includes provisions for more than 3 million small businesses and self-employed people to receive 3 million won each in relief money, starting as soon as the end of this month, according to a Finance Ministry statement. 
The extra budget comes as the ruling Democratic Party struggles to recover public support before a presidential election on March 9.
The additional 2.9 trillion won added to the final bill includes 1.3 trillion won earmarked for financial support for pandemic-hit businesses such as cafes, restaurants, and accommodation facilities, according to the ministry statement.
Another 1.3 trillion won was added to secure more COVID-19 treatments, test kits, hospital beds and for other quarantine measures, the ministry said.
To finance the added 2.9 trillion won, the government will utilise public fund reserves and net budget surplus, and therefore there will be no change to the debt-to-GDP ratio of 50.1%, the ministry added.
With the latest supplementary budget, total government spending increases to a record 624.3 trillion won this year.

South Korea's new daily COVID-19 cases topped 100,000 for the first time last week amid its Omicron outbreak, with authorities saying social distancing measures would be only slightly eased ahead of the March election.

Such an audit is on a list of reforms that donors have demanded before helping Lebanon climb out of a financial crisis that has locked most savers out of dollar-denominated bank accounts and left four in five Lebanese poor, according to UN agencies. These reforms include steps to tackle corruption, a root cause of the meltdown that has crashed the currency and triggered a sovereign default.
The Lebanese parliament adopted a law in December 2020 that lifts banking secrecy in regard to the central bank audit for one year. The law expired at the end of last year. 
MP Ibrahim Kanaan, head of parliament's finance committee, said the law had now been extended until the completion of the audit. ""This law puts the forensic audit on the final track,"" Kanaan said in televised remarks. 

Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal (A&M), which the Lebanese government has hired to carry out the audit, initially withdrew in November 2020 saying it had not received the information it required. A second contract was signed in September 2021, but the audit has not yet commenced amid requests by A&M for more information from the central bank.
A central bank spokesperson told Reuters earlier this month that the central bank had provided ""all info"" and urged A&M to commence.

Europe's largest economy went into reverse in the last three months of 2021 as its large industrial sector was hit by supply snags.
These were now easing but the rapid spread of the Omicron variant was affecting services and employment in general. 
""Unlike in previous waves of the pandemic it is not just activity in the services sector that is likely affected by containment measures and behavioural changes,"" Germany's central bank wrote in a monthly report.

""Instead, pandemic-related absence from work is likely to dampen economic activity markedly also in other sectors.""

(Reuters) - Following are some excerpts taken from Singapore's 2022 budget proposals announced by Finance Minister Lawrence Wong to parliament on Friday.
For a full story, see
SUPPORT PACKAGES 
- ""There are segments of the economy still struggling. I will therefore provide targeted help for our workers and businesses in these sectors through a S$500 million ($372.61 million) jobs and business support package."" 
- ""I recognise the immediate concerns of businesses and households and will provide significant additional support ... these amount to a significant package of S$560 million to help Singaporeans with their utility bills, children's education, and daily essentials.""
SPENDING AND REVENUE
- ""On the expenditure side, our needs are significant and growing. By 2030 we expect government expenditures to increase to more than 20% of GDP. Most of this increase in spending will go to healthcare.""
- ""We will set aside S$6 billion to maintain a multi layer public health defence. This is necessary for us to respond nimbly and confidently to the evolving COVID-19 situation."" 
- ""On the revenue side we would not have enough to cover additional spending needs... This is why we will make significant enhancements in our tax system in this budget."" 
WEALTH TAXES
- ""Wealth taxes are therefore needed to build a fairer society where everyone can aspire to succeed, regardless of their backgrounds ... Ideally, we would want to tax the net wealth of individuals. But such a tax is not easy to implement.""
- ""I will increase the property tax rates or non owner-occupied residential properties which includes investment properties. For such properties, I will increase the property tax rates from 10 to 20% ... to 12 to 36% of all non owner-occupied residential properties.
- ""When fully implemented, they will raise our property tax revenue by about $380 million a year.""
- ""I will also tax luxury cars at a higher rate to make our vehicle tax system more progressive. I will introduce an additional ARF (additional registration fee) tier for cars at a rate of 220% for the portion of open market value in excess of $80,000."" 
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
""I also understand the concern that Singaporeans have about the GST increase taking place at the same time as rising prices. I have therefore decided to delay the GST increase to 2023 and to stagger the increase over two steps. The first increase will take place on first January 2023, from 7 to 8%. And the second increase on first January 2024, from 8 to 9%."" 
CORPORATE AND INCOME TAXES
""I will therefore increase the top marginal personal income tax, or PIT rate, with effect from the year of assessment 2024. For the portion of chargeable income in excess of $500,000 up to $1 million will be taxed at 23%, while that in excess of $1 million will be taxed at 24% both up from 22% today. This increase is expected to affect the top 1.2% of personal income taxpayers and will raise $170 million of additional tax revenue per year.
-""Our corporate tax system will need to be updated due to global tax developments.""
""What this means is that if such an MNE (multinational enterprise) were to have an effective tax rate of less than 15% in Singapore at the group level, other jurisdictions such as its home jurisdiction can collect the difference up to 15%.""
""We will adjust our tax system in response ... We are exploring a top-up tax called the Minimum Effective Tax Rate, or METR. The METR will top up the MNE group'ss effective tax rate
in Singapore to 15%.""
INVESTMENT AREAS
- ""This budget will set up the key changes we must make to invest in new capabilities we must take to invest in new capabilities, advance our green transition, review and strengthen our social compact and develop a faired and more resilient structure.""
- ""We will also invest in future technologies like 6G, to ride the next communications and connectivity wave."" 
- ""Alongside infrastructure improvements I will set aside an additional S$200 million offer the next few years to enhance schemes and build digital capabilities in our businesses and workers.""
FOREIGN EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES
- ""Let me emphasise that Singapore will continue to stay open and welcome talent from around the world. The adjustments in our foreign worker policies apply mainly to the broad middle of the workforce."" 
- ""We will update the framework for employment pass (EP) holders... From September this year the minimum qualifying salary for new EP applicants will be raise from the current S$4,500 to S$5,000. For the financial sector, which has a higher salary norms, this will be raised from the current S$5,000 to S$5,500.""
- ""We will refine how we assess EP applications to improve the complementarily and diversity of our foreign workforce and also to increase certainty and transparency of businesses.""
- ""All of us, businesses, consumers and taxpayers will have to do our part and contribute to uplifting our lower wage workers. I recognise that some firms may need time to adjust ... Others may find it difficult to raise prices in the short term to support the wage increases.""
- ""I would therefore introduce the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme, or PWCS, to provide transitional support for businesses."" 
- ""Under the PWCS, the government will co-fund the wage increases of lower wage workers between 2022 and 2026. For workers earning up to S$2,500 the PWCS co-funding rate will be 50% in the first two years 30% In the next two years before tapering to 15% in 2026."" 
- ""We will spend an average of S$1.8 billion per year over the next five years or $9 billion in total for the PWCS and the enhanced Workfare... It is a significant increase and it reflects our shared commitment to uplift our lower wage workers.""
GREEN COMMITMENTS
- ""We believe we can bring forward our net zero timeline. We will therefore raise our ambition to achieve net zero emissions by or around mid-century.""
- ""The path towards net zero will entail significant economic restructuring and changes in how we live and work in the future. Everyone ...will face difficulty choices. Costly investments may be required."" 
- ""We aim to issue $35 billion in green bonds by 2030 to fund public sector green infrastructure. This will include bonds issued by the government as well as statutory boards."" 

- ""To move decisively to achieve our new net-zero ambition. You will need a higher carbon tax. I will therefore raise our carbon tax to $25 per tonne in 2024 and 2025 and $45 per tonne in 2026 and 2027 with a view to reaching 50 to $80 per tonne by 2030. The current tax of $5 per tonne remain will remain unchanged until 2023.""

867,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 04:32AM ET</span>",,,,,,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Swedish rate-setters were split over how fast to start tightening policy at their most recent meeting, the minutes published on Monday showed, but a surge in January inflation could tip the scales in favour of speeding up the exit from pandemic-induced measures.
At the meeting, the Riksbank broadly stuck to its previous plans to keep its balance sheet at the current level through the year and that the repo rate would not rise from 0% until the second half of 2024.
But rate-setters were evenly divided, with three of six wanting to start shrinking the balance sheet this year. Deputy Governor Anna Breman also wanted to bring forward rate hikes. 
Governor Stefan Ingves cast the deciding vote in favour of no change.
The minutes showed that three dissenters were all worried about inflation staying higher for longer than in the Riksbank's forecast, even in Sweden.
""For each inflation outcome published for the countries important to Swedish trade, it becomes increasingly clear that the higher inflation figures are not a transitory phenomenon,"" Deputy Governor Henry Ohlsson said.
The more dovish members saw inflation easing in the months ahead. The debate, however, may already be academic after January inflation figures, published after the Feb. 9-10 meeting, showed a surge in underlying prices.
Core inflation hit 2.5%, undermining the argument of the more dovish board members that inflation has mainly been due to energy prices.
The next meeting is in April and agreeing to a shrinking of the balance sheet this year looks like a minimum response, unless January's inflation number is a one-off.

Even before the last meeting, markets were betting on a rate hike coming long before the Riksbank had forecast, bringing Sweden's central bank more in line with peers.
With inflation surging, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to start hiking rates in March. The Bank of England has already done so and even the European Central Bank has left the door open for a hike this year.

868,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 01:55AM ET</span>",,,,,,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A key Japanese parliamentary committee on Monday approved the government's record $940 billion initial spending plan for the next fiscal year, setting the stage for the budget's full passage through the legislature in March.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is counting on the budget to pull the world's third-largest economy out of the COVID-19-induced doldrums with the economy set to slow to a crawl this quarter.
The budget for the new fiscal year beginning in April, worth 107.6 trillion yen ($936.14 billion), is Japan's biggest initial spending plan.
The expansive fiscal package will also add to strains for the industrial world's heaviest debt burden, which is more than twice the size of Japan's $5 trillion economy.
The budget was approved on Monday by ruling party lawmakers at the lower house budget committee. It would be put to a vote on Tuesday in the plenary, as agree by ruling and opposition blocs.
Given the ruling bloc's majority in the both chambers of parliament, the budget bill would be enacted 30 days after it is sent to the upper house.
It marked the quickest enactment of a budget since 1999.
Kishida has vowed to bring the primary budget, which excludes new bond sales and debt-servicing costs, to surplus by fiscal 2025, while he is facing pressure within his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to spend more before the July upper house elections.
The first annual budget compiled under Kishida's cabinet followed an extra 36 trillion yen in spending for this fiscal year as he has vowed to implement seamless spending over a 16-month period to keep the economy afloat.
Bigger spending meant fiscal discipline was weakening among policymakers who are counting on the Bank of Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy to keep borrowing costs low, analysts said.

The budget includes 5 trillion yen for emergency COVID-19 costs, a record defence outlay of 5.37 trillion, with both welfare cost of 36.3 trillion and 24.3 trillion yen for debt servicing accounting for more than half the annual spending.

(Reuters) -European companies hoping to fund M&A and capital expenditures on bond markets this year are facing a sudden jump in borrowing costs and wary buyers after the ECB's shock pivot towards tighter monetary policy.
Bond issues are a key source of funding for companies and have grown in importance relative to bank loans in the euro zone, particularly since the financial crisis.
Caught out by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde's hawkish tone after the bank's February meeting - which opened the door to rate hikes this year - bonds from investment-grade (IG) European firms have seen yields surge 60 basis points. 
Euro credit had been less hit by January volatility stirred by the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkishness, with IG bonds delivering less than half the losses in the United States. 
But those falls accelerated post-ECB and yields have more than doubled this year to as high as 1.18%, the highest since May 2020, according to BofA. 
That's still extremely low, but a sudden jump in borrowing costs is significant. If continued, it can impact companies' ability to invest, eventually slowing economic growth, so central banks watch credit spreads carefully. 
Nearly half of investors in BofA's February credit investor survey said IG spreads rising to 150-175 bps, from around 110 bps currently, would prompt a dovish turn from the ECB. 
A mergers and acquisitions boom and the need for capital investment has been seen by many as driving a rise in European corporate bond sales this year -- JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) for instance expects a record 645 billion euros of IG issuance. 
While moves so far are not enough to derail those expectations, Helene Jolly, head of EMEA IG corporate syndicate at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), said borrowers and investors were adjusting to ""the new normal"".
""Corporates have had to look at the new levels of coupons that are being required because of the rates being paid... and investors have had to think about what does this mean for me, what's my outlook on rates now and where do I want to play,"" Jolly said. 
Sentiment has turned rapidly -- just 16% of European credit investors are positioned net long on IG debt, the lowest since 2019 and down from 27% in December, while corporate debt funds are holding more cash than they have in years, BofA's survey found. 
One consequence has been declining bond sales -- in the two weeks since the ECB meeting companies have raised around 9 billion euros, similar to volumes in the single week up to the meeting, according to Refinitiv IFR data. Several sessions delivered zero issuance.
WARY 
Because many companies borrowed cheaply and abundantly during the pandemic, there is no panic over their ability to refinance debt, even for sub-investment grade, ""junk"" issuers. 
Just two junk issuers have sold bonds since the ECB, according to IFR. The vast majority of issuance came from Italian credit management and data group Cerved, which raised most of its funding from a floating-rate bond. Those compensate investors as interest rates rise.
""People are wary about new issues, not because they think they are bad credits, but they're concerned that if you buy a credit with a 3.5% yield today and in a week the same credit is yielding 3.75%, your bond's down a couple of points,"" said Ben Thompson, JPMorgan's co-head of EMEA leveraged finance capital markets.
ISSUANCE BOOM? 
Issuers may have to start hitting markets soon with the ECB expected to halt bond purchases by September. 
The ECB last year bought over 70 billion euros of company debt, around 6% of its total purchases during that period. 
IG spreads have widened over 25 bps this year and the additional premium companies pay for new bond sales are already higher than the average since 2015, according to BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). 
Viktor Hjort, global head of credit strategy at BNP, estimates an upcoming rush for M&A and capex-linked borrowing could widen spreads another 15 bps. 
""Corporates have significant need for spending, especially capex, which is unsustainably low... so the credit market is going to have to fund a capex cycle, and it's also facing a demand shock,"" Hjort said. 
In the junk market, critical for financing leveraged buyouts, the average coupon on BofA's index exceeds its yield, according to Refinitiv Datastream, so on average, new issuance will cost firms more than the interest on their current debt. 
Still, higher yields aren't expected to derail borrowing.
Shanawaz Bhimji, strategist at ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd), estimates that firms' total returns from equity this year will exceed the current cost of equity even when assuming a much higher cost of net debt than current rates, so they should continue investing in M&A and capex. 

To cheapen funding, borrowers may opt for shorter-dated financing or issue floating-rate notes, patterns already emerging on some deals, the bankers said. 
""Issuers are going to have to be realistic about the cost of debt,"" Thompson at JPMorgan said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - For more than a decade, Lebanon's central bank charged commercial banks in the country commissions when they bought government securities without making clear that the bulk of those commissions went to a company controlled by the brother of the central bank's governor, according to documents seen by Reuters.
Four contracts between Banque du Liban (BDL) and a Lebanese commercial bank seen by Reuters, dated from 2004 to 2014, state that the bank entering into the contract agreed to pay 3/8 of 1% commission on purchases of government certificates of deposit worth millions of dollars. Such contracts were standard for commercial banks making such purchases at the time, two senior executives in the finance industry told Reuters. 
The contracts seen by Reuters make no reference to Forry Associates, a company controlled by Raja Salameh, brother of central bank governor Riad Salameh. That company ultimately received such commissions, Riad Salameh told Reuters in an interview in November. His brother, Raja Salameh, could not be reached for comment. 
Forry's ""only job was to gather all these commissions and fees and redistribute according to the instructions,"" Riad Salameh told Reuters, without specifying what these instructions were. Salameh said the commissions were transparent and approved by the board of the central bank, and that no one raised any complaints at the time.
Halim Berti, a spokesman for BDL, told Reuters the central bank's board could not respond to questions about its decisions, as only the governor was authorized to speak on behalf of the bank. 
The commissions, and where they went, are the subject of investigations in Europe and Lebanon.
Swiss authorities suspect the Salameh brothers may have illegally taken more than $300 million in this way from BDL between 2002 and 2015, laundering some of the money in Switzerland, according to a letter the Swiss attorney general sent to Lebanese officials last year, which was seen by Reuters. 
The Swiss attorney general's office told Reuters it is conducting a criminal investigation into suspicions of ""aggravated money laundering related to alleged embezzlement offences to the detriment of BDL,"" but declined to comment further for this story. 
Salameh said such commissions as those in the contracts seen by Reuters were paid to Forry. He denies embezzlement, saying none of the commission money belonged to the central bank, a publicly owned institution.
He told Reuters that the commissions were paid into what he called a ""clearing account"" at the central bank, and then subsequently paid to Forry. He said he hired the audit firm BDO Semaan, Gholam & Co to look into the matter. The auditor's report found that ""no funds belonging to BDL went into this account,"" Salameh told Reuters in November. He declined to show the report to Reuters. BDO Semaan declined comment.
However, details of the contracts seen by Reuters, which have not previously been reported, show that the commissions were to be paid to BDL. Three contracts, written in Arabic and printed on paper bearing the central bank's letterhead, state: ""We authorize you to deduct a commission of 3/8 of 1%,"" where ""you"" refers to the central bank. In none of the contracts is Forry mentioned. 
Five people who hold, or recently held, senior positions in the Lebanese financial system and had direct knowledge of such contracts told Reuters they had never heard of Forry until the Swiss investigation was reported last year. 
Salameh said BDL's relationship with Forry, which started in 2002, was not exclusive. Six other firms performed similar services for the central bank, he said. Asked by Reuters, he declined to name those firms. 
INVESTIGATION HITS RESISTANCE 
Experts say it is not unusual for central banks to charge commissions on some transactions. But the fee money usually goes direct to the central banks to help them fund operations and reduce their reliance on public funding. Sending commissions to third parties would be unusual and defeat the purpose of imposing such fees, they say. 
""These are clearly public funds, because if the commission wasn't paid"" to Forry, ""the central bank would've gotten a better deal"" by receiving the fee itself, said Mike Azar, an expert on Lebanon's financial system and former economics professor at Johns Hopkins University in the United States. 
Salameh, 71, has been governor of Lebanon's central bank for 29 years. Public scrutiny of him has increased since the country's financial collapse in 2019. Once highly regarded for his stewardship of the banking system, he is now blamed by many for the collapse and the subsequent plunge in the value of the Lebanese pound, which has effectively impoverished most Lebanese people. Salameh has denied responsibility, blaming politicians who he says oversaw decades of profligate spending. 
Salameh still has the support of some of Lebanon's most powerful politicians, including Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Najib Mikati. 
Lebanese prosecutor Jean Tannous told Reuters in November he was investigating Salameh on suspicion of embezzlement of public funds, illicit enrichment and money laundering. But his investigation has run into resistance. 
Commercial banks have refused to give Tannous access to account information he has been seeking to use as evidence, citing the country's 1950s banking secrecy laws, according to four people familiar with the investigation. The people said the banks told Tannous to ask for such information from the central bank's Special Investigation Commission (SIC), which is headed by Salameh himself.

Tannous declined to comment for this story. The SIC did not respond to a request for comment.
Lebanon's top prosecutor, Ghassan Oueidat, stopped Tannous from attending a Paris meeting of European prosecutors in January designed to coordinate and share information on Salameh, according to correspondence seen by Reuters between Oueidat and a member of Eurojust, the European Union criminal justice agency organizing the meeting. Oueidat and Eurojust declined to comment.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Prospects of tighter U.S. monetary policy continue to drive up yields for Japan's super-long government bonds, putting to test the central bank's resolve to defend its key 10-year target.
The 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield moved back below an implicit 0.25% cap the Bank of Japan sets around its 0% target, after the central bank stepped in on Monday with a rare offer to buy an unlimited amount of the tenor at the level.
But 30-year and 40-year yields have crept up to multi-year highs, drawing investors' attention to the BOJ's response and how long it could keep defending the key 10-year target.
WHEN WOULD THE BOJ INTERVENE AGAIN?
The BOJ's focus is to avoid the 10-year JGB yield from rising above 0.25% and push up borrowing costs too much. It could step in again even before the yield hits 0.25%, if the rise in yields speeds up and risks breaching the line.
WILL THE BOJ INTERVENE TO CAP OTHER MATURITY YIELDS?
Under yield curve control, the BOJ seeks to control the shape of the curve by pinning short-term rates and the 10-year JGB yield. It does not set any target level for other zones.
As such, the BOJ likely won't intervene to stem rises in yields with maturities other than the 10-year, unless the moves could threaten to push up the 10-year yield above 0.25%.
For now, the BOJ sees the recent steepening of the yield curve as a desirable move as it widens the margin financial institutions earn from loans and investment.
WHAT'S NEXT?
If upward pressure on the 10-year yield continues to build up, the BOJ can conduct fixed-rate bond buying operations for as many consecutive days as necessary - the most powerful tool available to contain an unwelcome rise in borrowing costs.
The central bank also has the option of conducting an unscheduled bond-buying operation, or ramp up the amount of scheduled bond purchases released once every quarter.
HOW MUCH FIREPOWER DOES THE BOJ HAVE LEFT?
After years of heavy buying to pump money into the economy, the BOJ owns nearly half of outstanding JGBs. Its strong grip on the market allows it to control yields without ramping up buying much. Theoretically, the central bank can print as much money as it wants to keep buying JGBs to achieve its yield target.
WHAT ARE THE CONSTRAINTS?
The BOJ is chasing two conflicting goals. It wants to protect its yield cap to keep borrowing costs low. But it also hopes to avoid controlling yields too much and roll back recent efforts to breathe life back to a market made dormant by its huge presence.

That means the BOJ probably wants to limit the number of times it intervenes in the market. It will also avoid ramping up bond buying unless doing so becomes absolutely necessary to keep the 10-year yield from breaching 0.25%.
The yen's recent weakening won't deter the BOJ from stepping in to prevent yields from rising. But it may come under pressure to allow yields to rise more, if further yen declines boost import costs and draw public complaints about the rising cost of living.

Western leaders have until now refused to be drawn on the details of the responses they have agreed on if Russia invaded, only ruling out a military response and promising economic sanctions that would be unprecedented in scale.
""Russia would in principle be cut off from the international financial markets,"" Von der Leyen told ARD public television late on Sunday evening. Sanctions would be imposed on ""all goods we make that Russia urgently needs to modernise and diversify its economy, where we are globally dominant and they have no replacement,"" she said.
She said sanctions would not be imposed until after any invasion, rejecting calls on Saturday by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for immediate sanctions.
""The move to sanctions is so enormous and consequential that we know we must always give Russia a chance to return to diplomacy and the negotiating table,"" she said. ""This window is still open.""
Russia, which has stationed some 150,000 soldiers around Ukraine's northern and eastern borders, is demanding a guarantee that Ukraine never be allowed to join the NATO alliance, something President Vladimir Putin says is essential to Russia's long term security.

But Von der Leyen, who heads the 27-member European Union's executive, said Russia's reliance on fossil fuel exports was its weakness.
""They make up two thirds of its exports, and half of the Russia budget comes from them,"" she said. Russia needed to modernise, and ""precisely that would no longer be possible"" if further sanctions were raised.

Investing.com -- Rising tensions between Moscow and the West over Ukraine and speculation about monetary policy look set to keep investors on edge in the coming holiday-shortened week. Concerns over elevated inflation will also remain to the fore with the release of a key U.S. inflation metric along with a string of earnings results from major U.S. retailers. Oil prices will remain in focus, while the U.K. and the Eurozone are to release PMI data that may show the economic impact of easing Covid-19 restrictions. Here's what you need to know to start your week.
The U.S. market will be closed on Monday for the Presidents' Day holiday, but investors are likely to be facing another choppy week as fears over a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine underpins demand for safe haven assets.
Ongoing uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s next policy move is also likely to continue to weigh on equities.
The Fed has signaled that it will hike interest rates at its upcoming meeting in March to bring down inflation, which has surged past the central bank’s 2% target to hit its highest levels in four decades, but it has not indicated how aggressively it will act.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard has called for aggressive steps to curb inflation, while New York Fed chief John Williams said Friday he sees little need for the central bank to go big at the start of its rate-hike cycle.
""This is a confused market, confused about Ukraine, confused about how aggressive the Fed is going to be, and pretty much ignoring very strong earnings results from the fourth quarter,"" Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York told Reuters.
Amid speculation over the prospect of a half percentage point rate increase from the Fed in March Friday’s data on the personal consumption expenditures price index will be closely watched.
The PCE price index, rumored to be the Fed's favorite inflation measure is forecast to have risen 6% year-over-year in January, while the core reading, which excludes food and fuel prices, is expected to rise 5.2%.
The PCE data is released as part of the report on personal income and spending. Other economic data on Friday includes revised data on consumer sentiment, pending home sales numbers for January and a report on durable goods orders, also for January.
There will also be speeches from several Fed officials during the week, including Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Fed Governor Christopher Waller.
After a strong rebound in January retail sales, consumers are back in focus and a string of earnings results from major retailers this week will be parsed for signs of how surging inflation is affecting spending. Despite the rebound in retail sales, consumer sentiment has dropped to a decade low in recent months leading to fears that the economic recovery could stall.
 Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), Macy's (NYSE:M) and  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) are among those scheduled to report fourth quarter results during the week. Other companies reporting earnings include Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD),  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR),  Krispy Kreme  (NASDAQ:DNUT) and Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND).
In addition to bottom lines, investors will be looking to see how companies are dealing with the supply chain crunch and their views on inflation.
Oil prices could be set for another mixed week as energy traders weigh a potential supply disruption resulting from the Russia-Ukraine crisis against the prospect of increased Iranian oil exports.
Fears over possible supply disruptions from sanctions on top exporter Russia if it attacks Ukraine have supported prices, which have also been underpinned by a recovery in demand from the pandemic.
U.S. crude prices are hovering around $91 a barrel and last week reached their highest level since 2014, while the price for Brent, the global benchmark, is near seven-year highs.
Higher oil prices are contributing to soaring inflation, adding to concerns that the Fed will need to aggressively tighten monetary policy to curb consumer prices.
Investors will also have the chance to measure the effect of higher oil prices on energy companies’ earnings this week when Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Coterra Energy (NYSE:CTRA) all report.
The U.K. and the Eurozone are to release PMI data for February on Monday that may show a boost to economic activity with governments removing more pandemic era restrictions. Germany’s Ifo business climate index on Tuesday will also be closely watched.
Positive signs of an economic recovery could encourage central banks to unwind post-pandemic stimulus fast.
The Bank of England is on track to raise rates again in March while European Central Bank policymakers are still debating whether rates will need to rise this year in order to curtail inflation.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey along with several policymakers are due to appear before Parliament's Treasury Committee on Wednesday to answer questions on inflation and the economic outlook.
Meanwhile, several ECB officials are due to make appearances during the week, including Vice President Luis de Guindos and Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The United States and the United Arab Emirates are seeking an additional $4 billion of global investment in an initiative launched last year to make agriculture resilient to climate change and reduce its emissions, a U.S. official said on Sunday.
The two countries launched the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) at COP26 climate talks in November, aiming for $4 billion investment from governments and non-government innovation partners between 2021-2025. 
AIM now wants $8 billion in climate-smart investment commitments by the November COP27 climate talks in Egypt, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Vilsack told Reuters ahead of AIM's first ministerial meeting in Dubai on Monday. 
""We believe we actually need to set a higher goal. President Biden believes we should get $8 billion by COP27,"" Vilsack said. 
The initiative is supported by 140 partners who have agreed to increase public and private investment in climate-smart agriculture research and practices. 
The initial $4 billion target comprised $1 billion each from the U.S. and UAE governments, $1.8 billion from other governments and $200 million from non-government partners. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently said it would invest $1 billion in pilot projects for climate-smart commodities, promoting farming, ranching and forestry practices that cut emissions. 
Vilsack said that initiative could qualify as part of U.S. AIM for Climate targets. ""There are a number of different ways those resources could be identified."" 
The U.S. farming industry is already battling the effects of climate change, including increased drought and flooding.
The UAE, a Gulf oil producer that imports the majority of its food and desalinates seawater for potable water is investing heavily in agricultural and water technologies, and clean energy.
The UAE hosts COP28 climate talks in 2023. 
""Agriculture and food systems offer immense opportunities for global climate action,"" UAE Climate Change Minister Mariam al-Mheiri said in a statement. 
 IBM  (NYSE:IBM)'s pro-bono Sustainability Accelerator will become one of AIM's partners and will start in India assisting smallholding farms to adopt climate-smart practices, Vilsack said. 

Washington will host an AIM for Climate summit in spring 2023. 
""We don't have time to waste,"" Vilsack said.

In a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday, World Bank President David Malpass said the group will continue to support the Ukrainian people and economy for short- and long-term financing needs, the group said in a statement.
The leaders met in Munich as Russia's strategic nuclear forces held exercises overseen by President Vladimir Putin and Washington accused Russian troops near Ukraine's border's of being ""poised to strike"".
The initial funds from the World Bank would be followed by further budget support and more reforms, including in the energy and climate areas, the statement said. Malpass and Zelenskiy also discussed a pipeline of projects for Ukraine, including energy efficiency, infrastructure, railways, and strengthening the economy and job opportunities in eastern Ukraine.

On Monday, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund said they had temporarily relocated some staff from Ukraine amid rising concerns about a potential Russian invasion, even as their lending to and support work for the country continued.
Over the last year, the World Bank has suspended operations with several countries where coups were staged, including Myanmar and Sudan.

878,"<span>Feb 19, 2022 11:50AM ET</span>",,,,,,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A vote in which nearly 1,700 workers at Mexico's Tridonex auto-parts plant will have the chance to elect a new union has been pushed back one week to Feb. 28, according to an official document seen by Reuters on Saturday.
Workers at the plant in the northern Mexico city of Matamoros began campaigning about two years ago to replace a union that they accused of failing to push for higher wages. 
In the upcoming vote, they will be able to choose between their current union, part of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), and an independent group, SNITIS. 
Documents from Mexico's federal labor board showed the vote was scheduled for Feb. 28 after initially being slated for Feb. 21.

Tridonex's unlisted U.S. parent, Cardone, faced U.S. government scrutiny last year in one of the first labor complaints under a new regional trade deal after workers said they were being denied the right to freely select their representation. 
Cardone said it will be neutral and work with the group elected by workers.

879,"<span>Feb 19, 2022 06:25AM ET</span>","BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's government hopes inflation will ease back to below 6% by the end of 2022 after hitting a near 15-year high of 7.9% at the start of the year, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Saturday.
Orban, who faces a closely fought election on April 3, added that his government would phase out price caps on fuel, some basic foods and mortgages once inflation starts slowing. Retail energy prices caps will remain in place, he said.
""The policy of the four price caps did not feel good, we are not out of our right minds,"" Orban told a business forum. ""But desperate times call for desperate measures.""
The nationalist leader also said his government could announce a new foreign investment worth 6 billion euros ($6.79 billion) before the election, but he gave no further details.
Late on Friday, Orban's government widened the scope of an interest rate freeze to home lease contracts.
Orban said tension between Ukraine and Russia and questions about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would ship natural gas to the European Union from Russia meant the outlook for energy price developments was uncertain in the coming months.

But he said the high external inflation environment would likely prevail in the foreseeable future.
