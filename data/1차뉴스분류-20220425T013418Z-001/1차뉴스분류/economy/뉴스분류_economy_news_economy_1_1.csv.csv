(Reuters) -The U.S. Commerce Department on Thursday confirmed it had identified seven Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 Planes operated by Belarusian national carrier Belavia that are in apparent violation of U.S. export controls.
The seven Belarusian-operated aircraft are the first to be identified since restrictions on Belarus were tightened last week. The Commerce Department said restrictions that bar them from operating services abroad should effectively ground them from future international flights. 
The list of planes subject to restrictions, imposed since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, now includes 146 Russian-owned or operated aircraft and seven Belarusian aircraft 
Belavia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The export controls bar companies around the world from providing any refueling, maintenance, repair, or spare parts or services to the identified airplanes.
The Commerce Department actions are part of the Biden administration's response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which the department said Belarus has enabled and supported.
Deputy Commerce Secretary Don Graves said: ""By rejecting the international rule of law, Russia and Belarus have made it clear that they do not deserve the benefits of participating in the global economy, and that includes international travel.""
Last week, the department stepped up its crackdown against Russian airlines, slapping Aeroflot, Azur Air, and UTair with enforcement actions for violating American export controls.
The enforcement action denies the three Russian carriers export privileges and targets the entire airlines, not just specific planes. The U.S. government believes the actions will over time make the carriers largely unable to continue flights.

Previously, the United States had identified more than 170 Boeing planes that Russian airlines were operating in violation of U.S. sanctions, including about 40 Aeroflot Boeing 737 and 777 planes, 21 Azur Boeing planes and 17 UTair Boeing aircraft. It has removed some that have left Russia.
The United States, European Union and other countries have barred Russian planes from U.S. airspace.

(Reuters) -A federal-state dispute over U.S. immigration policy heated up on Wednesday, as the White House lambasted Texas' governor over state inspections that have snarled truck traffic from Mexico, while Texas chartered a bus to carry migrants from the border to Washington.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki slammed the enhanced truck inspections ordered by Governor Greg Abbott last week, saying they are disrupting trade and leading to higher prices.
The border slowdown comes as U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is battling rising inflation and challenges to the movement of goods stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Governor Abbott’s unnecessary and redundant inspections of trucks transiting ports of entry between Texas and Mexico are causing significant disruptions to the food and automobile supply chains, delaying manufacturing, impacting jobs, and raising prices for families in Texas and across the country,"" Psaki said in a statement on Wednesday morning.
Abbott and Samuel Alejandro Garcia Sepulveda, governor of the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, announced on Wednesday that they had reached an agreement for increased security on the Mexican side of the border to combat illegal immigration.
Abbott said the agreement would allow Texas to cease the stepped-up inspections for vehicles coming from Nuevo Leon, but that they would continue at other border crossings unless similar agreements are reached, adding that he expected to meet with more Mexican officials this week.
""There are very real and very deadly consequences for Biden's refusal to secure the border,"" Abbott said.
Earlier on Wednesday, a bus chartered by the Texas government arrived in Washington, dropping off Colombian, Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan migrants who had been encountered at the border and released in Texas by federal border officials, Abbott's office said.
Republicans across the country have made opposition to the Democratic president's immigration policies a major focus in the run-up to Nov. 8 midterm elections where they hope to gain control of Congress and key state governorships.
Abbott, a Republican seeking a third term in office, ordered the state's Department of Public Safety last week to conduct ""enhanced safety inspections"" of vehicles as they cross from Mexico into Texas in order to uncover smuggling of people and contraband. 
The inspections were part of a broader effort to deter illegal immigration that included the busing of migrants to Washington and aimed to counter Biden's ""open borders"" policies, Abbott said.
By midday, the migrants arriving in Washington had dispersed from a dropoff point near the U.S. Capitol, with one local organization saying some Venezuelans had boarded another bus to Florida.
An Abbott spokesperson earlier in the week declined to say whether the enhanced inspections had uncovered any smuggling attempts, although Texas authorities took more than 500 vehicles out of service for safety violations such as defective brakes, tires and lighting.
A record number of migrants were caught at the U.S.-Mexico border during Biden's first year in office, fueling Republican attacks and straining government resources.
The Biden administration is preparing for even more arrivals in the coming months after U.S. health officials announced they would terminate a pandemic-era order that allowed asylum seekers and other migrants caught at the border to be rapidly expelled to Mexico to limit the spread of COVID-19.

Mexican truck drivers blockaded bridges at the U.S. border earlier in the week to protest Abbott's stepped-up inspections, which some drivers said caused waits that spanned more than half a day.
On Wednesday, an international bridge connecting Reynosa, Mexico, with Pharr, Texas, remained blocked by Mexican truckers while other crossings reopened but still experienced long lines due to the inspections by Texas authorities, truckers and Mexican officials told Reuters.

The Make More in America initiative will allow companies to tap existing medium- and long-term loans and loan guarantees for export-oriented domestic manufacturing projects as part of President Joe Biden’s push to bolster U.S. supply chains.
“The Make More in America Initiative will create new financing opportunities that spur manufacturing in the United States, support American jobs and boost America’s ability to compete with countries like China,” EXIM President and Chair Reta Jo Lewis said in a statement.

Biden has focused heavily on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States and ending decades of underinvestment, outsourcing to China and other countries.
The initiative, developed by EXIM in response to the supply chain executive order Biden signed in February 2021 https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/executive-order-on-americas-supply-chains, will give manufacturers access to fresh capital to fill critical supply chain gaps, particularly in areas such semiconductors, biotech and biomedical products, renewable energy, and energy storage.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -The European Central Bank confirmed plans on Thursday to end its hallmark stimulus scheme in the third quarter, worried that high inflation could become entrenched, even as the war in Ukraine left the outlook exceptionally uncertain.
The ECB has been unwinding support at a glacial pace, far slower than its peers, worried that growth could quickly crumble as the war, sky-high energy prices and the risk of losing access to Russian gas batter an already fragile economy. 
Even on Thursday it maintained a non-committal tone, avoiding any firm pledge beyond the end of bond buys, stressing that policy is flexible and can quickly change.
""The downside risks to the growth outlook have increased substantially as a result of the war in Ukraine,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said. 
""We will maintain optionality, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of our monetary policy,"" she said, speaking from home where she is recovering from the coronavirus.
But Lagarde also delivered a stark warning on inflation, noting that longer-term inflation expectations were showing early signs of moving above the ECB's 2% target.
Such a shift, called de-anchoring in central bank-speak, is a worrisome sign, suggesting markets' loss of confidence in the bank's ability to maintain price stability. 
""The last thing that we want is to see inflation expectations at the risk of de-anchoring,"" Lagarde said, adding that ""close monitoring"" would be required.
While Lagarde largely avoided discussion of any rate hike, her comments that it could come ""a week"" or months after the end of bond buys suggest that policymakers could discuss the issue at their late July meeting. 
Sources close to the discussion agreed, noting that a July rate move is still on the table but there were divisions in the Governing Council about risks, including on longer-term inflation prospects. [S8N2UQ05X]
JULY?
Economists meanwhile zeroed in on a later move but took note that Lagarde did not rule out a change in the minus 0.5% deposit rate during the summer, just before policymakers leave for their holidays.
""We still believe the ECB is unlikely to hike in July, but Lagarde wanted to make clear that the option was available,"" Pictet strategist Frederik Ducrozet said.
The ECB last raised interest rates over a decade ago and has kept its deposit rate in negative territory since 2014. 
Markets now price in 63 basis points of rate hikes before the end of the year, a modest retreat compared with 70 basis points priced in prior to the meeting.
The euro meanwhile fell sharply as some expected Lagarde to unveil a more decisive schedule to tighten policy. 
Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING, also saw September as the more likely lift-off date.
""We expect the ECB to stop net asset purchases in July and start hiking interest rates in September,"" he said. The ECB will definitely not get ahead of the central banks’ pack any time soon in terms of policy normalisation. It will be normalisation at a snail’s pace.""
Among the world's most cautious central banks, the ECB is already lagging far behind nearly all its major peers, many of which started raising rates last year. 
In the past two days alone, the central banks of Canada, South Korea and New Zealand have all increased the cost of borrowing. The U.S Federal Reserve is meanwhile expected to raise rates eight times or more over the next two years, leading the world in policy tightening. [TOP/CEN]
Part of the ECB's caution is that the drivers of high inflation now are likely to weigh on price growth further out.
Energy prices driven higher by the Ukraine war are draining household savings and uncertainty caused by the conflict is halting corporate investment. Banks are also tightening access to credit as they naturally do during wars, potentially exacerbating the downturn.

Since this inflation is almost entirely the result of an external supply shock, price growth is likely to fall on its own over time, some policymakers argue. 
In fact, high energy prices sap savings, so the shock will eventually weigh on growth and thus drag inflation back under target, they argue.

4,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 11:41AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Moscow would work to redirect its energy exports eastward as Europe tries to reduce its reliance on them, adding that European nations would not be able to ditch Russian gas immediately.
Russia supplies around 40% of the EU's natural gas, and western sanctions over what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine have hit its energy exports by complicating the financing and logistics of existing deals.
While the EU debates whether to slap sanctions on Russian gas and oil and member states seek supplies from elsewhere, the Kremlin has been forging closer ties with China, the world's top energy consumer, and other Asian countries.
""The so-called partners from unfriendly countries concede themselves that they won't be able to make do without Russian energy resources, including without natural gas, for example,"" Putin told a televised government meeting.
""There is no rational replacement (for Russian gas) in Europe now.""
Putin also said that Europe, by talking about cutting off energy supplies from Russia, was driving up prices and destabilising the market.
He said Russia, which accounts for around a tenth of global oil production and around a fifth of gas, would need new infrastructure to boost energy supplies to Asia.
He ordered the government to present a plan by June 1 including on ""expanding transport infrastructure to countries of Africa, Latin America (and the) Asia Pacific.""
He also sought clarity on the possibility of including two pipelines - China-bound Power of Siberia and the far-eastern Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok in Russian unified system of gas supplies.
Plugging those routes into the wider network may allow Russia, in theory, to switch gas flows from Europe to Asia and visa versa.
Russia launched pipeline gas supplies to China in the end of 2019 and in February agreed a 30-year contract via a new pipeline, yet to be built, with plans to settle sales in euros. 
Putin also said that the role of national currencies in exporting deals should rise, amid Russia's plans to switch to roubles in payments for its gas supplies, mainly to Europe.
Russia has seen a steep decline in production of oil, its key source of revenues, amid difficulties with payments for trading and vessels.

Major global trading houses are planning to reduce crude and fuel purchases from Russia's state-controlled oil companies as early as May 15, sources said, to avoid falling foul of EU sanctions on Russia.
Putin said the sector's most acute problems were related to the disruption of energy supply logistics.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund will cut its global growth estimates for 2022 and 2023 as Russia's war in Ukraine drives food and energy prices higher, piling pressure on already fragile economies, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday, warning the world was in ""a very dangerous time.""
The global lender will downgrade its growth outlooks for 143 economies representing 86% of global economic output, although most countries will maintain positive growth, Georgieva said in a ""curtain raiser"" speech ahead of new forecasts to be released at next week's IMF and World Bank spring meetings.
Georgieva, who previously flagged a likely downgrade, said Russia's invasion of Ukraine was ""sending shockwaves throughout the globe"" and dealing a massive setback to countries struggling to recover from the still-raging COVID-19 pandemic.
""The root cause of what we face today is the war, and it is the war that must end,"" Georgieva said in remarks to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ""In economic terms, growth is down and inflation is up. In human terms, people's incomes are down and hardship is up.""
Western sanctions imposed on Russia reflected ""a global order that has been severely impacted,"" she added, warning of a major new threat, the fragmentation of the global economy into geopolitical blocs, with differing trade and technology standards, payment systems and reserve currencies.
She said the war was also aggravating food insecurity across the globe, given disruptions to grain and fertilizer supplies from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus that are driving up food prices and hitting the weakest countries the hardest.
Without urgent, coordinated action to bolster food supplies, many countries face more hunger, poverty and social unrest, she said. It was also imperative to improve longer-term resilience by diversifying agricultural production, much as vaccine production was spread out regionally during the pandemic.
The IMF anticipates that inflation, now a ""clear and present danger"" for many economies, will remain elevated for longer than previously expected.
Georgieva did not provide a specific target for global growth, but has said previously it would be lower than the 4.4% the IMF forecast in January, a figure already reduced by half a percentage point from the Fund's prior forecast due to lingering supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic.
""Since then, the outlook has deteriorated substantially, largely because of the war and its repercussions,"" she said. ""Inflation, financial tightening and frequent, wide-ranging lockdowns in China -- causing new bottlenecks in global supply chains -- are also weighing on activity."" 
THE THREAT OF FRAGMENTATION
Georgieva warned that fragmentation of the global economy was the biggest threat to the post-World War Two, U.S.-led economic order governed by the IMF, the World Bank, and other institutions created at the end of that conflict.
""Such a tectonic shift would incur painful adjustment costs. Supply chains, R&D, and production networks would be broken and need to be rebuilt,"" she said. ""Poor countries and poor people will bear the brunt of these dislocations.""
The shift is already impairing the world's ability to work together to resolve the Ukraine war and COVID-19 crises and threatens to derail cooperation on climate change and other challenges, she said.
She urged continued faith in coordinated action to address shared problems such as climate change and rapid technological change.

""Complex doesn't mean impossible... We have to remember that the answer need not be in isolation and fragmentation,"" she said, noting that the integration seen after the end of the Cold War had resulted in a tripling of the size of the global economy and sharp reductions in poverty for some 1.3 billion people.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen raised similar concerns on Wednesday about a ""bipolar"" global economy with the United States and democratic allies on one side, and China and other state-led economies on the other.

6,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 10:51AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russia's central bank sees room for an interest rate cut as weekly inflation is slowing, Deputy Governor Alexei Zabotkin said on Thursday, Interfax new agency reported.
It will present new economic forecasts to coincide with its next rate-setting meeting on April 29, TASS news agency quoted him as saying.
The bank raised the key rate to 20% in an emergency move in late February before cutting it to 17% last week.
Inflation in Russia could reach 17%-20% this year and the economy may contract by more than 10%, its deepest fall since 1994, according to Alexei Kudrin, the head of Russia's audit chamber and a former finance minister. 
After the emergency rate hike, capital controls and other measures put in place by the central bank, weekly inflation fell to 0.66% in the latest week, having grown by an average of 2% since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine. 
""The pace of price growth is still significantly higher than the inflation target but it is slowing down step by step,"" Zabotkin said. ""This gives us an opportunity to start gradually reducing the key rate.""
Weekly price growth of 0.1% equals the central bank's annual inflation target of 4%, Interfax quoted him as saying. The speed of future rate cuts will also be determined by the further normalisation of risks to financial stability, he added.
Year on year, inflation accelerated to 16.69% in March from 9.15% in February, and the central bank currently expects inflation will return to its target in 2024. 
During the first days of what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, Russians withdrew billions from their accounts, in roubles as well as euros and dollars, before the central bank introduced its curbs. 
On one day, ""nearly a yearly level of cash was withdrawn"" from banks, central bank first deputy chairwoman Ksenia Yudayeva was quoted as saying by Interfax. 
According to Zabotkin, the liquidity situation has stabilized and a significant part of the cash withdrawn has been returned to bank accounts. 
The central bank lost its ability to support the rouble after western sanctions froze nearly a half of its gold and forex reserves of $640 billion. Russia asked its exporting companies to sell 80% of their forex revenue on the market - a rule it is now preparing to ease. 

Asked whether the central bank had forecast the freeze, a sensitive issue which put its leadership under the fire, Yudayeva said on Thursday: ""What has happen was unprecedented... Everyone told us that such probability was very low."" 
Her boss, Governor Elvira Nabiullina, was proposed by President Vladimir Putin to serve another term and parliament is set to vote for the proposal on April 20.

But policymakers must also, while watching inflation, guard against the fallout from the war in Ukraine. The hit to consumer confidence from higher energy prices and disrupted supply chains might well darken the economic outlook, constraining monetary tightening.
Here is a look at where policymakers stand on the path out of the pandemic-era stimulus, ranked in terms of hawkishness.

1) NORWAY
The Norges Bank hiked rates by 25 basis points to 0.75% on March 24 and announced plans to hike at a faster pace than previously planned. 
Including the March move, the bank now plans eight hikes to bring rates to 2.50% by end-2023, three more than projected in March, and two more than anticipated in March by a Reuters poll. 
2) NEW ZEALAND 
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Wednesday reinforced its position as one of the world's most hawkish central banks. 
It raised the cash rate by 50 bps to 1.5%, the biggest rise in two decades and the fourth hike in the current cycle, and maintained its forecast for rates to peak around 3.35% by end-2023.

Having kicked off its rate-rise cycle in March, the Bank of Canada raised key rates on Wednesday by 50 bps to 1%, its biggest single move in more than two decades.
From next week, the BoC will also let maturing bonds roll off its balance sheet. BoC Governor Tiff Macklem reckons rates are still far below neutral levels, estimated between 2%-3%. Markets expect rates will hit 2.5% by year-end.

With inflation at a 30-year high, the Bank of England is under pressure to tighten policy further after three hikes since December. 
Markets are all but certain it will raise its benchmark by 25 bps to 1% on May 5, and then to 2%-2.25% by end-2022. 
However, with soaring energy prices threatening growth, the BoE has softened its language on the need for further tightening.

Inflation, which hit a 40-year high at 8.5%, may be starting to peak, but is expected to remain above the Fed's 2% target at least through 2023.

Markets' campaign to get the Reserve Bank of Australia to pivot hawkish succeeded on April 5, when it finally opened the door for its 0.1% cash rate to rise this year.
Data later this month is expected to show annual inflation at 3.2%, while a survey published on April 12 showed robust business conditions with the jobless rate possibly dropping below 4% this year for the first time since the 1970s. 
Futures price a 25 bps hike in June and imply a cumulative 200 bps of tightening by year-end. 
7) EURO ZONE 
The European Central Bank is among the most cautious of major central banks. On Thursday, it stuck to plans to slowly unwind extraordinary stimulus, weighing worries over record-high inflation against the risk that the war in Ukraine could drive the euro zone economy into recession.
Economists still expect the ECB to hike rates later this year and markets price around 60 bps of tightening by year-end.

Sweden's 6.1% inflation, the highest since 1991, may leave the dovish Riksbank no choice but turn into a hawk.
The bank will have to rethink its policy approach at its next meeting on April 28, deputy governor Martin Floden said last week. Governor Stefan Ingves, whose vote in February was the decider in keeping balance sheet plans unchanged this year, has made similar comments recently.
Current Riksbank guidance still sees a 2024 hike; markets see rates rising from zero to 1% by November.. 
9) SWITZERLAND
The Swiss National Bank remains in the dovish camp but with 2022 inflation projected at an above-target 2.1%, it is paying closer attention to prices.
Flight to safety sparked by the Ukraine conflict has forced the SNB to step up currency intervention, boostin Swiss sight deposits by 8 billion Swiss francs ($8.58 billion) in the past three weeks.

LE HAVRE (Reuters) -Marine Le Pen's plan to ban wind turbines is an ""aberration"", Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday as France's presidential election campaign moved away from the two candidates accusing each other of being authoritarian to focus on concrete policies.
Just 10 days ahead of a runoff that will determine who will lead the European Union's second-largest economy for the next five years, polls show the centrist president is slightly ahead of his far-right rival, but the contest promises to be tight.
While the cost of living is the top election theme, energy policies are closely linked to that, and the candidates have put forward very different policies on the renewables sector.
Both would boost the nuclear sector, but Macron wants France to build more wind turbines, while Le Pen - who calls wind turbines ""horrors that cost us a fortune"" - would end all subsidies to the solar and wind energy sector, apply a moratorium on both and dismantle already existing turbines.
""Exiting renewables today would be a complete aberration, we would be the only country in the world doing that,"" Macron told France Bleu radio on a visit to the northern France port of Le Havre. Her plan, he said, would mean ""spending hundreds of millions of euros dismantling existing wind turbines"".
Building nuclear plants would take time and would not cover the drop in production from dismantling the turbines, he added. 
Le Pen argues in her election platform https://mlafrance.fr/pdfs/projet-lecologie.pdf that boosting the nuclear sector as well as hydro power and thermal energy would provide France with the energy mix it needs. 
As well as seeking to cut reliance on fossil fuels in general to meet climate targets, EU states have been looking to renewables to help wean themselves off Russian gas after the West imposed sanctions due to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
The French Renewable Energy Trade Association (SER) said on Thursday that Le Pen's plans would be ""a major step backwards for our country and for the climate, by increasing our greenhouse gas emissions and our imports of fossil fuels, at the expense of taxpayers and the most precarious consumers"".
Le Pen's team did not respond to a request for comment.
Earlier on Thursday, Le Pen rebuffed criticism by Macron who accused her of retaining her ""authoritarian"" and extremist views, despite portraying a softer image in the campaign.
""This (criticism) makes me smile because we have never had a president who showed more signs of extremism than Emmanuel Macron,"" Le Pen told broadcaster France 2, citing police action against political demonstrations, such as the yellow vest movement.

Separately, France's election watchdog said it had sought clarifications from Le Pen's campaign over statements it had falsely attributed to public authorities on criminality and immigration, one of her core themes.
Le Pen called the step launched by the campaign control commission, or CNCCEP, a political ""manoeuvre"".

BERLIN (Reuters) -Inflation is the biggest threat to public finances and the European Central Bank should act on its mandate to stabilise prices, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner told Reuters, as the ECB kept its policy stance broadly unchanged on Thursday.
""The ECB's mandate is to ensure stable prices,"" Lindner said in an interview. ""The ECB cannot provide economic growth. Rising prices threaten the readiness to invest and weaken consumption. Inflation is the biggest threat to public finances and prosperity.""
Confirming its earlier guidance, the ECB said it plans to cut bond purchases, commonly known as quantitative easing, this quarter, then end them at some point in the third quarter. 
Interest rates will, however, only go up ""some time"" after the end of bond buys and this rise will be gradual, the ECB added.
The German government, like many in the euro zone, has had to roll out tax relief packages, subsidies and loans to help households and companies squeezed by exploding energy prices worsened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Germany is expected this year to take at least 224 billion euros ($243.15 billion) in new debt to finance increased spending on defence, inflation relief measures as well as on helping Ukrainian refugees, a record coming on top of unprecedented spending during the pandemic.
Lindner said subsidies must be capped and measures must be taken to boost productivity and growth, otherwise economies would be stuck in stagflation, a mixture of rising prices and anemic growth.
With mounting civilian deaths in Ukraine amid Russia's invasion, Europe's largest economy is also under pressure to wean itself off Russian gas and oil, as critics say the revenue provides Moscow with vital funds to wage war.
Lindner repeated German government claims that Germany could probably end Russian oil imports in a relatively short period of time without major disruption. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said this goal was possible by the end of this year.
Ending Russian gas imports is more complicated.

Lindner said Germany would use its presidency of the G7 to ensure leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies do not work with Russia as long as Vladimir Putin remains president.

10,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 09:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Reserve should reasonably consider raising interest rates by a half percentage point at its next meeting in May, New York Fed President John Williams said on Thursday, in a further sign even more cautious policymakers at the central bank are on board with a bigger rate hike. 
""I think that's a very reasonable option,"" Williams told Bloomberg Television in an interview. ""I do think from a monetary policy point of view, it does make sense for us to move expeditiously towards more normal levels of the federal funds rate, and also move forward on our balance sheet reduction plans.""
The Fed raised interest rates last month for the first time in three years, but uncertainty stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine kept it from raising rates more than a quarter-of-a-percentage point, minutes from its last policy meeting showed.
That now seems to have been overtaken by the need to move more urgently to contain inflation amid continued strength in the economy. Data on Tuesday showed consumer prices rose 8.5% in March, the biggest yearly rise since late 1981.

""We need to get to a more neutral or normal level of the fed funds rate,"" though whether that would be the end of the year or exactly when will depend on the data, Williams said, adding that the Fed should get ""real"" interest rates -- nominal borrowing costs minus expected the inflation rate -- back up to a more normal level by next year. 
The Fed needs to take the ""froth"" out of the economy, he said, but can do so and engineer a soft landing at the same time.

11,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 09:31AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Measures of underlying inflation in the euro zone have risen above the European Central Bank's 2% target and the ECB is closely monitoring inflation expectations, its president Christine Lagarde said on Thursday.
She said upside risks to the inflation outlook had intensified, especially in the near term.
Headline euro zone inflation hit a record high 7.5% last month, nearly four times the ECB's target, and price growth could accelerate for several months before peaking around mid-year as the war in Ukraine pushes up energy and some food prices.
""Measures of underlying inflation have risen to levels above 2% in recent months,"" Lagarde told a news conference, adding that it was uncertain how persistent the rise would prove.
""While various measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and from expert surveys largely stand at around 2%, initial signs of above-target revisions in those measures warrant close monitoring."" 
With much of the recent inflation driven by an external energy shock related to the war, price growth is likely to fall back on its own over time, especially since wage growth, a precondition for durable inflation, remains muted. 
But longer-term inflation expectations have started to move higher, raising fears they may become ""unanchored"", a phenomenon that worries policymakers as it suggests a loss of credibility. 

""The last thing that we want to see is inflation expectations at the risk of de-anchor(ing),"" Lagarde said.
Wage growth is also likely to follow, especially since the unemployment rate is at a record-low 6.8% and labour shortages have started to emerge.

(Reuters) - Sri Lanka's creditors face losing a third to half of their investment in the country's dollar bonds, after the government announced it would restructure $11 billion worth of debt, the first such financial shake-up in its modern history.
Formal debt talks haven't started but analysts are already crunching the numbers to estimate what kind of haircuts could be inflicted on bondholders.
Mired in economic crisis, Sri Lanka has halted all external debt payments and is prioritising its remaining hard currency reserves to buy food and fuel.. 
The country of 22 million has been hit by nationwide street protests and shortages of everything from power to medicines, and its dollar bonds trade at deeply distressed levels of around 40 cents in the dollar. 
With markets factoring in an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme as part of the debt overhaul, a $1 billion bond maturing on July 25 is valued at around 45 cents in the dollar, Refinitiv data showed.
Citi projects that, across the bonds maturing between 2022 and 2030, Sri Lanka may seek a coupon haircut of around 50%, a reduction of at least 20% in face value and maturity extensions between 10-13 years. 
""Assuming an 11% exit yield, we estimate that the recovery value on the dollar bonds in such a scenario could range in the low to mid 40s,"" Citi strategist Donato Guarino said, referring to the interest rate at which the new securities will trade on the day of the debt exchange.
Step-up coupons - interest payments that increase over time - could also play a role ""to give the government more time to recover"" after the restructuring, Guarino added, noting these were used in Ecuadorean and Argentine debt restructurings.
Tellimer analysts assumed in their base case scenario a 30% haircut. They assign a recovery value near 60 cents on the dollar for the bonds, with a 8% exit yield.
They also flagged an alternative scenario with a 42-cent recovery value and a 16% exit yield. 
UNWELCOME SURPRISES?
Tellimer senior economist Patrick Curran considers a 50% haircut a ""worst case"" scenario, with a recovery value as low as 30 cents for a 16% exit yield.
He highlighted the possibility that the debt overhaul might not be as swift as hoped. 
""While bondholders will receive some downside protection if negotiations drag out if interest is capitalised, prolonged delays will also make for a more onerous starting point and political risk will raise exit yields, potentially eroding recovery values,"" Curran added. 
Ratings agency S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) has said debt talks could be complicated and take ""many months"" to complete. 
On Wednesday, it lowered Sri Lanka's foreign currency rating to ""CC"" from ""CCC"" - two notches above the level denoting default - while Fitch cut its rating to ""C"" from ""CC""..
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts say the debt servicing moratorium is expected to pave the way for an IMF programme but warn a restructuring might be ""more comprehensive"" than what has been announced. 
As of now, the debt service suspension only covers about 55% of public debt, Citi calculates, noting the latest IMF report hints at a ""tough programme ahead"". 
The fund recommends tax reforms, and possibly, curbs on public-sector wages and capital expenditure. 
Asset managers BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Ashmore are among the top holders of Sri Lanka's international bonds. They are part of a fledgling creditor group, with White & Case acting as legal adviser.
Bondholders are in wait and see mode until the government picks a financial adviser, one creditor said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
""The group's idea so far is to be reactive, not proactive,"" the source said.

13,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 07:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank renewed its pledge to end bond-buying in the coming months, as record inflation raises the odds it will also lift interest rates for the first time in more than a decade before the year is out.
The Governing Council reiterated Thursday that it will halt net asset purchases in the third quarter -- an accelerated timeline agreed on last month with consumer prices now surging at almost four times the 2% target. It reaffirmed that “gradual” rate hikes will follow “some time after.”
“Inflation has increased significantly and will remain high over the coming months, mainly because of the sharp rise in energy costs,” the ECB said in a statement. “The Governing Council will take whatever action is needed to fulfill the ECB’s mandate to pursue price stability and to contribute to safeguarding financial stability.”
Money markets trimmed ECB tightening bets, pricing quarter-point rate hikes in September and December. German bonds rose, sending the 10-year yield one basis point lower to 0.75% after earlier climbing to 0.83%.
While still well behind the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in raising borrowing costs, the faster timetable for withdrawing stimulus underlines the ECB’s focus on taming price pressures -- stoked by the war in Ukraine -- over risks to the pandemic rebound in the 19-member euro zone.
But with Russia’s invasion complicating the task of forecasting, policy makers are likely to maintain flexibility by awaiting new projections in June before cementing an end-date for asset purchases. Economists predict the ECB will eventually select July as the cutoff and expect rate liftoff in December.
Some ECB officials back a similarly tough approach, though others fret that a steadier pace is needed as the conflict saps confidence and the prospect of a ban on Russian energy threatens recessions for economies such as Germany’s -- Europe’s largest.

President Christine Lagarde may offer some insight on how that debate is shaping up when she holds a news conference at 2:30 p.m. in Frankfurt.
She’s also likely to be asked about behind-the-scenes preparations for an instrument to deploy if the bond yields of weaker euro-area countries jump excessively as quantitative easing is phased out. 
The ECB’s staff is designing a backstop that would be available for the Governing Council to tackle shocks outside the control of individual governments, people familiar with the plans told Bloomberg last week, though it’s unclear what the tool would look like.

LONDON (Reuters) -British consumers spent more in early April, partly due to soaring fuel prices, but fewer people left their homes to go to work, shop or socialise, raising the prospect of an economic slowdown caused by a cost-of-living squeeze.
Weekly credit and debit card data showed spending in the week to April 7 was 2 percentage points higher than the week before, though this was not adjusted for seasonal factors or inflation.
The Office for National Statistics said overall spending was 6% higher than in February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic, while average prices have risen by more than 8% since then.
Consumer price inflation has picked up sharply over the past year and last month, budget forecasters predicted it would reach nearly 9% by the end of the year, ushering in the biggest cost-of-living squeeze since records began in the late 1950s.
The Bank of England expects growth to slow sharply this year as households' disposable income drops in real terms.
The most recent rise in spending was led by a 6-percentage-point week-on-week increase in 'work-related' spending, which includes the cost of fuel for commuting, the ONS said, while spending on socialising was up by 4 percentage points too.
The higher spending figures, which come from interbank CHAPS payments data collected by the BoE, contrast with a fall in the number of Britons visiting places of work, shops and restaurants over the same period.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Mobility figures published by the ONS showed a 4% week-on-week drop in visits to workplaces and a 1% decline in visits to 'retail stores and recreation areas', while OpenTable restaurant booking figures dropped by 2 percentage points.
Looking ahead, British banks are concerned that defaults on a wide range of loans will rise, according to a quarterly survey by the BoE, also published on Thursday. 
Rates of default for mortgages, unsecured consumer lending and business loans are all expected to be higher in the three months to the end of May than in the three months before.
That said, recent rates of default have been low, and concerns about big rises in default rates in previous surveys have not come to pass.
The survey also showed lenders intended to reduce the availability of mortgages by the most since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.

""The anticipated pull back in credit availability reflects rising market interest rates rather than ... criteria over which lenders have more control,"" said Andrew Wishart, senior property economist at Capital Economics.
Financial markets expect the BoE to raise rates to at least 2% by the end of the year, up from 0.75% currently.

Investing.com -- The world's richest man, Elon Musk, bids to take over Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), one of the world's biggest social media companies. The dollar's rally eases and bond yields stabilize well off their highs ahead of weekly jobless claims and retail sales, and monthly consumer sentiment data. The ECB holds its last policy meeting for eight weeks and Russia's Black Sea Fleet loses its flagship to an explosion as the U.S. sends yet more military aid to Ukraine. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 14th April.
1. Musk Offers to Buy Twitter 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO offered to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share in cash, valuing the social media company at $41.4 billion. That's a 38% premium to the price on the eve of Musk's disclosure 12 days ago that he had accumulated a ""passive"" 9.2% stake in the company. 
The offer may appease some of the Twitter shareholders who have filed suit against Musk for not disclosing the stake in a timely manner.
In any event, the prospect of the world's richest man taking over one of the world's most influential media assets is likely to cause a stir in Washington and among Tesla shareholders, some of whom have criticized Musk's interest in the company as a distraction.
2. Dollar weakens; Jobless claims, Michigan consumer sentiment
The dollar’s rally has paused, as market participants reassess the outlook for aggressive Federal Reserve moves in the wake of March’s consumer inflation data, when a slight undershoot in core inflation provided the first measure of relief in months from what has become an increasingly alarming trend in prices.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the dollar index was at 99.65, down 0.4% on the day and nearly a full percentage point below the peak it hit earlier in the week. The move is also due to other central banks showing their inflation-fighting credentials, with Canada and New Zealand hiking their key rates by 50 basis points each on Wednesday and the BoC starting to allow its bond portfolio to roll off.
U.S. bond yields have also eased, with the 2-Year and 10-Year Treasury yields stabilizing around 2.34% and 2.70%, respectively, overnight. That may change later when initial jobless claims for last week are released, or when the Michigan consumer sentiment survey comes out at 10 AM ET.
3. ECB meeting
The week’s sequence of central bank news continues later with the European Central Bank’s meeting.
The ECB is expected to announce no change to its policy at 8:45 AM ET, however, given that the Eurozone economy is the most exposed of all advanced economies to Russia’s war in Ukraine. An illustration of that came earlier as Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) announced its group deliveries fell by 31% on the year in March, and also warned that volatility in commodity markets could negatively affect its hedging operations. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) acknowledged losing $120 million on last month’s madness in nickel markets on Wednesday.
The euro was up 0.3% against the dollar by late morning in Frankfurt, but has slid by more than 4% since the start of the war.  That’s despite record-high inflation which has led traders to price in more than 50 basis points of interest rate hikes by the end of the year. The ECB has refused so far to endorse such expectations.
4. Stocks set to open higher; bank earnings in focus again 
U.S. stock markets are set to open modestly higher later but all eyes will be on the spate of bank earnings releases that are due before the open, after the update from traditional bellwether JPMorgan fell short of expectations.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are all due to report early, as are PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and  State Street  (NYSE:STT). UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) is the biggest non-financial company due to report.
By 6:30 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 65 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures were up less than 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up a shade more, gaining just over 0.1%.
The three main cash indices had made solid gains on Wednesday as interest rate fears eased a little, with the Dow and S&P gaining over 1% each and the Nasdaq Composite rising over 2%.
5. Flagship of Russian Black Sea Fleet crippled by explosions
Russia’s difficulties in the war with Ukraine increased as the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet was crippled by explosions.
The crew of the cruiser Moskva (Moscow) were forced to abandon ship after a series of detonations of munitions on board the ship, Russia’s Defense Ministry admitted in a statement. It’s not clear whether the explosions were the result of a Ukrainian attack - as claimed by Ukrainian authorities - or poor maintenance and safety procedures.
The U.S. announced earlier it will send an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine to help repel a fresh attack on its eastern regions.
Separately, the Russian government announced a 19.5 billion ruble bailout package for the country's airline sector, one of many support measures likely in the coming weeks and months. Russian media speculate that the total needed may account for up to half the assets of the country's National Wealth Fund.

Salameh is facing investigations in Lebanon and five European countries into the alleged embezzlement of some $330 million in public funds with the help of his brother, Raja, charges they have both denied.
""I have already informed the Swiss justice (authorities) that I am ready to go,"" he told Swiss broadcaster SRF's investigative Rundschau programme in an interview from Beirut aired late on Wednesday.
""Because they asked the question in February 2020 whether they can (interview) me in Lebanon or in Switzerland. I said I am ready to go to Switzerland...I am waiting for them to call for me.""
The Swiss attorney general's office said last year it had requested legal assistance from Lebanon in the context of a probe into aggravated money laundering and possible embezzlement tied to the Lebanese central bank.
Lebanon's public prosecutor last year questioned Salameh based on that request.
Salameh estimated his personal fortune at around $150 million, which have grown from $23 million in 1993 - before he became head of the central bank - thanks to investments.
Asked about properties he owned in Switzerland via proxy companies, including a building in the Lake Geneva town of Morges, Salameh said he had never seen it.
He had used professional investment advisers and bank loans to buy property, he said, adding: ""I don't see where is the crime in that."" 

Europe's criminal justice coordination body said in March that 120 million euros ($131 million) of Lebanese assets had been frozen in France, Germany, Luxembourg, Monaco and Belgium linked to an embezzlement investigation. German prosecutors said the move was tied to probes into Salameh.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin told Chancellor Karl Nehammer during their meeting this week that Austria's supply of gas can continue to be paid for in euros, Nehammer was quoted as saying by Austrian news agency APA.
Moscow has warned Europe it risks having gas supplies cut unless it pays in roubles as he seeks retaliation over Western sanctions for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which the Kremlin describes as a ""special military operation"".
Nehammer said he held ""very direct, open and tough"" talks with Putin near Moscow on Monday about the invasion of Ukraine. But the Austrian leader had not publicly mentioned any discussion of Austria's security of gas supply.
Austria gets 80% of its natural gas from Russia and opposes an immediate European Union gas embargo on Moscow, arguing it is not possible to suddenly switch to alternative suppliers.
Putin said ""that the gas supply is secured, that Russia will deliver the contractually agreed quantities and that payments can continue to be made in euros"", APA quoted Nehammer as saying in a joint interview on Wednesday with German news agency DPA.
The European Commission has said those with contracts requiring payment in euros or dollars should stick to that, which Nehammer has said Austria will do. 
At the same time, Russia appears to have opened a door to continued payment in euros.
Two weeks ago Moscow decreed foreign buyers of Russian gas would have to open rouble accounts in state-run Gazprombank, which is not under the same crippling sanctions as many other Russian banks, or risk being cut off.

European gas buyers could therefore deposit payments in euros and let Gazprombank buy roubles on their behalf - a work-around that Austria has said appears to make continued payment in euros possible.
Nehammer repeated his opposition to an embargo in Wednesday's interview, which quoted him as saying it ""would mean that both (Austrian) industry and households would suffer serious harm from the non-delivery of that gas"".

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economic growth is likely to slow to 5.0% in 2022 amid renewed COVID-19 outbreaks and a weakening global recovery, a Reuters poll showed, raising pressure on the central bank to ease policy further.
The forecast growth for 2022 would be lower than the 5.2% analysts tipped in a Reuters poll in January, suggesting the government faces an uphill battle in hitting this year's target of around 5.5%. Growth is then forecast to pick up to 5.2% in 2023.
Gross domestic product (GDP) likely grew 4.4% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to the median forecasts of 41 economists polled by Reuters, outpacing the fourth-quarter's 4.0% due to a solid start in the first two months.
Analysts believe March activity could take a blow from China's efforts to contain its biggest COVID outbreak since the coronavirus was first discovered in the city of Wuhan in late 2019.
""March activity data is likely to have seen a notable deterioration, but that would just be the tip of the iceberg as the economically damaging lockdowns only started in mid-March,"" analysts at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said in a note.
""However, real GDP growth might avoid falling below 4%, thanks to the infrastructure push, the reporting methods and the surprisingly strong data seen in January and February.""
On a quarterly basis, growth is forecast to fall to 0.6% in the first quarter from 1.6% in October-December, the poll showed.
The government is due to release first-quarter GDP data, along with March activity data, on April 18, at 0200 GMT.
GDP expanded 8.1% in 2021, its best showing in a decade, but momentum cooled markedly over the course of last year, weighed by debt problems in the property market and anti-virus measures that hit consumer confidence and spending.
Last year, policymakers focused on curbing property and debt risks, which exacerbated the economic slowdown.
MORE EASING ON CARDS
The government has unveiled more fiscal stimulus this year, including stepping up local bond issuance to fund infrastructure projects, and cutting taxes for businesses.
China will use timely cuts in banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) and other policy tools to support the economy, the cabinet said on Wednesday, as headwinds increase amid outbreaks of COVID-19.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is likely to cut the RRR - the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves - by 50 basis points (bps) in the second quarter of 2022, according to the poll.
Citi economists expect a 50-basis point cut to be announced as early as Friday, releasing over 1.2 trillion yuan ($188.52 billion) in liquidity, they said in a note, adding the move could reduce the chance for an imminent medium-term lending facility rate cut, but the loan prime rate (LPR) could still be trimmed on April 20.
Analysts expect the PBOC to cut the one-year LPR, the benchmark lending rate, by 10 basis points in the second quarter, the poll showed.
The PBOC last cut the one-year LPR by 10 basis points in January and last cut the RRR by 50 basis points in December.
Consumer inflation is expected quicken to 2.2% in 2022 from 0.9% in 2021, before picking up to 2.3% in 2023, the poll showed.

20,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 04:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan (BOJ) will give a slightly hawkish tilt to its guidance on the future path of monetary policy by phasing out a pledge to ramp up stimulus if needed, Naomi Muguruma, a veteran analyst well-versed in the bank's policy, said on Thursday.
The tweak could come at the central bank's policy meeting this month, Muguruma wrote in a research note, having initially expected the tweak to be made in July.
The projection by Muguruma, a prominent BOJ watcher who has closely tracked its policy for years, comes despite reassurances by Governor Haruhiko Kuroda that the BOJ is in no rush to follow in the footsteps of other central banks in withdrawing stimulus.
Under the current guidance, the BOJ says it ""won't hesitate to take additional easing steps,"" and expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to ""remain at their present or lower levels.""
The central bank will likely change the guidance to say it will ""maintain short- and long-term rates at current levels for the time being,"" Muguruma said.
The tweak could help slow the pace of yen declines by making the BOJ's policy outlook appear somewhat less dovish than before, she said.
""With the yen sliding to 20-year lows against the dollar, there's no need to stick to a guidance that eyes a possible deepening of negative interest rates,"" Muguruma said.
Under a policy dubbed yield curve control, the BOJ pledges to guide short-term rates at -0.1% and cap the 10-year bond yield around 0% to support growth through low borrowing costs.

With inflation still subdued and the economy weak, the BOJ has repeatedly said it will keep monetary policy ultra-low. The Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hike plans has widened the interest rate differential, pushing the yen to a two-decade low against the dollar.
The BOJ next meets for a policy meeting on April 27-28.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's explicit call to cut the amount of cash banks set aside as reserves and boost lending has reinforced expectations for imminent policy easing, but economists say any credit loosening may not be enough to beat back the prospect of a deep economic downtrend.
Growth in the world's second-largest economy has slowed since early 2021 as traditional engines of the economy such as real estate and consumption faltered. Exports, the last major growth driver, are also showing signs of fatigue.
More recently, widespread disruptions to activity from China's biggest COVID-19 outbreak since 2020 and tough lockdowns have tilted the odds towards a recession, a few economists say.
On Wednesday, the State Council, or cabinet, said after a meeting that monetary policy tools - including cuts in banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) - should be used in a timely way. 
In the last two rounds of RRR cuts in 2021, the respective announcements of the easing were made two to three days after they were flagged by the State Council. 
""We expect the PBOC to deliver a 50-basis point RRR cut and potentially also an interest rate cut in the next few days,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) wrote in a note on Thursday. 
Most private forecasters now expect an RRR cut of 50 basis points (bps), which would free up more than 1 trillion yuan ($157 billion) in long-term funds that banks can use to boost lending.
A commentary by state-run Securities Times said April 15 would be the window to watch. 
China on Monday will report March data for industrial production and retail sales, which are expected to reflect the impact from COVID curbs, as well as first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP).
But some analysts cast doubt on the effectiveness of an RRR cut now, due to a lack of demand for credit, as factories and businesses struggle while consumers remain cautious in a very uncertain economy. [nL2N2VZ04K
Transmission channels for conventional RRR and rate cuts are severely clogged due to the COVID-related lockdowns and logistics disruptions, according to Nomura.
""When households scramble to stockpile food and private corporates prioritise survivorship over expansion, credit demand is weak,"" Nomura analysts said in a note. 
""With so many lockdowns, road barricades and property curbs, the most concerning issues lie mainly on the supply side, and merely adding loanable funds and slightly cutting lending rates are unlikely to effectively boost final demand.""
Nomura says China is facing a ""rising risk of recession"", with as many as 45 cities now implementing either full or partial lockdowns, making up 26.4% of the country's population and 40.3% of its GDP.
It expects one 10-bps rate cut each to the rates of the one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF), one-year and five-year loan prime rates (LPRs), and seven-day reverse repo in the near term. 
But no change in the one-year MLF rate is expected when the central bank is set to renew 150 billion yuan of such medium-term loans on Friday, said 31 out of 45 traders and analysts in a Reuters poll. 
Since a flurry of cuts to key rates in January, China has kept its benchmark one-year LPR unchanged at 3.70% and its five-year LPR steady at 4.60%.
""Monetary policy is not the panacea for all problems,"" the Securities Times commentary said. 

""Unblocking supply chains and industrial chains, allowing enterprises to get orders, and allowing people to have income would be the only way the cash-flow of the real economy be improved and a turnaround be achieved naturally.""

SEOUL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore and South Korea both tightened monetary policy on Thursday, hot on the heels of rate hikes in Canada and New Zealand, as global policymakers moved quickly to prevent soaring inflation from derailing a fragile world economic recovery.
While the four central banks began tightening policy last year to stem price rises caused by coronavirus-driven logistics bottlenecks, the war in Ukraine, which started Feb. 24, has since intensified supply pressures, heightening the urgency for policymakers to bring forward planned rate hikes.
""We're likely to see more Asian central banks push forward the timing of interest rate hikes,"" said Toru Nishihama, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo. ""That could hurt growth but with inflation becoming a more imminent concern, there's little choice for them but to move toward tighter monetary policy.""
Asia-Pacific economies largely lagged U.S. and European reopenings from the pandemic, which meant central banks in Australia, India and Southeast Asia had up until now mostly seen inflation pressures as transitory, with a focus more on shoring up their recoveries.
Singapore, South Korea and New Zealand were the exceptions and were particularly concerned about surging import price costs and financial stability more generally.
The Bank of Korea delivered a surprise quarter of a percentage point rate hike on Thursday.
Most economists had expected it to hold fire while it awaited the appointment of a new governor but with inflation in Asia's fourth-largest economy running at a decade-high, the bank said waiting was not an option.
Singapore, meanwhile, tightened its policy, which influences its currency rather than interest rates, for the third time in six months, citing fresh risks from the Ukraine war.
Both meetings came less than a day after commodity-rich economies New Zealand and Canada lifted their respective rates by a hefty half a percentage point, their largest such hikes in two decades.
New Zealand's hike was larger than what economists had expected and Canada warned more would be needed.
GET THERE FAST, TAKE IT SLOW
Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, said Singapore, South Korea, New Zealand and Canada were part of a group that saw an urgent need to get ahead of the inflationary threat. 
""The so-called 'Kokomo Club' of central banks that aim to 'get there fast, and then take it slow' necessarily are inclined to front-load tightening, with 50 basis point hikes as a hallmark,"" Varathan said, referring to lyrics from the Beach Boys' 1988 hit ""Kokomo"".
While larger peers like the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank were not quite as aggressive in their posturing, he said they were moving in that direction.
The challenge for many economies is they have only just started to embed a sure-footed recovery from large pandemic-led downturns, though inflation has since forced their hands on concerns prices could trigger broader financial and price instability.
Indeed, even some of Asia's less hawkish central banks are feeling the pressure to wind down their crisis-era policy.
The Reserve Bank of Australia last week held rates but dropped a reference in its communication about being ""patient"" in watching economic conditions.
Australia's labour market remains extremely tight with unemployment at a 13-year low and markets now expect the first hike since the start of the pandemic in June.
India's central bank also kept rates at a record low last week but flagged a move away from ultra-loose policy.
While the Ukraine war's economic impact has mostly be seen in inflationary terms for now, with energy and food prices soaring, analysts warn policymakers need to pay close attention to the hit to growth.

Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital in Sydney, compared current conditions with the Saudi oil embargo in 1973 that caused a global price shock.
""(Central banks are) having this dilemma that the longer this goes on, and it's being going on for a year now, inflationary expectations move higher and inflation will become self-perpetuating much as it did in the 1970s,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Thursday urged the government to introduce jet fuel subsidies and launch a tourism campaign as part of a relief package to cushion the blow from global commodity inflation driven up by the Ukraine war.
While the proposal did not mention the size of spending, it called on the government to act swiftly by drawing on existing budget reserves of 5.5 trillion yen ($43.9 billion).
""Developments regarding Ukraine are hard to predict and prices for various necessities are rising,"" the proposal said, adding the LDP will consider additional steps if commodity prices continue to rise.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has instructed his cabinet to compile measures to cushion the blow from rising fuel and food costs by the end of the month.
The administration wants to keep spending relatively small, government officials with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters, with Kishida instead hoping to unveil a bigger spending plan closer to an upper house election scheduled in July.
The officials were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
The LDP's coalition partner Komeito, however, wants an extra budget to be crafted as soon as possible for bigger, immediate spending.
Takuya Hoshino, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, projects this month's package to be sized around 2-3 trillion yen, and followed by bigger spending later this year.
""It wouldn't surprise me if the second package is sized around 10 trillion yen, given political pressure to spend big at the time of upper house elections,"" he said.
Spiking costs for energy and food in particular have hit Japan's economy already struggling to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The economy is expected to expand an annualised 4.9% this quarter, below an earlier prediction of 5.6%, according to a Reuters poll.

25,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 03:01AM ET</span>",,,,,,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's central bank is set to step up monetary easing efforts, but a vast majority of market participants in a Reuters poll conducted on Thursday believe the central bank may opt not to cut borrowing costs on its medium-term policy loans this week.
Instead, markets increasingly expect an imminent reduction in the amount of cash banks must set aside as reserves, after the State Council, or cabinet, called on Wednesday for the timely use of such monetary tools.
Activity in the world's second-largest economy has slowed since early 2021 as traditional growth engines such as real estate and consumption faltered. More recently, widespread disruptions from COVID-19 outbreaks and tough lockdowns have tilted the odds towards a recession, a few economists say.
Still, 31 out of the 45 traders and analysts, or nearly 70% of all participants polled, forecast no change in the interest rate on one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) when the central bank is set to renew 150 billion yuan ($23.57 billion) worth of such loans on Friday. 
Among the other 14 respondents, eight predicted a marginal 5 basis points (bps) cut, while the remaining six believed a 10 bps reduction would be more likely.
""Citi economists' base case is a 50 bps broad-based reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut to be confirmed as early as April 15, releasing more than 1.2 trillion yuan of liquidity,"" the American investment bank said in a note, adding such a cut could reduce the chance of an imminent MLF rate reduction.
Some investors also argued that more aggressive monetary easing in China, such as lowering both RRR and key policy rates, would further diverge its policy stance with other major economies, which have started tightening, and potentially trigger more capital outflows. The yield premium between the China and the United States was wiped out this week.
""The situation would become more uncertain in case of more significant capital repatriation pressure and deteriorating (yuan) sentiment later this year,"" said Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank.
Lockdowns in the financial hub of Shanghai and dozens of other cities to curb the fast spread of COVID-19 have roiled markets and prompted concern over wider disruptions to economic activity, leaving policymakers with no choice but to offer more stimulus to ensure the economy is on course to hit this year's growth target of around 5.5%.

However, some economists say any credit loosening may not be enough to quickly reverse a deep economic downtrend, as businesses and consumers are in no mood to borrow money given the uncertain outlook.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's central bank tightened its monetary policy on Thursday, saying the widely forecast move will slow inflation momentum as the city state ramps up its battle against soaring prices made worse by the Ukraine war and global supply snags.
The policy tightening, the third in the past six months, came as separate data showed Singapore's economic momentum waning over the first quarter.
The local dollar jumped briefly after the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) re-centred the mid-point of the exchange rate policy band known as the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate, or S$NEER, at its prevailing level. It also increased slightly the rate of appreciation of the policy band.
It was the first time in 12 years that the MAS used these two tools simultaneously to tighten policy, underlining policymakers' worries about potential price instability which has seen the U.S. Federal Reserve set an aggressive path to tightening monetary conditions.
There was no change to the width of the MAS policy band.
""The war in Ukraine has driven global inflation forecasts higher and dented the outlook for growth,"" MAS said in a statement. 
""The fresh shocks to global commodity prices and supply chains are adding to domestic cost pressures,"" it said, warning that inflation risks remain ""elevated over the medium term."" 
Singapore, a major travel and business hub, made its biggest reopening moves https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-relax-more-covid-curbs-including-overseas-arrivals-2022-03-24 from the COVID-19 pandemic through late March and early April, easing local restrictions and allowing vaccinated travellers from anywhere in the world to enter without having to quarantine.
MORE TIGHTENING?
""The door is definitely not closed yet,"" said Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC, referring to another potential tightening in October.
The MAS manages monetary policy through exchange rate settings, rather than interest rates, because trade flows dwarf its economy, letting the Singapore dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed band. 
It adjusts its policy via three levers: the slope, mid-point and width of the policy band.
All 16 economists polled by Reuters expected the MAS to tighten but they were divided on which parameters it would change. 
The Singapore dollar strengthened about 0.5% after the statement and hit a one-week high of S$1.3552 per dollar.
The central bank maintained its forecast for gross domestic product to expand 3% to 5% this year. The economy grew 7.6% in 2021, the fastest in a decade, recovering from a pandemic-induced 4.1% contraction the previous year.
Separate advance data on Thursday showed GDP grew 3.4% in January-March on a year-on-year basis, versus economists' expectations of 3.8% growth, and slower than the 6.1% pace in the fourth quarter of 2021.
The MAS tightened monetary policy in January in an out-of-cycle move, which followed a tightening in October https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/singapores-central-bank-tightens-monetary-policy-inflation-risks-2022-01-25, joining many other global central banks, led by the Fed, to get on top of surging inflation.
Earlier on Thursday, South Korea's central bank hiked rates to their highest since August 2019 in an unexpected move.
The Russia-Ukraine conflict has intensified pressure on consumer prices which were already rising rapidly due to coronavirus-driven supply snags. The Singapore government has said it stands ready https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-can-deploy-more-fiscal-monetary-policy-measures-if-needed-finmin-2022-03-22 to respond with fiscal and monetary measures if a deepening Ukraine crisis impacts growth and inflation.
MAS said it will remain vigilant to developments in the external environment and their impact on the Singapore economy.

It expects core inflation to come in at 2.5–3.5% this year, versus a prior forecast for 2.0–3.0%. Overall inflation is forecast at 4.5–5.5%, up from the earlier range of 2.5–3.5%.
""The MAS fully recognise that if inflation continues to surprise to the upside, there's a possibility they have to do more at future policy meetings,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research, ANZ.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank raised its benchmark rate to the highest since August 2019 on Thursday in a surprise move as it ramped up the fight against rampant inflation, which threatens its economic recovery.
In its first ever rate review held without a governor, the bank's monetary policy board voted to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 1.50%, an outcome less than half of economists foresaw in a Reuters poll.
Most analysts had expected the Bank of Korea to keep rates unchanged until its new governor assumes office, after Lee Ju-yeol's term as chief ended last month.
Joo Sang-yong, acting chairman of the six-member policy board, said the bank could not to wait for the formal appointment of a new governor to continue efforts to slow inflation and warned price growth was likely to top 4% for a while, up from its February forecast of 3.1%.
""A back-to-back rate hike in May is also likely,"" said Paik Yoon-min, an analyst at Kyobo Securities, who sees the policy rate at 2.00% by the end of this year. 
""If the Fed starts making big step hikes from May, it will soon catch up on South Korea's base rate and weaken the effectiveness of pre-emptive moves by the BOK.""
STAGFLATION RISKS
While the hike went against most economists' official forecasts, an April tightening was seen as a live prospect by many investors and the Korean won and bond yields were little swayed following the move.
In fact the yield on three-year treasury bonds fell after Joo spoke at a news conference about downside risks to growth. 
In a policy statement, the BOK said South Korea's economic growth is projected to be below the February forecast of 3%. 
At the same time, inflation in South Korea is expected to hold at decade-highs as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sends commodity prices soaring.
Thursday's rate decision comes after New Zealand and Canada both delivered 50 basis point hikes and other Asia-Pacific central banks shift their focus away from supporting growth to fighting surging inflation.
Analysts see South Korea's policy rate reaching 2.00% by the end of this year. 
Rhee Chang-yong, a veteran International Monetary Fund official and South Korea's nominee to be central bank chief, is expected to start his four-year term after the necessary parliamentary hearing on April 19.

The yield on the most liquid three-year treasury bond exceeded 3.2% this week, to levels not seen since 2012, as the prospect of faster U.S. rate hikes fuelled concerns about the ability of the global economy to weather higher financing costs.
The Federal Reserve raised the target band for its policy rate in March in the first upward shift since 2018, and analysts predict it will turn much more aggressive in tightening monetary policy to step up the fight against inflation.

29,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 11:55PM ET</span>","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's race to stop the spread of COVID-19 is clogging highways and ports, stranding workers and shutting countless factories - disruptions that are rippling through global supply chains for goods ranging from electric vehicles to iPhones.
While some factory owners try to tough it out through ""closed loop"" management that keeps workers isolated inside, some said that is becoming harder to sustain given the extent of local COVID-19 curbs aimed at heading off the Omicron variant, complicating efforts to procure materials or ship products.
Foxconn Interconnect Technology, a unit of Taiwan-based Foxconn that makes data transmission equipment and connectors, has kept a plant open in Kunshan, which borders Shanghai, in a closed loop but is only able to run at 60% of capacity, a person familiar with the matter said. 
Foxconn did not respond to a request for comment.
On Wednesday, more than 30 Taiwan companies, many making electronics parts, said that COVID-19 measures in eastern China had led them to suspend production until at least next week.
A day earlier, German auto parts giant Bosch said it suspended output at sites in Shanghai and Changchun, while putting two other plants under ""closed-loop"" operation. Also on Tuesday, Taiwan's Pegatron Corp, which assembles Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones, halted operations in Shanghai and Kunshan.
Sven Agten, Asia Pacific CEO of Rheinzink, a German maker of zinc construction materials, said logistical challenges make a closed-loop unworkable at his Shanghai warehouse and manufacturing facilities, and expects to have zero sales during April and possibly May.
""We need somebody in the warehouse and the manufacturing facility to do the work, and we need a truck and a driver. These are the two key components, and both are impossible,"" he told Reuters. 
GRAPHIC - Container vessels crowd off key ports near Shanghai https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/zjvqkdbzdvx/ContainerCongestionMapApr132022.png 
China's zero-tolerance approach to COVID-19, despite low case numbers and even as the rest of the world tries to live with the coronavirus, is proving unwieldy given the extreme infectiousness of the less-deadly Omicron variant. 
The zeal to cut-off virus transmission chains means localised curbs extend far beyond virus hotspots Shanghai and Jilin province in the northeast. An April 7 study by Gavekal Dragonomics found that 87 of China's 100 largest cities by GDP have imposed some form of quarantine curbs. 
On Saturday, electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) said it had to suspend production at its Hefei factory - even though there were no local-level curbs - because suppliers from other areas had stopped work.
TRUCKERS' BLUES
Truck transport has been especially hard hit, causing long queues and delays and driving up prices. The normal rate to book a truck from Shandong province to Shanghai had more than quadrupled from 7,000 yuan ($1,100) to 30,000 yuan, said an executive at a trucking firm who declined to be identified.
""It has become extremely difficult for our company to find available trucks near Shanghai in the past two weeks as many truck drivers were either stuck on the highways or locked down in the cities,"" he said, adding that he was subcontracting orders - at a loss - to keep goods moving.
The city of Xuzhou, a logistics hub, on April 8 began requiring truck drivers to produce negative PCR test results taken within 48 hours to take more tests upon arrival. They cannot exit their trucks.
Some drivers have become stuck on highways after visiting areas like Shanghai, which meant their smartphone health codes were automatically invalidated. Last week, state media reported on a truck driver who lived in his truck for seven days after traveling to Shanghai. 
CLOGGED PORTS, GLOBAL IMPACT
Foreign business groups have been especially vocal about their concerns, with the European Chamber of Commerce in China sending a letter to the government last week noting that about half of German firms in the country were experiencing supply chain problems.
China has tried to cushion the impact of the curbs by keeping ports and aiports running and encouraging closed-loop manufacturing.
But the number of container vessels waiting off Shanghai – the world’s busiest container port – and nearby Zhoushan has more than doubled since the start of April to 118, nearly three times the number a year ago, Refinitiv data showed. 
GRAPHIC - Container congestion worsens off key ports along Eastern China https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/klvykjwymvg/ContainerCongestionEasternChinaApr132022.png 
Danish shipper Maersk on Monday recommended to clients that they divert from congested Shanghai port to other Chinese destinations. 
Economists have cut growth forecasts for China on the back of such disruptions, with Beijing's official growth target of around 5.5% this year seen as increasingly difficult to reach. 
ING last week downgraded its GDP forecast for China to 4.6% from 4.8% previously.
On Wednesday its chief economist for China, Iris Pang, warned that China's COVID crisis could impact growth rates around the world.
""A problem in China could be a problem for the global economy,"" she said. 
Chen Xin, who runs a family-owned embroidery and garment painting factory in Guangdong province, said that since late March he has been unable able to ship roughly 70-80% of orders because customers can't receive them.

""The current situation is, the impact of the policy is greater than the epidemic,"" he said.

30,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 09:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Korea raised its key interest rate on Thursday, brushing aside concerns about a leadership vacuum and global risks to the economy as the board focused instead on resuming its struggle against escalating inflation. 
The central bank increased its seven-day repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 1.5% in the board’s first-ever decision without a governor in place. Some 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected the hike, while 10 forecast policy would remain unchanged.
The rate rise highlights a sense of urgency among policy makers to tackle inflation after the bank last week warned it’s likely to remain in a 4% range for the foreseeable future. The nominated new Governor Rhee Chang-yong has made clear he sees inflation as a pressing concern ahead of a parliamentary confirmation hearing on April 19.
Central banks worldwide are struggling to cool consumer prices fueled by pandemic-era stimulus and exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The BOK raised rates three times between August and January to tackle soaring asset prices and inflation, before standing pat in former Governor Lee Ju-yeol’s final meeting in February.
“Inflation is clearly the key concern that monetary policy will need to address and I think they will continue to tighten monetary policy in the next two to three quarters,” Ho Woei Chen, an economist at United Overseas Bank (OTC:UOVEY) Ltd. in Singapore, said before the decision.  
“I think Rhee may not differ too much from Lee in the monetary policy handling at this point though he may be perceived to be less hawkish,” Ho added.
Rhee is set to undergo a parliamentary hearing on April 19 and once confirmed is likely to continue with the push toward normalization as he has made clear he sees inflation as a pressing concern. The next policy meeting is May 26.

TOKYO (Reuters) - More than three-quarters of Japanese firms say the yen has declined to the point of being detrimental to their business, a Reuters poll found, with almost half of companies expecting a hit to earnings. 
The results of the Reuters Corporate Survey are one of the clearest signs yet that much of Japan Inc is struggling with higher costs and worsening consumer demand caused by the yen's weakness.
The survey also showed almost 60% think the government should move quickly to restart nuclear reactors, evidence that higher energy costs - driven in part by the currency's slide - may be changing opinion on nuclear policy. 
The currency fell to its lowest against the dollar in about 20 years on Wednesday, slumping past 126 yen. It has pared some losses and was trading at 125.6 yen on Thursday.
While yen weakness is often a boon for Japan's export-driven economy, at these levels companies are more worried about how it inflates fuel and raw material imports, which are already soaring due to the war in Ukraine. A decades-long shift to producing more goods overseas has also muted a weak yen's benefits. 
""We see the surging energy and commodity costs that come with the weakening currency as a negative,"" one manager at a ceramics maker wrote on condition of anonymity.
""We are concerned that could lead to constraints on consumption and capital spending.""
Forty-five percent of companies said they find it hard to cope with the currency weakening beyond 120 yen, while 31% described 125 yen as their pain threshold.
This month's survey was conducted between March 30 and April 8, when the yen moved between 122 and 124 to the dollar. It polled about 500 large and midsize Japanese non-financial firms, of which around half responded.
EARNINGS HIT
Non-manufacturers, which tend to be more focused on the domestic economy, were more sensitive to the weak yen than manufacturers, but only by a thin margin, the survey showed. 
Food processing companies were the most sensitive overall, with 73% of respondents putting their threshold at 120 yen. They were followed by retailers, 64% of which had the same threshold.
""The ongoing weakening in the yen has come on top of higher raw materials costs and dealt a double blow to our business,"" a manager at a food processor said.
Overall, 48% of firms expect the currency's weakness to hit earnings, with 36% saying it would hurt profits ""somewhat"" and 12% saying the impact would be ""considerable"".
Some 23% said it would be a boost to profits, while 30% said it would have no impact.
Many food processors and retailers expect a hit to earnings, as do many in fibre, paper and pulp manufacturing, steelmaking as well as automaking and auto parts.
Fifty-seven percent of firms said the government should move quickly to restart nuclear reactors to address energy security, showing how the Ukraine crisis and higher energy costs have put the issue in sharp relief.
""Surging electricity bills are hurting our business,"" said one manager at a wholesaler, who was in favour of a restart.
Nuclear power remains a difficult issue in Japan, where a decade after the Fukushima nuclear meltdown only a handful of the country's 30-odd power plants are operating.
A public opinion poll by the Nikkei newspaper last month showed 53% of voters believe the government should proceed with restarting nuclear reactors. That compared to 44% in a previous survey in September.
""Nuclear power is a necessary evil,"" wrote a manager at a machinery maker. 

""It would greatly contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions and it should be carefully considered as an alternative to the energy sources we are currently depending on Russia for.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The International Monetary Fund's executive board on Wednesday approved creation of a new facility to help low-income and most middle-income countries deal with longer-term challenges such as climate change and pandemics.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva announced approval of the new Resilience and Sustainability Trust in a statement after the board meeting, and said it would take effect from May 1, with a goal of raising at least $45 billion.
She said the trust would amplify the impact of last year's $650 billion allocation of IMF Special Drawing Rights by allowing richer members to channel their emergency reserves to allow vulnerable countries to address longer-term challenges that threatened their economic stability.
""This historic decision embodies the spirit of multilateralism,"" she said in a statement to Reuters. ""It shows that when there is the need and there is the will, we can work together to achieve a significant outcome for the benefit of all.""
IMF staff hammered out details of the new facility in recent months after it won the backing of the Group of 20 major economies in October.
An IMF staff paper prepared for the board and viewed by Reuters said nearly three-quarters of the IMF's 190 members would be eligible to borrow from the RST, the IMF's first facility set up expressly to help countries manage balance of payments risks posed by longer‐term challenges, the paper said.
""Today, even as IMF member countries confront the immediate challenges of rising inflation, constrained fiscal space and pandemic recovery — heightened by risks associated with the war in Ukraine — they are also calling on the Fund to help respond to longer-term challenges such as climate change and pandemic preparedness,"" the paper said. 
Currently, the IMF offers low-cost and zero-interest rate financing to help countries deal with short-term challenges, such as capital flight, inflation or high commodities prices, and medium-term fiscal and financial challenges.
But until now it lacked a facility to help countries manage risk to balance payments posed by longer-term threats, and its Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust was open only to low-income countries.
The RST, first proposed by Georgieva last June, will fill those gaps, offering a broader range of countries affordable financing over extended repayment periods, with a 20-year maturity and a 10-1/2-year grace period. The IMF has said it plans to begin lending under the program by October.
The funding will be available to low-income and most middle-income countries, including all small developing states, the IMF said. Many of those states were hit particularly hard by the pandemic and its economic impact.
To qualify for lending from the new RST, countries would still need to develop ""credible policy and reform measures,"" have sustainable debt and adequate capacity to repay the IMF, and be part of a concurrent IMF financing or non-financing program, such as its policy-coordination arrangements with Serbia, Rwanda and other countries.
The IMF staff paper said the eligibility criteria were set up to balance creditor and debtor needs, while mitigating financial risks to the fund.

The funding is also expected to serve as a catalyst for additional financing from the private sector, donors and other international financial institutions, the IMF said.
It said close collaboration with the World Bank and other international financial institutions would be critical for the success of the RST.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -The Brazilian government plans an across-the-board 5% salary increase for public servants starting in July in an attempt to end protests and strikes affecting public services, three Economy Ministry sources said on Wednesday.
According to two of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private deliberations, the increase will cost the federal government around 6 billion reais ($1.28 billion) this year. 
Brazil has a constitutional spending cap so the government will have to cut other expenses to increase salaries, as Congress approved the 2022 budget with only 1.7 billion reais for such raises. The government had also analyzed options within that limit, including boosting meal vouchers by 400 reais ($85) for all employees, a possibility that they largely rejected.
Another alternative was to favor a few categories of civil servant, including those at the central bank and public revenue service, which were leading noisy protests after President Jair Bolsonaro said earlier this year that only civil servants providing public security would be allowed to receive raises.
Behind the scenes, Economy Ministry officials strongly opposed that idea, arguing that privileging a few could set off a wave of new protests demanding more costly raises.
""The biggest problem was giving raises to one category and not others,"" said one of the sources familiar with discussions.
Many public employees have not seen their wages rise in five years and protests have taken place as double-digit inflation erodes purchasing power in Latin America's largest economy.

A strike by central bank employees is delaying the release of economic data, while protesting tax auditors have delayed the processing of goods arriving in Brazil.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States is pushing the U.N. Security Council to further sanction North Korea over its renewed ballistic missile launches by banning tobacco and halving oil exports to the country and blacklisting the Lazarus hacking group, according to a draft resolution reviewed by Reuters on Wednesday. 
The United States circulated the draft to the 15 council members this week. It was not immediately clear if or when it could be put to a vote. A resolution needs nine ""yes"" votes and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States.  
Russia and China have already signaled opposition to strengthening sanctions in response to Pyongyang's launch last month of an intercontinental ballistic missile - it's first since 2017.
U.S. special envoy on North Korea, Sung Kim, told reporters last week that the United States had discussed the draft U.N. text with China and Russia, but ""unfortunately, I cannot report that we have had productive discussions with them thus far.""
U.S. and South Korean officials and analysts have also said there are increasing signs that North Korea could also soon test a nuclear weapon for the first time since 2017.
The U.S.-drafted U.N. resolution would extend a ban on ballistic missile launches to include cruise missiles or ""any other delivery system capable of delivering nuclear weapons.""
It would halve crude oil exports to North Korea to 2 million barrels annually and halve refined petroleum exports to 250,000 barrels. It also seeks to ban North Korean exports of ""mineral fuels, mineral oils and products of their distillation.""
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is known as a chain smoker - frequently seen with a cigarette in hand in photographs in state media - and the draft resolution would ban exports to North Korea of tobacco and manufactured tobacco.
North Korea has been subjected to U.N. sanctions since 2006, which the U.N. Security Council has steadily - and unanimously - stepped up over the years in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
LAZURUS HACKERS
The council last tightened sanctions on Pyongyang in 2017, but since then Beijing and Moscow have pushed for an for an easing of the measures on humanitarian grounds.
The United States and allies say Kim is to blame for the humanitarian situation, accusing him of diverting money to nuclear weapons and missile programs instead of spending it on the North Korean people.
The hermit Asian state has successfully evaded some U.N. sanctions and continued developing its programs, according to independent U.N. sanctions monitors, who reported in February that North Korean cyberattacks on cryptocurrency exchanges were earning Pyongyang hundreds of millions of dollars.
The draft resolution would impose an asset freeze on the Lazarus hacking group, which the United States says is controlled by the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea's primary intelligence bureau.
The Lazarus group has been accused of involvement in the ""WannaCry"" ransomware attacks, hacking of international banks and customer accounts, and the 2014 cyber-attacks on  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Pictures Entertainment.

The draft resolution would also ban anyone from ""procuring or facilitating the procurement of information and communication technology -related services"" from North Korea. 
When asked about the U.S. push last week, China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said: ""We do not think that additional sanctions will be helpful in easing the tension, it might even make the situation worse.""

35,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 06:16PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller on Wednesday said the U.S. central bank needs to raise rates aggressively to fight inflation, but not so abruptly as to stress markets, destroy jobs and push the economy into recession.
""I don’t see value in trying to shock the markets; we are not in a Volcker kind of moment,"" Waller told CNBC in an interview. In the early 1980s, when inflation was last as high as it is now, Fed Chair Paul Volcker jacked up rates as much as four percentage points at a time.
But Volcker, Waller noted, had to battle inflation that had been building for six or seven years; the current Fed is dealing with a surge in inflation that only began early last year.
""Right now our main concern is getting these prices down and we can do that without causing a recession,"" Waller said, noting that he supports raising interest rates by a half-a-percentage point in May and ""possibly more"" in June and July. 
""We don’t need to be shocking anything just to cause a shock...if inflation doesn’t cool off, we’ll keep going; we’ll do what it takes to get inflation back down"" he said. ""But we can do that in an orderly way without causing a lot of financial market stress.""
The Fed raised interest rates last month for the first time in three years, but uncertainty stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine kept it from raising rates more than a quarter-of-a-percentage point. 
Data since then - including a report on Tuesday showing consumer prices rose 8.5% in March, the biggest yearly rise since late 1981 - supports bigger rate hikes ahead, Waller said.
""I think we want to get to above neutral certainly by the later half of this year, and get closer to neutral as soon as possible,"" Waller said, noting that while inflation has ""pretty much"" peaked, the Fed still needs to tighten policy to reduce demand and take pressure off of prices. 
Traders continue to bet the Fed will raise interest rates by a half-point at both its May and June meetings, but in recent days have retreated from bets on a third half-point hike this year. 
Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday signaled she was heartened by a moderation in core inflation in March that could point to some cooling ahead, even as rising food and gas prices drove overall consumer prices up 8.5%. 
Rate futures prices last week were pricing in about a 75% chance the Fed's policy rate would end the year in the range of 2.5% to 2.75%. 
On Wednesday traders were betting that year-end range was only slightly more likely than ending 2022 in a range of 2.25% to 2.5%, around the rate that most Fed policymakers see as neutral and that could be achieved with two half-point rate hikes in coming meetings. 

Waller's remarks stood in contrast to his former boss St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who supports raising rates to 3.5% by the end of the year and told the Financial Times that it is ""fantasy"" to think that inflation can be vanquished with more modest moves.
To reach Bullard's target would require half-point hikes at all six remaining Fed meetings this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With Sarah Bloom Raskin last month dropping out of the running for the Federal Reserve's top regulatory role, President Joe Biden's administration is hunting again for a new candidate.
Raskin failed to garner enough support from moderate Democrats to be confirmed. Most notably, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin said he would not back her, citing worries she would discourage banks from lending to oil and gas companies. 
The Fed Vice Chair for Supervision role is one of the most powerful banking regulators in government, and the next official is likely to take on a sweeping portfolio including climate finance risk, fintechs, and fair lending. 
Here are the candidates likely to be in the mix, according to analysts and Washington insiders. 
MICHAEL BARR, FORMER TREASURY OFFICIAL
Michael Barr, currently a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, was a central figure at the Treasury under President Barack Obama when Congress passed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law.
As assistant secretary for financial institutions, Barr helped shape the Wall Street overhaul and now is a leading candidate to be nominated for the Fed role, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
Barr had previously been in the mix for another bank regulatory post, heading up the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. But opposition from some progressives, who cited his work with some fintech firms after leaving government, helped sink his consideration.
Barr did not respond to a request for comment.
RAPHAEL BOSTIC, ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT
With his appointment as president of the Atlanta Fed in 2017, Bostic became the first Black person to hold a regional Fed president role. He has been outspoken on racial diversity and economic inequality issues, both of which are key policy priorities for the Biden administration. 
An economist by training, Bostic previously held roles at the U.S. central bank in Washington, where he won praise for his work on community lending rules, and at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
However, Bostic represents a bit of an unknown regarding financial regulation, analysts said. Even so, some banks were keen on Bostic for the role when his name was first floated last year, according to two industry executives. 
A spokesperson for Bostic did not immediately provide comment.
NELLIE LIANG, TREASURY UNDERSECRETARY
Liang, a former Fed official who is now Treasury's undersecretary for domestic finance, was instrumental in building the regulatory framework after the 2007-2009 recession and financial crisis. She spent decades at the Fed as a staffer, ultimately becoming the first director of the central bank's Division of Financial Stability.
She left the Fed in 2017 to join the Brookings Institution think tank, where she criticized Republican efforts to trim capital and liquidity requirements for large banks, among other changes. 
Liang was nominated for a seat on the Fed's Board of Governors during the Trump administration, but she withdrew in 2019 after Republicans blocked her nomination over worries she would be too tough on Wall Street.
However, some progressives are unhappy that Liang has not taken a tougher stance on cryptocurrencies, ""so it is unclear whether she would be in any future conversation about this role,"" Isaac Boltansky, policy director for brokerage BTIG, wrote in a note on Monday. 
A spokesperson for Liang did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
MICHAEL HSU, ACTING COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY
Currently acting comptroller of the currency, Hsu previously led big bank supervision at the Fed. In his current role, he has pushed Democratic priorities, including climate change risk and has warned banks against ""over-confidence"" coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
While he would be a good fit for Fed supervision, Washington insiders said, it's unclear if his stance on climate financial risk would be palatable to Manchin, a moderate who represents coal-producing West Virginia in the Senate.
A spokeswoman for Hsu did not immediately respond to a request to comment.
FORMER TREASURY UNDERSECRETARY MARY MILLER
A new name floated on Monday was Mary Miller, who was at the Treasury from 2010 to 2014. She recently served as the interim senior vice president for finance and administration at Johns Hopkins University.
During her stint at the Treasury, Miller was responsible for Treasury debt management, fiscal operations, and the recovery from the financial crisis. She played a central role in implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, helping agencies write complex regulations like the ""Volcker Rule"" and standing up the new Financial Stability Oversight Council. 
Miller could not immediately be reached for comment.
RICHARD CORDRAY, FORMER HEAD OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (CFPB) 
A former Ohio attorney general, Cordray served as the first director of the CFPB. 
Under his leadership the agency took an aggressive stance in going after abusive mortgage and payday lenders, earning praise from progressives and criticism from Republicans who said he was overstepping the agency's statutory remit.

After leaving the agency, Cordray ran unsuccessfully for Ohio governor. He currently runs the Education Department's federal student aid programs. Cordray was in the running for the supervision post late last year, Reuters reported. 
Cordray did not respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -China should help end Russia's ""heinous war"" in Ukraine or face a loss of its standing in the world, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday, warning that those who seek to undermine Western sanctions face economic consequences.
Yellen said in a landmark speech that she ""fervently"" hoped that China would use its ""special relationship"" with Russia to persuade Moscow to pursue end the conflict, and that countries ""sitting on the fence"" about the war were shortsighted.
""The world’s attitude towards China and its willingness to embrace further economic integration may well be affected by China’s reaction to our call for resolute action on Russia,"" Yellen said at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington.
The remarks reflect Biden administration appeals for China to condemn Russia's invasion and side with Western democracies, with whom Beijing has enjoyed a lucrative economic relationship.
U.S. President Joe Biden also told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday that buying more Russian oil was not in India's interests.
China ""firmly opposes"" associating China-Russia relations with the Ukraine crisis, said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington, adding that Beijing was ""committed to promoting peace talks.""
""China opposes all forms of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction of the U.S., and will resolutely defend the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and individuals,"" he said in an emailed statement.
Going forward, Yellen said that it would be increasingly difficult for China and the West to separate economic issues from broader national security concerns.
""Whatever China’s geopolitical aims and strategies, we see no benign interpretation of Russia’s invasion, nor of its consequences for the international order,"" Yellen said.
China cannot expect the world to respect any future appeals from Beijing on sovereignty and territorial integrity if it fails to respect these principles in Ukraine ""now, when it counts,"" she added.
But Yellen said in a question-and-answer session that the United States needed to work hard with China to avoid a bipolar global financial system that pits market-driven democracies against autocratic, state-driven economies.
China's reliance on state-owned enterprises and other practices has damaged U.S. national security interests, she said, adding that maintaining the current relationship required changes and Beijing's cooperation.
""I would like to see us preserve the benefits of deep economic integration with China -- not moving to a bipolar world -- but I believe that's a danger we need to address,"" Yellen said.
Yellen also expressed concern that China's new strict COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns would cause a new wave of supply chain disruptions that could hurt the world's economic recovery.
Yellen also called for more ""friendshoring,"" or shifting of supply chains to more trusted partner countries that are free of geopolitical conflicts.
The U.S. Treasury chief also said global economic growth would take a hit from the war between Russia and Ukraine and the Biden administration was resolute in its commitment to hold Russia accountable for its ""horrific conduct"" and its violations of international law.
MODERNIZING INSTITUTIONS
Yellen's remarks come just days before the International Monetary Fund and World Bank member countries convene their Spring Meetings in Washington next week, and she said the war in Ukraine will be ""at the top of everyone's minds.""
She called for these institutions, created at the end of World War Two, to be ""modernized"" to address 21st century challenges that have led to the current conflict, and help tackle other big issues including climate change, ending the COVID-19 pandemic, and supporting low-income countries.Last week, Yellen said Russia should be excluded from the Group of 20 major economies, whose finance leaders will meet next week in Washington.

Yellen also said that she plans to convene other leaders during the IMF and World Bank meetings to discuss possible solutions to food price spikes that are hurting the world's poorest.
""Some may say that now is not the right time to think big,"" she said, citing the war and the lingering pandemic. ""Yet, I see this as the right time to work to address the gaps in our international financial system that we are witnessing in real time.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -Argentina's monthly inflation rate soared to 6.7% in March, the government said on Wednesday, far above forecasts and the highest level in two decades as spiraling food and fuel prices dent the value of salaries and savings. 
The INDEC statistics agency said the annual inflation rate hit 55.1% in the month, above a Reuters analyst poll of 53.8%. Analysts had also predicted a monthly rise of 5.8%, though Economy Minister Martin Guzman had warned it would top 6%.
The monthly rate was the highest since 2002, INDEC said.
""Money doesn't get you by nowadays,"" José Luis Rodríguez, an Argentine bricklayer, told Reuters while building a wall at a construction site in Buenos Aires, the capital. He said he now struggles to get by on his paycheck.
""The reality is that it doesn't buy you anything. If I get sick, I don't know who is going to feed my family.""
Argentina has been battling with high inflation for years with little success. That has been worsened as global commodities prices have climbed over the last year, exacerbated recently by the war in Ukraine.
People across South America have been hit hard, sparking protests against rising prices in Peru and long lines for food and fuel in Cuba. Central banks have been forced to sharply hike interest rates, a trend expected to continue.
Experts predict Argentina's inflation will reach nearly 60% this year. That takes a steep toll on Argentines, almost 40% of whom already live in poverty even as a rebound in growth from the coronavirus pandemic has helped reduce that number.
In Buenos Aires some people protested on Wednesday demanding more state support, with banners reading ""we are getting poorer."" Others like bricklayer Julio Reinoso were selling baked goods on the street to supplement his regular income.
""Inflation is forcing those of us who work in different sectors to do these kinds of bake sales,"" Reinoso said. 
""We have no choice. If we are lucky, we can have two or even three jobs. And not even then do we make ends meet because one day products have a certain price and the next day it's a different one. That really kills people throughout the country.""

TORONTO (Reuters) -Canada's biggest banks said on Wednesday they will raise their prime lending rate by 50 basis points to 3.2%, a two-year high, following the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate hike, moves that could rein in the country's red-hot housing markets.
The country's four biggest banks - Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal - said the higher prime rate, which variable-rate mortgages are tied to, will come into effect on Thursday.
Variable-rate mortgages have grown in popularity as the gap between these and fixed-rate mortgages has widened over the past several months. They accounted for 55% of all mortgages, according to Bank of Canada data https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/banking-and-financial-statistics/funds-advanced-and-outstanding-balances-for-new-and-existing-lending-by-chartered-banks/#download.
The central bank raised its overnight rate on Wednesday by half a percentage point to 1%, the biggest single move in more than two decades, and said more hikes are coming.
""Canadians with variable-rate mortgages and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) will feel an immediate impact,"" James Laird, co-founder of mortgage rate comparison site, Ratehub.ca, said in an emailed statement. 
The moves follow 25-basis-point prime-rate increases last month.
Canada red-hot housing markets, a source of growing concern for regulators and authorities, have already started to see some slowing in price growth due to affordability issues and in anticipation of rate hikes.
Fixed mortgage rates have also already risen alongside bond yields, and are now close to 4% at Canada's biggest banks.

This means the floor of Canada's mortgage stress test, which set the qualifying rate at the higher of 5.25% or 200 basis points above the rate the borrower pays, has already shifted to the latter for these loans. 
A 1-percentage-point increase in the stress test reduces affordability by about 10%, Laird said.

41,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 03:21PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Reserve must put the brakes on economic activity to tackle surging prices, James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, told the Financial Times in an interview https://on.ft.com/3uBKcZZ.
It is a ""fantasy"" to think the Fed can tame the fastest U.S. inflation in four decades without aggressively raising interest rates, he said.
""We have to put downward pressure on the component of inflation that we think is persistent,"" the paper quoted him as saying, making a call for rates to rise to a level that curtails growth.
U.S. officials estimate the ""neutral"" level for the federal funds rate to be around 2.4%. Bullard in comments to reporters last week said he would like to see the policy rate raised to 3.5% by year's end, a goal that would require half-point rate increases at each of the Fed's six remaining meetings this year.
Fed officials are largely aligned around the need for steady rate increases this year.
But there is division nonetheless about how to view incoming inflation data, and whether a series of larger, half-point increases will be warranted.

A report Tuesday showed consumer prices rose 8.5% over the last 12 months, but some policymakers noted that inflation among a key set of goods appeared to be slowing, a sign overall inflation also may be peaking. 
Bullard told the Financial Times that, to the contrary, the latest data ""underscores the urgency that the Fed is behind the curve and needs to get moving.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The chief executives of U.S. meatpackers Cargill,  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), JBS and National Beef Packing have agreed to testify at a Congressional hearing discussing cattle markets and price increases for consumers, House Agriculture Committee Chairman David Scott said on Wednesday.
""It is very important, very vital, and very urgent that we hear the perspectives from the CEOs at these companies and get the full picture of why prices have gone up for consumers and down for ranchers,"" Scott said in a statement.
""In addition to this panel of CEOs, we will be convening a panel of ranchers to hear what consolidation in the beef industry has done to their bottomlines and viability,"" he added.
Increased prices and profits for meatpacking companies have threatened to amplify Washington's scrutiny of the U.S. meatpacking industry, as the Biden administration has criticized a lack of competition in the sector.

U.S. President Joe Biden announced a plan in January for new rules to bolster competition and stop ""exploitation"" in the sector amid concerns that a small group of meat packers was capable of dictating beef, pork and poultry prices, adding to inflation pressures caused by rising labor and transportation costs and by COVID 19-related supply constraints.
In January, the chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee on economic and consumer policy sent a letter to major U.S. meat processing companies, seeking information on rising prices and profits.

43,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 01:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Real economic activity in the U.S. is slowing sharply. This is showing up in lower demand for new trucks and autos, and a tailing off in freight volumes, leaving transport stocks facing more downside.
Heavy truck sales in the U.S. are very good leading indicator of economic activity, with 65% of the dollar value of North American freight moved by trucks. But new truck sales have been falling sharply and are now down 23% on an annual basis. New auto sales are falling at a similar rate. Truck and auto sales combined are falling at a rate previously only associated with recessions.
This is not a recession prediction. Recessions are signaled by a rapid regime shift across many areas of the economy and markets, and there is no sign we are in the process of this happening. Nonetheless, this sharp decline in vehicle sales shows slowing growth is in the mail.
Freight volume growth has also been slowing. Annual growth in containers loaded at the Port of Los Angeles is steadily heading down to 0% after hitting 20% last year. Lockdowns in China are clearly having an impact here. Cities and regions accounting for over 40% of China’s 2020 GDP are in full or partial lockdown. The Shanghai freight index is 13% lower than it was six weeks ago, the sharpest decline seen in the 10-year history of the index.
Shipping rates have been falling, but this is academic as it is virtually impossible -- while such a draconian lockdown is in place -- for exporters to load boxes in their warehouse and move the goods on to the ships.
Lockdowns in China may be a proximate cause of falling shipping rates, but the remote cause is the fall in global liquidity as central banks step back from historically loose monetary policies to try to stem inflation. Global liquidity has collapsed and points to continued depressed shipping rates in the coming months.
That commodities, their movement around the world, and liquidity are intrinsically linked has become starkly clear in this cycle. As a commodity producer, if you don’t have the liquidity to cover the margin on your short futures positions, bankruptcy means you can’t ship and deliver your commodities, exacerbating the rise in prices and triggering more margin calls.
This liquidity and economic-demand driven decline in shipping and truck usage points to underperformance of transport stocks. The S&P transport index is down 11% from its high of  last month. Transports and autos are roughly flat to the S&P year-to-date, so should begin to lag. Furthermore, being underweight medium-to-high duration sectors is a good idea when in an inflationary regime.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's WhatsApp has won regulatory approval to more double the number of users of its payments service in India to 100 million, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
WhatsApp has over the years told National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) that there should be no cap on users of its payments service in India, its biggest market.
Instead, the NPCI told the company on Wednesday it can increase the number of users to 100 million from 40 million currently, the sources said.
WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The NPCI confirmed the development in a statement to Reuters. 
Though the relaxation will come as a relief, the new cap could still limit WhatsApp's growth prospects given it has more than 500 million users in India.
WhatsApp has told the NPCI several times it wants to operate ""without a cap"", but privately the NPCI is of the view that allowing all its users to access the payments service - integrated with the app and allowing contacts to send each other funds - could strain the country's financial infrastructure, said one of the sources.
The NPCI gave WhatsApp approval to launch the payments service in 2020 after the company spent years trying to comply with Indian regulations, including data storage norms that require all payments-related data to be stored locally.
It started with 20 million users and the cap was increased to 40 million in November last year. 

WhatsApp competes with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Pay, SoftBank- and Ant Group-backed Paytm and Walmart’s PhonePe in India's crowded digital market.
Online transactions, lending and e-wallet services have been growing rapidly in India, led by a government push to make the country’s cash-loving merchants and consumers adopt digital payments.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The World Bank, International Monetary Fund, UN World Food Program and World Trade Organization on Wednesday called for urgent, coordinated action on food security, and appealed to countries to avoid banning food or fertilizer exports.
In a joint statement, the leaders of the four institutions warned that the war in Ukraine was adding to existing pressures from the COVID-19 crisis, climate change and increased fragility and conflict, threatening millions of people worldwide.
Sharply higher prices for staples and supply shortages were fueling pressure on households, they said. The threat is greatest to the poorest countries, but vulnerability was also increasing rapidly in middle-income countries, which host the majority of the world’s poor.
The compounding crises could fuel social tensions in many of the affected countries, especially those that are already fragile or affected by conflict, they warned.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, World Bank President David Malpass, UN World Food Program (WFP) Executive Director David Beasley and WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala issued their joint statement ahead of next week's Spring Meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
They said the rise in food prices was compounded by a dramatic increase in the cost of natural gas, a key ingredient of nitrogenous fertilizer, which could threaten food production in many countries. 
""Surging fertilizer prices along with significant cuts in global supplies have important implications for food production in most countries, including major producers and exporters, who rely heavily on fertilizer imports,"" they said.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also expressed grave concerns about the food security crisis during a speech at the Atlantic Council think tank, noting that over 275 million people worldwide were facing acute food insecurity.
A Treasury spokesperson said the meeting would include ministers from the G7 and G20 major economies, officials from the IMF, World Bank, and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), as well as lead technical experts on food security and agriculture. ""The event will bring attention to the different dimensions of the worsening food security crisis; and mobilize the (international financial institutions) to accelerate and deepen their response to assist affected countries,"" the spokesperson said.
Yellen said she would meet with other leaders next week to discuss possible solutions, and underscored the need for longer-term investments to address vulnerabilities in food systems.
In their joint statement, the four leaders called on the international community to provide emergency food supplies to vulnerable countries, boost agricultural production, and keep trade flows open.
For their part, they said they would step up their respective policy and financial support to help vulnerable countries and households and mitigate balance of payments pressures.

They urged the international community to provide grants and other funding for immediate food supplies to help the poor, and small farmers facing higher input prices.
It was important to keep trade open and avoid restrictive measures such as export bans on food or fertilizer, they said, underscoring the need to avert any restrictions on humanitarian food purchases by the World Food Program.

LIMA (Reuters) -In the hilly slums of Peruvian capital Lima, soup kitchens struggle to feed some of the Andean nation's poorest and most vulnerable residents, cutting proteins and loading up on carbohydrates, as food prices soar.
""The rise in prices is huge,"" said Jenifer Mondalgo, president of the soup kitchen association in the Pamplona Alta slum. ""The chicken that we used to buy ... is now inaccessible. For us as soup kitchens, chicken has ceased to exist.""
Mondalgo said they have resorted to pleading at the market for free bones, skins or other remnants so that they can serve at least some animal protein.
For years soup kitchens offered lunch at 1 sol (27 cents), but now community leaders have been forced to charge 1.5 soles.
As much of the world deals with high inflation triggered by the Ukraine crisis, the stakes are highest in the global South, where the poor have always scrounged for a living and could go hungry any day.
The war has also caused a global crunch in fertilizer supplies, which directly affects food costs.
In Pamplona Alta, residents foraged for food in the trash. Lima's slums have long been a first stop for Peruvians moving from the Andes into the city in search of better opportunities.
Peru's inflation is at its highest in a quarter of a century, with price hikes disproportionately affecting food. The soaring prices have already triggered nationwide protests that have left the government scrambling to find ways to cut costs.
Peruvian President Pedro Castillo vowed to lower prices by waiving the sales tax on food staples, a bill that Congress passed late on Tuesday after a lengthy debate on what foods count as essential.
Peru has also raised the minimum wage by 10% to 1,025 soles and offered vouchers to subsidize cooking gas for the most vulnerable.
""Things like vegetables and potatoes used to be cheap. Now they are super expensive,"" said Elena Rodriguez, a Pamplona Alta resident. ""I don't know what to do anymore.""
On Monday, a soup kitchen in Pamplona Alta served rice with lentils, as well an increasingly rare dish: chicken soup, thanks to a donation of bones at the market earlier in the day. 
Vegetable oil has surged 50% in the past year, according to Peru's national statistics agency. That has forced poor Peruvians to find ways to make do, such as collecting leftover pork fat to use in other dishes.
""If soup kitchens ceased to exist, our lives would be terrible,"" said Maria Sanchez, who spends almost 200 soles a month on her local soup kitchen to feed lunch to her family of six.

""We wouldn't know what to buy because everything is so expensive at the market.""

(Reuters) - Life expectancy in the United States fell by nearly two years in 2020 to about 77 years amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the sharpest drop compared to 21 other high-income countries, according to a global study.
Americans on average are now expected to live for 76.99 years from 78.86 years in 2019, according to the study, which looked at national death and population counts in 2019 and 2020 to calculate the mortality rate ratio.
The decline of 1.87 years in life expectancy for 2020 was far higher than the mean reduction of 0.58 years in 21 peer countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Denmark and South Korea. No country experienced a decrease as steep as that of the United States, according to the study. 
U.S. COVID-19 mortality and excess deaths were among the highest in the world and the virus was the third leading cause of death in the United States in 2020, after heart disease and cancer.
Authors of the study said the United States mismanaged the federal, state and local responses to the COVID-19 pandemic at the start, contributing to higher death rates than those in other countries. The pandemic response exacerbated the life expectancy gap between the U.S. and its peers.
""The fact the U.S. lost so many more lives than other high-income countries speaks not only to how we managed the pandemic but also to more deeply rooted problems that predated the pandemic,"" said Steven H. Woolf, one of the study authors and faculty at Virginia Commonwealth University.
""U.S. life expectancy has been falling behind other countries since the 1980s, and the gap has widened over time, especially in the last decade,"" he said.
Woolf said Americans die at higher rates because of heart disease, diabetes and dozens of other conditions. The lack of universal health care, income and educational inequality, and less healthy physical and social environments also contributed. 

The study findings mirrored earlier estimates from U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that showed 2020 life expectancy was 77 years for the total U.S. population, a decrease of 1.8 years from 78.8 years in 2019, the biggest decline since World War II.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Bank of Canada on Wednesday raised interest rates by half a percentage point - its biggest single move in more than two decades - and promised more hikes to fight soaring inflation that is being driven in part by the war in Ukraine.
The central bank raised its benchmark overnight rate to 1% from 0.5%. It also said it would allow government bonds it amassed during the COVID-19 pandemic to roll off as they mature from April 25, beginning what is known as quantitative tightening.
Both moves were in line with analyst expectations. The Bank of Canada last hiked by 50 basis points (bps) in May 2000. In remarks made after the announcement, Governor Tiff Macklem said more rate increases would be needed.
""We are committed to using our policy interest rate to return inflation to target and will do so forcefully if needed,"" Macklem said. The Bank said there was ""an increasing risk"" that inflation expectations ""could become entrenched.""
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.4% higher at 1.2595 to the greenback, or 79.40 U.S. cents, recovering from its weakest level in nearly four weeks earlier in the session.
""Given the mountainous task at hand in terms of addressing inflation... some very aggressive actions were warranted,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. ""It certainly looks like there's a solid possibility that (the Bank) follow this up with another 50-basis-point increase in June.""
Macklem noted that despite Wednesday's hike, rates were still far below the neutral rate, which the bank calculates at somewhere between 2% and 3%.
""If demand responds quickly to higher rates and inflationary pressures moderate, it may be appropriate to pause our tightening,"" Macklem said. ""On the other hand, we may need to take rates modestly above neutral for a period to bring demand and supply back into balance and inflation back to target."" 
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand also hiked rates by 50 bps to 1.50% on Wednesday, and the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to deliver two back-to-back half-point interest rate increases in May and June as central banks seek to tackle inflation.
On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada lifted its inflation forecast for the first half of the year to just below 6% compared to the 5% predicted in January. 
It also raised the forecast for 2022 to 5.3% from 4.2%, blaming Russia's invasion of Ukraine for adding to global commodity prices, energy costs and supply chain disruptions.
Inflation hit a 30-year high of 5.7% in February, its 11th consecutive month above the Bank of Canada's 1-3% range. The Bank last month hiked rates for the first time in three years, increasing them to 0.5% from a record low 0.25%.
On Wednesday it also updated the growth outlook, saying the economy would grow at a scorching 6% annualized rate in the second quarter, double the pace of the first, driven by consumer spending. 

""A broad set of measures suggests that economic slack has been absorbed and that the economy is starting to operate beyond its productive capacity,"" the April Monetary Policy Report said.
The next interest rate announcement will be on June 1.

""It is likely to be a hit to global growth,"" Yellen told an event hosted by the Atlantic Council think tank, adding that she ""worried more about recession prospects"" in Europe, which was most vulnerable to disruptions in energy supplies from Russia.
The United States had a ""very strong economy, and a very strong labor market,"" Yellen said, but also faced ""strong, strong wage pressures,"" inflation and the potential for further supply chain pressures due to COVID-19 lockdowns in China.

51,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 11:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The cost of foods for final demand rose in March by the most in 10 months, indicating mounting grocery store bills for Americans in the coming months even as gasoline prices cool.
The producer price index report on Wednesday showed food costs climbed 2.4% from a month earlier, the largest increase since May. The jump was driven by bigger increases in prices for grains, vegetables, cooking oils and pork -- suggesting the closely watched consumer price index will soon reflect such advances.
From a year earlier, food prices advanced an eye-popping 16.2%, the largest increase in annual records back to 2010, the PPI data showed.
“A number of the commodity-based food categories in the CPI tend to track their PPI counterparts with a lag of a month or two, so we are likely to see ongoing big increases for food prices at the consumer level,” Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC, said in a note.
Economists and policy makers, including those at the White House, have been mostly concerned about the impact of rising energy prices on U.S. consumers. While gasoline prices have been easing over the last two weeks, the PPI report suggests that food may become the larger burden on households.

Consumer prices for food -- which increased in March at one of the fastest rates since 1990 -- have already been rising solidly for months, partly a reflection of transportation bottlenecks and other supply-chain constraints resulting from the pandemic. The Russia-Ukraine war has further driven up futures prices on concerns about the supply of grains and fertilizer.
No relief from higher costs appears to be coming soon, according to Curt Covington, senior director of institutional credit at AgAmerica, an agricultural lending firm.
“The short supply across a lot of commodity sectors in agriculture, whether it be the meat or grain sector,” is behind the price increases, Covington said, an issue that’s expected to persist for the foreseeable future.

That’s especially bad news for lower-income households that spend more of their earnings on necessities. Those in the lowest-income quintile spend 18% of their income on food and energy, compared with 11% in the highest one-fifth group, according to Bloomberg Economics.
“The knock-on effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and potentially China’s lockdowns, have not fully flowed through the supply chain in March, and will add to the momentum in inflation that’s built up over the last two years,” Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Bank, said in a note.

52,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 11:31AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - The phone call telling Oleksandr Kyryliuk he was losing his job came just hours after Russian troops stormed into Ukraine. His employer, beermaker Samuel Smith, had decided to pull out of the Russian market.
""On Feb. 24, we all woke up to a new reality,"" said 33-year-old Kyryliuk, who had worked for the British company since 2018, growing sales of its bottled beers across Russia, Ukraine and neighbouring countries. 
Ironically, Kyryliuk is Ukrainian, one of millions of people from across the ex-Soviet Union who moved to Moscow to seek work but are now caught up in the aftermath of the Vladimir Putin's invasion.
Sanctions imposed by Western nations to punish Russia for what it calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine have sent the economy into a tailspin, with inflation and economic contraction both expected in the double digits.
And the ranks of Russia's jobless, which Kyryliuk has now joined, could swell by as much as 2 million by year-end, according to the Centre for Strategic Research in Moscow. In the worst-case scenario, unemployment could approach 8%, the think-tank estimates, almost double February levels.
""Russia has been forcefully yanked out of the global financial system. So the entire structure of the economy is going to change,"" said Tatiana Orlova at Oxford Economics. 
""We are going to see an uptick in white collar unemployment as foreign companies and banks are leaving, but companies are also withdrawing from sectors such as retail that employed cheap labour.""
Over 600 companies have announced their withdrawal from Russia since the invasion hit, according to the Yale School of Management, though many will pay employees for a few months. 
With McDonalds having employed more than 60,000 staff, French carmaker  Renault  (EPA:RENA) 45,000 and retailer Ikea with 15,000, Orlova calculates that Western firms' departure will directly cause the loss of approximately one million jobs.
Western embargoes on Russian exports, if implemented, may force mining and oil firms to lay off staff, Orlova said.
The number of people looking for jobs rose by nearly a tenth in the week to April 10 compared with the week before Feb. 24, online recruitment platform HeadHunter said. The number of job openings fell by more than a quarter.
Samuel Smith, Kyryliuk's former employer, confirmed via e-mail it had ceased exporting to Russia after the invasion, adding: ""We have no intention of supplying any of our bottled beers to Russia under the current regime.""
BROADER IMPACT
The impact is rippling out. With Western sanctions crimping travel, Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport last month furloughed a fifth of its staff.
Russia's services sector shrank in March at the fastest rate in almost two years, and employment fell at the sharpest pace since June 2020. 
Overall, 2.6 million people may fall below Russia's official poverty line this year, the World Bank estimates. 
Alevtina, a 25-year beautician from the Moscow region said more than 10% of her regular clients did not book treatments in March. That shaved 15,000 roubles ($185) off her average monthly earnings of 100,000 roubles. 
""I think my customer base will be shrinking each month – clients complain about losing their jobs, so they are saving on beauty,"" said Alevtina, who did not want to give her full name. 
A massive, energy-fuelled balance of payments surplus -- estimated by a Reuters poll to nearly double this year to $233 billion -- may allow authorities to maintain unemployment benefits.
But Orlova of Oxford Economics predicts a worse economic recession than in 1998 or 2008, and with longer-lasting consequences, for instance if sanctions prevent Russian firms accessing foreign technology and equipment needed for investment. 
Her models also project Russia's productivity, relative to that of its trading partners, will fall. 
That partly stems from the hit to the promising information technology (IT) sector, which according to the Higher School of Economics, comprised 1.2% of Russian GDP by end-2019 and had doubled in value over the previous six years. 
But since the invasion, over 100,000 IT specialists have fled the country, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications estimates.
There are some Russia-specific factors that possibly capped unemployment below 6.5% during the COVID crisis, while Western economies suffered double-digit rises.
For one, state-run companies often choose to cut wages and keep staff on the books. 
Also, Russia's demographics -- its share of people aged over 65 is almost double the global 9% average, according to the World Bank -- means jobs, especially unskilled ones, were increasingly filled by workers from neighbouring countries. 
So as jobs vanish, Russia's crisis is starting to penetrate the far reaches of the former Soviet Union.

""There are job cuts in every sector, the rouble has fallen, and some people have not been paid,"" Kubanychbek Osmanaliev, the head of the Kyrgyzstan Diaspora Council in Moscow, said. 
""Our people are wondering what to do. Go home or wait for things to improve? Everyone knows there is no work at home either.""

53,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 11:11AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Consumer inflation in Russia will keep on accelerating in annual terms due to base effects, the central bank said on Wednesday, warning that rouble volatility will continue, leading to upside inflationary pressure.
In month-on-month terms, consumer prices in Russia jumped 7.61% in March, their biggest such increase since January 1999, as the economy took a hit from sanctions and a record fall in the rouble.
Year on year, inflation accelerated to 16.69% in March from 9.15% in February, and officials say it can reach 20% this year.

The central bank said its policy will help bring inflation to the 4% target in 2024.
Last week, the central bank unexpectedly cut its key interest rate to 17% from 20% and said future cuts were possible, as emergency steps had contained the risk to financial stability, brought deposits back to banks and helped limit the threat of inflation.

""One of the poorest countries in the world has become much poorer,"" said Tobias Haque, World Bank Senior Country Economist for Afghanistan.
""The isolation of the Afghan economy following last August's political crisis risks...leading to grave poverty, displacement, fragility, and extremism threats,"" he told a briefing for the release of the World Bank's first development update on the country since August. 
The Taliban takeover prompted foreign governments, led by the United States, to cut development and security aid, and the strict enforcement of sanctions has debilitated the country's banking sector.
The World Bank update said that incomes had dropped so starkly that around 37% of Afghan households did not have enough money to cover food while 33% could afford food but nothing more. 
A Taliban failure to meet Western conditions, in particular access to education for all girls, has led the international community to withhold international assistance and keep financial sanctions in place, with exceptions for humanitarian aid.
""Under current conditions, the outlook for Afghanistan's economy is dire,"" the World Bank said in a statement accompanying the update.
If current conditions continued, the World Bank predicted, Afghanistan's real gross domestic produce (GDP) per capita would decline by around 34% between the end of 2020 and the end of 2022, reversing all progress since 2007.

The United States cancelled planned meetings in March, some of which would have included the World Bank, to discuss key economic issues after the Taliban sent all high school-aged girls home after they had arrived ready for classes. 
The U-turn angered donors, foreign governments and many Afghans as Taliban officials had previously said they were opening all schools.

China will step up financial support for the real economy, especially industries and small firms hit by the pandemic, and will lower financing costs, the cabinet, or State Council, said in a statement after a regular meeting.
""In light of changes in the current situation, we will encourage large banks with higher provisions to lower provision ratios in an orderly manner and will use monetary policy tools, including RRR cuts, in a timely way,"" it said in a statement on the central government's website.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) usually follows guidance from the cabinet, which oversees the world's second-largest economy and charts the fundamental course of China's policies.
The PBOC last cut the RRR - the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves - by 50 basis points in December.
A government adviser said on Wednesday that China should cut the RRR and interest rates to support the slowing economy, even as consumer inflation picks up steadily.
Some analysts expect China's central bank to cut the rate on its medium-term lending facility (MLF) as early as Friday.

Authorities will also take measures to boost consumption, barring localities from imposing new restrictions on vehicle purchases, and will step up export tax rebates to stabilise foreign trade, the cabinet said.
More steps will be taken to support purchases of new energy vehicles and consumption in rural areas, and boost consumption in healthcare, elderly care and childcare areas, the cabinet added.

Investing.com -- The Bank of Canada raised its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 1.0% and said it will begin the process of 'quantitative tightening' from April 25, unwinding some of the bond purchases it has made during the pandemic. 
The move is the second 50 basis point hike by an advanced economy central bank on Wednesday, coming only hours after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand also took the same step - its biggest rate hike in 22 years. 
The BoC said in its policy statement that there has been a ""substantial upward revision"" to the outlook for inflation in Canada, pointing to ""price spikes in oil, natural gas and other commodities"" and ""supply disruptions resulting from the war"" in Ukraine. It now expects inflation to average nearly 6% in the first half of this year, before moderating to around 2.5% in the second half of 2023, finally returning to the bank's 2% target in 2024.
""Growth is strong and the economy is moving into excess demand,"" the bank said. ""Labor markets are tight, and wage growth is back to its pre-pandemic pace and rising. Businesses increasingly report they are having difficulty meeting demand, and are able to pass on higher input costs by increasing prices.""  
The Bank didn't give any indication that it would begin actively selling its bond portfolio. Instead, it will rather no longer reinvest the proceeds of bonds that mature. Governor Tiff Macklem is due to elaborate on the bank's decisions at a press conference beginning at 12 PM ET. 
The Canadian dollar strengthened on the news, reversing earlier losses to trade at C$1.2650 to the U.S. dollar, effectively unchanged on the day. The loonie had lost over a cent against the greenback since the start of April, as the market priced in a faster tightening of monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve."

The average contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 5.13% in the week ended April 8 from 4.90% a week earlier. It is up more than 1.5 percentage points since the start of the year as the Federal Reserve has begun to tighten financial conditions to cool demand in the economy amid high inflation.
Fed policymakers now anticipate a series of swift interest rate hikes until the end of this year at least as they seek to bring down inflation, after they raised the benchmark overnight lending rate last month for the first time in three years.
Investors see the Fed bringing its federal funds rate to 2.5%-2.75% by the end of 2022, up from the current target range of between 0.25% and 0.5%. 
Officials are also expected to start culling the central bank's portfolio of $8.5 trillion of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities as early as next month, a stash of assets that had also helped keep consumer borrowing costs - for mortgages in particular - low throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
Those expectations for Fed tightening actions have led to a surge in Treasury yields. The yield on the 10-year note, which acts as a benchmark for mortgage rates, has reached its highest since 2018, and the average 30-year mortgage contract rate has shot up by 1.8 percentage points since the start of the year, the fastest climb in home-financing costs in decades.
The rise in borrowing costs, which has dampened demand for mortgage applications overall since the start of the year, caused a small bump in activity last week as homebuyers rushed to lock in rates before they move even higher.
The MBA said its Purchase Composite Index, a measure of all mortgage loan applications for purchase of a single-family home, increased 1.4% on a seasonally adjusted basis to 261.8, while the refinance index fell 4.9%.

The MBA's latest economic forecast was also released on Wednesday, with mortgage originations seen declining 35.5.% in 2022 from a year earlier to $2.58 trillion.
Purchase originations are still seen rising and are expected to increase 4% from last year to a record $1.72 trillion in 2022.

Inflation will hit the real incomes of people in the U.K. harder than those in continental Europe, according to an economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
While sanctions against Russia will hurt Europe’s economy more, the impact of rising prices on spending power probably will be “more stark” because of the way energy bills are regulated, said Steffan Ball, chief U.K. economist for the investment bank. Consumer bills for electricity and natural gas will rise 54% on average this month after authorities lifted a cap on what utilities can charge.
While newspapers report the poorest households may have to choose between “eating and heating” later this year, those on middle and upper middle income probably can rely on savings accumulated during the pandemic, Ball said.
The remarks, made before data showed U.K. inflation surged to a 30-year high of 7% in March, indicate the scale of pressure on policy makers at the Treasury and Bank of England, which are struggling to contain a record squeeze on consumer spending power. The BOE has raised interest rates three times since December and may move again next month.
“They can buffer a shock to their real disposable income and not let it hit their living standards,” Ball said, referring to the more wealthy households. 
The question economists are asking is whether people will want to hoard cash and continue saving money, he said, adding, “It’s hard to think that they won’t be going out to restaurants and things like that.” 
There’s a “clear risk” that Britain will tumble into recession as the surge in inflation curtails household spending, Ball said, noting that a contraction isn’t Goldman’s central forecast.

Annual inflation in Russia has spiked to a seven-year high of 16.70%, while the rouble and external trade have dropped after Western countries imposed sanctions over the Ukraine conflict.
Russia hiked its key interest rate to try to curb volatility, introduced capital controls, banned foreign holders of Russian assets from selling investments and offered over 1 trillion roubles in social payments and support to businesses. 
""We have certain macroeconomic limits under which we are working,"" First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov said. ""We have more or less understood the limits allowing us to work without increasing pressure on inflation.""
Some Russians rushed to snap up essential food items in the first days after Moscow launched what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
By late March, demand for the most popular socially important goods started to stabilise, Belousov said. 
Yet sugar and the so-called ""borscht basket"", a Russian version of the Big Mac index which contains the most popular daily food items including potatoes, onions, carrot and beetroot, spiked by 50%-60% after the sanctions, Belousov told the upper house of parliament. 
Salt, flour and cereals increased in price by 10%-20%, with stocks now enough for five to six weeks, he said, compared with more than two weeks for sugar and 10-12 weeks for baby food and canned food.
WEEKLY INFLATION DOWN
Russian weekly inflation fell to 0.66% in the latest week, Belousov said, after growing by an average of 2% in the weeks after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine.
Inflation in Russia could reach 17%-20% this year and the economy may contract by more than 10%, its deepest since 1994, according to Alexei Kudrin, the head of Russia's audit chamber and a former finance minister. 
Output volumes had fallen by around 11% in the industry and trade sectors, with other sectors shrinking by 9-10%, Belousov said without elaborating. Sources told Reuters earlier that Russian oil output hit its lowest since mid-2020 this week. 
The energy ministry had earlier suspended publication of monthly oil and gas output figures, while the central bank stopped disclosing foreign trade data, cutting investors off from the most essential data about the state of the Kremlin's finances. 
Russia plans to use all funds available this year for support measures, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has said, warning that there will be no budget surplus.

Belousov said on Wednesday that budget spending has already increased by 20% in the first three months of 2022 from a year ago.

Investing.com -- The U.S. earnings season begins in earnest with reports from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) and Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST). Producer price inflation data and mortgage applications and interest rates are also due. The Bank of Canada is set to raise interest rates and its peers in New Zealand hike by 50 basis points. Inflation also continues to surge in Europe. The Ukraine war enters a new phase as Joe Biden accuses Vladimir Putin of committing genocide, and oil is higher ahead of U.S. inventory data. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 13th April.
1. U.S. PPI, mortgage data due 
Inflation, and the policy response to it, remain front and center Wednesday, with U.S. producer prices for March due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), a day after the consumer price index rose by a new 40-year high of 8.5%.
Analysts predict a 1.1% rise in prices on the month, which would be their fastest increase in 14 months and strong evidence that what policymakers believed last year to be a passing phenomenon has morphed into something much more durable.
There will also be data from the Mortgage Bankers Association on weekly applications for mortgages and on mortgage rates. The latest weekly data in these series have shown a clear cooling off of mortgage demand as the 30-year rate has risen to its highest since the end of 2018. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard told the Financial Times that it was “fantasy” to think that the Fed can bring inflation down just by raising rates to their neutral level.
2. New Zealand hikes by 50bps as BoC prepares to meet; U.K., Spanish inflation rages 
The global spread of inflation continues. The U.K. became the latest country to announce a 30-year high in consumer price inflation, at 7% in March. That was above expectations, as was an 11.9% rise in producer prices.
The country’s largest grocer  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) saw its stock fall sharply after it warned that the need to respond to such developments would cut its operating profit by around 10% over the coming 12 months.
In Spain, meanwhile, consumer inflation was confirmed at 9.8% in March.
Overnight, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand became the first advanced economy central bank since the start of the pandemic to raise its key interest rate by 50 basis points. That was its biggest hike in 22 years. The Bank of Canada is expected to follow suit at 10 AM ET, raising its key rate to 1.0% from 0.5%.
3.  JPMorgan set to kick off earnings season; stocks drift higher ahead of open
JPMorgan kicks off the first-quarter earnings season with what, in the current circumstances, is likely to be a crucial snapshot of credit trends across the U.S. economy. The profitability of the core lending business is likely to come under pressure as the spread between short- and long-term interest rates narrows.
Analysts expect it to report adjusted earnings per share of $2.70 on $30.63 billion in revenue.
U.S. stocks are set to open higher, reversing the losses posted on Tuesday in response to the March CPI figures.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 105 points, or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were also up 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.4%.
Also reporting first-quarter earnings later are Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Blackrock and Fastenal.
4. Ukraine war nears new phase; Biden accuses Putin of genocide
The war in Ukraine is about to enter a new phase, as Russian troops prepare fresh attacks on the Donbas region in the east of the country after completing the conquest of the city of Mariupol. The last 1,000 defenders of the city surrendered on Wednesday after holding out for over a month against intense rocket and artillery bombardment that caused widespread civilian casualties.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday accused Russia’s Vladimir Putin of genocide for the first time, in response to increasing evidence – aired loudly and repeatedly on Russian state TV – that it is Russian policy to destroy Ukrainian nationhood. Putin said on Wednesday that Russia’s principal aim is to help the Russian-speaking population of Donbas.
5. Oil higher ahead of EIA inventories; Shanghai lockdown relaxation looms
Crude oil prices climbed above $100 a barrel again, after a mixed report on U.S. inventories from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday, and after signs that the lockdown of Shanghai and other regions of China may soon be at least partially lifted.
The International Energy Agency in its monthly report earlier cut its estimate for Chinese demand this month by 925,000 barrels a day, and also shaved its estimate for global demand in 2022 by an average 260,000 barrels a day.
The Energy Information Administration’s data at 10:30 may help add clarity on the state of U.S. demand. On Tuesday, the API said that crude stockpiles rose by over 7.7 million barrels last week, the biggest weekly rise in over a year. However, gasoline stockpiles fell by over 5 million barrels, their biggest weekly drop since August.
By 6:20 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 1.4% at $101.97 a barrel, while Brent was up 1.7% at $106.40 a barrel."

TOKYO (Reuters) -Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Wednesday warned the recent rise in inflation driven by higher import costs could hurt the economy, stressing the central bank's resolve to keep monetary policy ultra-loose.
Consumer inflation is likely to clearly accelerate as energy prices rise sharply and companies steadily pass on higher raw material costs to households, Kuroda said.
While the BOJ chief said the world's third-largest economy was expected to recover as consumption shows signs of improvement, and robust overseas demand underpin exports, he also warned of risks.
""The outlook, however, remains highly uncertain due to the impact of the pandemic, as well as developments regarding Ukraine and the impact on commodity prices,"" Kuroda said in a speech to an annual meeting of trust banks. 
He stressed the need to maintain the BOJ's massive stimulus to support an economy yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels.
""Recent rising inflation, driven by higher import costs, weighs on Japan's economy by reducing households' real income and corporate profits,"" Kuroda said.
The spike in global commodity prices, fuelled by the war in Ukraine, and a weak yen have inflated the cost of imports for resource-poor Japan, threatening to derail a fragile economic recovery.

Finance Minister Shinichi Suzuki jawboned markets against pushing down the yen too much, saying earlier on Wednesday that rapid moves in the yen were ""undesirable.""
The remark, however, failed to prevent the yen from sliding below 126 to the dollar on Wednesday, the first time it breached that level since May 2002.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan central bank governor Yang Chin-long said on Wednesday inflation would slow by the third quarter and any rate rise decisions would depend on consumer price data, but the bank would be very cautious on the pace of tightening.
In a surprise move last month, the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate and by a much bigger margin than some expected, citing concerns about inflation, which have been driven by supply chain disruptions from the war in Ukraine.
Taiwan's March consumer price index (CPI) rose an annual 3.27%, a more than nine-year high and the eighth month in a row it had increased beyond the central bank's 2% warning line, driven largely by rising global energy costs.
Taking lawmaker questions in parliament, Yang declined to provide details on future rate rise decisions. Asked whether each future increase would be a 12.5 basis point jump, he replied: ""At present, I wouldn't dare to say that.""
Yang, who has previously flagged the bank would continue to move in the direction of tightening this year, said they would be ""very cautious"" on the speed of rate rises.
""We have our considerations and won't be like the United States,"" he said, when asked if they would be as aggressive as the Federal Reserve in mapping out rate rises. He noted U.S. inflation was far higher than it was in Taiwan.
Yang said the depreciation of the Taiwan dollar, down around 5% so far this year against the greenback, did add to inflationary pressures, but that the effect was mild so far.
The central bank will intervene to ensure the currency's stability, but it was normal for a currency to both rise and fall, he added.
He also said Taiwan's economic fundamentals were very good, with listed companies reporting good profits.
But firms need to be aware monetary policy tightening is the direction the bank is going in, Yang added.

""They definitely need to be careful with their financial planning.""

65,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 03:41AM ET</span>","BEIJING (Reuters) -China's overall trade with Russia rose over 12% in March from a year earlier, slowing from February but still outpacing the growth in China's total imports and exports, as Beijing slammed Western sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. 
Shipments to and from Russia increased 12.76% in March to $11.67 billion, Chinese customs data showed on Wednesday, slowing from 25.7% growth in February, when Russia launched its invasion.
Still, the growth in March was faster than the 7.75% increase in China's trade with all countries and regions to $504.79 billion that month. 
Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in a move that Moscow described as a ""special military operation"" designed to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its southern neighbour.
Beijing has refused to call Russia's action an invasion and has repeatedly criticised what it says are illegal Western sanctions to punish Moscow.
Several weeks before the attack on Ukraine, China and Russia declared a ""no-limits"" strategic partnership. Last year, total trade between China and Russia jumped 35.8% to a record $146.9 billion. 
As sanctions against Russia mount, China could offset some of its neighbour's pain by buying more. But analysts say they have yet to see any major indication China is violating Western sanctions on Russia.
China's economic and trade cooperation with other countries including Russia and Ukraine remains normal, customs spokesman Li Kuiwen said at a news conference. 
In the first quarter, China's trade with Russia jumped 30.45% from a year earlier, within the range of gains seen in previous quarterly increases. 
Russia is a major source of oil, gas, coal and agricultural commodities for China. 
Russia's economy is on course to contract by more than 10% in 2022, former finance minister Alexei Kudrin said on Tuesday, hit by soaring inflation and capital flight.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) on Tuesday revised down its forecast for global trade growth this year because of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan (BOJ) will not introduce a digital yen as a means to achieve negative interest rates, an idea sometimes discussed in academic circles, a senior central bank official said on Wednesday.
In upcoming experiments on issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the BOJ will explore features such as setting a limit on the amount of transactions and holdings for each entity, BOJ Executive Director Shinichi Uchida said in a speech.
The central bank will also examine whether to make the digital yen interest-bearing, though doing so might be unnecessary as the CBDC could then end up being a close substitute for bank deposits, he said.

""While the idea of using such a functionality as a means to achieve a negative interest rate is sometimes discussed in academia, the Bank will not introduce CBDC on this ground,"" Uchida said in a speech.
The BOJ has not decided whether to issue a digital yen but has moved to a second phase experiment from April to prepare for a possible launch in the future.

The measure, backed by the government of President Pedro Castillo, is estimated to cost some 3.8 billion soles ($1 billion) in lost revenue.
The tax exemption will last eight months, applied to bread, chicken, sugar and pasta, according to the text of the law.
The final list of items was significantly scaled back following objections from the government that the congress was trying to exempt items, such as beef, that were not truly essential.
Consumer prices leapt 1.48% in March, reaching a level 6.82% higher than a year earlier. The monthly rise was the fastest since 1996.

The central bank does not expect annual inflation to return to its target range of 1% to 3% until early 2023.
Peru has this month seen road blockades as anger has flared over price rises, which have worsened since Russia invaded Ukraine.

The Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee lifted the official cash rate to 1.5% from 1% Wednesday in Wellington, the first time it has delivered an increase of that magnitude since 2000. The move wrong-footed 15 of 20 economists in a Bloomberg survey who expected a quarter-point adjustment. However, five predicted the half-point increase and investors had assigned it a 70% probability.
“The Committee agreed it is appropriate to continue to tighten monetary conditions at pace to best maintain price stability and support maximum sustainable employment,” the RBNZ said. “They agreed that moving the OCR to a more neutral stance sooner will reduce the risks of rising inflation expectations.”
The RBNZ has raised the cash rate for four straight policy meetings, lifting it by 125 basis points since October as inflation surged to a 32-year high. The risk is that the rapid rise in borrowing costs could stall the economy. House prices are already falling and business and consumer confidence have slumped amid New Zealand’s worst outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The New Zealand dollar jumped, buying 68.86 U.S. cents at 2:04 p.m. in Wellington. 
Today’s decision was a rate review rather than a full Monetary Policy Statement, meaning the bank did not publish new forecasts and won’t hold a press conference. 
“The Reserve Bank’s core inflation measures are at or above 3%,” the RBNZ said.
The RBNZ is at the forefront of global policy tightening as central banks around the world respond to an inflation surge that’s threatening to become entrenched. The Bank of Canada is expected to raise its key rate by half a point to 1% later today, while the Bank of Korea may add to its three rate hikes on Thursday. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve began its tightening cycle last month and its policy makers have signaled they could move in half-point steps if needed. The Reserve Bank of Australia only this month opened the door to rate increases, with economists tipping its first hike will come in early June.

""We sell it at the same price as before. Also with the impact of the pandemic, everybody is hanging in there. It is the same all over Beijing, we are not the only restaurant suffering,"" Ma said.
Asian restaurants and street food hawkers like Ma's face the tough choice of taking the hit from higher costs or passing them on and risk losing loyal customers.
Spiralling prices for ingredients and material that started with supply chain snags during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now being propped up by the war in Ukraine are squeezing businesses and consumers.
Households in Asia, where tasty and affordable street food is an integral part of society and the economy, are feeling the pressure the most. 
Mohammad Ilyas, a cook at a biryani store in Karachi, Pakistan, said the price of a kilogram of the seasoned rice dish, enough to feed three to four people, has doubled to 400 Pakistani rupees ($2.20). 
""I have been working at this kitchen for the last 15 years,"" he said. ""These days prices of rice and spices have gone up so much that poor people can't afford to eat it.""
Some businesses are dealing with the cost pressures by cutting portion sizes. 
At one of Jakarta’s street food corners, nasi goreng vendor Syahrul Zainullah has reduced his servings of the signature Indonesian fried rice dish rather than raise prices or use lower grade ingredients.
In South Korea, where consumer inflation is at a decade-high, Choi Sun-hwa, a 67-year-old kimchi shop owner, only gets seven heads of cabbage for the price she used to pay for 10.
The spicy fermented cabbage is traditionally served as a free side dish with other meals at Korean eateries, but even that has become an extravagance.
Seo Jae-eun, a customer at Choi's store, quips kimchi should now be called ""keum-chi"", keum being Korean for gold.
""I can't ask restaurants to give more kimchi these days and it's too expensive to make my own at home due to high-priced vegetables...so I came here to buy it,"" she said.
Choi says she won't be able to continue if she can't raise prices.
The price pressures are changing the eating habits of some Asian consumers.
Steven Chang, a 24-year-old service sector worker, is a regular at Just Noodles, a popular ramen store in Taipei but is reconsidering his spending.

Chile has resorted to allowing early pension withdrawals to help citizens deal with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Three withdrawals of up to 10% of a worker's pension funds have been approved since July 2020. A fourth was voted down in December. 
Boric's government had opposed a new withdrawal of 10%, saying it would pump too much money into an economy already struggling with spiraling inflation.
Then, hours before the scheduled vote, Boric's government introduced a separate bill that would allow withdrawals only to pay off debts. This measure, the government says, would mitigate inflationary effects.
""It is a way of making pension funds saved by workers available for matters in which their use does not imply higher inflation, higher demand or higher consumption,"" Finance Minister Mario Marcel told reporters.
The government's new proposal would also cap withdrawals at 10%, but restricts access to pension funds for alimony payments, mortgages and other debts. The bill also bolsters unemployment insurance.
Both bills were debated simultaneously, with Boric's proposal clearing the committee first. Some legislators in favor of a blanket 10% withdrawal argued that the government shouldn't have a say in how people use their pension funds.
Despite the committee votes, both bills will face a full vote in the lower house, where the unrestricted withdrawal is also expected to be voted down.

Although Boric had supported the four previous withdrawals, speaking to reporters, he said a new withdrawal without limits would ""deeply hurt the neediest"" by spurring inflation and lowering the value of their funds.
""We think (this bill) is an alternative that both helps families get ahead in tough times and is also responsible,"" Boric said.

(Reuters) - U.S. central bankers are split on whether high inflation will be a recurring problem in the future requiring repeated rate hikes, comments from two officials showed on Tuesday, a stark contrast to their broad consensus on the current policy path.
Separate remarks from Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin on the post-pandemic outlook showed an emerging rift in the views of Fed leaders, who all currently see the need to raise interest rates aggressively this year.
How that debate shapes up could bend the path of Fed policy for years to come.
Speaking in a Wall Street Journal interview, Brainard said that bringing inflation back down toward the Fed's 2% goal is the central bank's ""most important task"" but was confident a series of interest rate hikes and a reduction in the Fed's massive bond holdings would achieve that. 
She said she was encouraged that core inflation, which excludes energy and food, was starting to moderate, even as headline price increases ran at their highest since 1981. She said she expected demand -- and inflation -- to cool in coming months as the Fed ""expeditiously"" raises rates.
But once the economy moves beyond price pressures from pandemic-constrained supply and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, ""there are good reasons to think"" that the economic picture will reset closer to pre-pandemic norms, she added.
Low inflation was, for the two decades before the pandemic, a bigger threat than high inflation. Persistent downward pressure on prices from an aging population, slow growth and globalization forced the Fed to keep interest rates low for much of that time. Some critics say that experience shaped what they view as the Fed's too-slow response to high inflation this time around.
Separately on Tuesday, Richmond Fed President Barkin signaled agreement with Brainard on the near-term policy path but laid out a very different post-pandemic picture. 
He said upward price pressures could stick around if firms remake supply chains more resistant to potential disruptions, but also more costly, and governments spend on benefits for an aging population or on defense.
Labor constraints from slowing population growth could also add to these pressures.
If bouts of high inflation become more common in the future than they were pre-pandemic, Barkin said, ""our efforts to stabilize inflation expectations could require periods where we tighten monetary policy more than has been our recent pattern.""

For now, though, Barkin said the task is clear: to quickly raise interest rates to a neutral level, estimated to be around 2.4%.
""The best short-term path for us is to move rapidly to the neutral range and then test whether pandemic-era inflation pressures are easing, and how persistent inflation has become,"" he said, speaking remotely at a Money Marketeers event in New York. ""If necessary, we can move further.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer inflation hit another four-decade high in March when it reached 8.5% in large part on gasoline prices surging to a record, but the data sported enough soft spots for some Wall Street pundits to declare ""peak inflation"" was at hand. 
The Federal Reserve certainly hopes it is. Officials there are banking in fact that a long-awaited crest may be here.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard, speaking on the heels of the Consumer Price Index's release on Tuesday, said the fact that one main measure of the pace of month-to-month inflation slowed in March gave her ""confidence that we are going to be successful in achieving"" the Fed's 2% inflation goal. 
A drop in used car prices did help bring the so-called core CPI - excluding food and energy costs - to a six-month low. But looked at through a lens other policymakers feel is the appropriate focus - the annual increase in overall inflation - the pace of price increases continues moving up.
In response the central bank has already begun what may prove one of the fastest moves to tighten monetary policy in modern Fed history. If it is forced to become even more aggressive the risks of a mistake - and a recession - will increase.
Recent data on inflation, and of how people think about it, have held little good news for the Fed, though some argue there's a silver lining. Maybe.
Here's a look: 
PRICE PRESSURES HAVE BROADENED
Inflation began to accelerate last spring, and at first policymakers insisted it was all a temporary shock from the pandemic as government aid payments and the arrival of vaccines created a gusher of demand that crashed against snarled global supply chains. Since then, prices increases have broadened to services as well as goods. 
GRAPHIC: Pandemic inflation https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/gkplgqobovb/chart.png 
PANDEMIC ""LOSERS"" REBOUND
Even the industries pounded down early in the pandemic have seen prices accelerate - and it doesn't take a tangled global supply chain or shipping crisis to make it happen. As quarantines lifted, people started traveling again, booking hotel rooms and going to restaurants. At the same time workers found they had more bargaining power in a tight labor market, and wages rose. Demand and higher operating costs, coupled with consumers ready to spend, are driving prices higher. 
GRAPHIC: Changes in contribution to inflation https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/akpezjknmvr/chart.png 
BACK TO BASICS
For consumers, inflation was felt first and most pointedly in areas like car prices, where sticker shock over the cost of used cars was a feature of the pandemic. 
In recent months necessities like food, shelter and, yes, transportation, have contributed more to the headline pace of price increases. 
GRAPHIC: Price of daily life climbs https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/xmvjoqmjwpr/chart.png 
EXPECTATIONS REMAIN CONTAINED

The main bit of good news for the Fed is that views about inflation seem to have remain contained - at least over the longer term. Expectations are considered to play an important role in how people set wages and prices, and so far traders in inflation-linked securities appear to believe the Fed will bring inflation back towards the formal 2% target. The fact that the month to month pace of core price increases slowed in March - and fell for core goods - could be a sign that a peak has indeed been reached.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's new government is facing the daunting task of managing a stuttering economy with huge deficits, an aide to new Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday.
Sharif, 70, the younger brother of former premier Nawaz Sharif, was elected as prime minister on Monday followed a week-long constitutional crisis after parliament ousted Imran Khan in a no-confidence vote.
""Imran Khan has left a critical mess,"" Miftah Ismail, who is likely to be Sharif's finance minister, told a news conference in Islamabad, adding the suspended talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would be resumed as a priority. 
""We will restart talks with the IMF,"" he said. 
Ismail repeated Sharif's concerns raised in his maiden speech in parliament at what he described as record deficits his government will inherit from Khan, who was accused by the opposition of mismanaging the economy.
Sharif set up a National Economic Advisory Council in his first meeting on Tuesday. 
The IMF has suspended talks ahead of the seventh review of a $6 billion rescue programme agreed in July 2019.
Pakistan's current account deficit is projected at around 4% of GDP for the 2022 fiscal year (FY), the country's central bank said last week, while foreign reserves dropped to $11.3 billion as at April 1, compared with $16.2 billion less than a month earlier.

The central bank last week hiked key interest rates by 250 basis points to 12.25% in an emergency decision, the biggest hike in decades, citing deterioration in the outlook for inflation and an increase in risks to external stability, heightened by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as local political uncertainty.
The bank also revised average inflation forecasts upwards to slightly above 11% in FY22, which ends in June. 
 
"
74,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 07:11PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve should quickly get interest rates up to a level where borrowing costs will no longer be stimulating the economy, and should raise them further if high inflation proves persistent, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Tuesday.
""How far we will need to raise rates, in fact, won’t be clear until we get closer to our destination, but rest assured we will do what we must to address this recent bout of above-target inflation,"" Barkin said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Money Marketeers in New York. ""The best short-term path for us is to move rapidly to the neutral range and then test whether pandemic-era inflation pressures are easing, and how persistent inflation has become. If necessary, we can move further."" 
Consumer prices jumped 8.5% in March from a year earlier, a government report showed on Tuesday, marking the fastest pace of inflation since late 1981 as Russia's war against Ukraine sent gasoline and food prices higher and lockdowns in China threatened to worsen inflationary supply chain disruptions. 
The Fed, which aims for 2% inflation, last month raised interest rates from near zero to begin to deal with what it sees as largely pandemic-induced inflation. Policymakers have signaled they may accelerate the pace of rate hikes and begin to rapidly reduce the Fed's balance sheet -- bloated by its purchases of bonds -- to deal a more decisive blow to inflation. 
Barkin's remarks show he backs that approach, and then some.
Many Fed policymakers say they expect the pressures that for decades pushed down on inflation to reassert themselves once pandemic-related constraints on labor and materials fade. 
On Tuesday, Barkin said he was not so sure of that narrative, noting that price pressures could remain higher than before if companies choose to remake supply chains so they are more resistant to potential disruptions, if the government needs to spend more to provide benefits to an aging population, and if the labor supply continues to be limited by slowing population growth. 

If bouts of high inflation do become more common in the future than they were before the pandemic, Barkin said, ""Our efforts to stabilize inflation expectations could require periods where we tighten monetary policy more than has been our recent pattern."" 
Doing that could create communication challenges as Fed policymakers explain why stabilizing prices may need to be balanced against costs to employment.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Port of Los Angeles, the nation's busiest, on Tuesday reported record first-quarter volume as anxiety builds ahead of the July 1 expiration of the labor contract covering some 22,000 West Coast dock workers.
The Port of Los Angeles handles about 40% of U.S. container cargo and is home to more union workers than any of the 29 Pacific Coast ports.
An impasse in the West Coast talks threatens to undo progress at the Port of Los Angeles. Despite a continued flood of imports, workers there are whittling down pandemic-fueled cargo pileups that contributed to inventory shortages, helped drive up consumer prices, and turned the surrounding bay into a parking lot.
The National Retail Federation (NRF) and other groups that depend on West Coast ports like Los Angeles are pressuring the dockworkers' union and employers to quickly hammer out an agreement to avoid further injury to the world's battered supply chains.
The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), which represents West Coast dockworkers, and the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), representing employers, are scheduled to kick off talks on May 12 in San Francisco. 
Such labor talks are historically fraught. The last round of negotiations in 2014-2015 resulted in an eight-day work stoppage that sapped an estimated $8 billion from the Southern California economy. Service did not recover for roughly nine months.
On Tuesday, Los Angeles port Executive Director Gene Seroka said increased staffing helped slash vessel backups by speeding up cargo movement - even as first-quarter volumes climbed 3.5% to an all-time high of 2.68 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEU). 

Meanwhile, bottlenecks are building at Asian ports as outbreaks of a highly contagious Omicron variant disrupt the free flow of trade and threaten to unleash a new wave of global supply chain shocks.
""We're still facing a global supply chain crisis ... we certainly hope (the West Coast labor negotiation) doesn't further complicate that ongoing crisis,"" Jonathan Gold, vice president supply chain and customs policy at NRF, told Reuters.

(Reuters) - Countries around the world are working to diversify their supply chains and reduce their dependence on China, which is ""probably good for everyone,"" World Bank President David Malpass said on Tuesday.
Malpass said cross-border trade would remain important to the global economy, and China - already the world's second largest economy and likely to become the largest - had a big role to play as both a consumer and producer of goods.
But, speaking at an event in Warsaw, he said China also needed to be part of a value system shared by other countries in the global trading system, and added, ""I don't know that that will happen.""
Asked about whether China was headed for a crisis due to severe COVID-19 lockdowns and debt problems in its property sector, Malpass said: ""They're having setbacks, major setbacks in various areas, and the forecasts for growth have been brought down.""
But he said the World Bank continues to work well with China, which is a major shareholder and a borrower whose use of the lender's financing is shrinking. The bank is also working closely with China to encourage more transparency its lending to developing countries, Malpass said.
""So I guess the way I think of it is that the world needs to interact with China, recognizing that it's important in the world and growing in importance,"" Malpass said.
He also said he did not believe the world faced a new ""Bretton Woods moment,"" a reference to the 1944 conference that revamped the international financial architecture and created the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund amid the ruins of World War Two.

That system, with the U.S. dollar at its core, ""works pretty well,"" he added.
""My view is we're not at that point now at all. There's not a sense of the world being lost,"" Malpass said. ""There's this sense actually of unity of a great deal of the world in one endeavor, which is to end the war in Ukraine.""

78,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 05:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Korea’s interest-rate decision on Thursday is dividing economists, highlighting the challenge of forecasting the outcome of a central bank meeting held without a governor for the first time.
Out of 21 surveyed economists, 11 see the BOK lifting its key rate by a quarter percentage point to 1.5%, while the others expect the board to stand pat. The bank’s nominated new Governor Rhee Chang-yong is unable to attend the meeting as he is still to undergo a parliamentary confirmation hearing.
The six-member board will be left to judge the risks of hiking to rein in inflation or holding to avoid further dragging on already slowing economic momentum. The central bank paused in February to assess the impact of its three rate increases since August.
A further complication is the backdrop of a political transition as President-elect Yoon Suk Yeol prepares to take office in May. While his administration’s broader agenda is still unclear, Yoon has pledged to tackle inflation.
“The risk of further upward pressure in prices remains high, but the downside risk to growth is somewhat limited,” said Min Joo Kang, an economist at ING who sees a hike. “Both the current and future governments set price stability as a policy priority, which will support the BOK’s efforts to curb inflation.”
Inflation hit a decade-high 4% in March and consumer inflation expectations have climbed to levels last seen in 2014. The BOK, following last week’s CPI data, scrapped its February forecast of 3.1% inflation for the year and warned price growth would likely stay in a 4% range for the foreseeable future.
The price rises risk damping momentum in a consumption-led recovery that authorities had sought to buttress by relaxing restrictions on public activity.
Underscoring the uncertainty of what the BOK’s board will decide tomorrow, a survey of 100 financial professionals conducted early this month found them split down the middle on rates being raised or left unchanged.
Rhee, who will undergo his parliamentary confirmation hearing on April 19, has made it clear he sees inflation as an immediate threat. The nominated new Finance Minister Choo Kyung-ho told reporters Sunday that taming inflation was an “urgent task.” 
With an economy heavily dependent on trade, South Korea is exposed to fallout from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Rising commodity prices are eroding the bottom lines of Korean companies that drive the economy, while higher imports costs were reflected in a renewed trade deficit in March.
China Disruptions
Adding to concern are ongoing disruptions to global supply chains from China’s efforts to stem the spread of omicron through wide-reaching lockdowns. In Europe, German business confidence plunged last month after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices soaring.
As the war in Ukraine intensified, the BOK has increasingly pointed to hurdles to economic expansion even as it maintained a focus on asset bubbles and price gains. On April 4, Acting Governor Lee Seung-heon highlighted “downward pressure” on economic growth as well as upward pressure on prices.
Joo Sang-yong, widely considered to be among the more dovish members of the board, will chair Thursday’s meeting and handle the press conference after the rate decision.
In minutes of the February meeting, Joo was likely the board member who called for caution in combating inflation and warned pressures on prices could quickly reverse once supply chain issues resolve, said Roh Hyun-woo, a strategist at Hanwha Asset Management. The BOK declined to comment on whether that was the case.
The minutes showed multiple board members expressed concern about tensions brewing over Ukraine at the meeting on Feb. 24, which was held hours before Russia actually invaded. 
“We expect the board to sound hawkish on its inflation assessment, though some of this hawkishness may be neutralized by comments about rising downside risks to growth,” said Angela Hsieh, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank.
The BOK announces its policy decision at around 10 a.m. in Seoul, followed a little over an hour later by a press conference that provides the names of any dissenters.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's central bank directors will meet on Wednesday to discuss a possible interest rate hike, a source with the bank told Reuters on Tuesday, as the South American country battles annual inflation expected to have topped 6% in March.
A central bank spokesman confirmed Wednesday's meeting, a day earlier than usual due to a national holiday on Thursday.
""March inflation readjusts reality and therefore a potential rate hike will be analyzed,"" said the source, a central bank adviser with direct knowledge of the discussions.
""There is an implicit consensus that it should be raised, what is not known is the convenient range so as not to harm the running of the economy.""
A recent Reuters poll of traders and analysts estimated the bank would raise the benchmark rate by 150 basis points in April to 46%, in what would be the fourth hike in 2022. Authorities around Latin America are battling inflation.
That represents a 57.1% effective annual rate, analysts say, which is still below forecasts for inflation in 2022 that is predicted to hit near 60% by the end of the year.
March inflation, to be revealed on Wednesday, will exceed 6%, Economy Minister Martín Guzmán said on Monday, the fastest monthly price rise since at least 2018.
""If there is any news about a new rate, it will not be released until after the government itself reports March inflation,"" the central bank source told Reuters.

Argentina has pledged to shift towards real positive interest rates as part of a recently finalized $44 billion debt deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The central bank raised the benchmark 28-day Leliq rate to 40% in January, 42.5% in February and 44.5% in March.

(Reuters) - A major blizzard slammed North Dakota on Tuesday with snow, high winds and whiteout conditions, and meteorologists said the spring snowstorm could rage into Thursday, becoming one of the biggest in a quarter century.
Bismarck Airport canceled all flights for the day. State offices closed at 12:30 p.m. local time and residents were urged to stay off roads due to treacherous conditions.
""Its definitely looking like its going to pack a punch,"" Rick Krolak of the National Weather Service office in Bismarck said of the storm, which began blowing snow across the city early on Tuesday morning.
""We started seeing snow in Bismarck at 4 a.m., winds kicking up causing whiteout conditions,"" Krolak said.
Two feet of snow were predicted across much of the state. Northern cities such as Minot could see up to 30 inches by Thursday, when the weather system was expected to move northeast and out of the region.
Krolak said the storm brought to mind the blizzard of 1997 that hit on April 4 of that year, dumping up to two feet of snow in some areas, knocking out power to thousands of residents and leaving motorists stranded on major highways.
The National Weather Service warned of potential power outages from this year's storm as well.
A separate weather system brought thunderstorms, high winds, heavy rain and hail across the U.S. Midwest and into the south, spinning off at least one tornado in the Little Rock area on Monday.
The National Weather Service issued tornado warnings were issued across the state on Tuesday and the University of Central Arkansas canceled all classes for the day.
The weather service announced severe thunderstorm watch for parts of Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee through Tuesday afternoon.

Tai and one of her deputies, Sarah Bianchi, discussed bilateral trade relations and the implications of Russia's war against Ukraine for global trade and economic developments, USTR said in a statement.
The meeting came a day after President Joe Biden told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that buying more oil from Russia was not in India's interest and could hamper the U.S. response to the war in Ukraine.
The United States is seeking more help from the world's largest democracy in condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pressuring Moscow to halt what it calls a ""special military operation."" U.S. officials say India has its own concerns about deepening ties between Russia and China.
Tai and Jaishankar also shared views on Biden's initiative to launch an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework aimed at strengthening regional economic cooperation in critical areas such as supply chain resilience, USTR said.
Washington has signaled it has no intention of engaging with China in the new framework, which it sees as a way to push back against China's bid to create a regional sphere of influence and become the world's most influential power.

""They shared the perspective that the U.S.-India Trade Policy Forum (TPF), re-launched in November 2021, holds substantial promise as a mechanism for expanding bilateral trade and reducing barriers, including with respect to trade in agriculture,"" it added.
The two officials agreed to remain in touch as work continues toward a 2022 meeting of the U.S.-India trade forum, USTR said, but gave no specific date.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former senior official at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday agreed to pay $10,000 to resolve civil allegations that he violated federal conflict of interest rules after departing his post in 2016.
The Justice Department said that the settlement with Kenneth J. Buck, the former Executive Director for the DHS Office of Management Integration, also resolves claims under the federal False Claims Act alleging he submitted false invoices that concealed his involvement with a DHS contract after he departed from his government post.
Under federal ethics rules, government employees are subject to post-employment restrictions, including a one-year ""cooling off"" period. In settling, Buck did not admit liability, and he denied the allegations against him.
The settlement comes at a time when the Department of Homeland Security is already under an ethics cloud.
On April 4, the Secret Service, which is part of DHS, placed four agents on administrative leave pending an investigation into their acceptance of gifts from two men who allegedly posed as DHS agents and offered them gifts including rent-free apartments and iPhones.
The two men accused of providing the gifts and posing as agents - Arian Taherzadeh, 40, and Haider Ali, 35, are now facing charges, and a federal prosecutor said on Tuesday that the Justice Department is continuing to investigate whether there was bribery involved.
Separately on Monday, the former Acting Branch Chief for the DHS inspector general's information technology division, Murali Y. Venkata, was convicted on federal criminal charges of conspiring to defraud the U.S., theft of government property, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and obstruction.
The department's former Acting Inspector General Charles K. Edwards previously pleaded guilty for his role in the alleged scheme in January 2022, and another former DHS inspector general staffer also pleaded in April 2019.

""It's a manoeuvre by Emmanuel Macron to try to win over, or at least to mitigate the opposition of the left-leaning voters"", said Le Pen on Tuesday, speaking in an interview with France Inter radio. 
Campaigning in France's former industrial heartland, Macron on Monday said he was prepared to readjust his planned pension reform, which is at the core of his programme for re-election. 
""I am ready to change the timeline and say we don't necessarily have to do a reform by 2030 if I feel that people are too anxious"", Macron said. He was also prepared, he said, to ""open the door"" on pushing the country's retirement age from 62 at the moment to 64, rather than 65, his initial proposal. 
""There is nothing to expect here from Emmanuel Macron. He will go all the way to the end with obsession, because it's a reality that the minimum (retirement) age of 65 is his obsession"", said Le Pen. 
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, an ally of Macron, told broadcaster CNews that Macron had not changed his plans on the pensions reform and is still ""totally determined"" to carry out the reform. 
""We will stick to (the minimum age of) 65, but there will be options for discussing details,"" said Le Maire. 
Manuel Bompard, the head of the campaign of far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came in third in the first round, said he did not agree with Macron's or Le Pen's retirement proposals.
""I tell Macron this: If he really wants to appeal to our voters ... he has to make a clear commitment,"" he said.
Speaking on Public Senat television, Bompard pointed to the possibility mentioned by Macron of carrying out a national referendum on the minimum pension age.
An Ipsos-Sopra Steria poll cited by Public Senat said 23% of Melenchon voters would now support Macron, 15% Le Pen and a further 62% did not take a position.

Macron and Le Pen traded blows on Monday as they sought to appeal to left-leaning voters who now face the tough decision whether to give their vote to a far-right populist or to a liberal many opponents branded a ""president of the rich"".

85,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 01:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Americans are expected to drive more this summer than they did last year, even with higher prices limiting some travel.
U.S. drivers are expected to burn through 9.2 million barrels a day of gasoline from April to September, up by 0.8% from the same time last year but 3.5% lower than it was in 2019, according to the Energy Information Administration’s summer fuels outlook. Meanwhile, the average gasoline retail price is expected to be $3.84 a gallon, the highest since summer 2014 after adjusting for inflation, the report shows. 
Fuel demand is being watched closely in the world’s biggest oil consuming nation as soaring prices at the pump threaten to limit further growth in consumption. Surging gasoline costs have also contributed to rising U.S. inflation rates, underscoring high costs of living and posing a political challenge for the Biden administration.  
Rising employment and easing virus cases will drive an annual increase of 2.5% in vehicle miles traveled. Still, high prices may limit recreational travel, according to the EIA. The most significant effects of the pandemic on commuting have largely dissipated, according to the report. 
Gasoline supply is expected to remain ample and end the summer at 233.6 million barrels, 2.9% more than last year and 1.6% more than the fiver-year average.
Diesel consumption this summer will surpass the same period last year and match 2019 levels, supported by demand for trucking, home delivery and distribution of goods, the report said. Distillates inventories will end the summer 9% less than the five-year average.

86,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 01:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said the U.S. central bank will move “expeditiously” to raise interest rates and return surging inflation to its 2% target.
“We are doing that by tightening monetary policy methodically, and it is through a series of interest rate increases as well as beginning that balance sheet runoff,” Brainard said Tuesday in a live-streamed interview at a Wall Street Journal jobs summit. She said a decision on the balance sheet “could be as soon as May, which would lead to reductions in that balance sheet starting in June.”
Fed officials increased interest rates by a quarter point in March and signaled they expect to keep hiking all year, while starting to shrink their bloated balance sheet next month. Since then, officials have said this tightening cycle will be faster than in previous economic recoveries -- including by raising rates in larger 50 basis-point steps -- to curb surging inflation.
“In terms of exactly what the right pace of that set of increases in the policy rate from meeting to meeting, I don’t really want to focus on that,” she said. “But I would just say the combined effect will bring the policy stance to a more neutral posture expeditiously later this year,” she added, referring to the level of rates that neither speed up nor slow down the economy.
U.S. consumer prices rose 8.5% in March from a year earlier, marking the biggest increase since 1981. The war in Ukraine has raised food and energy costs, pushing headline inflation further away from the Fed’s 2% target. U.S. central bankers, by their own admission, were slow to react and are now viewed as moving with determination to catch up.
Minutes of their March 15-16 meeting showed that “many” officials would have preferred a half-point move but wanted to wait to see how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine impacted the economic outlook. The minutes showed that many said one or more half-point rate increases “could be appropriate” if inflation pressures remained elevated.
Financial markets are pricing accordingly with futures traders betting on a high probability of a 50 basis-point hike in the Fed’s main policy rate at its May 3-4 meeting.
Brainard is awaiting Senate confirmation of her nomination to be Fed vice chair by President Joe Biden.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Ukrainian refugees fleeing war have been hospitably received around Europe, but the longer they stay the more their presence may exacerbate housing price pressures in host nations like Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic.
More than half the 4.5 million who have left since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion have gone to neighbouring Poland, which was already home to the region's biggest Ukrainian diaspora.
Marcin Janczuk, from local real estate firm Metrohouse Franchise, said Poland's commercial housing market would have to immediately grow by half a million flats to satisfy the needs of refugees who have arrived so far.
""We estimate that in (Poland's) largest cities, rental prices are currently about 20% higher than at the beginning of the year,"" Janczuk said, adding that the refugee influx was just one of many reasons for the growth.
European nations are mostly backing Kyiv against Moscow and have shown solidarity with the refugees, finding them free or cheap accommodation in private homes and emergency lodgings, and promising help with jobs and schools. Most are women, children and the elderly as men below 60 stay to fight.
""I experience some nightly waves of gratitude for the fact that I've got to know Peter and Yulia,"" said refugee Yulia Sarycheva, who found shelter at a family's apartment in Prague.
Yet as the war drags on, it is unclear when the refugees might return or what shape their homes will be in when that is possible, so the need for longer-term housing plans is growing. 
MEMORIES OF 2015
Sebastian Wunsch, from housing research institute GEWOS, said demand in Germany may grow by some 200,000-400,000 apartments due to the Ukrainian refugee influx, most in already over-populated cities.
After Germany received 1 million refugees during the 2015 refugee crisis, new rents grew a slightly faster 3.5% in 2015-2018 compared to 2.5% in 2011-2014, he said.
The number of refugees Germany took in was about one eightieth of the population, but Poland has already crossed the 1/15 threshold, as Europe debates the fairest way to distribute the influx of Ukrainians.
The Czech government estimates more than 300,000 Ukrainian refugees have entered the nation of 10.7 million people.
Real estate agents there report soaring rental demand.

""The growth is several-fold,"" said Artem Egorov Pozo-Sandoval at the Chirs agency.
Though adding to existing pressures on house prices and rentals, data shows refugees ultimately benefit host countries' economies as they plug workforce shortages, start businesses and contribute to tax revenue.

Investing.com -- In the political Tour de France of 2022, Emmanuel Macron has won an important stage victory.
The Fifth Republic’s youngest ever president is now odds-on to become the first president to win re-election since Jacques Chirac 20 years ago.
That matters. With war having returned to Europe, France and the EU are at a crossroads. Driven by a liberal, internationalist outlook, Macron has sided solidly with Ukraine, pushing Europe for harder sanctions than it is currently prepared to countenance. It is inconceivable that France under Marine Le Pen – an avowed admirer and kindred spirit of Vladimir Putin, who approved of his annexation of Crimea eight years ago - would behave the same way.
Irrespective of the rape of Ukraine, it matters a lot to Europe who rules France for the next five years. Macron has pushed through important reforms in his first term and while the pandemic may have wrecked his attempts to end France’s chronic budget deficits, it has not stopped him bringing the unemployment rate – France’s perennial Achilles’ heel - down from 9.5% at the start of his term to only 7.4% now. Youth unemployment has fallen to 16% from over 24% in the same timeframe.
Not that he has had much credit for it. Indeed, every age group under 60 preferred Le Pen to Macron in Sunday’s poll. And nearly three-quarters of voters in Sunday’s first round cast their vote for rupture with the liberal establishment world view and world order that Macron represents.
It’s enough to make one think that the degree to which French society consents to be governed is on a permanently downward slope. The traditional parties of right and left have collapsed, collecting less than 7% of the vote. The Green candidate also polled less than 5%. The difference with the continent’s other major power Germany, where mainstream parties last September regained ground lost to extremists since the Great Recession, could hardly be more glaring.
Macron may point to the fact that the 27.8% share of the vote he picked up on Sunday was actually more than the 24.0% he scored at this stage five years ago. But Le Pen can point to similar gains, to 23.4% from 21.3%. Five years ago, Macron beat Le Pen in the run-off by a margin of 66%-34%. Today’s polls suggest he will lose at least 10 points of that. One poll even put Le Pen within the margin of error for overall victory.
Small wonder, then, that Macron is belatedly trying to neutralize the talking points that have driven Le Pen’s campaign. In an interview with BFM TV on Monday, he left open the possibility of a referendum on his plans for pension reform, in whatever final shape it takes. His current proposal – to raise the retirement age to 65 years from 62 - may be soundly enough rooted in economic reality, but it is an easy target for populists who feel no pressure to balance the books. 
And the books must be balanced, one way or another. The pandemic has undone almost all the good work of Macron’s reforms. After shrinking to 1.6% of GDP in 2018, France’s structural budget deficit – that part which can’t be argued away by the business cycle – has widened to 7.5% of GDP as Macron, like the head of many other governments across the world, has simply thrown newly-printed money at the problems caused by Covid-19. France’s debt now stands at an estimated 115% of GDP, meaning that a sustained bout of inflation and higher interest rates could easily bring growth – and the associated payroll gains – to a halt.
How Le Pen would deal with such a situation is anyone’s guess. At least on the surface, markets have less reason to be afraid of her winning than five years ago. Grand plans to leave the euro and the European Union have disappeared from her platform (which explains why she has picked up so many votes from the mainstream conservative Republicains). Even so, “with her agenda of protectionism, reform rollbacks, subsidies and harsh measures against immigration, she would likely trigger noisy conflicts within the EU,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist with Berenberg Bank, in a note to clients.
‘Noisy’ is putting it mildly. Not much in Le Pen’s agenda is compatible with the EU’s budget or antitrust rules. For markets at least, however, given that her party would still need to win control of the Assemblee Nationale in June to enact that agenda – which seems unlikely – the realistic worst-case scenario for markets looks reasonably limited.
Of more concern is that a Le Pen victory would be - quite literally – a death sentence for Ukraine, and an invitation to Russia to continue its imperial adventures in eastern Europe if and when it ever succeeds in digesting its current prey. During the campaign, Le Pen told a television interview unapologetically that she would rather bring gasoline prices down for French drivers than support Ukraine with sanctions on Russia. That kind of talk can buy votes today cheaply enough, but in the long term may cost Europe even more than her dream of ‘Frexit’ would have.",,,,,

90,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 11:37AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- One of President Joe Biden’s top economic advisers touted White House efforts to tamp down soaring energy costs, a major driver of the largest annual consumer price increase since 1981.
“This president is dispatching his team do everything we can to help ease energy price pressures,” Jared Bernstein, a member of Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg Television following the Labor Department’s release of consumer price index data for March.
The widely followed inflation gauge showed consumer prices rose 8.5% over the past year -- the most in four decades -- and 1.2% from a month earlier, for the biggest one-month gain since 2005. 
Bernstein cited Biden’s decision two weeks ago to order the largest-ever release from the strategic petroleum reserve in showcasing the administration’s efforts to address the rising cost of living.
Biden on Tuesday will announce plans to allow expanded sales of higher-ethanol gasoline in a further effort to lower costs at the pump. 
Gasoline costs drove half of the March monthly increase, and food was also a large contributor. Prices for rent and services such as airline fares also rose.
White House officials are attempting to cast inflation as an outgrowth of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, referring to increased energy costs as “Putin’s price hike.” 
“A full 70% of that increase is due to energy costs, 63% of that increase is due to gas alone,” Bernstein said. “In other words, this is a CPI print very much with the fingerprints of Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and its impact on commodity prices.”
Rising prices across the board, however, have dogged the administration for the past year, long before Putin moved into Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The risk for the White House is that the rising costs continue to hurt Americans’ bottom lines -- and potentially color their perception of Democrats’ handling of the economy six months out from midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.

91,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 11:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Consumer-goods prices, at the root of the U.S. inflation spike over the last year, are showing signs of cooling just as services costs accelerate.
Prices for goods excluding food, energy and used cars rose 0.4% in March from a month earlier, the smallest advance in a year. That deceleration in prices was partly due to more moderate price gains for apparel, new cars and housekeeping supplies.
The costs of core services, which excludes energy, rose 0.6% from a month earlier, the most since October 1992 and consistent with a broader reopening of the economy from coronavirus restrictions.
Price growth accelerated for car rentals, hotel stays and medical services. And airline fares posted the largest monthly gain on record, rising 10.7%. Shelter costs, which includes rents and hotel fees and accounts for a third of the overall CPI, rose 0.5% for a second month.
Economists and Federal Reserve policy makers have been looking for signs of slowing goods inflation after many months of broad-based increases. While March appears to have shown some respite for merchandise, price increases in services are likely to keep inflation well above the Fed’s goal for the remainder of the year, keeping the central bank on track to take a more aggressive policy approach.
“Slower core-goods inflation is partly offset by higher services inflation, underscoring the challenge the Fed faces in taming price pressures even if supply and demand in the goods sector were to balance,” Bloomberg economists Anna Wong and Andrew Husby said in a note. 
“The Fed needs to hike rates expeditiously, but if goods demand continues to cool they may not need to hike as aggressively as the market -- now pricing in almost three 50-bps rate hikes this year -- currently expects,” they said.
Another factor that could drive services prices higher is labor costs, given the tight job market with near-record open positions. Upward pressure on wages feeds risks of greater upward pressure on prices for services such as medical care, recreation and meals out, economists at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). said in a note.
“This underlying inflationary pressure resulting from a tight labor market could be the most important element keeping the Fed raising rates quickly back towards its estimate of the long run neutral rate,” Citi economists Veronica Clark and Andrew Hollenhorst said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on global supply chains but new International Monetary Fund research shows that more diversification of source countries and inputs can significantly reduce the economic drag from supply disruptions.
In an analytical chapter of its forthcoming World Economic Outlook, IMF researchers said that countries experienced larger declines of goods imports, and GDP, in the first half of 2020 when trading partners imposed strict COVID-19 lockdowns.
Such declines revealed the vulnerabilities of value chains optimized for maximum efficiency and have prompted governments to call for more production to be brought home.
""Dismantling global value chains is not the answer. More diversification, not less, improves resilience,"" the researchers wrote in a blog post accompanying the chapter. 
Simulating a lockdown akin to those in China in early 2020, the researchers said by that reducing labor supply by 25% in a single large supplier of intermediate components, the average economy's output fell by around 0.8%.
But with higher diversification among source countries, the decline would be reduced by about half, to about 0.4%.
Even in scenarios where there are shocks to multiple countries, high source diversification reduces the level of GDP decline by about 5%.
But in a largely global lockdown such as the first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic, high diversification provides almost no diversification among downside risks.
The IMF researchers said that the benefits of increased geographical diversification raise questions about national policies aimed at ""reshoring"" production to domestic sources, such as the Made In-China 2025 program, the Make in India initiative and the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act of 2021.
""The evidence from a modeling approach suggests that resilience to cross-border supply shocks can be increased with greater input source diversification (using more foreign inputs) and greater input substitutability (across suppliers), although the benefits are smaller if shocks are more widespread and correlated across countries,"" the IMF said.

Substitutions can also be achieved through greater production flexibility, the IMF said, such as when electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) responded to a semiconductor shortage by rewriting software in its cars to use alternative chips. It also cited General Motors (NYSE:GM)' moves to replace 95% of the unique chips it uses with more standardized microcontrollers.
The IMF recommended governments prioritize improving vaccine access to end the pandemic as soon as possible, to improve trade logistics through better infrastructure and reduce trade barriers.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's biggest banks started fiscal 2022 on a hiring spree, adding staff despite a tight labour market, especially to boost digital capabilities.
Their expansion in the midst of surging inflation could threaten profit margins, particularly as higher interest rates weigh on loan volumes.
""It's a Catch-22,"" said Avenue Investment Management portfolio manager Bryden Teich. From a short-term profitability perspective, ""you don't want them aggressively growing their costs at this part of the economic cycle.""
But not adding staff when clients are seeking more advice and personalized solutions and better digital offerings would hurt longer-term growth, he added.
The top five banks had increased their Canadian full-time equivalent positions to a record 171,730 in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, up 4.3% from a year ago for the fastest pace in at least three years, according to Reuters' analysis of the banks' statements.
The unemployment rate in the finance, insurance and real estate industries was at a record low 1% in March, the lowest of any industry in Canada.
Carolyn Hamer, partner at Deloitte focused on workforce-related issues, said the banks are trying to plug the digital gaps they recognized during the pandemic and are starting to get more aggressive as they compete with large technology firms.
Even in a tight labour market, banks can turn to contractors and gig workers, particularly with employees themselves seeking more flexibility, she said.
Bank of Montreal, whose Canadian workforce grew by 7.5%, the fastest of the major lenders, has been expanding its technology operations and personal and commercial banking, said Karen Collins, its chief talent officer. 
Digital channels now account for more than a third of sales, and 90% of self-serve transactions happen outside branches, primarly online, so BMO wants to improve technology infrastructure and replace routine branch services with more advisory offerings, Collins said. 
BMO is offering remote working flexibility, particularly to technology workers, if their roles allow, she added.
Royal Bank of Canada's employee growth peaked in the third quarter of 2021 but it is still expanding its technology workforce, after adding 2,000 technology jobs last year, about half of those external hires, said Helena Gottschling, chief human resources officer. 
""It is harder to source those critical skills, because we're not the only employer hiring and... (we get) fewer applications than three years ago,"" she said.
""In a tight talent market, compensation always rises to the top as an important lever,"" she added. ""We know who our top talent is"" and reward them accordingly. 
While this could boost labor costs more than expected, rising margins from higher interest rates could offset this, said Jason Boggs, Canadian banking and capital markets leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Toronto-Dominion Bank announced plans to add 2,000 technology roles this year. 
Anna Zec, senior vice president for human resources at Bank of Nova Scotia, said Scotiabank's hiring surge reverses a pandemic reduction in recruitment.
Scotiabank, which had the second-biggest growth, plans to continue to expand Canadian banking and wealth management, and build its digital capabilities, she told Reuters. 

""Customers are asking for more and more digital solutions... I don't foresee our demand for technology talent slowing down anytime soon,"" she said. ""I think 2022 will continue to be a very challenging year from a talent standpoint.""

(Reuters) -Prices for online goods continued to surge in March at a record pace, data released on Tuesday from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc showed, adding a potentially troubling dimension to the Federal Reserve's battle to slow the overall pace of price increases.
Adobe's digital price index increased by 3.6% from a year earlier, the same as in February, with costs for apparel - long a category with heavy online discounting - up 16.3% from a year before and online grocery prices up 9%.
Adobe began publishing a monthly digital price index last year, tracking tens of millions of online goods in 18 categories aligned similarly to the government's Consumer Price Index.
New CPI data on Tuesday showed prices rose 8.5% over the last 12 months as of March, the largest increase since December, 1981. Even as inflation for some goods eased, it spread to items like food away from home and airline fares, evidence demand was shifting as expected to services but also a sign that the move won't necessarily cure the inflation problems on its own. 
For the Fed, the shift in online price dynamics is one more piece of evidence that the factors driving U.S. and global inflation may have changed fundamentally, or at least in ways that will not revert quickly to the more tempered inflation seen before the pandemic.
""Over the past 30 years globalization, demographics, technological change have driven prices. The Fed cannot do anything about the three of them,"" said RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas. ""We are just going through a period of prolonged disruption"" that could mean structurally higher inflation as populations age and then save less and spend down assets, and globalization suffers through a series of shocks including the trade war launched by former President Donald Trump, the pandemic, and now the war in Ukraine.
Technology continues to offer potential relief through higher productivity, but as the Adobe index showed, at least for now that impact is not being felt for key consumer goods.
""MORE PERSISTENT""
The Fed in March raised the target federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point in the first of an anticipated series of increases this year. 
Coming hikes may be in larger half-point increments, and the central bank is expected to soon begin trimming its asset portfolio, which may further raise borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. 
Still, the gap between current inflation and the Fed rate is among the largest on record, a measure of the Fed's reluctance last year to begin rate hikes when inflation first took off. 
That hesitancy was rooted in a belief that the forces driving inflation represented temporary disruptions that would snap back to prior form and cause inflation to behave as it did when it was pinned close to 2%, the Fed's targeted level.
""It's gonna take time for us to appreciate the recent burst of relative prices and how long they're going to be with us,"" Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Monday. ""They're much more persistent than initially expected, (but) I don't think they're going to be permanent.""
The issue is central to how Fed policy evolves this year. If inflation does ease as pandemic and other shocks abate, the Fed can do less. Otherwise more of the work will fall to monetary policy, likely raising the risk of recession as the Fed becomes even more aggressive. 
Research out last week from Michael Kiley, deputy director of the Fed's Division of Financial Stability, examined whether the 2000-2019 experience showed that inflation was clearly ""anchored"" at 2% then - perhaps because of larger structural reasons that could dominate again - or was simply persistent, and tended in the future to be what it was in the past absent some shock. 
His conclusion: It could be either. 
Data from 2000 to 2019 ""contains very little information"" to argue convincingly that inflation isn't persistent.
Policymakers have turned attention to the reasons why a phase of endemically higher inflation may be at hand, with key culprits including tight labor markets and the consequent higher wage pressure, to the reordering of global supply chains as firms insure against future disruptions by locking down multiple sources or investing closer to home at a higher cost.
At a Fed event on Monday, one trucking industry executive painted a grim picture of how the pandemic had upended pricing expectations and how long it may take to sort out, if ever.

Crissy Wieck, chief sales officer at Western Express, said after boosting driver wages 40% last year, the company faces a more than 80% jump in trailer prices, from $28,500 to $52,000, constraining efforts to increase its capacity.
""Your business can't function without raising the cost of what we do every day,"" she said at an event in Nashville, one of the Fed Listens series of community sessions. ""There hasn’t been an infusion of 200, 300, 400,000 extra trucks to take the pressure off. ... We won’t have new trucks until 2024. So that supply chain and that supply demand ratio is not going to correct.""

Investing.com -- Peace talks with Ukraine ""are at a dead end"", Russian news agencies quoted President Vladimir Putin as saying on Tuesday, raising the prospect of a fresh assault on Ukrainian territory in the coming days. 
Speaking at a joint press conference with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said that Ukraine had not honored the tentative agreements made in peace talks in Istanbul over recent weeks. He didn't elaborate. 
Earlier, during a tour of a space facility in Russia's Far East, Putin had repeated his familiar criticisms of Ukraine, claiming that Neo-Nazism had taken root there and that a conflict with Russia was ""inevitable"" and ""just a matter of time.""
However, he had said that the main aim of what Russia calls a ""special military operation"" had been ""to help the people of Donbas"", the regions of eastern Ukraine that seceded in 2014 with support from the Russian military. Russia has supported breakaway 'republics' in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions since that time, and formally acknowledged their independence just before invading the rest of the country in February.
Putin had initially said that the aim of Russia's actions was to ""de-Nazify"" and ""demilitarize"" Ukraine, and sent thousands of troops to conquer Ukraine's capital Kyiv. However, its army suffered repeated setbacks in that theater due to determined resistance from Ukrainian forces, and was withdrawn two weeks ago to concentrate on the conquest of Donbas. ",,,,,

GENEVA (Reuters) -The World Trade Organization (WTO) on Tuesday revised down its forecast for global trade growth this year to 3% from 4.7% because of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and warned of a potential food crisis caused by surging prices.
The report from the global trade watchdog said the conflict, now in its seventh week, had damaged the world economy at a critical juncture as the coronavirus pandemic - and Chinese lockdowns specifically - continues to weigh on the recovery.
""The economic reverberations of this conflict will extend far beyond Ukraine's borders,"" WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told a news conference presenting the findings.
""It's now clear that the double whammy of the pandemic and the war has disrupted supply chains, increased inflationary pressures and lowered expectations for output and trade growth.""
The Geneva-based body forecast global trade growth in 2023 would inch up to 3.4%, noting that both 2022 and 2023 estimates are less certain than usual due to uncertainty about the conflict. 
Okonjo-Iweala also warned of a potential food crisis because of disruptions to exports from Ukraine and Russia, both major suppliers of grains and other commodities, that could hit poor countries, including some 35 African importers, the hardest. 
""This is why we need to act and act decisively on this issue of food in order to avoid food riots,"" she said, citing the need for more transparent monitoring systems and potential releases of buffer stocks to lower prices.
She urged countries to remain committed to the multilateral trading system to stave off the risk of it splitting into two spheres. ""I think the costs to the global economy will be quite significant if we do that,"" she said.

WTO chief economist Robert Koopman said there was an ""extremely difficult set of circumstances in the world economy"" but said trade remained resilient and that warnings of the end of globalisation were unfounded.
""So far there's been no evidence of reshoring,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Thursday's European Central Bank meeting could mark another tense moment for policymakers caught between record high inflation and the economic hit from the war in Ukraine. 
As some of the most dovish major central banks change tune to tackle surging inflation, some ECB Governing Council (GC) members are also pushing for an interest rate rise sooner rather than later.
Here are five key questions for markets.
1/ When will the ECB hike rates?
A growing number of conservative policymakers would like an interest rate increase before year-end. Markets are betting the -0.5% deposit rate could rise as early as July.
The ECB has not made any commitments and President Christine Lagarde could be pressed on timing. U.S. rates rose in March, and Britain has hiked three times since December. 
A prerequisite to an ECB rate move is ending bond purchases in the third quarter. The ECB says any increase will come some time after this.
""This meeting is key because it is hard to see currently what the ECB's main message is,"" said ING's global head of macro Carsten Brzeski. ""It needs to give more guidance."" 
GRAPHIC: Money markets bet ECB will raise rates fast (https://graphics.reuters.com/EUROPE-MARKETS/gdpzybkonvw/chart.png) 
2. Could the hawks push for a precise end-date to bond buying?
Don't rule it out. Recent ECB decisions have surprised markets and pressure is building after March's 7.5% headline inflation print.
The ECB in March decided to end asset purchases sometime in the third quarter but made no further commitment on how to exit stimulus. Minutes from that meeting show a sizable group wanted to set a firm end-date for asset purchases.
""The debate and positions on the GC will only get more entrenched as inflation far exceeds its (2%) target, but the flip side is that growth is going to be much weaker,"" said Nick Kounis, head of financial markets research at ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd). 
GRAPHIC: ECB plans to end asset purchases in Q3 (https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/mopanborjva/ECBAprilAPP.PNG) 
3. Is the ECB behind the curve on inflation?
Well, it has persistently underestimated price pressures over the past year and concern that high inflation could become entrenched is growing. Inflation shows few signs of peaking. The ECB is not alone, with many central banks accused of being too slow to respond to soaring prices. 
While the ECB would normally tighten policy to fight inflation, such a move could further hurt consumers, already hit by rising energy prices.
Chief Economist Philip Lane says the ECB should take its time analysing the data.
""The ECB is probably a bit behind the curve, but not much, as the euro area economy is the epicentre of the adverse fallout of the war and a sharp growth slowdown would help tame inflation,"" said Generali (MI:GASI) Investments' senior economist Martin Wolburg. 
GRAPHIC: Inflation is well above its 2% target (https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbpgnmyxdvq/ECBAprilCPI.PNG) 
4. Is there a risk of stagflation?
Yes, say economists. Major economies are grappling with high inflation, but the euro area is the most exposed to the Ukraine conflict. So risks of weak growth and high inflation, or stagflation, are rising.
Germany's council of economic advisers has more than halved its 2022 growth forecast to 1.8%, and euro area consumer confidence has plunged. ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos expects second-quarter growth to hover around zero.
ECB chief Lagarde says the ECB does not expect war in Ukraine to lead to stagflation. 
GRAPHIC: Cracks widen in euro zone economy as war in Ukraine rages on (https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/myvmnqrbxpr/sentiment0804.PNG) 
5. What about losing Russian energy?
Europe depends on Russia for about 40% of its gas needs and without it, would have to buy more gas on the spot market where prices are around 500% higher than 2021.
Germany has already activated the first stage of an emergency plan to manage Russian gas supplies in preparation for possible disruptions or a halt. 
In a pessimistic scenario, where energy supply from Russia is cut by 50%, UBS Investment Bank economist Reinhard Cluse expects inflation to spike above 9% with a recession possible.

If Russian gas stops completely, the ECB could consider a new stimulus scheme or extend asset purchases, others add, although postponing potential rate hikes seems more likely.

""We cannot wait...We need powerful decisions, and the EU must take them now. They must sanction oil and all Russian banks...Each EU state must set terms for when they will refuse or limit (Russian) energy sources such as gas"", he said.
""Only then will the Russian government understand they need to seek peace, that the war is turning into a catastrophe for them,"" he told the Lithuanian parliament in a video address.
Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 on what he calls a special military operation to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression. 
The EU executive is drafting proposals for a possible EU oil embargo on Russia, foreign ministers have said, although there is still no agreement to ban Russian crude.
Galvanised by what Ukraine says are senseless killings of civilians by Russian troops since the start of the invasion, the bloc last week approved a fifth round of sanctions on Russia that included an end to Russian coal imports.

Zelenskiy told the parliament that Russian soldiers had behaved the same everywhere they had stayed as they did in the town of Bucha. Russian forces are accused of killing many civilians there, although the Kremlin has denied this and says the incident was staged.
The Ukrainian leader also said Russia had deported hundreds of thousands of people from occupied Ukrainian regions into ""filtration camps"". There was no comment from Moscow moment on the latest allegations but it generally denies targeting and abusing civilians in the conflict.

Investing.com -- U.S. inflation is set to hit its highest level in 40 years in March, raising the pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. China's government head calls for accelerated stimulus to cushion the impact of spreading Covid lockdowns. German economic sentiment darkens as Europe braces for a fresh Russian onslaught in Ukraine, and OPEC and the U.S. government both publish regular updates on the state of the oil market.  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) throws money at videogames publisher Epic, and CarMax (NYSE:KMX) reports earnings. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 12th April
1. Inflation set to hit new 40-year high 
U.S. inflation is set to hit another 40-year high later, as surging energy prices, disrupted supply chains and a tight labor market combine to form a powerful cocktail. The benchmark 10-Year Treasury yield hit a new three-year high of 2.80% overnight in anticipation.
Analysts expect the headline annual rate of inflation to hit 8.4%, from 7.9% in February. The core rate is expected to rise to 6.6% from 6.4%. Base effects mean that this could be the month that the annual rate peaks. For that reason, it will be important to keep an eye on the month-on-month rates to judge the strength of current price dynamics.
Lael Brainard, Joe Biden’s nominee for the vice-chair position at the Federal Reserve, will speak at 12:10 PM ET (1610 GMT), while Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin will give his two cents’ worth at 5:30 PM ET.
2. Chinese Premier calls for stimulus to cushion Covid blow
China’s Prime Minister Li Keqiang issued his third warning about the growth outlook in less than a week and called for planned stimulus measures to be accelerated.
Authorities should “add a sense of urgency” when implementing existing policies, Bloomberg reported Li as saying.
There’s still no end in sight to the lockdowns that are affecting Shanghai, China’s biggest financial hub and a major manufacturing sector of 25 million people. The EU Chamber of Commerce estimates that half of its German members’ supply chains are either “completely” or “severely” disrupted as a result of lockdowns that – according to Nomura economists – now cover nearly 400 million people in varying degrees of severity.
3. Stocks set to open mixed; CarMax, Sony in focus
U.S. stocks are expected to open mixed later, with traders loath to take many risks in premarket ahead of the CPI numbers at 8:30 AM ET.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 14 points, or less than 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures were up by less than 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.2%. The Nasdaq had underperformed again on Monday, falling over 2% as fears about rising interest rates again strained the valuation models underpinning many technology stocks.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include CarMax, whose quarterly earnings come at a time when the market for used cars is starting to show signs of softening, and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), which is facing a sellers’ strike after it said it wanted to raise its fees.
Sony (NYSE:SONY) ADRs and videogames makers may also get attention after the Japanese company invested in Fortnite publisher Epic Games at a valuation of nearly $32 billion.
4. European data worsen as Ukraine braces for Russian attack
The economic data in Europe continues to worsen against the backdrop of a war that shows no sign of ending, and every sign of intensifying in the near future.
The German ZEW Economic Sentiment index fell again to its lowest since March 2020, with the think-tank warning that the prospect of stagflation over the next six months “remains real”. German consumer inflation was confirmed at 7.3% in March.
In the U.K. meanwhile, the monthly drop in those claiming unemployment benefits was the smallest in six months, while employment in the three months through March grew only 10,000, well below forecasts.
Emerging markets continued to throw up more dramatic economic news, however, with Sri Lanka declaring a halt to foreign debt payments.
5. Oil rebounds ahead of OPEC and EIA reports; API inventories due
Crude oil prices bounced back from their recent China-driven selloff, with Brent crude trading back above $101 a barrel and U.S. crude futures rising 3.3% to $97.34 a barrel.
There’s no sign of relief coming from the war in Ukraine, where the government has warned it expects a fresh Russian onslaught in the east of the country. Austria’s Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he had “no positive impression” for peace after meeting with Russia’s Vladimir Putin on Monday.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will update its forecasts for global supply and demand in its monthly report later, while the U.S. will release its Short-Term Energy Outlook at 12 PM ET.
The American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly assessment of U.S. crude and product stocks at 4:30 PM as usual."

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia can afford to wage a long war in Ukraine despite being hammered by Western sanctions aimed at crippling its ability to sustain the campaign, defence experts and economists say.
Russia's invasion has driven up the price of the oil, gas and grain it exports, providing it with a substantial windfall to fund its ""special military operation"" - now entering a new phase as Moscow focuses on the eastern Donbas region after failing to break Ukraine's defence of the capital Kyiv.
As the war grinds on, rising casualties and the need to rotate fresh troops into battle may prove more pressing challenges than the financial cost.
    ""This type of low-tech war can be financed almost entirely in roubles, which means they can continue pouring troops and heavy artillery into Ukraine at least until there's a more general collapse of the economy,"" said Jacob Kirkegaard, economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Johan Norberg, senior analyst at the Swedish Defence Research Agency, said: ""The sanctions will not affect this war in the short run, because Russia's military is fighting with tanks it had already built and soldiers it had already trained.""
Sanctions are expected to shrink the economy by more than 11% this year, the World Bank says, but revenues from energy exports are actually increasing. The Russian finance ministry said on April 5 that Moscow expects to earn $9.6 billion in additional revenue from energy sales in April alone thanks to high oil prices, which remain around $100 a barrel.
There is no doubt, however, that Russia's vaunted military machine has taken a huge and costly hit.
The United States assesses that Russia has lost about 15-20% of its combat power during its invasion of Ukraine, a senior U.S. defence official said.
That includes everything from tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery systems, fighter and bomber aircraft and helicopters to surface-to-air and ballistic missiles, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
LOST TANKS
According to Oryx, a closely watched military blog which tallies both sides' losses based on verifiable visual evidence, Russia had lost at least 2,770 items of military equipment as of Tuesday, including at least 476 tanks that had been destroyed, damaged, abandoned or captured.
That, said Yohann Michel of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), is more than the combined tank strength of NATO members France (222) and Britain (227).
Russia, which had around 3,000 tanks before the war, according to IISS figures, is not about to run out. But experts said some of those are likely to be old, in poor condition or held for spare parts, so the effective number available for combat is lower.
Mathieu Boulegue, a specialist in the Russian military at Chatham House, said Moscow had so far held back its most modern weaponry, which it is reluctant to lose, and relied heavily on an abundance of more expendable Soviet-era hardware.
He said it could take ""a decade or two at least"" to rebuild equipment levels to where they were before the war - a task complicated by a host of factors including design and innovation challenges, corruption, the indebted state of defence companies and a lack of access to Western microelectronics because of sanctions. 
DEFENCE BURDEN
Russian military spending will need to rise both because of the war with Ukraine and the resulting sharp increase in tension with NATO, which has sent thousands more troops to eastern Europe, said Richard Connolly, an associate fellow at RUSI in London and director of the Eastern Advisory Group consultancy.
He said defence spending as a share of GDP could rise significantly from its current level of around 4%, potentially doubling in the next few years.
Connolly said ordinary Russians would feel the impact but the state could comfortably pay for the war effort, even if its economy is plunged into recession. If necessary it could commandeer resources like fuel from state-owned companies.
The more pressing question, he said, was the level of casualties and the difficulty of sustaining a war involving up to 150,000 troops at a time.
Russia has so far acknowledged only 1,351 troops killed and 3,825 wounded, although Ukraine and Western governments believe the toll is many times higher. Its army and airborne troops have a combined strength of about 325,000.
Eventually, Connolly said, it may have to take the politically unpopular decision to dip into its reserves, which the IISS estimates to number 2 million men under 50 with military service within the past five years.

""If you’ve got 150,000 committed to Ukraine, you’ve got half of your effective army currently in combat operations, many of which have experienced significant losses,"" Connolly said.
""So they’re going to need to replace, they’re going to need to rotate them. They're using their entire army, basically - or they will be if this goes on for very much longer.""

103,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 04:36AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russia's economy is on track to contract by more than 10% in 2022, the biggest fall in gross domestic product since the years following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, former finance minister Alexei Kudrin said on Tuesday.
Russia is facing soaring inflation and capital flight while grappling with a possible debt default after the West imposed crippling sanctions to punish President Vladimir Putin for sending tens of thousands of troops to Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Russia's economy and finance ministries are currently working on new forecasts, RIA state news agency quoted Kudrin, who now serves as head of the Audit Chamber, as saying.
""The official forecast would be for more than around a 10% contraction,"" said Kudrin, who served as Putin's finance minister from 2000 to 2011, according to RIA.
Previous Russian government forecasts envisaged gross domestic product growth of 3% this year after the economy expanded by 4.7% in 2021.
A source close to the Russian government who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters that the economy ministry projects a GDP contraction of between 10% and 15% this year.
A contraction of 10% would amount to the biggest decline in gross domestic product since 1994, according to World Bank and International Monetary Fund data. 
The World Bank this month forecast Russian GDP output would fall 11.2% this year.
Analysts polled by Reuters in late March had on average forecast 2022 GDP contraction at 7.3%, predicting a pick up in inflation to nearly 24%, its highest since 1999.

Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to act to defend Russian-speaking people in Ukraine against persecution.
Ukraine says it is fighting against an imperial-style land grab and dismisses Putin's claims of genocide as nonsense.

104,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 04:31AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Euro zone banks plan to sharply tighten access to corporate credit in the second quarter as the war in Ukraine weighs on the outlook and cuts deep into their risk tolerance, a European Central Bank survey showed on Tuesday.
As the war drags on and inflation soars, policymakers have become increasingly concerned that banks will curtail lending, growing reluctant to finance investment during a period of uncertainty. They also fear that higher household spending on daily necessities will curtail their disposable income.
Credit standards, or banks' internal loan approval criteria, already grew tighter during the first quarter over perceptions of increased risk, due in part to high inflation and continued supply chain disruptions, the ECB said.
But the second quarter is likely to be even more difficult as banks seek to protect their balance sheets from the fallout of Russia's war in Ukraine and they remain concerned about high input prices. 
""Banks expect a considerably stronger net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms, likely reflecting the uncertain economic impact of the war in Ukraine and the anticipation of less accommodative monetary policy,"" the ECB said in a quarterly lending survey.
""In addition, banks expect a moderate net tightening of credit standards for housing loans and for consumer credit and other lending to households,"" it added.
Still, demand for credit continued to rise across the board in the first quarter and the ECB expects a net increase in corporate loan demand in the second quarter even as interest in mortgages will likely drop. 

The survey is normally a key input in the bank's policy deliberations and policymakers are likely to be concerned that the flow of credit to the economy is dropping just as growth is coming to a standstill. 
The bank will next meet on April 14 and while no major policy action is expected, the ECB could provide further detail on how it plans to roll back its extraordinary stimulus, fearing that inflation is now a bigger problem than weak growth.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's economy likely expanded at a slower pace in the first quarter, but is expected to stay on its recovery path this year as border controls are relaxed further, giving the central bank room to tighten monetary policy to tackle inflation.
Advance data on Thursday is seen showing gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 3.8% in January-March from a year ago, according to the median forecast of 15 economists in a Reuters poll, as the manufacturing sector comes off a high base and amid travel curbs to curb a COVID-19 outbreak driven by Omicron.
Manufacturing remained the main growth engine, helped in part by demand for semiconductors, analysts said. The city-state's economy expanded 6.1% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
Singapore's recent easing of border controls and COVID-19 rules are expected to boost services from the second quarter, partly offsetting the negative impact of the Ukraine-Russia war, supply disruptions and rising energy prices, Maybank economists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye said.
The trade-reliant economy grew 7.6% last year, the fastest pace in a decade, recovering from a 4.1% contraction in 2020. 
The government had projected GDP growth of 3-5% in 2022, though this was before Russia began what it calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Inflation has become the key risk this year and while economists expect GDP to continue to grow they are watching to see whether official forecasts are revised when the central bank gives its monetary policy statement, also on Thursday. 
Sixteen economists expect the Monetary Authority of Singapore to tighten its policy, but are divided on how aggressive it will be and which of its settings will change.
Instead of interest rates, the MAS manages policy by letting the local dollar rise or fall against currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed band, known as the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER). 
It adjusts its policy via three levers: the slope, mid-point and width of the policy band.

DBS Senior FX Strategist Philip Wee expects a third steepening in the slope of the SGD NEER policy band to 3%.
""We expect the authority to keep the door open for another tightening in October. The MAS could re-centre the policy band higher six months after returning to a 3% slope, as they did in April 2008 and April 2011,"" he said.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Bank of Korea is likely to stand pat at its meeting this week as its committee awaits the appointment of a new governor, but it will embrace a steeper rate hike path ahead to tame more than decade-high inflation, a Reuters poll showed.
While the U.S. Federal Reserve has now begun a tightening cycle and the European Central Bank is not expected to raise rates until later this year, South Korea's central bank has been quick to address high inflation and ballooning household debt.
The BoK has raised its base rate by 75 basis points since August, taking it to 1.25%, making it the first major Asian central bank to normalize policy from pandemic-induced lows.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated inflationary pressures. March inflation showed prices rose 4.1% from a year earlier, staying above the BoK's target of 2% for the 12th straight month and increasing the chances of another rate hike.
But the latest survey of 29 economists, taken April 4-11, suggested the BoK will hold its policy rate at 1.25% on April 14 on growth concerns and its own lack of a governor.
""Above all, the meeting is set to take place without a governor, as the parliamentary hearing for nominee Chang-Yong Rhee is to be held on April 19,"" said Oh Suktae, an economist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
""But concerns on growth have also increased due to the war in Ukraine, the Fed's hawkish stance, and the ongoing Omicron wave. A significant slowdown in household debt growth may also result in a wait-and-see stance.""
South Korea's central bank senior deputy governor Lee Seung-heon said last week the April policy review meeting will be tricky, citing the twin challenges of dealing with higher inflationary risks and downward pressure on growth.
Yet almost 38%, or 11 of 29 economists, expected a 25 basis point hike at the upcoming meeting.
""Despite increasing growth uncertainties, we think the economic risks from rising inflation and financial imbalances will sway the BOK to continue with its rate hike cycle,"" said Lloyd Chan, senior economist at Oxford Economics, who expects a hike.
The poll medians also showed the BoK following a steeper rate hiking path to control unruly inflation. Interest rates are now expected at 2.0% by year-end, a level which a February poll only forecast them to reach by the end of 2023.
Inflation forecasts were significantly upgraded in the current poll to 3.8%, 3.5% and 2.9% for the second, third and fourth quarters of the year, from 2.5%, 2.1% and 1.5% estimated in a January survey.
Inflation was predicted to average 3.3% and 2.0% for 2022 and 2023, a sharp rise from 2.0% and 1.6% in the last poll.
""Inflation is likely to stay elevated at least in the near term, after the rally in global energy prices,"" noted Sanjay Mathur, chief economist, Southeast Asia & India at ANZ.

""While producers have started to pass through the higher costs of inputs to consumers, the still large gap between PPI and CPI point to persistent price pressures in the pipeline.""
The South Korean economy was forecast to expand 2.8% in 2022, down from 2.9% estimated in the January poll. However, the growth forecast for next year increased to 2.6% from 2.5%.

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican truck drivers blockaded two busy bridges at the border with United States on Monday amid rising tensions on both sides over an order by Texas Governor Greg Abbott that has slowed commercial crossings between Mexico and Texas.
""We're desperate because we have to wait up to 15 hours to cross into the United States,"" said truck driver Pedro Gonzalez as he and others protested at the Zaragoza bridge connecting Ciudad Juarez to El Paso.
Abbott ordered the state's Department of Public Safety (DPS) last week to conduct ""enhanced safety inspections"" of vehicles as they cross from Mexico into Texas in order to uncover smuggling of people and contraband.
The inspections were part of a broader effort to deter illegal immigration, Abbott said.
However the order has infuriated industry groups and threatened to alienate even some of Abbott's allies.
""We are supporters of Governor Abbott, but unfortunately we weren't taken into consideration,"" said Ernesto Gaytan, chairman of Texas Trucking Association, who said he'd been fielding calls from frustrated drivers since the order took effect.
Gaytan said migrants rarely tried to cross the border illegally via commercial trucks at legal ports of entry.
""Slowing down trade isn't the solution."" 
A Texas DPS spokesperson said that since Abbott's order was issued, the agency had inspected nearly 2,400 commercial vehicles and taken 552 vehicles out of service for ""serious safety violations"" such as defective brakes, tires and lighting.
The spokesperson declined to say whether the effort had uncovered any smuggling attempts. 
A second bridge, connecting the Mexican city of Reynosa to Pharr, Texas, was also blockaded by truck drivers.

Dante Galeazzi, president of the Texas International Produce Association, said the delays at the Pharr bridge alone had, since Friday, prevented an estimated $30 million of fresh produce from reaching the U.S. side.
""There are very likely to be store shelves devoid of fresh produce items this Easter holiday weekend,"" he said, warning that prices would rise for consumers if the delays continued.

108,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 06:21PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ukraine's finance ministry on Monday welcomed the creation of a special new account set up by the International Monetary Fund to give bilateral donors and international organizations a secure way to send financial resources to war-torn Ukraine.
The IMF's executive board approved creation of the new account on Friday after the Canadian government proposed disbursing up to $1 billion Canadian dollars through the vehicle, which is to be administered by the IMF.
The account will allow donors to provide grants and loans to help the Ukrainian government meet its balance of payments and budgetary needs and help stabilize its economy as it continues to defend against Russia's deadly invasion.
Russia calls its actions a ""special military operation.""
""Donors will benefit from the IMF's tested infrastructure to quickly deliver authenticated payments,"" the IMF said.
Going through the global lender will allow donations to Ukraine to be frozen in the event of a Russian takeover of power in Ukraine, experts say.
Donors will deposit reserve currencies or Special Drawing Rights, the IMF's own reserve currency, into the new account, which will then disburse these resources as grants or loans into Ukraine's SDR account at the fund.
Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko last week said his government was seeking about 4 billion euros ($4.37 billion) in foreign financing in addition to the about 3 billion euros it has already received to deal with a budget shortfall.
IMF staff last month said Ukraine's economy was expected to contract by 10% in 2022 as a result of the invasion, but warned the outlook could worsen sharply if the conflict drags on.
One source familiar with the plans said additional donations were expected for both the IMF account and a separate World Bank account set up for Ukraine during next week's spring meetings of the two global financial institutions.

The IMF in March also approved a $1.4 billion disbursement to Ukraine under its Rapid Financing Instrument.
IMF staff continue to engage closely with the authorities on their emergency response to the economic dislocations brought about by the war in Ukraine, the fund said.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected to deliver two back-to-back half-point interest rate hikes in May and June to tackle runaway inflation, according to economists polled by Reuters who also say the probability of a recession next year is 40%.
With the unemployment rate near a record low, inflation the highest in four decades and a surge in global commodity prices set to persist, most analysts say the Fed needs to move quickly to keep price pressures under control.
The latest April 4-8 Reuters poll of more than 100 economists forecast two half-point rate rises this year, the first such move since 1994, taking the federal funds rate to 1.25%-1.50% by the June meeting. 
That brings the end-year prediction from the March Reuters poll at least three months forward, and more in line with interest rate futures pricing.
A strong majority, or 85 of 102 economists, forecast 50 basis points in May, and a still-solid majority of 56 said the Fed would follow up with 50 basis points as well in June.
""Given the shift in official commentary and with inflation pressures visible throughout the economy, we believe the Fed will deliver half-point interest rate increases at the May, June and July policy meetings,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.
While the central bank, chaired by Jerome Powell, is likely to gear down to quarter-point moves in the second half of this year, the federal funds rate is now expected to end 2022 at 2.00%-2.25%, 50 basis points higher than the median forecast in a poll taken last month.
Moving so quickly with interest rates, especially in an economy that has become used to very low borrowing costs for many years, comes with risks.
""With the Fed seemingly feeling the need to 'catch up' to regain control of inflation and inflation expectations, a rapid-fire pace of aggressive interest-rate increases heightens the chances of a policy misstep that could be enough to topple the economy into a recession,"" added Knightley.
RAPID SLOWING 
Indeed, respondents to an additional question gave a median one-in-four chance of a U.S. recession in the coming year, rising to 40% over the next 24 months. The bond market is already showing signs of recession concerns. [US/INT]
That partly explains a rapid slowing in the pace of rate hikes next year to only a cumulative 50 basis points, according to the Reuters poll, bringing the fed funds rate to 2.50%-2.75% by the end of 2023.
A few economists are already predicting lower rates as soon as the fourth quarter of next year.
Yet despite expectations for an aggressive policy tightening path, inflation was not seen dropping to the Fed's 2% target at least until 2024.
The Russia-Ukraine war, which has sent commodity and energy prices soaring, is also making it harder to predict when inflation will eventually come down.
Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was predicted to have peaked at 7.9% last quarter, and average 6.8% this year, a significant upgrade from 6.1% in last month's poll.
The U.S. labor market was expected to further tighten after unemployment dropped to 3.6% last month, only slightly above pre-pandemic levels and what it is forecast to average in 2022.
The jobless rate was predicted to average 3.5% next year and stay there in 2024, roughly in line with the Fed's own optimistic view and not consistent with respondents' concerns about recession.

Growth forecasts were downgraded across the board. The economy was expected to grow 3.3% and 2.2% this year and next respectively, down from 3.6% and 2.4% predicted last month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sharply higher global food and energy prices due to the war in Ukraine are hitting poor countries, and better mechanisms for dealing with sovereign debt stress will be needed to stave off defaults, the IMF said on Monday.
""The war in Ukraine is adding risks to unprecedented levels of public borrowing while the pandemic is still straining many government budgets,"" Vitor Gaspar, director of the International Monetary Fund's fiscal affairs department, and Ceyla Pazarbasioglu, the IMF's strategy chief, wrote in a new blog.
""With sovereign debt risks elevated and financial constraints back at the center of policy concerns, a global cooperative approach is necessary to reach an orderly resolution of debt problems and prevent unnecessary defaults.""
Spikes in food and energy prices were hitting low-income countries particularly hard, and they may need more grants and highly concessional financing. Countries should undertake reforms to improve debt transparency and strengthen debt management policies to reduce risks.
About 60% of low-income countries were already in, or at risk of, debt distress, the authors said. Rising interest rates in major economies could lead to widening spreads for countries with weaker fundamentals, making it more costly for them to borrow. 
The credit crunch was exacerbated by declining overseas lending from China, which is grappling with solvency concerns in the real-estate sector, COVID-19 lockdowns and problems with existing loans to developing countries, they said.
Actions taken by major economies were insufficient, they said, noting that a freeze in official bilateral debt payments adopted at the start of the pandemic had ended, and no restructurings had been agreed under a framework set by the Group of 20 industrialized nations.

Options were needed for a broader range of countries, now not yet eligible for debt relief.
""Muddling through will amplify costs and risks to debtors, creditors and, more broadly, global stability and prosperity,"" they wrote. ""In the end, the impact will be most sharply felt by those households that can least afford it.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A rally in U.S. credit markets after the U.S. Federal Reserve started hiking rates last month was short-lived and some corporate bonds hit new lows on Monday amid rising bond yields and concerns over the economic outlook.
BlackRock’s iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF - an exchange-traded fund which tracks the U.S. junk-bond market – fell 0.6% to trade at $79.76 a share on Monday, its lowest since May 2020.
Its investment grade equivalent was also down sharply, by over 1%, hitting its lowest since March 2020.
Corporate bonds have had a rough start to the year but credit spreads - the interest rate premium investors demand to hold corporate debt over safer U.S. Treasury bonds - tightened after the Fed hiked rates in March.
That was in step with a stocks rally which was partly driven by investors comforted by more clarity on rate hikes and the Fed's decisive action against surging inflation.
However, lingering concerns over the impact of tighter monetary policies on corporate profits and borrowing costs, as well as the possibility of a sharp economic slowdown as the Fed tries to cool the economy, have started to pressure U.S. credit markets again this month.
The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a basket of credit default swaps that serves as a gauge of credit risk, widened 6 basis points from the end of March to 72.843 basis points on Monday, as investors hedged bets on a deterioration in credit quality.
""Economic conditions are evidencing some signs of perhaps slowing somewhat down"", said Mark Luschini, Chief Investment Strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.
""That can start to creep into widening credit spreads by way of investors taking perhaps a slightly more sober view about what are the conditions that are going to persist to allow those lower rated credits to continue to fund their debt financing"", he said. 
U.S. Treasury yields rose last week on the back of hawkish signals by the U.S. central bank - increasingly determined to tighten financial conditions through rate hikes and so-called quantitative tightening, a plan to reduce its balance sheet.

On Monday, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to its highest level in more than three years as investors awaited key inflation data later this week to determine how hawkish the Fed will need to be on its policy path.
""The combination of faster rate hikes along with quantitative tightening is, at least potentially, a cocktail for drawing the liquidity conditions that are best suited to promote high flying equity names as well as the risky components of the fixed income market, credit and lower rated credit in particular"", said Luschini.

(Reuters) - There are early signs of a cooldown in some of the hottest corners of the U.S. housing market,  Redfin  (NASDAQ:RDFN) said in a report on Friday, a fresh indication that high house prices and rising mortgage rates are cutting into homebuyer demand. 
Among those early tells, according to Redfin: Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches for ""homes for sale"" dropped by double digits in Baltimore, Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles in the second week of March from a year earlier; tours of homes for sale in California were down 21% as of March 31 from the first week of 2022, data from ShowingTime shows; Redfin agents in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Boston and Seattle reported a drop in requests for homebuying help at the start of this year compared with last year, even as requests nationwide surged; and agents in California say they are seeing fewer offers on each home than previously. 
Home prices nationwide have risen about 35% in the two years since the COVID-19 pandemic slammed the nation and the Federal Reserve slashed short-term interest rates to near zero, the Zillow Home Value Index shows. 
The Fed last month began raising its policy rate to bring down decades-high inflation as the economy reopened, and longer-term borrowing costs have climbed swiftly in anticipation of more aggressive rate hikes ahead.

The average interest rate on a 30-year-fixed mortgage, the most popular U.S. home loan, rose last week to 4.9%, a fresh three year high, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) showed this week. 
The U.S. housing market is still hot, however, even in cooling California cities. The average home in Los Angeles, for instance, is sold for 5% over its asking price, with a record share selling within a week of listing, Redfin said. 
But the signs are there already, the report said, of a price slowdown in coming months."
113,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 02:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices likely increased by the most in 16-1/2 years in March as Russia's war against Ukraine boosted the cost of gasoline to record highs, resulting in annual inflation rising at its fastest pace since the early 1980s.
The Labor Department's consumer price report on Tuesday would seal the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points next month. It would follow on the heels of data last month showing the unemployment rate dropping to a fresh two-year low of 3.6% in March. 
The U.S. central bank in March raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Minutes of the policy meeting published last Wednesday appeared to set the stage for big rate increases down the road.
""Inflation is reaching a crescendo because of not only what's happening in Ukraine, but also what happened in the past, such as massive government stimulus and the Federal Reserve printing money,"" said Sung Won Sohn, a finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""We should expect a half a point rate increase next month."" 
The consumer price index likely surged 1.2% in March, according to a Reuters survey of economists. This would be the largest monthly gain since September 2005 and would follow a 0.8% advance in February. Gasoline prices on average soared to an all-time high of $4.33 per gallon in March, according to AAA.
Though gasoline was likely the main driver of inflation last month, strong contributions were expected from food and services such as rental housing. Russia is the world's second-largest crude oil exporter. The United States has banned imports of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas and coal as part of a range of sanctions against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.
Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of commodities like wheat and sunflower oil. In addition to pushing up gasoline prices, the Russia-Ukraine war, now in its second month, has led to a global surge in food prices. 
High inflation readings and the Fed's hawkish posture have left the bond market fearing a U.S. recession, though most economists expect the expansion will continue.
In the 12 months through March, the CPI is forecast shooting up 8.4%. That would be the largest year-on-year gain since January 1982 and would follow a 7.9% jump in February. It would be the sixth straight month of annual CPI readings north of 6%.
INFLATION PEAKING?
Economists believe March would mark the peak in the annual CPI rate, but caution that inflation would remain well above the Fed's 2% target at least through 2023. Gasoline prices have retreated from record highs, though still remain above $4 per gallon.
Last year's high inflation readings will also start falling from the CPI calculation.
""However, inflation's descent will remain painfully slow for consumers, businesses and policymakers alike,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Services inflation, which includes housing, shows no signs of abating anytime soon."" 
A moderation in prices of used cars and trucks likely resulted in a tame monthly underlying inflation reading.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI is forecast rising 0.5% after a similar advance in February. That would result in the so-called core CPI increasing by 6.6% in the 12 months through March, the largest advance since August 1982, after rising 6.4% in February.
""Factors like used cars and unfavorable base effects could even cause an apparent slowing in core inflation for a few months this spring,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""This would likely be short lived, with further upside risks from higher commodity prices and supply disruptions materializing over the summer that could cause markets to reprice more hawkish expectations for the Fed.""
Lockdowns in China to contain a resurgence in COVID-19 infections are seen putting more strain on global supply chains, which could keep goods prices elevated. Separately, rising rents for housing are also expected to keep core inflation hot. 
A key measure of rents, owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, accelerated 4.3% on a year-on-year basis in February, the fastest since January 2007. 

Economists say this gauge tends to lag private sector measures of rents. While these measures have been showing signs of slowing, economists do not expect this to show in the CPI data for a while. Landlords slashed rents early in the pandemic as people deserted cities, but the reopening of the economy has boosted demand for accommodation. 
""The robust recovery in labor markets, rising labor incomes and healthy household balance sheets should prove supportive of rental demand even amid elevated prices, at least in the near term,"" said Michael Pond, head of inflation research at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. ""The peak in the CPI rents may still be at least a quarter away, but given the recent moderation in private measures of rents, we would caution against extending the trend of well above pre-pandemic levels into 2023.""

114,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 02:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Emmanuel Macron traveled to the former industrial region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais on Monday, signaling a change of strategy as he takes his re-election campaign up a notch to extend the gap with far-right leader Marine Le Pen ahead of a runoff vote.
The French president spent several hours mingling with crowds in Denain, where roughly 15% of voters backed him in Sunday’s ballot, compared to 42% who opted for Le Pen. In the evening in Carvin, another town in the area, he sat in a cafe for a live interview with BFMTV and spoke for 20 minutes about pensions, purchasing power and unemployment.
Macron said he sees “the divisions and people’s difficulties” and defended his social record, especially a cap on energy bills. He vowed to listen to unions and charities, and said workers should have the same benefits as shareholders when companies are profitable.
The trip was a clear attempt by Macron, 44, to try to shed his image as “a president of the rich” as he tries to convince more voters to keep him at the helm of Europe’s second-largest economy on April 24.
Le Pen finished 4.7 percentage points behind Macron in Sunday’s first round. While polls give him an advantage heading into the final phase of the campaign, Le Pen has already added more than 10 points to her showing in the 2017 election. To win, she needs to build an anyone-but-Macron coalition and many left-wing voters would have to abstain, or back her. 
The 53-year-old nationalist didn’t waste any time getting out on the stump, either. She gave a brief press conference in the afternoon and later in the day was in Yonne, a couple hours drive south of Paris, where she spoke about agriculture, food sovereignty and surging food and energy costs.
Investors are watching this stage of the election especially closely. If Le Pen were to unseat Macron, it would create a shock for the European Union to compare with Donald Trump’s U.S. election win of 2016. When the gap between them narrowed last week, French 10-year yields held near a seven-year high.
Le Pen’s Resilience Makes France’s Election a Much Closer Race
While Le Pen has benefited from a tailwind largely thanks to her focus on retail politics, Macron’s momentum stalled amid criticism that he was snubbing voters and neglecting domestic matters because of the crisis in Ukraine. 
Why France’s Macron Needs Every Vote to Beat Le Pen: QuickTake
As the president began his charm offensive, his allies were zeroing in on Le Pen’s links to Russia. 
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told RTL radio on Monday that voters have a choice between a president who had put France at the forefront of Europe and an “ally of Vladimir Putin.” 
It’s not clear how successful that strategy will be. 
Le Pen secured a loan for her party from a Russian company in 2014 and visited Putin in Moscow in 2017. But she distanced herself from the Russian president after his invasion of Ukraine even as some people close to her have continued to express sympathy. So far, polls show voters don’t care. 
For his part, Macron has been speaking to Putin regularly first to try to stop Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and then to try and end the war. His rivals have accused him of naivety in his interactions with the Russian leader who he invited to Versailles within weeks of taking office five years ago.
In Denain, Macron was asked if he’ll sit down with Le Pen as planned on April 20 after having refused to debate the other presidential hopefuls. 
“It’s program against program, so now there will be a debate,” he replied.

(Reuters) -Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on Monday signaled he would not necessarily oppose getting interest rates up to a neutral setting of 2.25% to 2.5% by the end of the year, a pace that would require a couple of 50 basis-point rate hikes at upcoming Fed meetings.
""Fifty is obviously worthy of consideration; perhaps it's highly likely even if you want to get to neutral by December,"" Evans told the Detroit Economic Club. 
But, he added, the Fed should not raise rates so fast that it doesn't have enough time to assess inflation pressures and adjust policy in response. 
""I think the optionality of not going too far too quickly is important,"" he said. ""I would focus the attention on where do we want to be at the end of the year.""
The Fed raised rates last month for the first time in three years, and with inflation accelerating is expected to ramp up its pace of rate hikes with half-percentage-point increases for a couple meetings instead of the usual quarter-point increments. 
Evans, long on the dovish end of the Fed policymaker spectrum, said he had thought the Fed should get interest rates up to a 2.25% to 2.5% range over the next year, but on Monday said he doesn't think that speeding that process up by three months will hurt the economy. 
""I think there's good momentum for the economy"" and vibrant labor markets will continue as rates rise toward neutral, he said. But once rates get there, he said, the Fed needs to be ""mindful"" of the outlook for the economy and the state of inflation.
A government report on Tuesday is expected to show consumer prices rose 8.4% last month, far above the Fed's 2% inflation goal. Fed policymakers like Evans say they expect pressures to recede this year as supply constraints ease and as higher borrowing costs squeeze demand. 

By the end of this year, Evans said, the Fed will know a lot more.
""Is it going to be that some of these pricing pressures have crested, and they start coming down? Or are they going to stay high -- or are they going to be higher?"" Evans said. ""And if it's because of supply concerns, real resource pressures, there's going to be a lot of gnashing-of-teeth angst over the inflation versus the concern for the economy. And I think finding the right balance is going to always be at a premium.""

116,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 01:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden’s top economic adviser said that the U.S. may see some difficulties as it contends with elevated inflation and further supply-chain challenges stemming from Covid lockdowns in China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
“We are facing a lot of uncertainty, we are facing rocky waters right now,” the director of Biden’s National Economic Council, Brian Deese, said on Bloomberg Television’s “Balance of Power with David Westin.” At the same time, “the United States is probably better positioned than any other major economy to navigate effectively through them,” he said.
Deese refrained from offering any estimate of the chance of a recession in the U.S., while saying that risks of a downturn are more elevated in other economies.
He pointed to a strong U.S. labor market -- unemployment last month dropped to 3.6%, practically its pre-pandemic level -- along with strong household balance sheets and consumption.
‘Elevated’ Inflation
While the consumer price index, due on Tuesday, will show an “elevated print” for March, Deese said that inflation should be lower by the end of this year. 
The Biden administration has worked to improve the processing of containers at key ports -- a key bottleneck in the supply chain during the pandemic -- and released petroleum reserves to combat surging gasoline prices, Deese noted.
If the Biden administration can move forward with those efforts, “we will see inflationary pressures moderate. They will be lower than they are today at the end of this year and lower still in the coming year,” Deese said. “That’s our focus and that’s our hope.”
He also said that U.S. officials are “closely” monitoring the situation in Shanghai, where a surge in Covid cases has triggered lockdowns that threaten renewed supply-chain complications.

117,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 12:00PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. drivers are receiving a break at the pump with gasoline prices falling for two straight weeks after hitting a record high in early March.
Average national gasoline prices dropped to $4.114 a gallon on Sunday, the lowest level since March 6, according to auto club AAA. The last time a losing streak endured for this long was in September 2020. 
Lower fuel costs offer some relief to American consumers who have been grappling with higher prices from food to housing amid decades-high inflation. The Biden Administration’s decision at the end of last month to order the largest oil release in history from its reserves, amounting to a million barrels of oil a day for six months, has helped cool prices.
Pump prices could pull back to the $3.50-$4 a gallon range by Memorial Day, said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities. The decline would correlate to West Texas Intermediate crude futures trading in the $85-100 a barrel range, he said.
WTI crude -- which makes up the bulk of gasoline prices -- has fallen below $95 a barrel as resurgent Covid-19 cases in China dim the demand outlook, helping to erase nearly all of the price gains in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

118,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 11:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumers’ outlook for inflation climbed to a new high last month as price expectations for food and rent soared. 
The median one-year inflation expectation rose to 6.6%, from 6% a month earlier, in the March consumer survey of consumer expectations released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In three years’ time, the respondents anticipate a 3.7% inflation rate, down from 4.2% six months ago.
The increase in short-term expectations was broad-based across age, education, and income groups, according to the report. Inflation also pushed the one-year outlook for household spending and rent growth to new highs in data going back to 2013.
The data suggest that consumers anticipate more pain from current wave of high inflation before it eases. They expect home prices to rise 6% over the coming year -- up from 5.7% in February. Expectations for year-ahead rent growth edged up to 10.2%, while food prices are now expected to increase by 9.6%.
The share of respondents expecting unemployment to be higher in a year’s time than it is now also increased, to the most since February 2021. Consumers also see a greater risk of losing their jobs,  and a lower probability of finding a new one if that happens. 
Respondents also anticipate more stress on household budgets. The average perceived probability of missing a minimum debt payment over the next three months increased by 1.9 percentage points to 11.1%, above its 12-month trailing average of 10%. And more respondents reported being worse off financially than they were a year ago.
The Federal Reserve last month started what is expected to be a series of interest rate hikes to tame inflation.
“It will take some time to get inflation down,” Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. “Inflation will remain above 2% this year and even next year, but the trajectory will be that it’ll be moving down.”
Consumer prices probably rose 8.4% last month from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists ahead of data due Tuesday. That would be the fastest annual rate since early 1982, reflecting higher energy costs in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The projected monthly price-increase of 1.2% would be the sharpest since 2005.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect consumer-price inflation of 6.9% this year, falling to 2.9% in 2023.

119,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 10:20AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russia will take legal action if the West tries to force it to default on its sovereign debt, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper on Monday, sharpening Moscow's tone in its financial wrestle with the West.
Russia faces its first external sovereign default in more than a century after it made arrangements to make an international bond repayment in roubles last week, even though the payment was due in U.S. dollars.
It had been due on April 4 to make a payment of $649 million to holders of two of its sovereign bonds, but the U.S. Treasury blocked the transfer, preventing Russia from using any of its frozen foreign currency reserves to service its debt.
""Of course we will sue, because we have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that investors receive their payments,"" Siluanov told the newspaper in an interview.
""We will present in court our bills confirming our efforts to pay both in foreign currency and in roubles. It will not be an easy process. We will have to very actively prove our case, despite all the difficulties.""
Siluanov did not elaborate on Russia's legal options and did not say where any court hearing could happen. 
The bonds in question were issued under English law, which allows a borrower to defend itself by saying that an external force made it impossible to honour obligations, so the court may postpone the payment, said Mitu Gulati, professor of law at the University of Virginia.
""So I think Russia is going to argue this but ... this is a war ... caused by Russia,"" said Gulati, also an expert on debt restructuring, adding: ""This is not a completely implausible legal argument."" 
DELIBERATE POLICY
Siluanov has said Russia will do everything possible to make sure its creditors are paid.
""Russia tried in good faith to pay off external creditors,"" Siluanov was quoted saying. ""Nevertheless, the deliberate policy of Western countries is to artificially create a man-made default by all means.""
Siluanov said Russia's external liabilities amount to about 20% of the total public debt, which stood at about 21 trillion roubles ($262 billion). Of that, about 4.5-4.7 trillion roubles were external liabilities. 
The finance ministry did not reply to a Reuters for a comment on what specific legal actions Russia may take. 
Russia has not defaulted on its external debt since the aftermath of its 1917 revolution, but its bonds have now emerged as a flashpoint in its economic tussle with Western countries. 
The key question is whether Russian assets previously frozen by Western countries, such as nearly a half of Russia's $640 billion in gold and foreign exchange reserves, could be claimed by creditors following the default, said Artur Starikov, a partner with Capital Law Office. 
A default was unimaginable until recently, with Russia rated as investment grade in the run-up to its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"".

""If an economic and financial war is waged against our country, we are forced to react, while still fulfilling all our obligations,"" Siluanov said. ""If we are not allowed to do it in foreign currency, we do it in roubles.""

120,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 10:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- For years, Fridays at Beef ‘O’ Brady’s, a sprawling restaurant chain in the Southeast, meant one thing: the steak-and-shrimp special.
But in January, Chief Executive Officer Chris Elliott saw signs that consumers were feeling the squeeze of soaring inflation. So he took the $12.99 surf-and-turf dish off the specials list, replaced it with a fish-and-chips platter and slapped a $9.99 price tag on it. Even with the change, though, customer traffic has been flagging in recent weeks.
“People are looking for deals; they’re getting hammered everywhere -- at the gas station, at the grocery store,” said Elliott, who acknowledges that restaurants, including his own, have also been raising prices.
One year into the inflation spiral that has rocked the U.S. economy, lower-income consumers are starting to shift spending patterns. They’re cutting back on more expensive items, ramping up on cheaper ones and forcing restaurants, grocery stores and retailers to rejigger their sales strategies. This marks a major break from 2021, when consumers, still flush with pandemic stimulus and newly won pay raises, kept spending at a frenetic pace even as annual inflation surged to a four-decade high.
“Consumers are becoming more sensitive to price,” said Krishnakumar Davey, president of strategic analytics at IRI Worldwide, a provider of market research and data. “March is the turning point.”
The dropoff in spending, executives and analysts say, is most pronounced in lower-income families as inflation overtakes those wage gains. Food prices rose 7.9% in February from a year earlier, the largest gain since July 1981. Updated U.S. inflation figures for March will be released on Tuesday. While job gains and a jump in savings mean the pandemic-era shopping boom may not be completely over, it’s clearly slowing.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) data show that households making less than $50,000 annually increased card spending by only 4% in March -- about a third of the rise for those who earn more than $125,000 a year. 
More than a third of U.S. households brought in less than $50,000 in 2020, excluding government stimulus payments, according to a Census Bureau report in September. That would total about 49 million households. Those in the lowest-income quintile spend 18% of their income on food and energy, compared with 11% in the highest one-fifth group, according to Bloomberg Economics.
This underscores the urgency of the Federal Reserve’s mission to restore price stability. Governor Lael Brainard highlighted the dynamic last week, noting that some families feeling crunched can shift to buying private-label goods. But for those already purchasing cheaper options, it won’t be as simple. Those shoppers “would have to either absorb the increase in cost or consume less,” she said.
Those in the food business are trying to adjust. Denny’s Corp. is promoting a $6.99 all-you-can eat breakfast of pancakes, eggs and hash browns to entice customers who are “feeling the pinch at the gas pump,” Chief Brand Officer John Dillon said. But that same endless breakfast meal costs $8.99 in states where wages and commodity costs are running higher. And bacon? That’ll be an extra 99 cents.
Soaring prices at restaurants and retailers are a big reason why the average U.S. household will have to spend an extra $5,200 this year, or about $433 a month, for the same consumption basket, according to Bloomberg economists Andrew Husby and Anna Wong.
That doesn’t necessarily mean total consumer spending is poised to fall. In fact, economists are predicting an inflation-adjusted 3.1% gain after last year’s 7.9% jump, according to the median estimate compiled by Bloomberg. That’s still strong, and ahead of the average annual growth of 2.5% the U.S. posted from 2016 to 2019. 
Indeed, there’s still plenty of cash to be spent. U.S. households are flush with an extra $2.5 trillion in savings built up over the pandemic, and inflation pressures will absorb only about a quarter of it, Husby and Wong said.
Even at the lower end, “consumers in the bottom 50% of incomes and wealth have never had more excess net worth or liquid assets,” Tavis McCourt and other analysts at Raymond James Financial (NYSE:RJF) Inc. said in a report. And with the job market booming, “we suspect it will take longer for consumers to show significant stress/slowing demand than one would normally expect,” they said.
Even so, shoppers are now looking harder for ways to save on groceries. Foot traffic at dollar stores, especially those of  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG)., has generally held up better than at traditional retailers, according to data compiled by Placer.ai, which uses mobile-phone data to determine traffic.
Big-Box Shift
Momentum is also shifting among big-box retailers.  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) trounced Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. in sales growth during the pandemic, and the company’s more upscale clientele positions it well for the future. But sales gains at Walmart have been stronger in recent months, according to Bloomberg Second Measure, which analyzes U.S. consumer transactions to measure revenue. That suggests shoppers are increasingly drawn to Walmart’s mantra of everyday low prices.
As recently as the fall, IRI, the market researcher, was predicting food inflation of 6% this year, with most of the increases coming in the first half. Now, it’s predicting a jump of between 8% and 11%. The sharp increase appears to be spurring a sales turnaround for private-label brands. Spending on generic-brand food recently ticked up after slipping during the pandemic, IRI’s Davey said. 
With many unable to pay more, companies’ profits are likely to fall. Friendly’s Restaurants is giving away more discounts than in the past, and is also advertising big portions. CEO Craig Erlich said he hopes Friendly’s won’t have to raise prices this year. He’s simply not sure customers can keep up.
“That’s why we’re being mindful about not increasing prices significantly like we’ve seen out there,” he said. “It’s really a tough balance we face.”

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada has an ambitious plan to double the pace of homebuilding within a decade but the first big challenge is finding enough skilled workers, as the country grapples with the tightest labor market on record and with construction already at a multi-year high.
Building more homes is a key peg of the C$9.5 billion ($7.5 billion) in housing spending outlined by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government in their budget on Thursday.
The average selling price of a Canadian home has surged more than 50% in the last two years, driven by record low interest rates and tight supply. Construction has failed to keep pace with immigration-driven population growth.
But the plan to build hundreds of thousands of new homes runs counter the reality that home building is generally the purview of municipal and provincial governments, leaving the federal government little role beyond handing out money. 
""It's very ambitious. I would say it's going to be equally challenging to pull it off, simply because the construction sector is already more or less operating at full capacity,"" said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Economics.
""And we are already building a record number of homes in this country.""
Canada has the lowest number of housing units per 1,000 residents of any Group of Seven nation, and that has been on the decline due to population growth, Bank of Nova Scotia economists said https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/about/economics/economics-publications/post.other-publications.housing.housing-note.housing-note--may-12-2021-.html in a report last year. 
There are nearly 300,000 units under construction across Canada, compared with about 240,000 just two years ago, government data https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-data/data-tables/housing-market-data/housing-starts-completions-units-under-construction shows.
Canada is building ""a lot and not enough,"" said William Strange, professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto. ""We've taken decades getting into this situation and we're not going to get out of it in six months.""
Canada has added more than 100,000 construction jobs in the last four months alone, a historic run of increases for the sector. Overall jobless rate fell to a record 5.3% in March. 
""Just the sheer volume of work that exists within the industry (creates) a lot of pressure on the various trades,"" said Jim Ritchie, chief operating officer of Tridel, which develops condominiums in the Toronto area.
""So there's a lot of demand for that workforce.""
Canada's immigration program could be a double-edged sword, as it brings in more skilled workers to replace a fast-retiring workforce, but also fuels housing demand. There is also a mismatch between the workers Canada is currently targeting and those it needs.
""Right now, our immigration policies are more geared towards attracting white collar labor than blue collar labor,"" said Mike Moffatt, senior director of policy and innovation at the Smart Prosperity Institute.
Construction costs rose nearly 10% in 2021 and are set to climb again, driven by higher labor and materials costs, adding to the near-term challenges, said Ritchie of Tridel.
Municipal and provincial approval delays, which the federal government hopes to address with a C$4 billion ""Housing Accelerator Fund,"" and the availability of land add to the hurdles. 
""There a whole bunch of levers that need to be pulled and increasing labor supply... is one of them,"" said Justin Sherwood, a spokesperson for the Building Industry and Land Development Association in the Toronto area.
Still, Canada's Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland was undeterred. 
""We are going to do everything we say we're going to do,"" she told reporters on Thursday when asked about the challenge of meeting the plan. 

""A growing population needs a growing housing supply.""

KATHMANDU (Reuters) -Nepal is tightening imports of cars, gold and cosmetics as its foreign exchange reserves have fallen, a central bank official said on Monday, after the government suspended the central bank governor and named his deputy the interim chief.
The Himalayan country's foreign reserves have been hit by a slump in tourism in Asia during the pandemic, a problem that has also hit Sri Lanka which is going through a crippling economic crisis due to a shortage of tourist revenue and other funds.
""Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB, the central bank) feels the country's foreign exchange reserves are under pressure and something must be done to restrict the import of non-essential goods, without affecting the supply of essential goods,"" NRB deputy spokesperson Narayan Prasad Pokharel told Reuters.
He said importers would be issued letters of credit to bring in 50 ""luxurious goods"" only with full upfront payments with the bank, declining to name all the items.
""We have already directed all the border customs points about the new arrangements for the import of these goods,"" he said. ""This is not banning the imports but discouraging them.""
A spokesperson for the central bank referred questions about the governor's suspension to the finance ministry.
A ministry spokesperson said he did not know why NRB Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari was suspended on Friday but that a government panel would investigate the matter.
A government official said on condition of anonymity that Adhikari was accused of leaking sensitive financial information to the media. Reuters could not immediately contact Adhikari, whose mobile phone was switched off.
With tourism struggling to resume after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal's gross foreign exchange reserves fell to $9.75 billion as of mid-February, down 17% from mid-July last year when its financial year started.
The current reserves are sufficient to support imports for about six months for the country of some 29 million people, where India and China jostle for influence.
Data from the central bank shows remittances from overseas fell 5.8% to $4.53 billion between mid-July to mid-February.
The balance of payments had a deficit of $2.07 billion in the first seven months of the current financial year, compared with a surplus of $817.6 million in the same period the previous year.
Opposition parties have criticised Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's government for suspending the central bank governor when the economy is weak.
""He was doing a good job and his removal at a time when economic indicators are not good is a wrong decision,"" said Surendra Pandey, a senior leader and lawmaker of the opposition Communist Unified Marxist-Leninist party.
The Asian Development Bank said this month that Nepal's government debt increased to 41.4% of gross domestic product in the 2021 fiscal year, from an average of 25.1% between 2016 and 2019 due to increased spending during the pandemic.
The Philippines-based bank predicted Nepal's current account deficit would widen to 9.7% of GDP in this fiscal year from 8% last year.

Investing.com -- Bond yields rise to fresh three-year highs ahead of potentially dramatic U.S. inflation numbers on Tuesday. There's the usual host of Fed speakers ready to comment on that. Elon Musk changes his mind about joining Twitter's board and continues to snipe about the social media company on its own platform. Emmanuel Macron is set for a tight run-off against right-wing leader Marine Le Pen in France's presidential elections, and Russia relaxes capital controls as the west's sanctions prove to be more bark than bite. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 11th April.
1. Bond yields hit news highs ahead of March CPI data
The bellwether 10-Year U.S. bond yield hit 2.75% for the first time since March 2019, at the start of a week likely to be dominated by consumer inflation data for March, which are set to post another 40-year high.
By 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), the 10-year was at 2.75%, having eased 3 basis points from its overnight high. The 2-Year yield, which is more sensitive to expectations for short-term interest rates, was up 6 basis points from late Friday at 2.58%.
Ahead of Tuesday’s data, there will be another salvo of Fed-speak: regional presidents Raphael Bostic, John Williams and Charles Evans are all due to speak in the course of the day, as is DC-based governor Michelle Bowman.
The global inflation phenomenon was in evidence overnight: Chinese producer and consumer prices both came in ahead of expectations, although were off their peaks. China’s credit aggregates and money supply also grew more strongly than expected in March. The central bank is still expected to announce an easing of monetary policy in the course of this week, however.
2. Musk jilts Twitter board
Elon Musk won’t be joining Twitter’s board after all. CEO Parag Agrawal said on Saturday that Musk had declined the board’s offer of a seat, hinting that there was too much of a conflict between the board’s goals and the Tesla CEO’s.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock fell over 4% in premarket trading, having risen as much as 25% last week in response to the news that Musk had built a stake of 9.2%.
It’s not clear how Musk intends to proceed now. He has styled his holding as ‘passive’ but spent much of last week and the weekend tweeting about how the company could improve its service and its financials. An ‘activist’ investor is usually required to disclose more about his or her intentions through the usual regulatory channels. Musk – whose activity on the site has already brought him grief from the SEC more than once - hasn’t done that yet.
3. Stocks set to open lower; Nio suspends production
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower later, amid ongoing unease at the rise in bond yields and their ability to generate some unpleasant surprises in the upcoming first quarter earnings season.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and others get that ball rolling on Wednesday.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 15 points, or less than 0.1%, but S&P 500 futures were down 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.7%.
The NASDAQ came under renewed pressure last week as the need to factor higher discount rates into stock valuations again weighed disproportionately on technology stocks who aren’t expected to generate positive cash flow for some years yet.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include the ADRs of Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE:NIO), which said at the weekend it will suspend production due to COVID-19 lockdown-related disruptions. It’s also raising prices for its three SUV models. Also in focus will be JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU), which pruned its summer schedule at the weekend in an effort to cut the risk of disruptions.
4. Macron set for tight run-off with Le Pen
Incumbent Emmanuel Macron emerged on top from the first round of voting in France’s Presidential elections, just under four points ahead of the populist right-wing leader Marine Le Pen.
The two will now face off in a second round of voting in two weeks’ time. Macron had won a similar face-off by 66%-34% in 2017 but faces a much tighter contest this time after Le Pen scored heavily with a campaign that focused on the cost-of-living crisis and on Macron’s unpopular plans to raise the pension age.
Eurozone bond markets and the euro itself both staged a modest relief rally, mindful that Le Pen has the greater momentum. Opinion polls suggest that she has narrowed the gap to Macron from over 30% a month ago to less than 4% now.
Elsewhere in Europe, Germany waved through the creation of financial support measures for its energy companies, while data showed the U.K. economy slowed to a crawl in February.
5. Russia relaxes capital controls
Russia’s central bank relaxed some of its most onerous capital controls in a further sign that its economy is adapting to the sanctions imposed on it by the U.S., EU, U.K., Japan, and Australia.
The central bank will suspend the 12% surcharge on foreign exchange transactions that it had imposed at the end of February to stop panic buying of dollars and euros by the population.
The ruble’s official rate fell some 2.6% in response, but its signal value has been undermined by the sanctions, which still restrict the free buying and selling of currency. Elsewhere, the French bank  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) effectively gave back its Russian unit Rosbank to its original owner, the oligarch Vladimir Potanin."
126,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 06:12AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. asset managers are pushing back on draft rules aimed at fixing systemic risks in the $5 trillion money market funds industry, arguing that one of the proposed measures would kill off popular products, executives told Reuters.
After taxpayers bailed out money market funds, a key source of short-term corporate and municipal funding, for the second time in 12 years during the pandemic-induced turmoil of 2020, the industry is facing renewed regulatory scrutiny.
Money market funds invest in high-quality short-term debt instruments and offer daily redemptions. Investors expect immediate liquidity with little price volatility and are spooked when those expectations are not met during market stress. 
As the pandemic shut down the economy in March 2020, investors pulled more than $130 billion from some money market funds, contributing to stress in the short-term funding markets, according to a Treasury analysis that is disputed by the funds industry. 
In December, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed boosting money market funds' resilience by, among other measures, adjusting a funds' value in line with trading activity so that redeeming investors bear the costs of exiting a fund and don't dilute remaining investors. In theory, this ""swing pricing"" reduces the incentive to run to the exit first. 
The deadline to submit comments is Monday and the industry is pushing back hard on the swing pricing measures, arguing they would be operationally challenging, impose excessive costs on fund sponsors, and reduce daily liquidity for investors. 
""We really do believe that it would kill the product,"" said Jane Heinrichs, associate general counsel at the Investment Company Institute, which represents the asset managers. ""Funds would determine it's not worth the changes necessary to make it work for a product that will no longer meet the needs of investors.""
The SEC has provided no data to support the idea, Heinrichs said. 
While swing pricing is used by some European funds, it is an unfamiliar concept to U.S. investors, said Peter Yi, a director at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Asset Management. ""Without a doubt, swing pricing is going to be very difficult for investors to understand."" 
An SEC spokesperson did not immediately provide comment. 
To calm fleeing investors and stem a broader crisis, the Treasury and Federal Reserve in March 2020 launched emergency liquidity facilities to backstop the market. The panic was reminiscent of 2008, when a run on money market funds likewise prompted the U.S. government to prop up the market.
That bailout led the SEC in 2010 and 2014 to introduce rules aimed at reducing the risk of investor runs. But 2020 showed those changes were inadequate, said regulatory experts.
Advocacy groups say money market funds are operating with an implicit government guarantee, without the stringent capital and liquidity requirements such guarantees usually require. 
""The government is literally giving private business - the money market fund sponsors - billions and billions a year for nothing,"" said Dennis Kelleher, president of the Washington-based advocacy group Better Markets. ""And then when there’s market stress, they don't have to cover the downside.""
His group is calling for wholesale reforms that go further than the SEC's proposal, including bank-like capital buffers. 
While the Investment Company Institute opposes swing pricing, it supports in principle the SEC's proposal to raise funds' liquidity requirements, and to allow fund boards more flexibility to charge for or suspend redemptions during stress, known a fund ""gate.""

In 2020, investor runs accelerated as funds approached a minimum liquidity threshold that, under the current rules, allows fund boards to gate redemptions. The SEC rule would eliminate that bright line. 
""By de-linking the fees and gates from the liquidity thresholds and increasing the liquidity levels, you directly address the issues from 2020,"" Heinrichs said.

128,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 05:31AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Japanese investors were big sellers of overseas debt in March, as prices of overseas bonds declined on concerns over inflation and aggressive tightening measures by major central banks. 
According to Japan's Ministry of Finance data, domestic investors exited a net 2.36 trillion Japanese yen worth of overseas bonds last month, after selling a net 3.2 trillion in February.
They also sold foreign equities worth $455.7 billion yen, after buying them in the previous month.
""Selling of foreign bonds increased later in the month, indicating that they became more worried about a hawkish pivot from the Federal Reserve around the FOMC,"" said Naka Matsuzawa, chief Japan macro strategist at Nomura. 
The big sales by local investors come despite a sharp decline in the Japanese yen in the last month.

""JPY collapsed in March, just at the time when local investors were bringing almost unprecedented amounts of capital home,"" Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets said in a note.
He added that many of the bonds sold were likely held on an FX hedged basis, implying limited FX flow and reflecting the low cost of hedging in all G10 markets for the last two years.
The cumulative sales of foreign bonds and equities in the first quarter of this year stood at 5.28 trillion yen, the biggest net selling in eight years. 
The Bank of Japan (BoJ) in its monetary policy meeting in March, maintained its massive stimulus amid uncertainty over the global outlook, reinforcing expectations it would remain an outlier in the global shift towards tighter monetary settings.
The data from Bank of Japan showed Japanese investors sold U.S. bonds and equities worth 3.11 trillion yen and 127 billion yen, respectively, in the first two months of this year.
However, they purchased 1.16 trillion worth of European bonds in the same period and sold 232 billion yen in European equities.
Japanese investors also offloaded Chinese bonds of 294.69 billion yen and equities of 25.26 billion yen, data up to February showed.

129,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 04:50AM ET</span>",,,,,,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Saikat Chatterjee. 
Relief that the far right did not win the first round of French presidential elections lasted only a few hours. The euro has slid back towards Friday's levels while French stocks are set for a lacklustre start.
With French leader Emmanuel Macron and far right challenger Marine Le Pen both qualifying on Sunday for what promises to be a tightly fought presidential election runoff on April 24, risk premia on French assets will remain elevated in coming days.
Of more broader concern perhaps is the inexorable march higher in U.S. Treasury yields. That's got stock futures pointing to a weaker start in Europe and the United States while so-called growth stocks -- sectors such as tech that outperform when borrowing costs are low -- are on the back foot. 
Ten-year Treasury yields rose as high as 2.7840% in Asian hours on Monday, the highest since January 2019, for a 125 basis-point plus rise so far this year. 
The yield has also risen above Chinese government borrowing costs for the first time in 12 years, while the dollar index earlier vaulted above 100 for the first time since May 2020..
Elsewhere, Chinese stocks were the biggest laggards in Asia as inflation data spiked higher, denting hopes for aggressive policy easing from Beijing. 
There are plenty of key data points this week to occupy traders, above all U.S. consumer inflation figures for March (due Tuesday). A headline print above 8% is likely due to the fallout on energy costs from the war in Ukraine. 
Then there is Thursday's European Central Bank meeting, which will see policymakers caught between record high inflation and the economic hit from the war. Money markets are already pricing in around 70 bps of cumulative rate hikes for the rest of the year.
And finally first quarter earnings will kick off this week offering investors the first glimpse on how companies have dealt with a torrid quarter. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday:

Central bank speaker corner: Fed's Bostic, Bowman, Evans
UK February monthly GDP, industrial, manufacturing
U.S. 3-year Treasury note auction

1/MADAME LA PRESIDENTE?
A late opinion poll resurgence for far-right French politician Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday's presidential election voting round had markets running scared. She ended up trailing incumbent Emmanuel Macron -- as expected -- but the April 24 run-off between the two promises to be a cliffhanger.
Macron is still expected to win the presidency. But some pollsters predict the vote split at 51%/49%, meaning victory either way is within the margin of error.
Le Pen no longer advocates leaving the euro but a win for her would hamper European cohesion, and her big-spending, tax-cutting agenda would blow out France's spending bill.
The premium investors demand to hold French debt versus Germany has eased slightly after Sunday's result, but more turmoil looks inevitable before the April 24 final round.

2/HAWKS OVER FRANKFURT
With euro area inflation running at 7.5%, the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday will see the hawks out in force.
They have become increasingly vocal, while markets are now gunning for a July rate rise, having ramped up their bets since the March meeting.
ECB chief economist Philip Lane warns against reacting to short-term, energy-driven price surges. And the Ukraine war is taking a toll on the economy and consumer confidence.
The ECB knows well the price of making a policy mistake. It has raised rates in the past, only to make a speedy U-turn. Yet inflation shows no signs of peaking, let alone returning to the 2% target. The hawks' clamour may get louder.

3/BIG GUNS, BIGGER RATE HIKES
    Canada and New Zealand appear poised for their biggest interest rate hikes in 20 years, underscoring the worldwide scramble to contain inflation.  
    Both banks meet on Wednesday. Swaps price a 90%-plus chance of a 50 basis-point hike from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and a better-than-80% likelihood of the Bank of Canada does the same.
With Canadian inflation seen above target until 2024, another 50 bps move may come in June. New Zealand delivered a 25 bps hike in February -- its third -- and flagged the possibility of bigger rises ahead.
These would be the most drastic G10 hikes this cycle. Until May, when the Federal Reserve is tipped to lift rates 50 bps.

4/PRICE WAR
Minutes from the Fed's March policy meeting showed meatier rate hikes and an aggressive balance sheet runoff are likely in coming months as the central bank battles inflation. .
All that puts a spotlight on Wednesday's inflation data. February's 7.9% print was the largest annual increase in 40 years. In March, consumer prices grew 8.3% year-on-year, economists polled by Reuters predict, as the Ukraine-Russia war sent commodity prices spiralling higher.
And as Americans dig deeper for rent, gasoline and food, wage gains are eroding -- inflation adjusted average hourly earnings fell 2.6% year-on-year in February. A chunky inflation print will bolster the case for more dramatic policy tightening.

5/BANKS TO THE TEST
As rising bond yields, labour shortages and sky-high commodity prices buffet stock markets, first-quarter U.S. earnings will give investors a chance to gauge balance sheet resilience, cost pressures on companies and share buyback plans.
Overall, S&P 500 earnings growth is expected at 6.8% in the Jan-March quarter, versus the 53% bounceback seen a year ago from COVID-time doldrums, according to Refinitiv IBES.
Big banks kick off the season with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reporting on Wednesday, followed a day later by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Bank shares have fared badly this year, with 11% losses, versus the S&P 500's 6%
The six biggest lenders are projected to show a 35% decline in net income versus a year earlier. Investment bank revenues may have declined, especially after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while some banks must make provisions for Russia-linked losses.

Finally, watch whether banks may curb share buybacks after seeing excess capital dented by Q1 losses on their bond holdings. [L2N2W31XD]

TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan on Monday cut its assessment for most regional economies in the country and its governor warned of ""very high uncertainty"" over the fallout from the Ukraine crisis, underscoring heightening risks to the economic recovery.
The downgrade highlights a growing concern among policymakers over the pain from rising commodity costs, and raises the chance that the central bank will cut its growth forecasts in fresh projections due this month.
""There's very high uncertainty on how developments in Ukraine could affect Japan's economy and prices,"" BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told a meeting of the bank's branch managers.
A senior BOJ official also warned on Monday that excessive volatility in yen moves could hurt businesses, signalling the bank's alarm over the currency's slide to its lowest level against the dollar since 2015.
In a quarterly report analysing regional Japanese economies, the central bank offered a bleaker view than in January for eight of the country's nine regions as a resurgence in COVID-19 cases and lingering supply constraints hit growth.
Of the total, five regions saw a rebound in their economies ""level off"" or ""slow"", the report said. That was a bleaker view than the BOJ's current assessment of the national economy that it was ""picking up as a trend"".
Rising raw material costs, driven by the war in Ukraine, are squeezing corporate profits and pushing up living costs for households, casting doubt on the BOJ's view that the economy is headed for a moderate recovery, analysts say.
The yen's recent declines, while giving a boost to Japan's exports, are also inflating import costs and adding pain to the resource-poor economy, they say.
""A further rise in commodity costs could hurt consumption, corporate profits and capital expenditure,"" said Hirohide Kouguchi, who heads the BOJ's Osaka branch. His office oversees the Kansai region of western Japan, home to electronic manufacturers such as Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY).
While the weak yen is generally beneficial for the Kansai region, it is among factors pushing up import costs, he said.

""There's also a risk (the Ukraine crisis) could heighten volatility in financial markets, including currency moves, and hurt business sentiment,"" Kouguchi said.
The BOJ's regional report will be among factors the central bank will scrutinise when releasing fresh quarterly growth and inflation projections at its next policy meeting on April 27-28.

Investing.com -- French bonds and stocks staged a modest relief rally on Monday after incumbent President Emmanuel Macron won the first round of voting in elections to the Elysee, beating the populist right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen. 
With almost all votes counted, Macron led Le Pen by just under 4 percentage points, on 27.8% compared to Le Pen's 23.9%. Macron will now face a run-off against Le Pen in two weeks' time, in a repeat of the 2017 elections. 
An opinion poll carried out by the research firm Ipsos pointed to a Macron victory in the second round by 54% to 46%. However, an earlier poll for the state broadcaster TF1 by the IFOP polling company projected a much tighter race, with Macron winning by only 2 points, 51%-49%. 
By 2:30 AM ET (6:30 GMT), the yield on the French 10-Year bond was down a single basis point at 1.25%, having soared to a seven-year high of 1.30% on Friday on concern that Le Pen might win. French CAC 40 stock futures were down 0.3%, slightly outperforming European peers after a week of heavy underperformance. 
The euro, meanwhile, was up less than 0.1% at $1.0880, having fallen to its lowest against the dollar in over a month on Friday.
The outcome of the second round will depend on whether Macron can mobilize enough voters from the traditional center of French politics to neutralize the surge in support for candidates on the extremes of right and left. The far-left candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon, came third with 21.1%, while another far-right candidate, Eric Zemmour, polled 7.1%. By contrast, the candidates of the two traditional center-left and center-right parties between them polled only 6.5%.
Macron's lead over Le Pen had shrunk massively in the three weeks leading up to the poll, as Le Pen campaigned effectively on issues such as the cost-of-living crisis and against Macron's plans to raise the national retirement age. Her policies, which foresee a steep rise in subsidies and state intervention, have been criticized as irreconcilable with the Eurozone's budget rules and would put the country on a collision course with Germany, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank."

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport topped the rankings by passenger traffic published Monday by Airports Council International (ACI), which is based on a preliminary compilation of 2021 global data. 
The report also ranked airports by cargo volumes and aircraft movements.
While the United States has seen the fastest and strongest recovery in travel, fueled by leisure trips to destinations like Florida, it still trails 2019 traffic levels. 
According to FlightAware data for March 6 to 13, U.S. commercial flights were down almost 18% compared with the same period in 2019. By contrast, global traffic was down nearly 27%.
With 40.4 million passengers, Florida's Orlando International Airport ranked seventh in 2021, just ahead of China's Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, and breaking into the top 10 for the first time since data was available in 1991, ACI told Reuters. 
While China remains an aviation powerhouse the country's international borders remained closed in 2021. Domestic traffic fell due to the country's zero-COVID policy which meant a series of outbreaks that are tiny by world standards led to strict internal travel controls, dampening demand.
A spokeswoman for the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority said the airport is expecting higher traffic in 2022 as international and business travel return in greater numbers.

The rankings ""tell the story of an encouraging trend of recovery, with most of the recurrent busiest airports pre-COVID-19 back at the top,” ACI World Director General Luis Felipe de Oliveira said in a statement. 
Traffic at the top 10 busiest airports in 2021 represented about 463 million passengers or almost 10% of global traffic, ACI said.

PARIS (Reuters) -President Emmanuel Macron will not be able to count on French voters' traditional anti-far right front in the final runoff and will need to step up his campaign if he is to defeat Marine Le Pen, who has successfully softened her image.
Although Macron was projected to win a better-than-expected first round score of 28%, improving on his 2017 result, Macron cannot count on victory: polls forecast a razor-thin margin of victory against Le Pen in the April 24 run-off. 
In past elections at national, regional and municipal levels, left- and right-wing voters have historically united to block the far right from power, a phenomenon known as a 'republicain front'. 
While all mainstream candidates, including those of the conservative Les Republicains and Socialist party, endorsed Macron for the runoff on Sunday night, it is not clear their voters will follow. Moreover, their low single-digit scores were so pitiful that their support may carry little weight.
""Among politicians, the republican front is putting itself in motion. It remains to be seen whether voters will follow,"" said Mathieu Gallard, head of research at Ipsos France.
An Ifop poll taken outside polling stations during Sunday's vote forecast Macron winning 51% of voter support in two weeks time, a clear indication the ""republican front"" is crumbling. 
Complicating Macron's task, Le Pen has largely dropped her more pugnacious anti-immigration, anti-European Union rhetoric, focusing more on cost of living issues.
Another Ifop survey in March showed that fewer than half of all French now found her ""scary"". 
In her speech on Sunday, she painted herself as a unifying figure, who would heal France's ""fractures"" and halt the ""chaos"" supposedly brought about by Macron, a former banker who she said embodied the ""power of money"" and worked for the few. 
BATTLE FOR THE LEFT
Meanwhile, Macron cannot take left-wing voters for granted.
The third-placed candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon, urged voters not to back Le Pen, but stopped short of endorsing Macron, increasing the uncertainty as to how the projected 21% of voters who backed the far-left firebrand will cast their ballot.
Polls show many may decide to abstain.
""Macron's politics ... has strengthened the far-right,"" voter Lea Druet, 27, told Reuters at Melenchon's campaign headquarters. She voted for Macron in 2017 and said she would abstain in this month's runoff. 
Other Melenchon supporters were still unsure. ""I'll see how the next two weeks go. If the polls say 49-51, at that moment I will vote Macron,"" said Guillaume Raffi, 36, a music producer from Montpellier.
Macron supporters and campaign insiders say the incumbent leader will have to spend more time campaigning on the ground than he did in the run up to the first round if he wants to counter Le Pen, who has tapped into anger against the rising cost of living and deep-seated discontent towards a distant elite. 

Macron has acknowledged entering the campaign too late as he focused on dealing with the fallout from the war in Ukraine. 
""In the second round, Emmanuel Macron will need to roll up his sleeves a bit more than he did for the first,"" the former French ambassador to Washington, Gerard Araud, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

LONDON (Reuters) - Thursday's European Central Bank meeting could mark another tense moment for policymakers caught between record high inflation and the economic hit from the war in Ukraine. 
As some of the most dovish major central banks change tune to tackle surging inflation, some ECB Governing Council (GC) members are also pushing for an interest rate rise sooner rather than later.
Here are five key questions for markets.
1/ When will the ECB hike rates?
A growing number of conservative policymakers would like an interest rate increase before year-end. Markets are betting the -0.5% deposit rate could rise as early as July.
The ECB has not made any commitments and President Christine Lagarde could be pressed on timing. U.S. rates rose in March, and Britain has hiked three times since December. 
A prerequisite to an ECB rate move is ending bond purchases in the third quarter. The ECB says any increase will come some time after this.
""This meeting is key because it is hard to see currently what the ECB's main message is,"" said ING's global head of macro Carsten Brzeski. ""It needs to give more guidance."" 
GRAPHIC: Money markets bet ECB will raise rates fast (https://graphics.reuters.com/EUROPE-MARKETS/gdpzybkonvw/chart.png) 
2. Could the hawks push for a precise end-date to bond buying?
Don't rule it out. Recent ECB decisions have surprised markets and pressure is building after March's 7.5% headline inflation print.
The ECB in March decided to end asset purchases sometime in the third quarter but made no further commitment on how to exit stimulus. Minutes from that meeting show a sizable group wanted to set a firm end-date for asset purchases.
""The debate and positions on the GC will only get more entrenched as inflation far exceeds its (2%) target, but the flip side is that growth is going to be much weaker,"" said Nick Kounis, head of financial markets research at ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd). 
GRAPHIC: ECB plans to end asset purchases in Q3 (https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/mopanborjva/ECBAprilAPP.PNG) 
3. Is the ECB behind the curve on inflation?
Well, it has persistently underestimated price pressures over the past year and concern that high inflation could become entrenched is growing. Inflation shows few signs of peaking. The ECB is not alone, with many central banks accused of being too slow to respond to soaring prices. 
While the ECB would normally tighten policy to fight inflation, such a move could further hurt consumers, already hit by rising energy prices.
Chief Economist Philip Lane says the ECB should take its time analysing the data.
""The ECB is probably a bit behind the curve, but not much, as the euro area economy is the epicentre of the adverse fallout of the war and a sharp growth slowdown would help tame inflation,"" said Generali (MI:GASI) Investments' senior economist Martin Wolburg. 
GRAPHIC: Inflation is well above its 2% target (https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbpgnmyxdvq/ECBAprilCPI.PNG) 
4. Is there a risk of stagflation?
Yes, say economists. Major economies are grappling with high inflation, but the euro area is the most exposed to the Ukraine conflict. So risks of weak growth and high inflation, or stagflation, are rising.
Germany's council of economic advisers has more than halved its 2022 growth forecast to 1.8%, and euro area consumer confidence has plunged. ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos expects second-quarter growth to hover around zero.
ECB chief Lagarde says the ECB does not expect war in Ukraine to lead to stagflation. 
GRAPHIC: Cracks widen in euro zone economy as war in Ukraine rages on (https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/myvmnqrbxpr/sentiment0804.PNG) 
5. What about losing Russian energy?
Europe depends on Russia for about 40% of its gas needs and without it, would have to buy more gas on the spot market where prices are around 500% higher than 2021.
Germany has already activated the first stage of an emergency plan to manage Russian gas supplies in preparation for possible disruptions or a halt. 
In a pessimistic scenario, where energy supply from Russia is cut by 50%, UBS Investment Bank economist Reinhard Cluse expects inflation to spike above 9% with a recession possible.

If Russian gas stops completely, the ECB could consider a new stimulus scheme or extend asset purchases, others add, although postponing potential rate hikes seems more likely.

TOKYO (Reuters) -A senior Bank of Japan (BOJ) official on Monday warned that excessive volatility in yen moves could hurt growth, after the currency's slide below the key 125 yen threshold on the dollar raised concerns about broader risks to the import-reliant economy.
Shinichi Uchida, the BOJ's executive director, also said the central bank will maintain ultra-loose monetary policy as recent rises in inflation were driven by fuel costs and could hurt Japan's fragile economic recovery.
""It's desirable for currency rates to move stably reflecting economic and financial fundamentals. That's a policy confirmed by G7 and G20 countries,"" Uchida told parliament, when asked about the impact of the yen's recent declines on the economy.

""Short-term, excess volatility in currency moves could heighten uncertainty over the outlook and make it difficult for companies to create business plans,"" Uchida said.
The dollar briefly rose above 125 yen on Monday, the first time since March 28, as prospects of aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve highlighted the widening rate differential between the United States and Japan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ukraine's economic output will likely contract by a staggering 45.1% this year as Russia's invasion has shuttered businesses, slashed exports and rendered economic activity impossible in large swaths of the country, the World Bank said on Sunday.
The World Bank also forecast Russia's 2022 GDP output to fall 11.2% due to punishing financial sanctions imposed by the United States and its Western allies on Russia's banks, state-owned enterprises and other institutions.
The World Bank's ""War in the Region"" economic update https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/37268/9781464818660.pdf said the Eastern Europe region, comprising Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, is forecast to show a GDP contraction of 30.7% this year, due to shocks from the war and disruption of trade.
Growth in 2022 in the Central Europe region, comprising Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Poland and Romania, will be cut to 3.5% from 4.7% previously due to the influx of refugees, higher commodity prices and deteriorating confidence hurting demand.
For Ukraine, the World Bank report estimates that over half of the country's businesses are closed, while others are operating at well under normal capacity. The closure of Black Sea shipping from Ukraine has cut off some 90% of the country's grain exports and half of its total exports.
The World Bank said the war has rendered economic activity impossible in many areas, and is disrupting agricultural planting and harvest operations.
Estimates of infrastructure damage exceeding $100 billion by early March - about two-thirds of Ukraine's 2019 GDP - are well out of date ""as the war has raged on and caused further damage.""
The bank said the 45.1% contraction estimate excludes the impact of physical infrastructure destruction, but said this would scar future economic output, along with the outflow of Ukrainian refugees to other countries.
The World Bank said the magnitude of Ukraine's contraction is ""subject to a high degree of uncertainty"" over the war's duration and intensity.
A downside scenario in the report, reflecting further commodity price shocks and a loss of financial market confidence triggered by an escalation of the war, could result in a 75% contraction in Ukraine's GDP and a 20% contraction in Russia's output.
This scenario would lead to a 9% contraction in the World Bank's Europe and Central Asia region of emerging market and developing economies - more than double the drop in the baseline forecast.
""The Russian invasion is delivering a massive blow to Ukraine’s economy and it has inflicted enormous damage to infrastructure,"" Anna Bjerde, the World Bank's vice president for Europe and Central Asia, said in a statement. 
""Ukraine needs massive financial support immediately as it struggles to keep its economy going and the government running to support Ukrainian citizens who are suffering and coping with an extreme situation.""

The World Bank has already marshaled about $923 million in loans and grants for Ukraine, and is preparing a further support package of more than $2 billion.
""Rapid IMF and World Bank assistance has allowed Ukraine fiscal space to pay salaries for civilians, soldiers, doctors, and nurses, while also meeting its external debt obligations,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who oversees the U.S. controlling share in the World Bank, told U.S. lawmakers during a hearing last week.

PARIS (Reuters) -French leader Emmanuel Macron and challenger Marine Le Pen qualified on Sunday for what promises to be a very tightly fought presidential election runoff on April 24, pitting a pro-European economic liberal against a far-right nationalist.
With partial results putting Macron in first place ahead of Le Pen after the first-round voting, other major candidates admitted defeat. Except for another far-right candidate, Eric Zemmour, they all urged voters to block the far-right in the second round.
But after five years in power in which his abrasive style has upset many, while Le Pen succeeded in softening her image, Macron will have to fight hard to win back disgruntled voters. He cannot take it for granted that voters will rally around a traditional anti-far right front.
""Nothing is decided, and the battle we will wage in the next 15 days will be decisive for France and Europe,"" Macron told supporters, urging all voters to rally behind him on April 24th to stop the far-right from ruling the European Union's second-largest economy.
Ifop pollsters predicted a very tight runoff, with 51% for Macron and 49% for Le Pen. The gap is so tight that victory either way is within the margin of error. 
Other pollsters offered a slightly bigger margin in favour of Macron, with up to 54%. But that was in any case much narrower than in 2017, when Macron beat Le Pen with 66.1% of the votes.
Le Pen, who had eaten into Macron's once-commanding 10-point poll lead in recent weeks thanks to a campaign focused on cost-of-living issues said she was the one to protect the weak and unite a nation tired of its elite.
""What will be at stake on April 24 is a choice of society, a choice of civilisation,"" she told supporters, who chanted ""We will win!"" as she told them: ""I will bring order back to France.""
Macron, meanwhile, told supporters waving French and EU flags: ""The only project that is credible to help purchasing power is ours.""
""DISASTROUS""
With 96% of the votes counted for Sunday's first round, Macron garnered 27.41% of the votes and Le Pen 24.03%. A near total count of the vote was expected for later in the night. 
A Le Pen victory on April 24 would be a similar jolt to the establishment as Britain's Brexit vote to leave the European Union (EU) or Donald Trump's 2017 entry into the White House.
France would lurch from being a driving force for European integration to being led by a euro-sceptic who is also suspicious of the NATO military alliance. 
While Le Pen has ditched past ambitions for a ""Frexit"" or to haul France out of the euro zone's single currency, she envisages the EU as a mere alliance of sovereign states.
Conservative candidate Valerie Pecresse warned of ""disastrous consequences"" if Macron lost, while the Socialists' Anne Hidalgo urged supporters to vote for him ""so that France does not fall into hatred.""
""Not one vote for Le Pen!"" added hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, who, according to the estimates, placed third with around 20% of the votes.
But they all also had very harsh words for Macron and some of the very unpopular policies of his first mandate as well as an abrasive style that has put off many voters. 
""Emmanuel Macron played with fire,"" Pecresse told supporters.
""PAY ATTENTION"" 
Zemmour acknowledged disagreements with Le Pen, but said Macron was a worse choice. 
Barely a month ago, Macron seemed on course for a comfortable re-election that, riding high in polls thanks to strong economic growth, a fragmented opposition and his statesman role in trying to avert war in Ukraine on Europe's eastern flank.
But he paid a price for late entry into the campaign during which he eschewed market walkabouts in provincial France in favour of a single big rally outside Paris. A plan to make people work longer also proved unpopular, enabling Le Pen to narrow the gap.
Le Pen, an open admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin until his invasion of Ukraine, had for months toured towns and villages across France. She focused on cost-of-living issues troubling millions and tapped into anger toward rulers.

""Marine Le Pen knew how to talk to people about their more concrete problems. During the next two weeks he (Macron) will have to pay more attention to what is happening in France, take a diplomatic break,"" said Adrien Thierry, a 23-year old Macron supporter.
As the vote count progressed, Melenchon's score rose to close to Le Pen's, with 21.57% of the votes, while none of the others were in the double-digits, leading some supporters to briefly hope for a change in the final line-up, which eventually seemed out of reach.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan's rare reappointment of a veteran technocrat behind the country's massive monetary stimulus positions the bank for an eventual exit from governor Haruhiko Kuroda's radical policies when his term ends next year.
Having spent most of his career at the BOJ's elite monetary affairs department, Shinichi Uchida, 59, was instrumental in drafting Kuroda's ""bazooka"" asset-buying programme in 2013 and negative interest policy in 2016.
While those policies create an image of him being a proponent of heavy monetary stimulus, Uchida also led the BOJ's drive to slow its huge bond buying by introducing yield curve control in 2016 - a policy that caps long-term interest rates at zero but also relieved the central bank from buying bonds at a set pace.
As its balance sheet became bloated and the financial sector's pain from prolonged easing became more apparent, Uchida was instrumental in crafting steps to slow the BOJ's purchases of risky assets and ease the strain on banks from low rates.
The reappointment for another four-year term as the BOJ's executive director, announced this month, will have Uchida, who joined the bank in 1986, oversee monetary policy design well beyond the end of Kuroda's term in April next year.
Uchida's technical expertise and deep experience mean the dismantling of YCC, whenever it happens, will go smoothly, while his bi-partisan nature mean he will be a help, not a hindrance, to the rollback of Kuroda's stimulus, say three sources familiar with the matter.
""Because he's created this complex framework, he's probably the best person to roll it back,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities and a veteran BOJ watcher.
""That's his strength, as well as his ability to quickly change tack on policy when he sees fit.""
The BOJ has six executive directors that assist the board in making decisions on key matters. The roles are highly sought after and offered to only a handful of top BOJ staff.
Uchida's reappointment is unusual - historically, such positions last only a single four-year term, after which the officials retire from the BOJ for private sector jobs.
NEITHER HAWK NOR DOVE
Having spent most of his career at the monetary affairs department, Uchida made his mark with a knack for designing complex policy frameworks and his ability to navigate BOJ leadership transitions.
People who know him say Uchida is sharp-minded and worked well under both the dovish Kuroda and his predecessor Masaaki Shirakawa, who was wary of ramping up stimulus too much.
""He's a genius in crafting sophisticated policy ideas,"" one of people said. ""It's hard to brand him as a hawk or dove.""
That means Uchida is well placed to craft plans to either prolong the lifespan of YCC, or gradually phase it out.
To be sure, the BOJ is in no rush to withdraw stimulus as it focuses on underpinning a fragile economic recovery, rather than fret about the prospect of too-high inflation.
But some in the BOJ are wary of Japan becoming increasingly isolated in a global shift in central banking towards tighter monetary policy.
While Japan's comparably subdued inflation allows the BOJ to keep rates low for longer than its counterparts, there is near consensus within the bank its next move will be to dial back - not ramp up - stimulus, the sources say.
Untangling YCC, a complex patchwork of measures to keep rates low while addressing the side-effects of prolonged easing without upending markets, is no easy task.

The BOJ traditionally spends years brainstorming scenarios on its next possible move, a process in which Uchida will likely be deeply involved, the sources say.

140,"<span>Apr 10, 2022 02:56PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Britain's finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Sunday he had asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson for a review to determine whether he had stuck to the rules on ministerial declarations following criticism over his family's financial arrangements.
Sunak said he had written to the prime minister asking him to refer Sunak's ministerial declarations to Christopher Geidt, the independent adviser on ministers' interests.
""I have always followed the rules and I hope such a review will provide further clarity,"" Sunak said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Sunak has endured a torrid week in which a substantial increase in taxes came into effect as the tax arrangements of his family also came under scrutiny, and the Sunday Times reported he considered resigning.
His wife, Akshata Murty, owns about 0.9% of Indian IT giant Infosys (NYSE:INFY), and has confirmed that she had non-domiciled tax status, meaning she did not pay tax on earnings from outside Britain. 
While the status was legal, critics said the arrangement was incompatible with Sunak's decision to raise taxes on workers and employers from April 6 at a time when high inflation is causing a cost-of-living squeeze for many households. On Friday she said she would pay British tax on foreign income.
A newspaper report said that Sunak was listed as a beneficiary of offshore trusts linked to his wife's family business interests, while on Friday he confirmed he only gave up a ""green card"" for the United States - an immigration status intended for permanent U.S. residents - after he became Britain's finance minister in 2020.

""I am confident that such a review of my declarations will find all relevant information was appropriately declared,"" Sunak said in the letter. 
Geidt, who will lead the review, last year cleared Prime Minister Boris Johnson of a conflict of interest over the refurbishment of his official residence in an report that said the prime minister acted ""unwisely"" but had not broken the ministerial code.

By making home, auto and other loans more expensive, Fed interest rate increases and other actions ""will help reduce excess demand, which is outpacing constrained supply, and bring price pressures down,"" to the Fed's 2% inflation target, Mester said. ""I think it will take some time. ... Inflation will remain above 2% this year and even next year. But the trajectory will be moving down.""
The Fed is planning a steady series of interest rate increases this year and expects also to trim its holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities as a second method for lifting the cost of credit to businesses and households. 
Mester, who has said she favors a more aggressive pace of rate increases than some of her colleagues, said she was ""optimistic"" the current economic expansion and strong job market would continue despite tighter monetary policy.
""I think we can reduce excess demand relative to supply without pushing the economy into recession,"" Mester said. ""It is very important that we get inflation under control. That is the biggest challenge right now."" 
Annual inflation by the Fed's preferred measure is currently 6.4%, a level Mester acknowledge was a ""real painful problem"" for many families. An unemployment rate of 3.6%, low by historical standards, is producing large wage gains for many workers but for many prices are still rising faster. 

President Joe Biden on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) Sunday threw the focus on the job market, considered by some economists as among the strongest since World War II.
""Americans are getting back to work at a historic pace. Over the last four weeks, fewer Americans filed initial claims for unemployment insurance than at any time in our nation’s recorded history,"" Biden said.

The sanctions, imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what Moscow describes as a ""special military operation"", cut Russia off from the global financial system and supply channels.
Western nations are also moving closer to a complete ban on energy from Moscow to strip the Kremlin of its biggest source of revenue.
The government has already pledged more than 1 trillion roubles in anti-crisis support to businesses, social payments and to families with children, which will take up all of this year's incoming revenues, so there will be no budget surplus.
""The funds, among other things, will be used to implement measures aimed at ensuring economic stability in the light of external sanctions,"" the government said in a statement on Sunday.
The government's reserve fund is a cash cushion to be used for unexpected spending that was not projected in the state budget. Last year, it was used for one-off social payments and to fight the pandemic. 
The government said the main source of the reserve fund's increase was 271.6 billion roubles in additional energy revenues received in the first quarter, as oil and gas prices rose in response to the recovery from the impact of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine conflict raised the risk of disrupted supply.

Russia supplies around 40% of the European Union's natural gas consumption, which the International Energy Agency values at more than $400 million per day. The EU gets a third of its oil imports from Russia, about $700 million per day.

Investing.com -- It’s set to be a busy week in markets, despite being a short one, with U.S. inflation data due and the first quarter earnings season getting underway. Inflation could hit fresh highs, while bank earnings are expected to decline. The ECB is to meet as it grapples with record high euro zone inflation and economic uncertainty stemming from the war in Ukraine. Central bank meetings in both Canada and New Zealand this week will also underline the worldwide effort to contain inflation. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
February's consumer price inflation reading of 7.9% was the largest annual increase in 40 years and U.S. data on Tuesday is expected to show that CPI rose by an annualized 8.5% in March as the war in Ukraine sent commodity prices sky high.
A strong inflation reading would bolster the case for more aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, likely adding to investor concerns that tighter monetary policy could act as a drag on the economy.
The Fed hiked rates by a quarter of a percentage point in March and last week’s minutes from that meeting indicated that more substantial rate hikes and a balance sheet runoff are probably on the cards in the coming months as policymakers try to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched.
Aside from the CPI numbers, the U.S. is set to release data on producer price inflation on Wednesday. The latest figures on initial jobless claims are due for release on Thursday along with data on retail sales and consumer sentiment.
Figures on industrial production and the Empire state manufacturing index will be release on Friday, which will be the Good Friday holiday.
Several Fed policy makers are also scheduled to speak during the week.
Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will be speaking Monday.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin are to deliver remarks at events on Tuesday, while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker are to speak on Thursday.
Big U.S. banks will kick off the first quarter earnings season this week and analysts are expecting financial sector earnings to decline from a year ago. Investment bank revenues are taking a hit in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while some banks are making provisions for losses related to Russia.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), the largest U.S. bank, is reporting on Wednesday, while results from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) will follow on Thursday.
Bank shares have performed badly so far this year, losing 11% against the S&P 500's 6% decline.
Bank executives will likely be pressed for their view on whether the U.S. economy can continue to grow against the background of the economic fallout from the war in Ukraine and a more aggressive Federal Reserve.
The ECB is to hold its latest policy setting meeting on Thursday and while euro area inflation is running at a record high 7.5%, fueled in large part by accelerating energy costs, policymakers are reluctant to tighten policy amid uncertainty over the impact of the war in Ukraine on the bloc’s economy.
But with inflation still showing no signs of peaking, calls for rate hikes by the more hawkish members of the ECB’s governing council may become more difficult to ignore.
Market watchers increasingly expect the ECB to raise interest rates this year.
In March the central bank announced a reduction in its bond buying stimulus program that would see the program end in September. At the same time, it said an interest rate increase could follow “some time” after the end of bond purchases.
Central banks in both Canada and New Zealand are both set to meet on Wednesday, with market watchers expecting officials at both banks to deliver their largest rate hikes in 20 years amid soaring inflation worldwide.
According to data compiled by Reuters, markets are pricing in a 90%-plus chance of a half a percentage point rate hike from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and a better-than-80% likelihood of the Bank of Canada does the same.
With Canadian inflation seen above target until 2024, another half percentage point hike may come in June. New Zealand delivered a quarter percentage point rate hike in February -- its third -- and flagged the possibility of bigger rises ahead.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's incoming President Yoon Suk-yeol on Sunday named Choo Kyung-ho to be deputy prime minister and finance minister, as the country seeks to tackle surging inflation, household debt and demand for welfare. 
Yoon, who takes office on May 10, announced eight cabinet minister nominations, including defence, industry, health and land. All are subject to parliamentary confirmation hearings. 
As deputy prime minister, Choo, 62, would double as finance minister and oversee economic policy, replacing Hong Nam-ki. 
Choo is a second-term lawmaker in Yoon's conservative People Power Party. He served 33 years in government roles including vice minister of economy and finance, and vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission. 
His nomination came as Asia's fourth-largest economy faces challenges of quelling decade-high inflation without destabilising markets as recovery from the pandemic continues.
Standing with Choo, Yoon said the nominee would facilitate policy coordination among agencies and with the parliament.
""The current economic situation are extremely serious, and internal and external circumstances are tough,"" said Choo told a news conference, citing inflation and slowing growth. 
""The new government's top priority is to stabilise prices and people's livelihoods."" 
South Korea's economy last year grew 4.0%, an 11-year high, but is expected to slow in 2022 and consumer inflation is at a decade-high of 4.1% amid global supply shocks and disruptions caused by Russia's invasion into Ukraine.
As a member of the presidential transition committee, Choo has been working to draw up an extra budget plan to support small businesses and the self-employed who have been affected by COVID.
Choo told a separate briefing that he plans to loosen the real estate policies of the outgoing government, including an easing of capital gains taxes and a levy on property ownership. 
He did not specify the size of the planned extra budget but said the amount should not destabilise the macroeconomy and markets.
Yoon nominated Lee Jong-sup, a retired military commander who formerly served as deputy chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to be defence minister. 
The incoming president is mapping out his foreign policy agenda just as tension flares after North Korea launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile last month.

Lee said he would bolster Seoul's independent response capability and ""maximise U.S. deterrence"" to counter the North's threats. 
A team of Yoon's foreign policy and security advisers said last week they discussed redeploying U.S. strategic assets, such as nuclear bombers and submarines, to South Korea during talks with Washington officials.

The Asian financial hub last month delayed a sale worth HK$6 billion because of the rapid spread of COVID-19.
The three-year green bond issue, which includes a quota from the new financial year that started in April, will be worth HK$15 billion, and it can be increased to up to HK$20 billion upon over-subscription, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a blog post.
The bond will have a rate of 2.5%, up from 2% for the planned sale in March, he added, and will be open for subscription by the end of this month. 
Hong Kong has stepped up efforts in recent years to become a leader in environmental and social governance, including the creation of working groups with government officials and global firms to develop a talent pool.

But its ambition to become a hub for green and sustainable business has been under threat from its tough border controls against COVID, which make it harder for financial institutions to attract specialist staff.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Ukraine has banned all imports from Russia, one of its key trading partners before the war with annual imports valued at about $6 billion, and called on other countries to follow and impose harsher economic sanctions on Moscow.
""Today we officially announced a complete termination of trade in goods with the aggressor state,"" Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Saturday.
""From now on, no Russian Federation's products will be able to be imported into the territory of our state.""
Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, exchange of goods and services between the two neighbouring countries has been virtually non-existent, but Saturday's move makes the termination of imports a law.
""The enemy's budget will not receive these funds, which will reduce its potential to finance the war,"" Svyrydenko said.
""Such a step of Ukraine can serve as an example for our Western partners and stimulate them to strengthen sanctions against Russia, including the implementation of the energy embargo and isolation of all Russian banks.""

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has repeatedly called on the West to boycott Russian oil and other exports and halt exports to Russia over its military assault.
The West has imposed numerous measures on Russia that have already isolated Moscow to a degree never before experienced by such a large economy and on Saturday British Prime Premier Boris Johnson said more sanctions are to come.

CIUDAD JUAREZ (Reuters) - Hundreds of commercial trucks waited in an hours-long line on Saturday to cross the border from the Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez into El Paso after Texas Governor Gregg Abbott ordered state troopers to step up inspections of north-bound vehicles.
""I've been here since 3 p.m. yesterday, I still haven't been able to cross,"" Mexican truck driver José Alberto Marin said as he waited to reach the port of entry.
""Who knows how much longer it will take,"" he added, saying that he was hauling a load of lamps bound for the United States.
The commercial border crossings between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso slowed to a snail's pace after Abbott directed the Department of Public Safety on Wednesday to begin conducting ""enhanced safety inspections"" of vehicles at the international ports of entry into Texas.
Abbott's order cited ""cartels that smuggle illicit contraband and people across our southern border"" as the reason for the stepped-up measures.
Manuel Sotelo, vice president of the northern region of Mexico's national chamber of freight transportation, said the lengthy wait times could be a ""catastrophe"" for the region's import-export and shipping industries.
Due to the slowdown, about 1,000 commercial trucks were able to cross the busiest bridge into El Paso on Friday, down from a daily average of 2,000, he said.

Abbott's office did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Ciudad Juarez is home to hundreds of factories, some owned by American or international companies, that manufacture everything from auto parts to electrical and medical equipment, with many of the products bound for export.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shanghai carried out another round of mass COVID-19 testing on Saturday, this time testing residents at least twice in a single day, as a city official in China's financial hub acknowledged shortcomings in the handling of the outbreak.
It was the fourth consecutive day of city-wide testing in Shanghai, which reported a record 23,600 new locally transmitted cases.
While those case numbers are small by global standards, the city has become a test bed for the country's elimination strategy, which seeks to test, trace and centrally quarantine all positive COVID cases.
Beijing intervened after the failure of Shanghai's initial effort to isolate the virus by locking down in stages, insisting that the country stick to its zero-tolerance policy to prevent its medical system from being overwhelmed.
But the curbs have sharply squeezed supplies of food and other essential goods for the city of 26 million, as numerous supermarkets have been shut and thousands of couriers locked in. Access to medical care has also been a concern.
City residents were asked to self-administer antigen tests on Saturday, sometimes even two, and then to queue in their compounds later in the day for PCR tests. 
Meanwhile, public frustrations have been growing over the disruptions to food supplies.
Video footage circulating on Chinese social media showed people in hazmat suits scuffling with occupants of a Shanghai housing compound. Some residents shouted: ""Send provisions."" Reuters was not able to independently verify the footage. 
The city government has said it is trying to get more couriers back on to the streets and reopen supermarkets. E-commerce company JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc said it had obtained a licence to deliver goods into Shanghai, triggering a buyer rush to its platform.
Shanghai city's deputy mayor Zong Ming acknowledged at a news conference that authorities had not met the public's expectations in their handling of the situation. 
""We feel the same way about the problems everyone has raised and voiced,"" he said. ""A lot of our work has not been enough, and there's still a big gap from everyone's expectations. We will do our best to improve.""
GUANGZHOU TESTING
On Friday, the U.S. State Department said in a travel advisory it was allowing non-emergency staff and their families to leave the Shanghai consulate due to the surge in cases and the impact of restrictions.
It also advised U.S. citizens to reconsider travel to China ""due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws and COVID-19 restrictions"".
Elsewhere on Saturday, the southern megacity of Guangzhou - home to more than 18 million people - said it would begin testing across its 11 districts after cases were reported on Friday.
In Beijing, the municipal government placed a high-risk area under lockdown after eight confirmed COVID cases in the last two weeks, Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, told reporters.
The lockdowns in Shanghai and other parts of China are also rattling supply chains. 

Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) said it has suspended production after COVID disrupted operations at its suppliers in Shanghai and the provinces of Jilin and Jiangsu.

COLOMBO (Reuters) -Sri Lanka will need about $3 billion in external assistance over the next six months to help restore supplies of essential items including fuel and medicine, Finance Minister Ali Sabry told Reuters on Saturday.
The island nation of 22 million people has been hit by power cuts and shortages which have drawn protesters out on to the streets and put President Gotabaya Rajapaksa under mounting pressure.
""It's a Herculean task,"" said Sabry in his first interview since taking office this week, referring to finding $3 billion in bridge financing as the country readies for negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this month.
The country will look to restructure international sovereign bonds and seek a moratorium on payments, and is confident it can negotiate with bondholders over a $1 billion payment due in July.
""The entire effort is not to go for a hard default,"" Sabry said. ""We understand the consequences of a hard default.""
J.P. Morgan analysts estimated this week that Sri Lanka's gross debt servicing would amount to $7 billion this year, with a current account deficit of around $3 billion.
The country has $12.6 billion in outstanding international sovereign bonds, central bank data showed, and foreign reserves of $1.9 billion at the end of March.
""The first priority is to see that we get back to the normal supply channel in terms of fuel, gas, drugs... and thereby electricity so that the people's uprising can be addressed,"" Sabry said.
The IMF said on Saturday that it had started technical-level engagement with Sri Lanka's finance ministry and central bank officials for a loan programme, and was ""very concerned"" about the ongoing crisis.
""We commit to assisting Sri Lanka consistent with our policies, and will engage in discussions on a possible program with senior policymakers in the coming days and weeks,"" Masahiro Nozaki, the IMF's mission chief for Sri Lanka, told Reuters in a statement.
'SENSE OF CONFIDENCE'
Anti-government protests have raged across the island for days, with at least one turning violent in the commercial capital of Colombo, in a threat to the country's lucrative tourism industry.
Thousands of protesters gathered near the president's seafront office in Colombo on Saturday, making it one of the biggest shows of public outrage in recent days. 
The protesters included dozens of Muslims who sat in the middle of a blockaded road to break their Ramadan fast and others who urged the president to step down with shouts of ""Gota (Gotabaya) go home"".
Sabry said he will lead a delegation of Sri Lankan officials to Washington to start talks with the IMF on April 18 and that financial and legal advisers would be selected within 21 days to help the government restructure its international debt.
""Once we go to them, first thing is there is a sense of confidence in the entire international monetary community that we are serious,"" he said. ""We are transparent, we are willing to engage.""
On Friday, a new central bank governor raised interest rates by an unprecedented 700 basis points in a bid to tame rocketing inflation and stabilise the economy.
Sri Lankan authorities will also reach out to rating agencies, Sabry said, as the country looks to regain access to international financial markets after being locked out due to multiple ratings downgrades since 2020.
He said the government will raise taxes and fuel prices within six months and seek to reform loss-making state-owned enterprises.
These measures were among key recommendations in an IMF review of Sri Lanka's economy released in early March.
""These are very unpopular measures, but these are things we need to do for the country to come out of this,"" Sabry said. 
'FRIEND OF ALL'
He said Sri Lanka will seek another $500 million credit line from India for fuel, which would suffice for about five weeks.
The government would also look for support from the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and bilateral partners including China, the United States, Britain and countries in the Middle East.
""We know where we are, and the only thing is to fight back,"" Sabry said. ""We have no choice.""
Discussions are ongoing with China on a $1.5 billion credit line, a syndicated loan of up to $1 billion and a request from Sri Lanka's president in January to restructure some debt.
""Hopefully we will be able to get some relief which would help ...until larger infusions come in,"" he said.
Beijing and New Delhi have long jostled for influence over the island off India's southern tip, with the country pulling closer to China under the powerful Rajapaksa family.

But in recent weeks, as the economic crisis deepened, Sri Lanka has leaned heavily on assistance from India.
""We are a neutral country,"" said Sabry. ""We are a friend of all.""

COLOMBO (Reuters) -Sri Lanka's central bank doubled its key interest rates on Friday, raising each by an unprecedented 700 basis points to tame inflation that has soared due to crippling shortages of basic goods driven by a devastating economic crisis.
The heavily indebted country has little money left to pay for imports, meaning fuel, power, food and, increasingly, medicines are in short supply.
Street protests have been held nearly non-stop for more than a month, despite a five-day state of emergency and a two-day curfew.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka's (CBSL) monetary board raised its standing lending facility to 14.50% and its standing deposit facility to 13.50%.
The build-up of aggregate demand, domestic supply disruptions, the plunge of the local currency and high prices of commodities globally could keep up the pressure on inflation, CBSL said in its monetary policy decision statement.
""The rate hike will give a strong signal to investors and markets that we are coming out of this as soon as possible,"" governor P. Nandalal Weerasinghe said at a post-policy decision briefing.
INDEPENDENT CENTRAL BANK 
Weerasinghe said that he wanted to run the central bank independently without any external influence and that he had been given the authority to do so by the president and has been asked to expedite measures to get the country out of the current crisis.
""I want to be very clear that my message is not one of blind positivity. Things are challenging and we need to take decisive action. Things will get worse before they get better, but we need to apply the breaks to this vehicle before it crashes,"" he added.
Inflation hit 18.7% in March.
An analyst had expected hikes of up to 400 basis points.
""With the monetary policy tightening now finally clear, the stage is set to take the next vital steps with regards to IMF and debt restructuring and clearly communicate this to the international stage,"" said Thilina Panduwawala, head of economic research at Frontier Research.
Finance Minister Ali Sabry said earlier that the country must urgently restructure its debt and seek external financial help, while the main opposition threatened a no-confidence motion in the government and business leaders warned exports could plummet.
""We cannot step away from repaying debt because the consequences are terrifying. There is no alternative, we must restructure our debt,"" Sabry told parliament.
J.P. Morgan analysts estimate that Sri Lanka's gross debt servicing costs will amount to $7 billion this year, with a $1 billion repayment due in July.
""We have to go for a debt moratorium,"" said Sabry, who offered to quit a day after he was appointed on Monday but later confirmed that he was still finance minister.
""We have to suspend debt repayment for some time and get bilateral and multilateral support to manage our balance of payments.""
NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION?
President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is running his administration with only a handful of ministers after his entire cabinet resigned this week, while the opposition and some coalition partners rejected calls for a unity government to deal with the country's worst crisis in decades.
At least 41 lawmakers have quit the ruling coalition to become independents, though the government says it still has a majority in parliament.
""The government needs to address the financial crisis and work to improve governance, or we will move a no-confidence motion,"" Sajith Premadasa, leader of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya opposition group, said in parliament.
Sabry, a former justice minister, said political stability was necessary as the country prepared to start talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this month. Weerasinghe said he will be holding a virtual meeting with the IMF on April 11.
Earlier on Friday, nearly two dozen associations, representing industries that collectively employ a fifth of the country's 22 million people, together urged the government to quickly seek financial help from the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Masakorala said that both merchandise and service exports could drop 20%-30% this year due to a dollar shortage, higher freight costs and power cuts.
Sri Lanka's foreign exchange reserves have plunged some 70% in the past two years, hitting $1.93 billion at the end of March.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The Biden administration is not doing enough to forge a long-term alliance with Brazil, Myron Brilliant, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's head of the international affairs division, told a press conference in Sao Paulo on Thursday. 
""In my candid view, I don't think the Biden administration is doing enough to focus on this region,"" he said of the world's ninth largest economy, adding part of the reason is the U.S. domestic agenda. 
Brilliant said the lack of U.S. engagement across Latin America means ""opportunities are not developed (nor is a) long-term strategic plan in the way that we would hope.""
The absence of the U.S. has paved the way for other partners to liaise and do business with Brazil.
""What we have seen in the last decade is a significant rise of Chinese investment and engagement in the region,"" Brilliant said. ""We are also seeing Russian engagement. We would say that the U.S. has to be present.""
The U.S. is Brazil's second most important trade partner, behind China. The difference is that Brazil runs a trade surplus with the Asian country, and a deficit with the U.S.
Brazil and the U.S. compete as exporters of agriculture commodities like soy, meat and corn. 
In the first quarter of the year, Brazil ran a $3.8 billion trade deficit with the U.S. and $4.7 billion surplus with China, according to Brazilian government data. 

The U.S. accounted for about 11% of Brazil's overall exports in the period while China was almost 28%, the data showed.
""Defining trade in terms of deficit and surplus is a mistake,"" Brilliant said. ""Important for us is to have a level playing field.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Friday broadened its export curbs against Russia and Belarus, restricting access to imports of items such as fertilizer and pipe valves as it seeks to ratchet up pressure on Moscow and Minsk following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
President Joe Biden's administration also restricted flights of American-made aircraft that are owned, controlled or leased by Belarusians from flying into Belarus ""as part of the U.S. government's response to Belarus's actions in support of Russia's aggressive conduct in Ukraine.""
Washington has sought to deepen sanctions against Russia and ally Belarus after a withdrawal of Russian troops from northern Kiev revealed mass graves in the town of Bucha.
On Wednesday, the United States targeted Russian banks and elites with a new round of sanctions, including banning Americans from investing in Russia, in response to what President Joe Biden condemned as ""major war crimes"" by Russian forces in Ukraine. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, which began on Feb. 24, is Europe's bloodiest conflict since World War Two. Russia calls it a ""special military operation"" aimed at protecting civilians.
The Commerce Department said it will begin requiring Russians and Belarusians to get a special license when seeking to obtain a host of goods from U.S. suppliers and pledged to deny those licenses. The goods include fertilizer, pipe valves, ball bearings and other parts, materials and chemicals.
The administration said items made abroad with U.S. tools would also require a U.S. license, which the administration plans to deny.

""It is evidence they are going to continue tightening export controls and targeting on an economy-wide basis those categories they have not yet done,"" said Emily Kilcrease, senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and former deputy assistant U.S. Trade Representative, noting that the Commerce Department now has further restricted Russian access to all items whose export it regulates. ""That's significant.""
Actions in late February and March placed unprecedented controls on export of U.S. and foreign-made items destined for Russia or Belarus. Those measures, coordinated with over 30 other countries, restrict a broad swath of commodities, software and technology.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -An American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) passenger who allegedly shoved a flight attendant and spit at crew members has been hit with the biggest fine ever issued by U.S. aviation regulators, and another fine topping $75,000 was issued to a Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) passenger who bit a fellow passenger after trying to hug and kiss another.
Since January 2021 when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposed a zero-tolerance policy, the agency has proposed fines of about $7 million for disruptive passengers. Two new fines issued Friday were the highest yet.
The FAA proposed a $81,950 fine for an American Airlines passenger on a July flight from Dallas, Texas to Charlotte, North Carolina, alleging the passenger ""threatened to hurt the flight attendant that offered help to the passenger after she fell into the aisle. The passenger then pushed the flight attendant aside and tried to open the cabin door.""
The FAA added ""two flight attendants tried to restrain the passenger, but she repeatedly hit one of the flight attendants on the head. After the passenger was restrained in flex cuffs, she spit at, headbutted, bit and tried to kick the crew and other passengers.""
The agency also proposed a $77,272-fine for a Delta passenger on a July Las Vegas to Atlanta flight, alleging the passenger ""attempted to hug and kiss the passenger seated next to her; walked to the front of the aircraft to try to exit during flight; refused to return to her seat; and bit another passenger multiple times.""
Delta said Friday it ""has zero tolerance for unruly behavior at our airports and on our flights as nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and people."" 
The FAA imposed its zero-tolerance mandate when unruly passenger incidents escalated around the time of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Incidents remained elevated after President Joe Biden's administration imposed a mandate requiring passengers to wear masks on airplanes and in airports because of COVID-19 cases in February 2021. 
The FAA said neither incident that led to Friday's fines involved passengers who objected to wearing masks.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told ABC's ""The View"" Friday that the administration's mandate requiring masks on airplanes and in public transport will either expire or be renewed on April 18.
""We all want to get to where there are fewer restrictions. We just need to get to a point where it is safe to do that,"" Buttigieg said. ""Air travel is a little different than a lot of other environments but we would love to get there.""
Airlines and Republicans in Congress are pressing the White House to end the mask mandate and some lawmakers sent a new letter https://republicans-transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2022-04-08_--_letter_to_biden_re_mask_mandate_april.pdf?utm_campaign=197014-345 on Friday to Biden.
The FAA said since January 2021, there have been a record 7,060 unruly passenger incidents reported - and 70% involved masking rules - but the rate has declined 60% since its high in 2021.

The FAA said in February it has referred 80 unruly airplane passengers to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution.
Buttigieg said the administration and Congress are still looking at a ""no-fly"" list for unruly passengers.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The fast-spreading Omicron variant stoked U.S. interest in better masks for children to ward off COVID-19, and that is adding fuel to an effort that could set the stage for domestic oversight of their quality.
Adult N95 masks are federally regulated and considered a gold standard. They were among the ""better masks"" U.S. health officials recommended in January to protect against Omicron. For children, no comparable U.S.-regulated mask exists, and some concerned parents turned to kid-sized masks made to South Korea's KF94 or China's KN95 standards instead. 
While many U.S. states and schools have since stopped requiring mask-wearing for COVID, disease experts say children will still need high-quality masks for everything from current and future pandemics to seasonal flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that can cause serious illness and death. 
""Every year there are opportunities for masks to make a difference - whether it's in the classroom or in the daycare,"" said Dr. Steven Krug, an emergency room physician and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Council on Children and Disasters.
U.S. e-commerce sites are crowded with sellers offering children's KF94 or KN95 masks. Most sites do not authenticate those products, and U.S. health agencies do not approve them - 
creating fertile ground for fraudsters.
Dr. Jennifer Nayak, a University of Rochester Medical Center infectious disease specialist, told Reuters that mask shopping for her three kids on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other sites spurred questions, including: ""Is it real vs. counterfeit? Is it going to fit?""
South Korea is considered a leader for children's masks because it tightly enforces its KF94 standard. Its health ministry says the only genuine KF94s are made in South Korea. 
Behealthyusa.net, the direct seller of made-in-South Korea BOTN KF94s in the United States, told Reuters its site sold out of many small-sized KF94 masks during the original Omicron surge.
Los Angeles-based importer Tony Chen, father of 8- and 11-year-olds, started bringing in kid-sized, made-in-South Korea KF94 masks when parents struggled to find authentic masks at affordable prices.
Parents with ties to South Korea pointed Chen to reputable children's KF94 mask sellers there, he said. He flies masks duty-free to the United States under direct-to-consumer shipping rules that lower his cost to 47 cents to $1 each, vs. $1 to $3 on e-commerce sites.
""I'm just hoping I break even,"" said Chen, who has imported about 9,000 children's KF94s for dozens of families since Jan. 1 and plans to keep going as long as needed. 
A handful of other groups also are doing leg work for parents.
Project N95 - which vets mask sellers all the way back to the factory - runs a website that offers a variety of masks for children - including KF94s from South Korea, KN95s from China, and specialty products made by legitimate N95 manufacturers in the United States.
""We do often run out,"" Project N95 Executive Director Anne Miller said. 
Factories produce fewer masks for children than adults, and demand for children's sizes is increasing up to 15% per week, Miller said.
LONG ROAD TO OVERSIGHT 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certifies N95 masks and inspects the facilities that make them. A move is afoot to establish a U.S. standard for high-filtration children's masks, which could set the stage for domestic oversight. 
Texas mask-maker Aegle and the University of Maryland's Fischell Institute for Biomedical Devices are designing children's masks that filter like N95s but are optimized for kids' smaller faces and lungs. Aegle Chief Executive Andy Moy aims to start clinical trials at Washington's Children's National Hospital in April.
The standard would define mask materials, measurements and filtration qualities. After that, a standards body or government agency would need to support and adopt it. A federal agency would be needed to enforce the standard, Moy said.
""Only then will parents have the assurance they need,"" Moy said.
American Mask Manufacturer's Association (AMMA) founder Lloyd Armbrust said success would require ongoing commitment and political pressure.

""These problems are totally solvable, but people have to care long enough,"" Armbrust said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Central banks from Brazil to Chile may be forced to dole out more monetary ""medicine"" than expected as inflation in the region continue to surge, defying sharp interest rate hikes and spurring discontent over rising food and fuel prices.
Brazil's monthly inflation has surged beyond forecasts to the highest in 28 years. Chile went one better with the biggest jump since 1993, Mexico has posted a 21-year-high annual figure and Peru the highest in a quarter of a century. 
That, analysts say, will push central banks towards hiking rates faster than planned, a reflection of how tough it has become to bring down inflation, with soaring commodities costs and the war in Ukraine heating up prices globally.
""The inflation reality is asking for more monetary medication,"" said Alfredo Coutino, director Latin America at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics.
Policymakers had signaled slower rises ahead after steep hikes earlier in the year. Chile has raised its benchmark rate 650 basis points since the middle of last year. Brazil has hiked the rate to 11.75% from a record-low 2% last March.
That's failed so far to rein in prices, with annual inflation also surging, pushed up by grocery prices and fuel costs, a volatile mix which is stirring angry protests in Peru and forcing political leaders to take evasive action. 
(Graphic: Latin America inflation - https://graphics.reuters.com/LATAM-INFLATION/zjvqkdlmnvx/chart.png) 
TIGHTENING CYCLE
William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said that higher-than-expected inflation rates backed the view that regional central banks will need to raise interest rates by more than expected.
""It reinforces our view that the tightening cycle will go further than the path implied by the central bank's latest guidance and the analyst consensus,"" he wrote in a note.
After the latest inflation data, Brazilian interest rate futures rose across the board and economists flagged that next month's widely expected interest rate increase may not be the last of the cycle, as the bank had previously suggested.
In Argentina, where annual inflation is running above 50% and is expected to keep rising, the central bank is now likely to lift the interest rate again in April, a source at the entity told Reuters, after three straight hikes this year.
""There should be a new upward adjustment this month,"" the person with direct knowledge of discussions said, adding though that the hike would likely be capped at 150 basis points to avoid stymieing economic growth.

'INFLATION IS BACK'
The headache for policymakers in Latin America, a major global producer of commodities from copper to corn, comes as global supply crunches heat up prices worldwide.
Almost 60% of developed economies now have year-on-year inflation above 5%, the largest share since the late 1980s, while it is over 7% in more than half of the developing world.
That's rattling governments from Sri Lanka to Peru, which has been gripped by angry protests in recent weeks against soaring fuel and food prices. The central bank has responded by hiking the interest rate to the highest since 2009. 
(Graphic: Peru interest rate - https://graphics.reuters.com/PERU-ECONOMY/klvykjoabvg/chart.png) 
And in region's second largest economy, Mexican consumer prices rose in March at a pace not seen since 2001, with economists now expecting more interest rate hikes ahead.
Still, the fight to bring down prices may be a long one.
The head of the Bank for International Settlements Agustin Carstens warned earlier this week the world is facing a new era of higher inflation and interest rates as deteriorating ties between the West, Russia and China and COVID after-effects drive globalisation into reverse.

""Inflation is back,"" said the BIS central bank umbrella group.

157,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 12:54PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. continued to slash estimates for Ukraine’s grain exports as sea routes were curbed following Russia’s invasion. 
Ukraine’s corn exports will drop by another 4.5 million tons to 23 million tons and wheat exports by 1 million tons, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s closely watched World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates, or WASDE. World wheat stockpiles were revised down to 278.4 million tons, less than expected by a Bloomberg survey.
Russia’s war in Ukraine is upending trade flows out of the critical Black Sea breadbasket region, prompting warnings of food shortages as crucial supplies of wheat, corn and cooking oils are at risk. Food prices are surging at the fastest clip ever and worsening world hunger. 
“There’s an increased possibility of the conflict getting out of hand again. Peace is not coming any time soon,” said Jack Scoville, analyst at Price Futures Group Inc. in Chicago.
Grain and oilseed futures have jumped to near record highs and also caused a spike in prices of farm necessities like fertilizer and fuel. Big growing regions like the U.S. and Brazil are under pressure to produce ample crops, though weather woes and inflation in both countries are clouding the season’s outlook. 
Most-active corn futures in Chicago rose 1.5% to $7.6175 a bushel as of 11:44 a.m. local time. Benchmark wheat was up 2.7% to $10.5325, and soybeans also rose.
Sidelined Supplies
To see how significantly the war is upending crop flows from Ukraine, its corn stockpiles tell the story. The war has left the country saddled with huge amounts of grain that it’s largely unable to move. With its ports shut, Ukraine is working to ramp up exports via rail, but the flows remain well below normal seaborne trade.
The chaos in the Black Sea so far hasn’t led to a jump in U.S. grain exports, though there were signs of fresh corn demand this week when China scooped up 1.1 million tons, the Asian nation’s biggest such buy in almost a year.
Besides the worsening war that’s affecting Black Sea exports, the report was bearish, according to Naomi Blohm, senior market adviser at Total Farm Marketing in Wisconsin, with no changes to U.S. corn reserves, bigger wheat supplies and a smaller-than-expected cut in U.S. soybeans stockpiles.
Soy  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH)
Shifts in the soybean markets are also underway. The report raised U.S. exports while lowering shipments out of Brazil, as well as Ukraine and Russia. 
South American soybean crops are down a combined 33 million tons below initial estimates from November, which marks a record loss for the region after a strong drought caused by La Nina weather patterns. With that cut in production, the smaller South American exports will drive more demand to the U.S. for summer and early fall.
Bigger U.S. exports will likely to shrink end-season U.S. soybean stockpiles by 8.8%, the largest decline in the month of April since 2012. It’s an unusual move because supplies in America are typically well known at this time of year.

158,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 11:23AM ET</span>",,,,,,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. recession is not imminent despite the inversion of a part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve which has been ""artificially pressured"" by some investors, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, said in a note on Friday.
The closely watched gap between two-year and 10-year yields, whose inversion has preceded past recessions, turned negative last week, fueling a debate on whether the signal presages a downturn this time around. 
“We do not see a recession occurring in the near-term,” said Gargi Chaudhuri, head of iShares Investment Strategy, Americas, at BlackRock.
“While we are hesitant to say that this time is different, we note that many factors now differ from previous yield curve inversions,” she wrote.
Longer-dated yields had been pushed artificially low by investors such as pension funds with improved funding status, contributing to the curve inversion, she said.
Inversions of key parts of the Treasury yield curve – which occur when yields on shorter-term Treasuries exceed those for longer-dated government bonds and signal economic worries – have concerned investors in recent weeks, as the Federal Reserve grows more aggressive in its fight to slow the economy and tackle inflation.
Analysts have said the central bank's unprecedented bond purchases, as well as excess savings after the coronavirus crisis, are holding longer-dated yields lower than they would otherwise be. 
The 2s/10s yield curve has been steepening this week, with the 10-year yield standing 18.8 basis points higher than the yield of two-year notes on Friday.

BlackRock's Chaudhuri said more hawkish signals by the central bank - increasingly determined to tighten financial conditions through rate hikes and balance-sheet reduction to fight inflation - have contributed to the curve steepening. 
""We still see room for longer end interest rates to move modestly higher from here"", she said.

MILAN (Reuters) -France's Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) has become the single largest investor in Banco BPM after buying a 9.2% stake, raising the prospect of a full takeover bid and sending shares in Italy's third-largest lender sharply higher.
The move increases the French group's exposure to its main foreign market, where it has been playing an active role in ongoing banking consolidation.
While Credit Agricole said it had not sought supervisory approval to go above 10%, analysts pointed to the gradual stakebuilding since 2018 that preceded its $1 billion takeover of regional Italian lender Credito Valtellinese (CreVal) in 2021. 
""We believe this is the first step that will bring the French peer to get, sooner or later, the control of Banco BPM. We witnessed the same process for CreVal,"" Bestinver said.
Credit Agricole had no comment. Two people close to the transaction said the rationale for the deal was to develop business lines and not to gain retail footprint. 
Banco BPM has long been searching for a merger partner, with CEO Giuseppe Castagna seen as keen for his bank not to be swallowed by a bigger rival.
Under Italian rules a full takeover of Banco BPM from Credit Agricole would need approval from Italy's government and political sources said the investment had irked Italy's League party, traditionally seen as close to Castagna. 
A strong presence in Italy's wealthy Lombardy region had made Banco BPM an attractive target for heavyweight UniCredit, which had readied a takeover offer before the Ukraine war and is now busy dealing with its large Russian exposure, sources had told Reuters.
Banco BPM's 200 billion euros ($217 billion) in assets at end-2021 compare with Credit Agricole Italy's 116 billion euros.
The two lenders held tie-up talks in 2020 which led nowhere. Banco BPM also sought in vain to strike what was dubbed a ""merger of equals"" with rival BPER Banca. 
CONSUMER FINANCE 
After losing nearly a fifth of its value since the start of the conflict, Banco BPM has a market capitalisation of just over 4 billion euros, giving the Credit Agricole stake a value of around 380 million euros.
Shares in Banco BPM rose 13% by 1500 GMT. Credit Agricole lost 0.5%.
The French lender said the investment, carried out by buying shares on the market and through a transaction with a leading international bank, would not significantly impact its core capital ratio.
Already tied to Banco BPM by a long-standing consumer finance joint venture, Credit Agricole said the deal strengthened its ""solid relationship"" with Banco BPM and aimed to expand the scope of their strategic partnerships.
It also shows its appreciation of Banco BPM's ""solid franchise"", good financial prospects and ""strong and performing management team"", it said.
Credit Agricole's Italian business dates back to 2007. Ten years later it took over three small failing banks for 130 million euros, while in 2016 its asset manager Amundi bought Pioneer Investments from UniCredit for 3.6 billion euros.
With Amundi's distribution agreement with UniCredit expiring in 2026, analysts said Credit Agricole was moving to secure an alternative sales network. 
Banco BPM owns 19.4% of Italian asset manager Anima, whose shares rose 8% on speculation it could also play a role in any tie-up.
Banco BPM said the stake purchase had not been previously agreed between the two banks.

""The quality and importance of the investor, as well as the appreciation it expressed for our bank ... represent a clear acknowledgement of the value and potential of Banco BPM,"" the Italian bank said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Plunging prices for Russian crab have South Koreans flocking to seafood markets and restaurants but some consumers are questioning whether to boycott the imports on concerns the purchases indirectly support Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The dinner-plate sized king crabs from Russia, along with slightly smaller snow crabs and lobsters, were once a pricey delicacy in South Korea, though they have become more popular at supermarkets and online retailers in recent years. 
But prices have nearly halved since late February as the United States, European Union and other nations banned Russian seafood imports over the Ukraine invasion, which Russia calls a ""special operation"", and China's lockdown on major cities over coronavirus outbreaks has further boosted shipments to South Korea.
Data from the Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market, one of South Korea's largest seafood markets, showed live Russian snow crabs prices fell to 23,000 won ($18.80) per kg (2.2 pounds) at the end of March from 50,000 won ($40.80) in mid-February, before rising slightly this week. The supply more than doubled during that period. 
The market does not track king crab prices, but Kim Mi-kyeong, who has been running a fish store at Noryangjin for 10 years, said she sold them at 85,000 won ($69.40) per kg, down from 110,000 won ($89.80) two months ago. 
""We didn't have enough supplies back then, but a lot more volume has come in from Russia for the last two months. Prices are lower now, so twice as many people are coming,"" she said. 
Choi Myung-sook, 54, said she could not miss out on getting her favourite king crabs cheaply. 
""I hope more Russian seafood will be brought in so that prices will go down even further,"" she said. 
But others say the government should join global efforts to ban Russian seafood, and that consumers should refrain from buying it. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is set to give a virtual speech to the South Korean parliament on Monday, has urged the international community to ditch Russian exports.
South Korea has curbed Russian coal imports and joined other economic and financial sanctions, but did not restrict food. 

""We should not buy those crabs,"" said Jung Mi-jung, 40, who said she was visiting the market for other items. ""That's not even a necessity, and Russia waged an unjustifiable war against Ukraine. We should join the boycott.""

(Reuters) -Euro zone bond yields rose on Friday as traders further ramped up bets on European Central Bank rate hikes this year.
Minutes from the ECB's latest policy meeting, which were more hawkish than expected, had already pushed yields higher after they were published on Thursday. 
The minutes showed some policymakers wanted to go further than ending bond purchases at some point in the third quarter by setting a firm end-date.
Traders moved to price in over 65 basis points of ECB rate hikes by the end of the year, compared to around 60 bps before the minutes were released. 
Expectations for rate hikes next year have also moved sharply higher. For example markets are betting rates will rise to around 1.15% in July 2023, up from around 0.95% at the start of the month. 
Banks are also adjusting their calls. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which had cut its call following the invasion of Ukraine, and Danske Bank now expect the ECB to deliver 25 basis-point hikes in both September and December. 
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) moved to the same forecast on Thursday.
""The economic backdrop since the last meeting has moved further towards a stagflationary scenario in the euro area, with weakening growth, higher uncertainty, lower confidence and higher inflation,"" Danske's analysts said in a client note. 
""However, the increasing risk of unanchored inflation expectations and second round effects on wages will keep the pressure on ECB to proceed with its policy normalisation despite rising recession risks.""
Goldman Sachs economists said that a hike might come already in July if the demand hit from the Ukraine invasion turned out smaller than expected and there were clear signs of second-round inflation effects. 
Germany's two-year yield, which is sensitive to interest rate expectations, was up 6 bps by 1446 GMT at 0.036%. 
The 10-year Bund yield, the benchmark for the euro area, was up 2.7 bps at 0.71%. 
A key market gauge of long-term euro zone inflation expectations continued surging and hit the highest since early 2013 at 2.3532%. 
French and Italian debt underperformed as investors remained focused on Sunday's first-round French presidential vote. Bond yields move inversely with prices. 
Markets this week started to acknowledge the possibility of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen beating incumbent Emmanuel Macron as her surge in the polls brought that outcome within the margins of error. 

The French 10-year yield was up 5.3 bps after rising to the highest since mid-2015 at 1.296%. 
Italian 10-year yields were up similarly after touching the highest since March 2020 at 2.421%. The closely-watched gap over German peers to 169.6 bps, the highest in a week.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy has reduced its estimates for the economic growth impact of European Union funds and reforms connected with its Recovery Plan, a Treasury document showed on Friday, saying the cash will be spent more slowly.
Italy is eligible for more than 200 billion euros ($216.82 billion) in grants and cheap loans from the EU's Fund, making it the biggest beneficiary of the 750 billion euro kitty set up to help the bloc's 27 countries recover from the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Treasury's annual Economic and Financial Document (DEF) said the government now expects to be able to spend the money less quickly than it envisaged when it sent its Recovery Plan of investments and reforms to Brussels in April last year.
The positive growth impact is reduced by 0.3 percentage points in 2022, 0.4 points in 2023, 0.4 in 2024, 0.3 in 2025 and 0.4 in 2026.
Under the latest forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) will be 3.2% higher in 2026 than it would have been without the Recovery Fund. That compares with a previous estimate of a 3.6% increase.
The downward revision reflects ""different and less rapid dynamics of the overall expenditure programme than previously assumed,"" the Treasury said without providing more details.
The DEF also says that of a complementary Italian growth-boosting fund worth 30.6 billion euros, almost a third (9.5 billion euros) will now not be spent until after 2026.
The revisions come as the war in Ukraine worsens the economic outlook throughout the euro zone.
The DEF slashed Italy's GDP growth estimate for this year to 3.1% from a 4.7% projection made in September.
That projection remains more optimistic than those of several independent forecasters. Employers' lobby Confindustria has estimated 2022 growth of just 1.9%.
Italy, whose top two banks have sizeable exposure to Russia and which relies heavily on Moscow for its energy needs, could see its growth outlook deteriorate further if the West ramps up its sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

In a worst-case scenario, assuming an embargo on Russian gas and oil until 2023 and serious shortages in supplies, the DEF estimates growth of just 0.6% in 2022 and 0.4% next year.

An Italian judge decided to transfer the case involving Italy's second biggest bank and seven of its staff to the court in the city of Trieste, a company lawyer told Reuters.
The case centres on allegations that banks and brokers sold diamonds to unwitting clients at vastly inflated prices while marketing them as sound financial investments.
All the banks involved have already reimbursed most of their clients.
The decision, based on where the alleged offences took place, means that proceedings involving Unicredit will have to start over from scratch.
""We are satisfied that the judge has granted our request for a transfer,"" Unicredit's lawyer Giuseppe Iannaccone told Reuters.
""But I consider the allegation baseless and we regret that the bank and its employees will have to wait more time to prove their innocence"", he added.
Judge Manuela Scudieri on Friday also ordered diamond broker IDB and 15 people to stand trial at the end of June, judicial and legal sources told Reuters.
A lawyer for IDB, which collapsed in 2019, was not immediately available for comment.
The judge, at the end of a closed-door preliminary hearing that began in July 2021, also accepted the settlement proposed by Banco BPM and its subsidiary Banca Aletti.
Banco BPM had proposed to pay 240,000 euros ($260,856) as a settlement, while it will have an additional 293,119 euros confiscated, while Banca Aletti would put forward 56,000 euros to settle. 
Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) settled on July 1, while the case against Monte dei Paschi has already been transferred to the court in Siena where it has its headquarters.
Many of the fraud allegations to be prosecuted risk being cancelled given that these kind of offences are time-barred after up to seven years, according to Italian law.
According to the prosecutors' indictment request, the five banks and two brokers, one of which settled the case last year, are suspected of having made inflated profits of around 500 million euros from 2014-2016, leaving savers out of pocket.

Intesa, UniCredit and MPS bought back the diamonds from customers at the original selling price, while Banco reimbursed the difference between the price clients paid for the diamonds and their fair market value.

164,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 10:07AM ET</span>","BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany plans to offer more than 100 billion euros ($108.8 billion) worth of aid to companies hit by fallout from the war in Ukraine, according to a document from the finance and economy ministries seen by Reuters on Friday.
In the plan, later published by the ministries, the government labelled the aid a ""protective shield"" for companies affected by the war, whose main concern it said was short-term liquidity - an issue it aims to address with credit instruments.
Under the plan, the government will offer companies of all sizes low-interest, liability-free loans worth an estimated 7 billion euros via state development bank KfW.
In addition, it will offer guarantees on loans of up to 100 billion euros to safeguard companies' liquidity during energy price spikes.
""Today we are presenting a major economic package to support companies that are exorbitantly burdened by high prices,"" Economy Minister Robert Habeck told a joint news conference with Finance Minister Christian Lindner.
German annual inflation rose to its highest level in more than 40 years in March as prices of natural gas and oil products soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Equity or hybrid capital injections could be an option for particularly relevant companies, the ministries said. For energy intensive industries, the government plans a temporary cost subsidy.
Lindner described the plan as an ""economic shock absorber"", adding that ""it deals responsibly with taxpayers' money"".
Peter Adrian, president of the DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce, said Friday's measures went in the right direction but developments related to the war in Ukraine were so dynamic it remained to be seen whether the aid plans would suffice.
""Above all, energy prices, which have once again risen significantly due to the war in Ukraine, are putting companies in a threatening cost squeeze,"" he said in a statement.
A supplementary budget, which Lindner plans to submit to parliament in the coming weeks to reflect the economic impact of the war in Ukraine, would likely have a volume of at least 24 billion euros, he said on Friday.
Lindner told Friday's news conference the German government was working every day to tighten sanctions against Russia.

""Russia must not win the war,"" added Habeck, who is also Germany's vice chancellor.

(Reuters) - Global sustainable bond issuance slowed faster than the broader market in the first quarter, hit by a surge in market volatility after Russia invaded Ukraine and tightening monetary policy around the world.
The slowdown followed record issuance of bonds linked to environmental or social goals in 2021, data from Refinitiv showed.
Total issuance of green, social and sustainability bonds, as well as those issued by companies with a sustainable business model, such as renewable energy, totalled $231.7 billion in the first quarter of 2022, a 19% drop over last year.
Issuance across the broader market fell 5% to $2.49 trillion over the same period. 
While assets of all stripes have long been helped by the ultra-easy monetary policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the first quarter saw signs of tightening across the globe.
""Certainty of Fed rate hikes and asset sales, tangible evidence of price inflation and the Russian/Ukraine conflict, collectively brought fear to investors in the fixed income markets in the first quarter of 2022,"" said David Falk, fixed income portfolio manager at Shelton Capital Management.
Issuance of green bonds, where the proceeds are used for a specific environmentally friendly project, dropped to $110.4 billion in the first quarter, a 7% decline from the prior year.

Andrew Poreda, senior ESG research analyst at Sage Advisory Services, said inflationary pressures, which have been exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine, had made renewable projects a tougher sell.
Rising prices across the renewable energy value chain ""will cause headwinds for new projects over the near-term, so (the level of issuance is) not surprising when looking at Q1 figures,"" he said.

Social bonds, which look to raise money for projects with positive social outcomes such as improving health or providing affordable housing issuance, saw issuance drop to $44 billion, a 55% decline over last year.

The consumer price index will now average 5.7% in the final three months of the year, up from the 4.5% estimated a month ago, according to the median forecast of 72 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The chance of a recession over the next year also increased to 27.5% from 20% in March. The March CPI report will be released Tuesday.
The survey, conducted April 1 to 7, captures economists’ forecasts after the first full month of Russia’s war in Ukraine, which has driven up prices of major commodities like food and oil and stressed fragile supply chains. That’s bolstering expectations for rapid inflation to persist and consumer spending to slow, complicating the Fed’s task to tame prices without tipping the economy into a recession.
“With the Fed seemingly feeling the need to ‘catch up’ to regain control of inflation and inflation expectations, a rapid-fire pace of aggressive interest rate increases heightens the chances of a policy miss-step that could be enough to topple the economy into a recession,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. 
Respondents raised their forecasts for each price index tracked in the survey from the first quarter of 2022 through the third quarter of 2023. The Fed’s preferred gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, is anticipated to average 4.7% year-over-year in the final three months of the year, more than double the central bank’s 2% target.
Estimates for economic growth were revised lower from the prior survey as expectations for consumer spending softened going forward. However, spending for the first three months of 2022 is seen stronger now than it was last month.
Average hourly earnings are expected to be higher than prior surveys showed, with the measure increasing by 5.6% and 5.3% from a year earlier in the second and third quarters, respectively, as businesses continue to boost wages to attract and retain workers.

(Reuters) - The euro area economy is one of the most vulnerable to the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, yet the message coming from its sovereign debt markets is quite different.
Bond yield curves plot borrowing costs across different maturities and are seen as a good indicator of growth and inflation trends. They are also closely watched financial market indicators.
The recent, albeit brief, U.S. yield curve inversion when two-year yields pushed above 10-year yields was a warning to the markets, as that move is considered a harbinger of recession.
To some degree, that resonated in Europe. Germany's 10-year/30-year yield and five-year/30-year spreads narrowed to their tightest since 2000 and 2008 respectively. The former neared inversion below 10 bps and is actually inverted in the swaps market, where investors exchange fixed and floating-rate cash flows to hedge rates risk. 
But the parallels end there.
The two-year/10-year German curve segment has steepened this year - meaning 10-year yields have risen faster than short-dated ones. Indeed, it is among the steepest globally.
That move seems counterintuitive, however. The Ukraine war will inflict more pain on euro zone economies, given their closer economic ties and reliance on Russian energy.
""It's a conundrum that it's so steep,"" Danske Bank analyst Piet Christiansen said. 
DIFFERENT
One explanation for the U.S. inversion was that it reflected worries that the Federal Reserve, set on hiking interest rates hard and fast, will trigger a slowdown. 
But a euro zone recession would stem not from central bank action but from the war fallout, said Jens Eisenschmidt, chief European economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), ""so it's not a natural one to focus on yield curve dynamics at this stage."" 
History also suggests the German curve is a less reliable indicator than its U.S. counterpart. 
Germany's two-year/10-year yield curve did not invert before any of the recessions from 2000, Refinitiv Datastream data shows. In some cases it even steepened before a recession and all inversions took place during, not before, a recession. 
""German curve spreads are not leading indicators,"" said Arne Petimezas, senior analyst at brokerage AFS Group.
First, the German curve has a relatively short history - analysts don't look at the period before Germany's 1990 reunification. 
Second, seven years of hefty ECB purchases have dulled the signalling power of euro zone's benchmark bond market.
That's a problem for all developed bond markets, but particularly acute for Germany, where the ECB owns nearly 40% of the outstanding market, AFS Group estimates, compared to the Fed's just over 25% footprint in U.S. Treasuries. 
The free float of German bonds available for investors was at a record low 22% at the end of 2021, AFS calculates.
That keeps Germany's 10-year yield about 175 basis points lower than it otherwise would trade, Allianz (DE:ALVG) senior economist Patrick Krizan estimates.
A collateral shortage leading to extraordinary repo demand for German debt is thought to hold down two-year yields, too.
So expectations that the ECB will end its bond-buying this year should cause the German curve to steepen.
""You have less of a dampening effect from (quantitative easing) and more supply coming from the German government,"" Krizan said, referring to Germany's 100 billion euros' worth of planned defence spending.
With 60 basis points of ECB rate hikes priced in by year-end looking excessive to many analysts, the curve should even be a bit steeper, said Carsten Brzeski, head of global macro at ING.
SWAPS?
Bond market distortions have led investors to seek out other gauges such as the swaps market.
This is not distorted by ECB purchases and captures the entire euro zone. 

So while the two-year/10-year German cash bond curve has steepened, the same points on the one-year euro zone forward interest rates swaps curve narrowed to 19 bps last week, the tightest since 2008, according to Refinitiv Datastream. 
That shows where the curve may be in a years' time based on current rates and has dropped from 72 bps at the start of the year. Here, growth appears to be a bigger concern than in the cash German bond market.

(Reuters) - There are early signs of a cooldown in some of the hottest corners of the U.S. housing market,  Redfin  (NASDAQ:RDFN) said in a report on Friday, a fresh indication that high house prices and rising mortgage rates are cutting into homebuyer demand. 
Among those early tells, according to Redfin: Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches for ""homes for sale"" dropped by double digits in Baltimore, Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles in the second week of March from a year earlier; tours of homes for sale in California were down 21% as of March 31 from the first week of 2022, data from ShowingTime shows; Redfin agents in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Boston and Seattle reported a drop in requests for homebuying help at the start of this year compared with last year, even as requests nationwide surged; and agents in California say they are seeing fewer offers on each home than previously. 
Home prices nationwide have risen about 35% in the two years since the COVID-19 pandemic slammed the nation and the Federal Reserve slashed short-term interest rates to near zero, the Zillow Home Value Index shows. 
The Fed last month began raising its policy rate to bring down decades-high inflation as the economy reopened, and longer-term borrowing costs have climbed swiftly in anticipation of more aggressive rate hikes ahead.

The average interest rate on a 30-year-fixed mortgage, the most popular U.S. home loan, rose last week to 4.9%, a fresh three year high, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) showed this week. 
The U.S. housing market is still hot, however, even in cooling California cities. The average home in Los Angeles, for instance, is sold for 5% over its asking price, with a record share selling within a week of listing, Redfin said. 
But the signs are there already, the report said, of a price slowdown in coming months."

MUMBAI (Reuters) -The Reserve Bank of India said on Friday it is starting to move away from its ultra-loose monetary policy even as it kept its key lending rate at a record low, as its priorities shifted to fighting surging inflation in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war.
In a surprise move, the central bank said it would restore its liquidity adjustment facility corridor to pre-crisis levels, which was seen as a first step to moving away from emergency measures embraced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Analysts and traders are now broadly expecting the RBI to change its 'accomodative' stance to neutral at its next policy meeting in June, with interest rate increases starting sooner rather than later.
But with global growth risks also rising, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das sought to reassure financial markets that the process of returning policy settings to more normal levels would be gradual. 
""The conflict in Europe has the potential to derail the global economy caught in the crosscurrent of multiple headwinds. Our approach needs to be cautious, but proactive in mitigating the adverse impact on India's growth and inflation,"" Das said after the policy decision. 
The RBI's monetary policy committee held the lending rate, or the repo rate, at 4%. The reverse repo rate, or the key borrowing rate, was also kept unchanged at 3.35%.
However, the central bank said it would restore the width of the liquidity adjustment facility corridor to 50 basis points.
RBI said the floor of the corridor would be the standing deposit facility rate, which was set at 3.75%, and the marginal standing facility rate at 4.25% will be the upper bound with the repo rate in between the two.
""This raises the probability of rate hike cycle commencing in August, while not fully precluding the case for a June hike itself along with a stance change if macro realities worsen for the inflation outlook,"" said Madhavi Arora, lead economist at Emkay Global.
All but six of 50 respondents polled by Reuters between March 29-April 5 had forecast no change in the repo rate on Friday. Thirty-two had expected rates to still be unchanged by end-June.
""INFLATION BEFORE GROWTH""
Reflecting growing uncertainties, the RBI raised its inflation forecast for the current fiscal year to 5.7%, 120 basis points above its forecast in February, while cutting its economic growth forecast to 7.2% for 2022/23 from 7.8%.
""We have now put inflation before growth. So that is the sequence of our priorities - first is inflation followed by growth,"" Das said, adding that this was the first time in three years that the RBI was putting inflation in the forefront.
Das said RBI will gradually withdraw system liquidity over a multi-year timeframe beginning this year but will do it in a non-disruptive manner. He said economic activity is barely above pre-pandemic levels but continues to steadily recover.
Das said the MPC voted unanimously to keep the repo rate unchanged and to retain an 'accommodative' monetary policy stance.
But he added that the focus is on the withdrawal of accommodation.
Inflation has held above the RBI's 6% upper threshold so far this year, casting doubt on its strategy of keeping rates low to bolster growth even as some other central banks are already raising borrowing costs to tamp down price pressures.
India's 10-year benchmark bond yield jumped 20 basis points on the day to trade at 7.11% by 1040 GMT, while the rupee strengthened to end at 75.8950 against the dollar. The NSE Nifty 50 index closed 0.82% higher while the S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.70%.

Das also said the RBI will work to help smooth the implementation of the government' record $14.31 trillion borrowing programme as and when warranted. The RBI also increased banks' held-to-maturity limit in debt to 23% from the current 22% until end-March 2023.
""Amid inability to explicitly support the government borrowing program, the RBI enhanced the held-to-maturity limit by 100 bps, which could calm the bond markets despite a sharp increase in inflation forecast,"" said Garima Kapoor, economist institutional equities at Elara Capital.

173,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 06:40AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The Russian central bank sharply cut its key rate to 17% on Friday and said future cuts were possible, as emergency steps had contained the risk to financial stability, brought deposits back to banks and helped limit the threat of inflation, it said.
Last month, the central bank kept its key interest rate at 20% following a massive emergency hike in February and said it would start buying OFZ government bonds, warning of an imminent spike in inflation and a looming economic contraction. 
Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 on what it calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour, prompting widespread Western sanctions.
On Friday, the central bank unexpectedly cut the key rate by 300 basis points, taking the decision ahead of its next regular meeting set for April 29.
It said the move reflected a change in the balance of risks of accelerated consumer price growth, a decline in economic activity and had contained the risk to financial stability.
""Financial stability risks are still present, but have ceased to increase for the time being, including owing to the adopted capital control measures. There is a steady inflow of funds to fixed-term deposits,"" its statement said. 
Annual inflation in Russia accelerated to 16.70% as of April 1, its highest since March 2015 and up from 15.66% a week earlier, as the volatile rouble sent prices soaring amid unprecedented Western sanctions which cut Russia off the global financial markets and limited its trade with the outside world.
External conditions for the Russian economy remained challenging and were ""considerably constraining economic activity"", the central bank said, but added that it ""holds open the prospect of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings"".
The central bank added that inflation would continue to rise due to the base effect, yet the latest weekly data showed a slowdown in the price growth rate, also thanks to the rouble's growth. 
""The tightening of monetary conditions already in place is partly offset by the lending support programmes launched by the government and the Bank of Russia, but it will continue to limit pro-inflationary risks,"" the statement said.
Russian analysts welcomed the ahead-of-schedule key rate cut, which some expected to start only in June, saying it showed that the central bank was confident in the emergency steps taken since Feb. 24.

""The rate is likely to be cut by another 100-200 bps in April, yet it will require additional positive dynamics on inflation and inflationary expectations,"" Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at the Moscow-based brokerage Locko-Invest, said.
After Friday's decision, Polevoy improved his year-end key rate forecast to 11-12% from an earlier expected ""no higher than 15%"".

The warning came against a backdrop of rising global bond yields driven by expectations of faster policy tightening by the Federal Reserve and other central banks.
Japan is not experiencing the kind of spiralling increase in inflation and wage growth that the United States and some other countries face, while interest rates remain ultra low because of powerful monetary easing by the Bank of Japan (BOJ).
""What's most affected in terms of finances will be interest rate payments,"" said a Ministry of Finance (MOF) official who oversees the panel.
A 1% increase in government bond yields would translate eventually into a 10 trillion yen ($80 billion) rise in borrowing costs, the official said, describing the panel's advice to the minister.
""The yen is weakening and the current account balance has swung into a deficit,"" he added. ""These underscore a growing need to ensure firm economic and fiscal policies so as to win confidence in the currency."" 
Japan's outstanding balance of government bonds are expected to reach 1,026 trillion yen at the end of the fiscal year to March 2023.
U.S. Treasury bond yields hovered near multi-year highs after the Federal Reserve minutes out this week reinforced the rate-hike momentum already priced into markets.
Under a policy dubbed yield curve control, the BOJ guides short-term interest rates at -0.1% and the 10-year government bond yield around 0%.

The divergence in monetary policy has caused interest rate differentials between Japan and the United States to widen, an occurrence that tends to strengthen the dollar versus the yen.

Investing.com -- A Russian attack kills scores of fleeing civilians at a Ukrainian rail station. Russia's central bank cuts interest rates sharply to stave off a looming economic and financial sector crisis. Stocks are set to open higher, even though bond yields continue to advance, Marine Le Pen senses victory in France's presidential elections, and world food prices are rising at their fastest pace ever. Here's what you need to know in world financial markets on Friday, 8th April.
1. Russia attacks fleeing civilians
Russian rocket artillery hit a train station in eastern Ukraine, killing over 30 people and injuring over 100 more, is one of the most shocking incidents yet in the six-week-long war.
The victims had gathered at Kramatorsk station as part of a mass evacuation of civilians ahead of an expected major Russian attack on eastern Ukraine. Russia’s Defense Ministry first said it had used high-precision missiles against three stations in the region, then accused Ukraine of staging the incident.
The attack comes as the EU confirmed its latest sanctions package, which bans imports of Russian coal. Japan also banned Russian coal imports on Friday. However, the attack is certain to raise the pressure on European governments, especially Germany, to apply the same treatment to Russian oil.
2. Russia cuts rates to stave off financial crisis
Russia’s central bank surprisingly cut its key interest rate by 3 percentage points to 17%, saying that the balance of risks in the economy had shifted away from inflation to economic recession and financial instability. 
The move reflects a degree of success in cushioning the immediate impact of western sanctions on the Russian economy, but analysts still expect gross domestic product to contract by around 10% this year. Many businesses, including much of the country’s manufacturing sector, have already had to idle capacity as sanctions have hit the import of vital components. Russia releases fourth quarter GDP numbers for 2021 along with March CPI data at 12 PM ET (1600 GMT)
Official exchange rates for ruble had recovered to their prewar level ahead of the move, although economists have played down the importance of that because the central bank has imposed capital controls that don’t allow the currency to be freely bought and sold, while withdrawals from dollar accounts held locally by businesses and individuals are still subject to strict limits.
3. Stocks set to open higher, shrugging off rising yields
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher later, building on Thursday’s tentative recovery at the end of a week in which expectations for future U.S. interest rates have been aggressively repriced.
By 6:20 AM ET (1020 GMT), Dow Jones Futures were up 74 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 Futures were also up 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 Futures were up 0.1%. The three main cash indices had gained by between 0.1% and 0.5% on Thursday.
That’s despite further advances in bond yields which, in signaling higher capital costs for the broader economy, ought to weigh on stocks. The benchmark 10-Year Treasury yield rose another 2 basis points to 2.69%, the latest in a string of three-year highs hit this week.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), whose factory in Austin, Tx., was opened with great fanfare by CEO Elon Musk on Thursday, and Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), after Goldman Sachs, the lead underwriter when the online brokerage went public, downgraded the stock to a 'sell'. It’s already lost nearly two-thirds of its value since listing.
4. French election jitters as Le Pen closes gap on Macron
France heads to the polls at the weekend for the first round of presidential and parliamentary elections.
The opinion poll lead of incumbent President Emmanuel Macron over the right-wing populist Marine Le Pen has shriveled from some 30 percentage points at the outbreak of Russia’s war in Ukraine to an average of only 3.5% according to most recent polls. One published on Thursday even suggested that Le Pen would beat Macron in the run-off in two weeks’ time (assuming they both progress).
French bonds and stock have underperformed the rest of Europe sharply this week as the chances of a Le Pen victory have risen. Her platform revolves largely around tackling the cost-of-living crisis through greater state intervention.
5. Global food prices on a tear; WASDE report eyed
Global food prices are rising at their fastest pace since records began, according to the UN.
The Food and Agricultural Organization’s world food price index rose 12.6% in March, according to data released on Friday, bringing its annual rise to 34% - the third straight record high. The FAO described the move as a “giant leap.”
The increase is due largely – but by no means exclusively – to the disruption of wheat and other grain-related products from the Black Sea since Russia invaded Ukraine.  Further increases are likely due to the massive shock to fertilizer prices from the sharp rally in natural gas over the last year.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Britain and other Western allies have announced several waves of sanctions targetting Moscow's wealthy elites, key industries and its access to the international financial system. 
An update to Britain's sanctions list announced asset freezes on Putin's adult daughters Katerina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova, and Sergeyevna Vinokurova, the daughter of foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. All three were sanctioned by the United States earlier this week.
""Our unprecedented package of sanctions is hitting the elite and their families, while degrading the Russian economy on a scale Russia hasn’t seen since the fall of the Soviet Union,"" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement.

Britain also said its analysis showed Russia is heading for the deepest recession since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Britain estimates that 60% of Russian foreign currency reserves have been frozen as a result of international sanctions.
On Thursday, the Kremlin, which says its actions are a ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" Ukraine, described the move against Putin's daughters as part of a broader Western frenzy against Russia.

Investing.com -- French stocks and bonds remained under pressure on Friday, unsettled by polls showing that the chances of Marine Le Pen winning the Presidential elections have risen sharply.
In a week when inflation fears have put pressure on all bond markets, France's has fared particularly badly on concerns that the populist right-wing leader of the National Rally (formerly the National Front) may be able to push through an agenda which, according to most economists, would lead to big increases in public borrowing, in contravention of the Eurozone's budget rules and a direct challenge to the German-led consensus on fiscal stability.
The spread between the French and German 10-year bonds, a rough proxy for French political risk, has widened by 16 basis points this week - a big move for a bond market indicator that usually behaves very calmly. In nominal terms, the French 10-year yield is now at an eight-year high of 1.24%. 
The French stock market benchmark, the CAC 40 index, has also underperformed badly this week, losing nearly 2% while the STOXX 600 has risen 0.5%. Two of the worst performers have been the utility Veolia and Vinci, which runs profitable airport and motorway concessions. Both companies' models would be likely to face major political uncertainty in the event of a Le Pen victory. 
""In the end, a Macron victory still seems much more likely, but given the state of the polls, we can't completely exclude a Le Pen victory,"" ING analyst Charlotte de Montpellier said in a note to clients on Thursday.
Le Pen has dramatically narrowed the gap in opinion polls for the elections, the first round of which is due on Sunday. In one poll, published on Thursday by Atlas Politico, Le Pen was even tipped to beat Macron in the second-round run-off on April 24th. 
For now, that poll still seems an outlier. IFOP's poll of polls still shows Macron with a notional lead of 3.5% over Le Pen in the run-off. However, Macron's lead has collapsed in less than a month from some 30 points as he has failed to sustain an initial boost to his support from the outbreak of war in eastern Europe. Macron has held a number of high-profile calls with Russian Vladimir Putin in an attempt to keep diplomatic channels with the West open.
Most alarming is the comparison between today and 2017 when Macron beat Le Pen in a run-off by 66% to 34%.
Le Pen's campaign has focused relentlessly on issues closer to home, notably on Macron's plans for reforming the pension system and on the cost-of-living crisis. As elsewhere across the world, French inflation hit its highest in over 30 years in March at 5.1%.
At the same time, consistent with her previous closeness to Putin, Le Pen has openly adopted a position undercutting western attempts to punish Russia for its aggression.
“The solution of cutting gas and petrol imports [from Russia], that will be a tragedy for French families,” Le Pen told French radio station RTL this week. “I’m sorry to tell you, my priority is to defend the purchasing power of French families.”"

(Reuters) - Annual inflation will continue to rise due to the base effect, the Russian central bank said on Friday, adding that tightening of monetary conditions already in place will continue to limit pro-inflationary risks.
On Friday, the central bank decided to cut its key rate by 300 basis points to 17% from April 11.

Hops are an essential flavouring ingredient and Russian-owned brewers import 98% of the 7,000–7,500 tonnes they use every year, mainly from Germany, the Czech Republic and the United States. 
Russia's domestic brewers could also face higher demand as European rivals Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) and Heineken (OTC:HEINY) have announced plans to exit the Russian market.
Most Russian-owned firms had enough hops to last them a few months, but would run into serious problems in summer if supplies were disrupted, the Russian Union of Brewers said in a letter seen by Kommersant.
The union asked the government to support the establishment of local production, although the process is likely to take some time.

The Association of Russian Hops Producers estimates that it would need more than 500 million roubles ($6.4 million) in annual state subsidies for 3-5 years to increase production to 1,000 tonnes by 2030, the newspaper said.

Two central banks in countries at opposite ends of the Pacific Ocean meet on Wednesday and could deliver the first half-point interest rate rises in any developed nation this cycle.
The U.S. Fed, expected to follow suit in May, gets March inflation data, while the ECB on Thursday will face pressure from its hawkish factions to start tightening policy. 
And Europe has woken to the risk of a French election upset.
Here's your week ahead in markets from Tom Westbrook in Singapore, Ira Iosebashvili and David Henry in New York; Sujata Rao and Dhara Ranasinghe in London.
1/MADAME LA PRESIDENTE? 
Far-right French politician Marine Le Pen, who sowed panic in the run up to 2017 presidential elections, is enjoying a resurgence in the opinion polls and markets are running scared.
With the first round of voting in presidential elections scheduled for Sunday, Le Pen is closing the gap on incumbent Emmanuel Macron.
Macron is still expected to win the presidency, but the possibility of an upset has sunk in. A Le Pen win would hamper European cohesion, while her big-spending, tax-cutting agenda would blow out France's spending bill.
The premium investors demand to hold French debt versus Germany has risen, while shares in companies targeted by Le Pen for nationalisation have fallen. 
Unlike in 2017, Le Pen does not advocate ditching the euro. But a strong showing on Sunday will herald market turbulence before the April 24 decider -- and possibly after.

2/HAWKS OVER FRANKFURT
With euro area inflation running at 7.5%, the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday will see the hawks out in force. 
They have become increasingly vocal, while markets are now gunning for a July rate rise, having ramped up their bets since the March meeting. 
ECB chief economist Philip Lane warns against reacting to short-term, energy-driven price surges. And the Ukraine war is taking a toll on the economy and consumer confidence.
The ECB knows well the price of making a policy mistake. It has raised rates in the past, only to make a speedy U-turn. Yet inflation shows no signs of peaking, let alone returning to the 2% target. The hawks' clamour may get louder.

3/BIG GUNS, BIGGER RATE HIKES
    Canada and New Zealand appear poised for their biggest interest rate hikes in 20 years, underscoring the worldwide scramble to contain inflation.  
    Both banks meet on Wednesday. Swaps price a 90%-plus chance of a 50 basis-point hike from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and a better-than-80% likelihood of the Bank of Canada does the same. 
With Canadian inflation seen above target until 2024, another 50 bps move may come in June. New Zealand delivered a 25 bps hike in February -- its third -- and flagged the possibility of bigger rises ahead. 
These would be the most drastic G10 hikes this cycle. Until May, when the Federal Reserve is tipped to lift rates 50 bps.

4/PRICE WAR
Minutes from the Fed's March policy meeting showed meatier rate hikes and an aggressive balance sheet runoff are likely in coming months as the central bank battles inflation. .
All that puts a spotlight on Wednesday's inflation data. February's 7.9% print was the largest annual increase in 40 years. In March, consumer prices grew 8.3% year-on-year, economists polled by Reuters predict, as the Ukraine-Russia war sent commodity prices spiralling higher. 
And as Americans dig deeper for rent, gasoline and food, wage gains are eroding -- inflation adjusted average hourly earnings fell 2.6% year-on-year in February. A chunky inflation print will bolster the case for more dramatic policy tightening.

5/BANKS TO THE TEST
As rising bond yields, labour shortages and sky-high commodity prices buffet stock markets, first-quarter U.S. earnings will give investors a chance to gauge balance sheet resilience, cost pressures on companies and share buyback plans.
Overall, S&P 500 earnings growth is expected at 6.8% in the Jan-March quarter, versus the 53% bounceback seen a year ago from COVID-time doldrums, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
Big banks kick off the season with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reporting on Wednesday, followed a day later by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). 
Bank shares have fared badly this year, with 11% losses, versus the S&P 500's 6% 
The six biggest lenders are projected to show a 35% decline in net income versus a year earlier. Investment bank revenues may have declined, especially after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while some banks must make provisions for Russia-linked losses.

Finally, watch whether banks may curb share buybacks after seeing excess capital dented by Q1 losses on their bond holdings. [L2N2W31XD]

182,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 03:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Tommy Wilkes. 
Barring a last-minute rebound, global stock markets will end this week lower -- for European stocks that's the first weekly drop in four -- with investors getting nervous about the speed at which central banks will tackle inflation.
While government bond yields have been marching higher throughout March and April, stocks have been shrugging off tightening fears and rising rapidly. 
The tone of the Federal Reserve meeting minutes this week, in which 50 basis point hikes and a big $95 billion a month shrinkage in the balance sheet appear likely, seemed to shake investors out of their calm state of mind.
The European Central Bank followed with a more aggressive tone than expected in their own minutes.
This week's rise in government bond yields -- up more than 20 basis points for 10-year U.S. Treasuries -- was punchy but in line with the recent dramatic price action. 
But stocks dropped as investors focused on the likelihood that central banks will be hiking aggressively to tame inflation just as the war in Ukraine knocks global economic confidence. Warning signals for a potential recession in the euro zone and even the United States are flashing red.
Overnight there was some respite with Wall Street making a late recovery, and European markets have opened slightly higher.
The other big story for markets in the euro zone this week is Sunday's first-round French election, where incumbent President Emmanuel Macron looks set for the fight of his life.
The tight French presidential race is adding to nerves and has sparked a selloff in French government bonds this week.
It has been a quiet week for corporate news with little in the way of earnings.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan's rare reappointment of a veteran technocrat behind the country's massive monetary stimulus positions the bank for an eventual exit from governor Haruhiko Kuroda's radical policies when his term ends next year.
Having spent most of his career at the BOJ's elite monetary affairs department, Shinichi Uchida, 59, was instrumental in drafting Kuroda's ""bazooka"" asset-buying programme in 2013 and negative interest policy in 2016.
While those policies create an image of him being a proponent of heavy monetary stimulus, Uchida also led the BOJ's drive to slow its huge bond buying by introducing yield curve control in 2016 - a policy that caps long-term interest rates at zero but also relieved the central bank from buying bonds at a set pace.
As its balance sheet became bloated and the financial sector's pain from prolonged easing became more apparent, Uchida was instrumental in crafting steps to slow the BOJ's purchases of risky assets and ease the strain on banks from low rates.
The reappointment for another four-year term as the BOJ's executive director, announced this month, will have Uchida, who joined the bank in 1986, oversee monetary policy design well beyond the end of Kuroda's term in April next year.
Uchida's technical expertise and deep experience mean the dismantling of YCC, whenever it happens, will go smoothly, while his bi-partisan nature mean he will be a help, not a hindrance, to the rollback of Kuroda's stimulus, say three sources familiar with the matter.
""Because he's created this complex framework, he's probably the best person to roll it back,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities and a veteran BOJ watcher.
""That's his strength, as well as his ability to quickly change tack on policy when he sees fit.""
The BOJ has six executive directors that assist the board in making decisions on key matters. The roles are highly sought after and offered to only a handful of top BOJ staff.
Uchida's reappointment is unusual - historically, such positions last only a single four-year term, after which the officials retire from the BOJ for private sector jobs.
NEITHER HAWK NOR DOVE
Having spent most of his career at the monetary affairs department, Uchida made his mark with a knack for designing complex policy frameworks and his ability to navigate BOJ leadership transitions.
People who know him say Uchida is sharp-minded and worked well under both the dovish Kuroda and his predecessor Masaaki Shirakawa, who was wary of ramping up stimulus too much.
""He's a genius in crafting sophisticated policy ideas,"" one of people said. ""It's hard to brand him as a hawk or dove.""
That means Uchida is well placed to craft plans to either prolong the lifespan of YCC, or gradually phase it out.
To be sure, the BOJ is in no rush to withdraw stimulus as it focuses on underpinning a fragile economic recovery, rather than fret about the prospect of too-high inflation.
But some in the BOJ are wary of Japan becoming increasingly isolated in a global shift in central banking towards tighter monetary policy.
While Japan's comparably subdued inflation allows the BOJ to keep rates low for longer than its counterparts, there is near consensus within the bank its next move will be to dial back - not ramp up - stimulus, the sources say.
Untangling YCC, a complex patchwork of measures to keep rates low while addressing the side-effects of prolonged easing without upending markets, is no easy task.

The BOJ traditionally spends years brainstorming scenarios on its next possible move, a process in which Uchida will likely be deeply involved, the sources say.
""If there's even a slim chance of a policy tweak in the long run, the BOJ needs to be ready,"" a second source said. ""Uchida will certainly play a key role in the process.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank will opt for a modest 25 basis point interest rate rise on April 13, but is set to raise by slightly more this year as a whole than previously thought to head off rapidly-rising inflation, a Reuters poll of economists found.
The survey puts the RBNZ, which has already raised rates by a quarter point at each of its past three policy meetings, in a slightly more dovish mode than the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is set to lift borrowing costs by a half point this month.
All but six of 21 economists polled expected the RBNZ to raise the official cash rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 1.25% at its Wednesday meeting, taking it above where it was before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
But more than a quarter of respondents, or six of 21, forecast a bigger half-point increase to 1.50%.
Pervasive supply chain disruptions and a tight labour market had already pushed up inflation to a three-decade high of 5.9% in the fourth quarter, almost double the top of the central bank's 1-3% target range.
Along with runaway house prices, there are also growing concerns Russia's war in Ukraine will push up commodity prices, including food, even faster.
""At this stage, it's a case of pick your poison,"" said Sharon Zollner, chief economist at ANZ who forecast a 50 basis point hike on Wednesday. ""Yes, aggressive hikes now raise the odds of a hard landing for the economy in the near term, but going too slowly would raise the risks of an even harder landing further down the track. 
""The RBNZ has a big job to do to rein in runaway inflation, and the sooner they rip into it, the lower the economic cost is likely to be,"" Zollner added.
FINE LINE 
But Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics economist Illiana Jain, who like the majority of respondents expects a 25 basis point move, said: ""The RBNZ will need to toe a fine line between controlling decades-high inflation and not stifling economic growth.""
Still, economists brought forward their rate hike expectations for the fourth Reuters poll in a row, and a majority, 12 of 21, now expect the OCR to reach 2.50% or higher by the end of this year. 
That is still below where it was in 2014 after the RBNZ last delivered four consecutive quarter-point rate hikes.
More than half of respondents in the latest poll who had a view on rates as far as the end of next year, 9 of 15, forecast the OCR to climb to 2.75% or higher by then.
""Inflation is running at its hottest in a generation, and inflation expectations have become unanchored by the lack of urgency by the RBNZ and a belief that higher inflation is settling in,"" said Brad Olsen, senior economist at Infometrics.
Olsen added the current policy setting is still stimulating the economy and ""the OCR must rise, faster and harder ... to realign expectations and stop pouring more fuel on an already-accelerating inferno.""
The poll also showed inflation would remain well above the RBNZ's target range of 1-3% until the second quarter of 2023. It was forecast to average 6.2% this year and slip to 2.8% in 2023, a sharp upgrade from 3.3% and 2.1% predicted in January.

New Zealand's economy, which returned to growth in the final quarter of 2021 on the back of increased consumer and government spending as pandemic restrictions were lifted, was expected to grow 3.1% this year and 2.7% next.

LONDON (Reuters) - Pretending it did not happen probably does not help much.
Given its track record in preceding the last four recession since 1990, the brief inversion of the U.S. bond yield curve between two and 10 years has unsurprisingly sounded alarms about another pending recession over the next 18 months.
In broad brush terms, these inversions reflect markets' belief that the Federal Reserve will have to move to 'restrictive' policies - with interest rate above long-term neutral estimates embedded in 10 year rates - in order to slow credit and the economy and squeeze out inflation. 
And they nod to the fact that most economic cycles don't just end, they are typically killed by the Fed. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), for one, now sees the U.S. economy recording two consecutive quarters of contraction in the second half of next year as the Fed races to unwind pandemic supports and tightens policy to rein in the highest inflation rate in 40 years. 
But as the spread between the two key short and long-term borrowing rates troughed about -7 basis points on April 1, many have dismissed the signal as something of a fools day joke.
The Fed itself claims it's a false flag and with less predictive power than shorter-term forward yield spreads that headed in the opposite direction.
Others blame massive Fed bond buying for snuffing out the true signal in long rates and that made it 'different this time'. Some investors just said they watch other healthier measures of the curve such as the spread between 3 months and 10 years, which is still positive to the tune of almost 2 percentage points.
And lo and behold, this week the 2-10 year curve reverted back positive and steepened to more than 10 basis points just as the Fed's hawkish rhetoric turned squarely to cutting its $9 trillion balance sheet - allowing bills and bonds to roll off as they mature and flagging possible outright sales ahead.
So a flash in the pan?
Maybe. But the history of the last four inversions of the 2-10 curve means a sudden re-steepening doesn't mean the real economy dodges the bullet - even though speculative traders continue to bet more steepening is ahead.
Before the recession actually hit in the middle of 1990, the 2-10 curve had already turned back positive - moving almost 50 bps higher from the most negative point of the inversion in April 1989. 
Similarly, before recession hit in mid-2001, the 2-10 curve had already steepened by almost a full percentage point from the deepest inversion of -46bp in April 2000. And yet again, before the economic contraction around the banking crash of 2008.
People argue the toss about the faintest sliver of inversion that presaged 2020's shock. But most agree that even an all-seeing bond market couldn't have predicted the pandemic and so the jury's out on whether contraction would have ensued anyway.
All that likely happened in all these cases is the Fed saw the downturn coming and took its foot off the brake.
Graphic: YIELD CURVE BALL?- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jnpwekzzepw/One.PNG
Graphic: US Fed's 'Term Premium' still negative- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xmvjoqxxxpr/Three.PNG
The big question now is whether the much-maligned 2-10 year curve is just re-adjusting to mirror what appears to be rosier signals from still floored short rates just as the long end of the curve is to be freed from Fed intervention.
The Fed this week blared out its intention to start slashing the balance sheet this year alongside planned steep rate rises, with the minutes of last month's meeting flagging a cut of almost $1.2 trillion over the next year or so.
And that seems to have helped steepen the curve a bit as long rate zoomed higher.
But it did nothing to lift the still-negative 'term premium' that's supposedly depressed by Fed distortions at the long end. All this week's movement coming 'real' or inflation-adjusted Treasury yields more reflective of Fed policy rate projections themselves.
What's more, the $1.2 trillion cut flagged over the next year is likely mostly in short-term bills and bonds. It will only bring the total balance sheet back to where it was in April of last year and would be still shy of what some Fed officials flagged earlier in the year as 'pure excess liquidity' of some $1.5 trillion.
Daily Fed money market drainage, via reverse repurchase tenders, were still as high as $1.7 trillion this week and suggest estimates of the excess have gotten bigger if anything.
But if it takes 12 months just to clip $1.2 trillion off the balance sheet, we're already at the cusp of when Deutsche Bank sees recession hitting.
All that questions just how much the Fed can realistically tighten before bowling over markets and the economy.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) upped the ante on that this week by showing how its quantitative analysis of the combined impact of both Fed policy rate rises and ebbing bond purchases - modelled as a so-called 'shadow Fed funds rate' - meant the peak in Fed rates could be less than half the 3.5% markets currently expect.
Work by SG analyst Solomon Tadesse, flagged by strategist Albert Edwards, reckoned the near doubling of the Fed's balance sheet since 2019 mean their modeled shadow Fed rate was effectively -5% at its trough -- and still -2.5% even after the first Fed hike last month.
""But with the pace of QT likely accelerated, the actual FFR will struggle to get to 1% before the Fed needs to halt the tightening cycle. That is shocking,"" Edwards wrote.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lankan leaders from garments, tea and other industries said on Friday the country's goods and services exports could plunge 20% to 30% this year due to high freight charges and power cuts, potentially worsening an economic crisis.
Various industry associations addressed a news conference to urge the government to quickly seek financial help from the International Monetary Fund.

187,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 01:09AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank will look past threats to economic growth from the war in Ukraine, ending asset purchases in the summer and setting the stage for a first interest-rate increase in more than a decade in December, according to a survey of economists. 
With Russia’s invasion fanning inflation that’s already almost four times the 2% target, the ECB is expected to conclude net bond-buying in July, the poll showed. The deposit rate, currently -0.5%, is seen reaching zero in March -- nearly nine years after it first turned negative.
It’s a timeline envisaged too by the world’s biggest banks: Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) both predict liftoff in December and gradual rate increases after that. Markets see a more aggressive route, betting on rates already being at zero by year-end.
The quicker policy-normalization path signaled by ECB President Christine Lagarde at the start of the year hasn’t shifted much. But the economic backdrop has. Russia’s attack has raised the specter of a euro-area recession as governments mull an energy embargo that would severely hit factories and further stoke record price growth.
Economists list the conflict and inflation as the two biggest dangers to the outlook, handing the ECB a dilemma: Action to tame prices risks choking what remains of the pandemic rebound; keeping stimulus, though, could ignite the kind of inflation spiral officials are desperate to avoid.
“The war in Ukraine has definitely brought into question the central bank’s accelerated stimulus exit,” said Claus Vistesen, chief euro-zone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “But it’s also, in a way, added to it by lifting the near-term inflation outlook.”
No policy changes are expected at next week’s meeting. The format of the news conference that follows it is yet to be decided after Lagarde tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday.
Recent remarks by officials suggest most, if not all, are on board with ending asset purchases in the summer and raising rates by year-end. But after disagreeing in March on their response to the war, differences persist over when and how quickly borrowing costs should climb.
Bundesbank chief Joachim Nagel and his Dutch counterpart, Klaas Knot, can envisage a move as soon as September. Their Belgian, Slovene and Austrian colleagues want two hikes this year.
Greece’s Yannis Stournaras, however, has urged extreme caution in using the “interest-rate weapon,” with Italy’s Ignazio Visco warning of a severely worsened outlook, and Chief Economist Philip Lane saying the ECB should be prepared to shift policy in either direction.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“The hawkish contingent at the ECB doesn’t seem to have had its views swayed by the war in Ukraine and currently holds the upper hand [...] Our view is that the first hike will be in December, although the risks are skewed toward an earlier move.”
--David Powell, senior euro-area economist. Click here for the full report
Inflation of 7.5% that’s set to accelerate further before peaking mid-year has analysts fretting that the economy will fare worse than outlined in the ECB’s “severe” scenario. Some wonder about the odds of more aggressive tightening. 
ING’s global head of macro Carsten Brzeski, whose base case is for a first 25 basis-point hike in September, says a lengthier spell of elevated price growth could “scare the ECB so much” that it raises rates by twice that amount.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has also flagged the possibility of half-point moves.
Whatever path is eventually chosen, there’ll be “no strong pushback on market expectations” next week, according to HSBC Securities European economist Fabio Balboni, who says a hawkish narrative may help the ECB lower the risk of second-round effects by tempering wage demands.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is ramping up sanctions against Russia to deprive Moscow's ""war machine"" of money and components needed to sustain its invasion of Ukraine, but curbing a main source of funding, Russian energy exports, will take time, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told Reuters on Thursday.
The United States and its allies have ""a lot more that we can and we will do"" to punish Moscow if Russia fails to halt its invasion, Adeyemo told Reuters in an interview. 
Ukrainian leaders called on Thursday for the democratic world to stop buying Russian oil and gas, and cut Russian banks entirely from the international financial system.
After an initial drive to freeze Russian assets, Washington and its allies announced incremental steps this week as they approach the limit of sanctions to punish Russia without also causing economic pain at home.
A new investment ban announced on Wednesday by President Joe Biden forbids Americans from investing in Russian firms' equity and debt and investment funds, cutting off Russia's defense industry and other sectors from the world's biggest source of investment capital, Adeyemo said. 
""What this means is that Russia will be deprived of the capital it needs to build up its economy, but also to invest in its war machine,"" Adeyemo said. 
Asked whether it would prohibit companies already in Russia from further funding those operations, he said Treasury was consulting with the private sector.
Kremlin officials, who have described their actions in Ukraine as a ""special military operation"" have insisted that Western sanctions will not have any effect on their goals and will solidify Russian support
Adeyemo said the United States and its European allies will target Russian military supply chains to deny access to key components - ""things that are important to building their tanks, to supplying missiles and making sure that they have fewer resources"" to fight the war in Ukraine but also to project power in the future.
""I think the impact will be immediate in the same way the impact on the economy has been immediate"" from prior sanctions, Adeyemo said. Russia's economy is headed for a 10% contraction this year and inflation is approaching 20%, U.S. officials estimate.
The Treasury later on Thursday put Russian diamond miner Alrosa on its sanctions blacklist https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0707, while the U.S. State Department did the same for United Shipbuilding Corp, a state firm building naval ships and submarines and its subsidiaries and board members.
White House Economic Council director Brian Deese said on Wednesday that the Biden administration also would ban transactions with United Aircraft Corp, the maker of Sukhoi and MiG fighter jets -- planes that are also flown by U.S. allies including some NATO members. 
Adeyemo said Russia's defense sector since 2014 has set up front companies to acquire critical supplies and materials to build up Moscow's military. A number of these firms were targeted by sanctions https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0677 last month.
ROUBLE SUPPORT DRAINS WAR FUNDS 
Financial sanctions have forced Russia to spend more of its hard-currency energy revenues to defend its rouble currency, Adeyemo said, eating into funds available for the war effort.
After losing 45% of its value against the dollar in the first two weeks of the Ukraine invasion, the Russian rouble has risen to just below its pre-war level, thanks to capital controls by Moscow and distortion by the Russian central bank, U.S. officials say. 
""What that means is that Russia has less money and the president is forced to make choices between propping up the economy and investing in the war in Ukraine,"" he said. Adeyemo said his meetings last week with European allies in London, Brussels, Paris and Berlin helped focused on next steps and helped to accelerate the sanctions announced on Wednesday.

Adeyemo said he was encouraged by ""strong statements"" from European countries about reducing their dependence on Russian energy but said the continent was in a different position from the United States, the world's top oil producer.
""Because of our ability to produce energy at home, we were able to ban the Russian import of oil to America rather quickly,"" he said. ""It's going to take them more time but what they're doing is they're reducing their dependence over time.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Congress voted to impose further economic pain on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, passing one measure to remove its ""most favored nation"" trade status and another to ban oil imports.
The Senate voted 100-0 in favor of the measure removing Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status for both Russia and its close ally Belarus. Shortly afterward, it backed the energy measure, also by a 100-0 tally.
Senate approval sent the legislation to the House of Representatives, which quickly passed the trade measure by 420 to 3, and the energy legislation by 413 to 9. 
President Joe Biden supports the measures and will sign them into law, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.
The trade bill clears the way for Biden's administration to raise tariffs on imports from Russia and Belarus. The energy measure puts into law Biden's previous executive order banning imports of Russian oil, natural gas and coal.
""This package is about bringing every tool of economic pressure to bear on (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and his oligarch cronies. Putin’s Russia does not deserve to be a part of the economic order that has existed since the end of World War Two,"" Senator Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement.
The House passed both bills earlier this year, but they stalled in the Senate as Republicans and Democrats argued over when to vote on the energy measure and wording of a provision in the trade bill reauthorizing the Magnitsky Act, which allows sanctions over human rights violations.
U.S. law mandates that Congress must approve the change in Russia and Belarus' trade status. 

Under a compromise forged late on Wednesday senators agreed to consider both the trade measure and the energy bill. The House had to approve amendments to both measures because of technical changes made in the Senate.

MEXICO CITY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Inter-American Development Bank directors have met to discuss accusations in an anonymous email that the bank's president, Mauricio Claver-Carone, carried out an intimate relationship with a staffer, three sources said.
One of the sources, a person at the IDB with direct knowledge of the matter, said the directors had debated the possibility of hiring an outside firm to investigate the allegations and asking Claver-Carone to temporarily step aside.
The two other sources confirmed that the bank's 14 directors, its general counsel and its deputy secretary met to discuss the allegations and how to proceed in a two-and-a-half-hour virtual meeting on Tuesday.
The directors met again on Thursday to draft a resolution to hire an external firm to investigate the allegations, the bank source said. The directors decided not to propose removing Claver-Carone from his duties, the person at the IDB with direct knowledge said. 
Reuters was unable to confirm the claims about the alleged relationship, which, if verified, would appear to be against the bank's rules.
The IDB did not comment when asked about both meetings and the allegations. 
Claver-Carone, a former White House official nominated to the IDB role by President Donald Trump, did not respond to repeated emails or calls seeking comment.
Before coming to the IDB in 2020, Claver-Carone served under Trump as senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs at the National Security Council.
The IDB is a development bank that, while far smaller than the International Monetary Fund or World Bank, is a key player in Latin America. It was responsible for $23.4 billion in financing and other financial commitments to Latin America and the Caribbean in 2021, according to bank figures. 
An anonymous email sent to the board of directors and the bank's ethics officer a week ago accused Claver-Carone of carrying out a relationship with a senior strategist who reported to him, according to the bank source with direct knowledge of the meeting. Reuters has not seen the email. 
The email also accused Claver-Carone and the staffer of misusing IDB funds, one source said, without giving more detail.
The IDB's ethics code on its website states: ""You cannot participate in any employment-related decisions about someone with whom you have an intimate relationship."" 
The allegations surfaced just weeks after the bank's annual meeting and just as Claver-Carone is seeking to push through a capital increase for IDB Invest, the bank's private-sector arm.
Raising capital would require backing from the United States, the bank's biggest shareholder, and its other members at a time when resources are tight due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and rising climate shocks. Leading Democrats opposed Claver-Carone's nomination for the IDB role by Trump, a Republican.
The U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment when asked about the IDB meeting.
The resolution must be sent to the IDB's board of governors, most of whom are finance ministers of member countries, to allow the directors to launch an investigation, according to the bank source with knowledge of the meeting.
The results would be shared with the governors when it is completed, the bank source said.

Claver-Carone, a hard-line Cuba hawk, faced a strong backlash ahead of his election to the IDB presidency in 2020 by some member states, including Argentina and Mexico, that bristled at breaking the bank's tradition since 1959 of having a president from a Latin American country. 
Claver-Carone dismissed the push-back https://www.reuters.com/article/us-latam-usa-bank-idUSKBN24Z1DH at the time, saying he had ""overwhelming"" support, citing public backing from 15 countries and six more privately.

The Andean country's interest rate has climbed steadily since the middle of last year when it was at a floor of 0.25% as the world's no. 2 copper producer has rebounded from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and inflation has started to bite.
Peru's 12-month inflation rate stood at 6.82% in March, the highest in a quarter of a century, pushed up by higher food and fuel prices as well as a weakening sol currency versus the U.S. dollar. The central bank's inflation target is from 1% to 3%.
The government earlier on Thursday ordered its armed forces to supervise the country's highways for the next month, amid crippling protests nationwide over rising food and fuel prices.

The South American country has been beset by road blockades for over a week as anger has flared over rising costs, which have spiked since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

SAN LUIS POTOSI, Mexico (Reuters) -A top U.S. labor official commended Mexico for progress in implementing a labor reform that is key to a new trade deal, but flagged a ""tremendous"" amount of work ahead and the need for financing and staffing to implement the law. 
The reform underpins the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that took effect two years ago. The law is meant to resolve labor disputes more swiftly and to help Mexican workers achieve better pay after years of stagnant salaries.
""The amount of work that needs to be done is tremendous,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of Labor Julie Su told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday in the central city of San Luis Potosi, one of Mexico's top automaking hubs.
On her first international trip in her role, Su met with workers, business leaders and local government officials.
""There's a broad recognition that this is going to require resources to do right,"" she said.
The labor reform was signed into law in 2019. All of Mexico's 31 states as well as the federal capital Mexico City were scheduled to implement changes to their labor justice systems by May 2022.
However, Mexico's Labor Ministry requested a five-month extension for the last dozen states due to budget and scheduling limitations.
Still, Su said Mexican officials had made ""good progress,"" citing the creation of a federal agency meant to process worker disputes quickly and to oversee votes to ratify union contracts.
She also noted that officials at both the local and federal levels had ramped up hiring and training, and planned to do more. 
""We are ... watching to see that the rest of the commitments also come through,"" she said.
Su also called on U.S. companies to model good behavior in Mexico. General Motors (NYSE:GM) faced scrutiny under USMCA mechanisms last year for worker rights violations, as did U.S. company Cardone over allegations of abuses at its auto parts plant Tridonex.
Both companies said they were committed to respecting worker rights.
""We hope there will be leadership also from American companies to support the USMCA commitments and to help create a culture in which there is broader recognition that what's good for workers is good for business,"" Su said. 
Several workers from the San Luis Potosi plant of industrial giant 3M Co, in a meeting with Su, asked her team to keep monitoring U.S. companies in Mexico, especially as a group of 3M workers begin the task of forming an independent union.

""We recognize the importance of keeping an eye on making sure the promises in the laws, the promises in the USMCA ... are actually realized,"" Su replied. 
3M said it is committed to providing a safe work environment with competitive salaries and respects the right of workers to organize.

Macro hedge funds, which bet on macroeconomics trends, rose 7.7% in the quarter, according to a macro fund index, helped by skyrocketing commodities prices, rising interest rates and inflation. 
""The combination of these two powerful market dynamics of inflation/interest rates and historic geopolitical risk has contributed to massive dislocations across commodity, equity, and fixed income markets and unprecedented macro and geopolitical uncertainty, with managers navigating tremendous and fluid volatility,"" said Kenneth J.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's Liberals put red-hot real estate markets squarely in their sights on Thursday, laying out a budget geared at boosting housing affordability amid soaring inflation, while promising modest new spending to encourage medium-term growth.
The 2022 budget set out C$9.5 billion ($7.5 billion) over five years in net new spending on housing initiatives and promised to legally ban foreign investors from buying Canadian homes for two years, though it gave no timeline for that legislation.
It also pledged to target domestic housing speculators with new taxes, double new-home construction over the next decade and boost tax credits for first-time buyers. Most measures were outlined in the Liberal's re-election campaign last year.
""Our economy is built by people, and people need homes in which to live,"" Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said as she presented the budget to lawmakers. 
""We will prevent foreign investors from parking their money in Canada by buying up homes,"" she continued.
But Freeland later added there was no single ""silver bullet"" to solve Canada's housing crisis. (Graphic: Canada fiscal projections in Budget 2022 - https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-BUDGET/PROJECTIONS/mopanbzggva/chart.png) 
The budget also hiked corporate taxes for the country's most profitable banks and insurers to 16.5% from 15% on all taxable income over C$100 million, less than the 3% rise pledged in last year's election campaign. That, along with a one-time recovery dividend, will boost revenues by C$6.1 billion over the five-year budget time frame.
All told, the budget included a net C$29 billion in new spending over five years, as the waning COVID-19 pandemic allowed the government to ease off on emergency stimulus. 
While that was less spending than some feared, economists said it would not help ease inflationary pressures.
""At the end of the day, we still are adding stimulus to the economy at a time when the Bank of Canada is actively trying to cool down inflation,"" said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Economics.
""I think it just reinforces what we're already expecting, which is pretty aggressive near-term tightening from the Bank of Canada,"" he added.
Inflation hit 5.7% in February and is expected to go higher before easing off later this year as supply chain bottlenecks unwind and the central bank increases interest rates.
The Bank of Canada is widely expected to make a rare 50-basis-point interest rate hike next week after raising its policy rate to 0.5% in March.
""This budget had one job - reverse the taxes and deficits that have ballooned inflation to a 30-year high,"" said Pierre Poilievre, a frontrunner to lead the opposition Conservatives. ""When your house is on fire, you don't douse it in gasoline.""
The budget bill should pass in parliament after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last month struck a support deal with the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) to keep his minority government in power until 2025. 
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
Fast rising home prices - up 50.6% in two years - have become a political liability for politicians, as Canadians of all stripes struggle to find an affordable place to live.
While foreigners represent a small overall segment of home buyers in Canada, they can have an outsized impact on price escalation and are an easy target for politicians, experts say.
Experts also questioned plans to double the pace of homebuilding over the next decade, noting that most supply measures would depend on other levels of government playing ball.
""I'm not sure the federal government has any real levers here to influence supply,"" said Robert Asselin, senior vice-president for policy at the Business Council of Canada, adding the whole housing strategy was ""a bit gimmicky.""
The budget offered a substantial incentive to companies investing in carbon-capture technologies and set aside as much as C$3.8 billion over eight years to accelerate critical mineral exploration.
Military spending will see a C$8 billion boost over five years.
The budget also outlined C$5.3 billion over five years on a national dental care program for lower-income families, a key NDP demand for propping up the Trudeau government.

The budget deficit for the current fiscal year is nearly 10% lower than forecast in a December fiscal update, mostly due to higher revenues. The debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to be 45.1% this fiscal year and to decline over the budget's timeframe.

(Reuters) - President Joe Biden's nominees to the Federal Reserve moved a step closer to confirmation Thursday after U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer entered procedural motions for two of them, setting up for a potential vote after lawmakers return from Easter Break on April 25. 
The filing of the motions on Michigan State University's Lisa Cook, nominated to fill a vacant seat on the Board, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard, nominated to be the Fed's vice chair, limits the time for floor debate and starts the clock toward a confirmation vote. 
A final vote on all four Fed nominees could take place as soon as late April, just days before the Fed is expected to deliver a large interest rate increase and begin shrinking its massive bond holdings in a double-barreled effort to fight decades-high inflation.
Both Jerome Powell, who has been nominated for a second terms as Fed Chair, and Davidson College dean of faculty Philip Jefferson, nominated to a vacant seat on the Board, have drawn bipartisan support and their confirmations are expected to sail through the Senate, split evenly between Republicans and Democrats.
Brainard and Cook, however, drew significant Republican opposition at the Senate Banking panel, with all Republicans voting against Cook and eight of 12 voting against Brainard. Cook's nomination was later brought to the full Senate through an additional parliamentary maneuver.
Still, with Vice President Kamala Harris on hand to break any potential tie, both are also expected to be ultimately confirmed. 
Cook would also be the first Black woman to serve on the seven-member panel, and Jefferson would be the fourth Black man to serve, and the first person of color since 2006.

It would mark the first time in its more than 100 years of existence that the U.S. central bank's Board of Governors would include two Black members at once. 
Biden must still make a decision on who to put forward for the board's final opening, the vice chair for supervision. His first nominee for the country's top bank oversight role - Sarah Bloom Raskin - withdrew after Republicans stymied a committee vote on her and a swing-vote Democrat announced his opposition.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -The Biden administration is not doing enough to forge a long-term alliance with Brazil, Myron Brilliant, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's head of the international affairs division, told a press conference in Sao Paulo on Thursday. 
""In my candid view, I don't think the Biden administration is doing enough to focus on this region,"" he said of the world's ninth largest economy, adding part of the reason is the U.S. domestic agenda. 
Brilliant said the lack of U.S. engagement across Latin America means ""opportunities are not developed (nor is a) long-term strategic plan in the way that we would hope.""
The absence of the U.S. has paved the way for other partners to liaise and do business with Brazil.
""What we have seen in the last decade is a significant rise of Chinese investment and engagement in the region,"" Brilliant said. ""We are also seeing Russian engagement. We would say that the U.S. has to be present.""
The U.S. is Brazil's second most important trade partner, behind China. The difference is that Brazil runs a trade surplus with the Asian country, and a deficit with the U.S.
Brazil and the U.S. compete as exporters of agriculture commodities like soy, meat and corn. 
In the first quarter of the year, Brazil ran a $3.8 billion trade deficit with the U.S. and $4.7 billion surplus with China, according to Brazilian government data. 

The U.S. accounted for about 11% of Brazil's overall exports in the period while China was almost 28%, the data showed.
""Defining trade in terms of deficit and surplus is a mistake,"" Brilliant said. ""Important for us is to have a level playing field.""

""It's time that we get off of our emergency stance -- I think it's really appropriate that we move our policy closer to a neutral position -- but I think we need to do it in a measured way,"" Bostic told a Chicago Fed virtual conference on economic mobility.
Evans said: ""I'm optimistic that we can get to neutral, look around, and find that we're not necessarily that far from where we need to go."" 
The Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a bigger-than-usual half-a-percentage point next month and begin paring its massive balance sheet as it steps up a battle against inflation now running at more than three times the Fed's 2% goal. 

Both Evans and Bostic have said they support the Fed's plans to tighten policy, and both have previously said they would be open to a 50 basis-point move if needed. 
But their voices calling for more moderation stand in contrast to those on the Fed's more hawkish wing, including St. Louis Fed President James Bullard who earlier on Thursday called for a rate-hike path this year that would require half-point hikes at the rest of the Fed's 2022 meetings.

198,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 04:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer borrowing surged in February by the most on record, reflecting outsized increases in both credit-card balances and non-revolving loans. 
Total credit jumped $41.8 billion from the prior month after a revised $8.9 billion gain in January, Federal Reserve figures showed Thursday. The increase exceeded all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. On an annualized basis, borrowing rose 11.3%. 
Revolving credit outstanding, which includes credit cards, rose $18 billion. Non-revolving credit, which includes auto and school loans, increased $23.8 billion. Both advances were among the biggest on record. On an unadjusted basis, revolving credit fell as is typical for the month, though to a lesser extent than in most years. That could indicate that consumers in February paid down less of the debt they racked up during the holiday-shopping season.

BEIRUT (Reuters) -The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Thursday it had reached a draft funding agreement with Lebanon - but that Beirut needed to enact a batch of economic reforms first before its board decided whether to approve the deal.
An IMF deal is widely seen as vital for Lebanon to begin recovery from an economic meltdown that has devastated the country since 2019, locking savers out of their deposits, sinking the currency, and causing poverty to soar, in the country's worst crisis since its 1975-90 civil war.
Thursday's staff-level agreement covers a 46-month extended fund facility, under which Lebanon has requested access to the equivalent of around $3 billion, the IMF said in a statement.
But it is dependent on Beirut enacting reforms that include steps its ruling politicians have failed to deliver since the crisis erupted, such as addressing how to allocate losses from a government-estimated $70 billion hole in the financial system. 
While Lebanese leaders hailed the preliminary agreement and said they were ready to make it a success, some analysts doubted whether politicians could deliver after more than two years of inaction.
Legislative elections are scheduled for May 15, after which a new government will need to be formed - a process that typically takes many months in Lebanon - potentially another complication to implementing the agreement.
Lebanese authorities had agreed, prior to the IMF board considering whether to approve the deal, to complete eight reform measures, the fund said.
These include a plan to address the huge losses in the financial system, which collapsed in 2019 due to massive public debts racked up by decades of corruption and waste. 
Cabinet must approve a banking restructuring strategy that ""recognizes and addresses up front the large losses in the sector, while protecting small depositors and limiting recourse to public resources"", the fund said.
Cabinet must also approve a ""fiscal and debt restructuring strategy, which is needed to restore debt sustainability"". Lebanon defaulted on its sovereign debt, including $31 billion in dollar bonds, in March 2020.
Other measures to be delivered included parliamentary approval of a reformed banking secrecy law, completion of an audit of the central bank's foreign asset position and ""initiation of an externally assisted bank-by-bank evaluation for the 14 largest banks"".
The statement set no timeline for agreeing to a programme, noting ""authorities understand the need to initiate the reforms as soon as possible."" 
'LACK OF CONFIDENCE'
President Michel Aoun and Prime Minister Najib Mikati affirmed their ""close cooperation, in collaboration with the parliament, to ensure fast implementation of the measures,"" a tweet from the presidency's account said.
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said the legislature was ready to work ""with great seriousness"" to make the programme succeed. Still, Mikati in February said agreeing to an economic recovery plan ""is a difficult process, a Kamikaze operation,"" and disagreements persist between main stakeholders, including commercial banks, the central bank and the government. 
Toufic Gaspard, a former advisor at the IMF and the Lebanese finance ministry, said even if half the reforms were implemented ""it would be music to the ears of Lebanese"".
But he added the measures would ""constitute a major source of worry for authorities because they have to implement many reforms even before submission to the IMF board. 
""This is a major political challenge, and the long list of substantial reforms to be implemented even before submission to the board rightly reflects a lack of confidence in the authorities,"" he said.
The IMF statement said the facility would also depend on enactment of economic reforms aimed at restoring financial sustainability, strengthening governance and transparency and removing impediments to job-creating growth. 
These would include unification by the central bank of exchange rates, of which there are currently several, ""for authorized current account transactions, which is critical for boosting economic activity... and will be supported by the implementation of formal capital controls.""
Parliament has repeatedly failed to pass formal capital controls. 

Alongside its financial meltdown, Lebanon has faced political paralysis and a diplomatic crisis in ties with Gulf Arab states - formerly major donors to Lebanon - over their opposition to Iran-backed Hezbollah's influence in Beirut. 
A number of Gulf states recalled their ambassadors to Beirut last year, but in a sign of a possible thaw in ties, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait Thursday evening announced their ambassadors would return.

An IMF deal is widely seen as the only way for Lebanon to begin to plot a way out of a financial and economic meltdown that is its most destabilising crisis since its 1975-90 civil war. 
Just how bad is the situation?
- Gross domestic product has plunged to an estimated $20.5 billion in 2021 from about $55 billion in 2018, the kind of contraction usually associated with wars, the World Bank says, ranking the collapse as one of the worst globally since the mid-19th century.
- The Lebanese pound has lost more than 90% of its value, driving up the cost of almost everything in a country reliant on imports, and demolishing purchasing power. A soldier's monthly wage, once the equivalent of $900, is now worth about $50. 
- Poverty rates are sky-rocketing in the population of about 6.5 million, with around 80% of people classed as poor, the U.N. agency ESCWA says. Last September, more than half of families had at least one child who skipped a meal, UNICEF has said, compared with just over a third in April 2021.
- The financial system has suffered eyewatering losses. The government estimated the overall losses at $69 billion in September. The deputy prime minister said last month the figure was expected to grow to $73 billion while the crisis is not addressed. 
- Lebanon's banks are paralysed. Savers have been frozen out of U.S. dollar accounts. Withdrawals in local currency apply exchange rates that erase up to 80% of the value. During an October visit to Beirut, U.S. official Victoria Nuland said the Lebanese people deserved to know where their money had gone.
- Reliant on imported fuel, Lebanon is facing an energy crunch. Even before the crisis, power was in short supply, including in the capital. Now households are lucky to receive more than a few hours a day. Fuel prices have soared. A ride in a shared taxi, a popular form of transport, cost 2,000 pounds before the crisis but now costs about 30,000 pounds.
- Lebanese have emigrated in the most significant exodus since the 1975-90 civil war. Believing their savings are lost, many have no plans to return. A 2021 Gallup poll found a record 63% of people surveyed wanted to leave permanently, up from 26% before the crisis. 

- Among those leaving are doctors. The World Health Organization has said most hospitals are operating at 50% capacity. It says around 40% of doctors, mostly specialists, and 30% of nurses have permanently emigrated or are working part-time abroad.
- Officials and the media talk of Lebanon becoming a ""failed state"". President Michel Aoun warned in December that the state was ""falling apart"". Lebanon's top Sunni cleric said after unrest over fuel shortages in August that the country risked complete collapse without action to prevent it.

Key goals of the plan, the president said, include creating 500,000 jobs and raising the current monthly minimum wage of 350,000 pesos ($434) to 400,000 pesos ($496) by the end of the year.
""We all know we're living through hard times and it's our duty from the government to work to alleviate those worries you have,"" Boric, a leftist who took power last month, said in a news conference. 
Citing rising prices and inflation, he said the government would freeze public transit fares for the rest of the year and subsidize fuel prices.
Boric, a former student protester, also announced that food scholarships for students would increase by 15%. That was the main demand of the first organized protest during his presidency in March.
The plan also includes subsidies for parents of young children, a one-time payment for culture workers and $300 million fund for local governments to use for infrastructure. 
Boric said the plan was aimed at helping those ""who haven't found private or state help to get ahead,"" and will offer financing for small-scale miners and 100,000 small businesses without access to banks.

Chile's central bank last month lowered its economic growth forecast for 2022 and predicted annual inflation could reach 8.2%.
""We know this recovery plan is a starting point,"" Boric said. ""Big changes aren't made overnight and for these changes to be sustainable, they have to be implemented responsibly.""

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday signaled it will likely start culling assets from its $9 trillion balance sheet at its meeting in early May and will do so at nearly twice the pace it did in its previous ""quantitative tightening"" exercise as it confronts inflation running at a four-decade high.
Minutes from the central bank's meeting last month, released Wednesday, showed policymakers were presented a range of options for reducing the size of its balance sheet. That stash of assets has roughly doubled in size during the coronavirus pandemic as the Fed used purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities to smooth market functioning and augment the effects of its interest rates cuts.
Here's a rundown of what appears to be in the cards and how it differs from the 2017-2019 ""QT"" period.
EARLIER START
The Fed appears poised to kick off this QT round just one meeting after lifting its benchmark short-term interest rate for the first time since 2018.
Last time, the launch of QT in the fall of 2017 occurred nearly two years after its first rate hike, which took place in December 2015.
This time's onset of QT is also earlier relative to where the Fed will be in the overall tightening process. If rate futures are a guide, the Fed will lift its target rate to 0.75-1.00% in May at the same time it kicks off QT. Last time, QT did not begin until rates had reached 1.00-1.25%. 
(Graphic: QT the last time around - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/QT/dwpkrqnnqvm/chart.png) 
LARGER CAPS
Fed officials ""generally agreed"" on a plan to cut about $95 billion a month from its holdings, split between $60 billion of Treasuries and $35 billion of MBS.
That is roughly double the maximum pace of $50 billion a month targeted in the 2017-2019 cycle. Back then, the split was $30 billion of Treasuries and $20 billion of MBS.
FASTER RAMP-UP
In the last cycle, it took a full year for the Fed to reach its maximum reduction rate of $50 billion a month. It started with $10 billion a month ($6 billion Treasuries/$4 billion MBS) and increased that by $10 billion a quarter until it reached its maximum rate in the fall of 2018.
This time, it will go from zero to $95 billion in the space of three months ... ""or modestly longer if market conditions warrant."" The minutes did not spell out precisely how the caps would be ""phased in,"" a detail likely to be set out at the May 3-4 Federal Open Market Committee meeting that is seen launching the process.
BIGGER BALANCE SHEET, BIGGER SHRINKAGE
When the Fed kicked off its first-ever QT undertaking, its total balance sheet was around $4.5 trillion in size. In nearly two years of QT, it managed to bring that down by about $650 billion to a bit over $3.8 trillion before it brought the program to a stop.
This time, the annualized monthly rate of reduction works out to more than $1.1 trillion a year in balance sheet roll-offs. That means it will likely surpass the total of the entire 2017-2019 QT cycle by the end of this year or early 2023. Many economists see officials targeting about $3 trillion in total balance sheet shrinkage over a three-year span.

DIFFERENT TREASURIES MIX
The Fed's Treasuries portfolio is shorter in maturity this time than in the previous QT round by about two years, according to New York Fed data. That is in part owing to the substantial purchases of T-bills, particularly early on in the crisis, to help restore market stability.
The minutes showed officials are eyeing redemptions of Treasury bills, which mature in a year or less, when the redemption of coupon securities, which are notes and bonds with maturities greater than one year, are below the cap. T-bills are highly valued by private investors and reducing the Fed's stock of them would facilitate more issuance of them by the U.S. Treasury.
In addition, officials generally don't view T-bills as a needed part of their holdings required to ensure an ample supply of reserves for the banking system under their current operating framework.
SELL THOSE PESKY MORTGAGE BONDS?

The minutes showed officials expect redemptions of MBS to run below the $35 billion a month cap. That is because U.S. mortgage interest rates have already risen substantially, which has slowed the rate of ""prepayments"" that typically occur when rates are low and homeowners are enticed to refinance their existing loans. That triggers a loan payoff and shortens the maturity of a mortgage bond. Conversely, when rates rise, fewer bonds will mature each month. 
Officials ""generally agreed,"" however, that it would be appropriate to consider outright sales of MBS ""after balance sheet run off was well underway to enable suitable progress toward a longer-run ... portfolio composed primarily of Treasury securities.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -When Nicole Flecchia contracted COVID-19 in January of 2021, the University of Rhode Island grad student figured she might be looking at a few days or weeks of symptoms.
It is now April of 2022, and the symptoms have never really gone away.
The 26-year-old is among the millions of Americans with so-called long COVID, with the damage from the virus taking a toll on their bodies and finances for months or even years.
Because as much as the virus attacks the body - in Flecchia’s case, with a dry cough, extreme fatigue, and brain fog - it can also attack your financial life.
For example, Flecchia’s student program required her to work 20 hours a week during the school year, and 40 hours a week during the summer. With long COVID, she could only work for an hour or two at a time. 
Flecchia tried to tough it out, but this past January she finally went on medical leave from her program. She is living off savings while she waits for the symptoms to recede.
Her story is far from unique. The American Academy of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation estimates that of the 79.17 million Americans who survived a bout with the coronavirus, 30% or 23.75 million are dealing with some level of post-acute COVID.
Typical symptoms include headaches, fatigue, sleep disturbance, dizziness, breathing difficulty and persistent brain fog, all of which can affect your ability to make a living.
“People are now realizing that this doesn’t just devastate you physically, it can ruin you financially,” says Diana Berrent, founder of Survivor Corps, the world’s largest COVID grassroots movement with around 200,000 members.
The Biden administration has taken note of the looming health crisis and this week said it would develop a national plan to expand research, care and disability services for Americans suffering from the debilitating condition.
DISABILITY COVERAGE
Ideally, prolonged health issues would be covered by workplace disability insurance, which provides a percentage of your earnings while your ability to work is impacted. According to the 2020 benefits report of the Society for Human Resource Management, 71% of organizations surveyed offer long-term disability coverage, and 62% provide short-term coverage.
But since long COVID is a recent phenomenon with more than 200 potential symptoms and little understanding of its underlying causes, sufferers often run up against roadblocks dealing with health insurance companies and government agencies.
And many employers do not offer disability coverage. In addition, growing numbers in the workforce operate on a freelance or short-term contract basis, without access to company benefits.
In such cases, it might be worthwhile to secure disability coverage on your own. The wisdom of that goes beyond COVID, since a quarter of Americans will experience disability at some point in their working lives, according to the Social Security Administration.
A few tips: Typically you might look for a policy that replaces around 60%-70% of your total taxable earnings, according Mark Friedlander, spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute. That could cost 1%-4% of your annual income when it comes to premiums.
The best coverage builds in cost-of-living increases and keeps pace with inflation. Usually, there are waiting periods before benefits are paid out, such as 60 or 90 days, with the first check cut 30 days after that. Look for a coverage period that lasts at least until age 65.
And keep in mind that if you are already dealing with long COVID, you will not be able to take out a new policy to cover it, since it would be considered a pre-existing condition.
There is also the potential for getting disability benefits through Social Security for those who have worked for many years and paid into that system.
However, that is a lengthy process involving both state and federal agencies, which will review the claim. But for those whose COVID symptoms are long lasting, a monthly benefit going forward could certainly help stave off financial ruin.
“I would say the earlier the better for filing, because it is taking a long time to process,” advises T.J. Geist, principal advocate with the firm Allsup, which helps sufferers file such claims. “It also helps to have a representative, since you are dealing with multiple layers of government.""
See your doctor on a regular basis, Geist advises, and make sure to get documentation of all your limitations and symptoms.

As for Nicole Flecchia, she still gets winded from ordinary activities like climbing the stairs to her apartment. But she looks forward to the day when she can pursue her oceanography studies.
“I’m trying to stay positive, because it’s really the only thing I can do,” she said. “I have to hope that I will eventually get better and be able to work again.”

204,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 01:27PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The House passed and sent to President Joe Biden for his signature legislation that would bar U.S. imports of Russian oil, gas and coal.
The 413-9 House vote followed 100-0 Senate approval earlier Thursday. Once signed by Biden, it will put into law an order he issued last month.
Congress also voted Thursday to approve legislation stripping Russia of its normal trade relation status, a move that allows the U.S. to impose large tariff increases on goods from Russia and Belarus in response to the invasion of Ukraine.
“These atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine are unthinkable,” Representative Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, said shortly before the vote. “These actions will further isolate Putin and inflict greater pressure in the Kremlin to end its reign of terror on Ukraine.”
When crude oil and all other petroleum products are included, such as unfinished fuel oil that can be used to produce gasoline and diesel, Russia accounted for about 8% of 2021 U.S. oil imports, according to the Energy Information Administration.
The effort comes amid mounting pressure on lawmakers to tighten economic pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin as the atrocities of the war in Ukraine are revealed.
“This package is about bringing every tool of economic pressure to bear on Vladimir Putin and his oligarch cronies,” said Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who authored the Senate version of the oil ban and trade legislation. “Putin’s Russia does not deserve to be a part of the economic order that has existed since the end of World War II. Ending normal trade relations hammers home that Putin has made Russia into a pariah state.”

San Francisco (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp unit Woven Planet is following the lead of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc in trying to advance self-driving technology with low-cost cameras.
Woven Planet told Reuters it is able to use cameras to collect data and effectively train its self-driving system, a ""breakthrough"" that it hopes will help drive down costs and scale up the technology. 
Gathering diverse driving data using a massive fleet of cars is critical to developing a robust self-driving car system, but it is costly and not scalable to test autonomous vehicles only with expensive sensors, it said. 
Woven Planet still uses data collected from other sensors like radars and lidars for training as well as long-term deployment.
Tesla has been betting on cameras to collect data from over 1 million vehicles on the road to develop its automated driving technology, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Waymo and other self-driving car firms added expensive sensors like lidars to a small number of vehicles.
""We need a lot of data. And it's not sufficient to just have a small amount of data that can be collected from a small fleet of very expensive autonomous vehicles,"" Michael Benisch, vice president of Engineering at Woven Planet, said in an interview with Reuters. 
""Rather, we're trying to demonstrate that we can unlock the advantage that Toyota and a large automaker would have, which is access to a huge corpus of data, but with a much lower fidelity,"" said Benisch, a former engineering director at  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT)'s self-driving division, which Toyota acquired last year. 
Woven Planet uses cameras that are 90% cheaper than sensors that it used before and can be easily installed in fleets of passenger cars. 
It said using a majority of data coming from low-cost cameras increased its system's performance to a level similar to when the system was trained exclusively on high-cost sensor data. 
He said, however, Toyota would still use multiple sensors such as lidars and radars for robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles to be deployed on the road, as this currently seemed to be the best, safest approach to developing robotaxis. 
Toyota is also partnering with Aurora in testing an autonomous ride-hailing fleet https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-aurora-test-drive-autonomous-ride-hailing-fleet-texas-2022-03-23 based on the Toyota Sienna minivans, equipped with lidars, radars, and cameras. 
""But in many, many years, it's entirely possible that camera type technology can catch up and overtake some of the more advanced sensors,"" he said.

""The question may be more about when and how long it will take to reach a level of safety and reliability. I don't believe we know that yet."" 
Tesla's CEO Elon Musk said it can achieve full autonomy with cameras this year https://www.reuters.com/article/tesla-robots-idCNL1N2U702E after missing his previous targets several times.

206,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 12:21PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -A former Goldman Sachs (N:GS) managing director has been permanently barred from the banking industry over mishandling confidential documents leaked from the New York Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank said on Thursday.
Joseph Jiampietro, the former Goldman executive, agreed to the prohibition, the Fed, which regulates Wall Street, said in a statement, ending a long-running case that reflected potential conflicts when government employees move to the private sector but continue to communicate with former employers. 
The U.S. central bank began enforcement proceedings against Jiampietro in 2016, accusing him of having asked Goldman junior banker Rohit Bansal in 2014 to obtain secrets from the New York Fed, where Bansal once worked, for use in Goldman’s client advisory work and pitches to potential clients.
Bansal and his source at the New York Fed, Jason Gross, pleaded guilty in November 2015 to theft of government property. Both were sentenced to probation and banned from the banking industry.
An administrative law judge overseeing the case concluded that Jiampietro breached duties he owed to Goldman by ignoring ""red flags"" and failing to determine the confidential nature of documents originating from the Fed. 
In 2018, Jiampietro, who denied wrongdoing, sued the Fed, accusing it of dragging its heels on his appeal of a possible lifetime industry ban.

The announcement on Thursday ends the Fed's enforcement proceedings against Jiampietro, the central bank said.
Goldman paid $86.3 million in penalties to the Fed and New York State’s Department of Financial Services in connection with the leaking. The investment bank fired Jiampietro and Bansal in 2014.

(Reuters) - The Fed is behind in its fight against inflation and needs to raise the federal funds rate another 3 percentage points by year's end, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard said on Thursday, a pace that implies half-point increases at each of the Fed's six remaining meetings this year.
""I would like to get there in the second half of this year...We have to move,"" to get ahead of inflation running at triple the Fed's 2% target, Bullard said. ""We are talking about bigger moves than we have made in a long time.""
The pace described is slightly quicker than the one Bullard offered at the March Fed meeting, which saw the federal funds rate reach 3.25% by year's end. 
Minutes of that session showed ""many"" of Bullard's colleagues prepared for ""one or more"" half-point increases at upcoming meetings.
But the path outlined by Bullard, now perhaps the most aggressive policymaker in his reaction to inflation, is beyond even what markets currently anticipate from the central bank. Trading in federal funds future contracts show investors expect the Fed to raise its policy rate to a range of between 2.5% and 2.75% by year's end, according to data compiled by the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME).
Even a ""generous"" application of standard monetary policy rules, Bullard said, showed the Fed ""behind the curve"" in fighting inflation, even after accounting for the financial ""tightening"" that already has taken place in markets based on investors' expectations the Fed will act more aggressively. 
Even though the Fed has only raised its policy rate a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of between 0.25% and 0.5%, the 2-year Treasury yield has risen from around 1.45% on March 1 to 2.45% on Thursday morning, and the interest rate on a 30-year home mortgage is approaching 5% versus recent lows below 3%.
The Fed next meets on May 3-4, and a half point increase at that session is widely expected. Inflation data to be released next week is expected to show consumer prices in March rose at a torrid pace, perhaps north of 8% or higher, amid a spike in gasoline prices due to the outbreak of war in Ukraine.
But some Fed officials have pointed to the second half of 2022 as a time to assess just how the Fed's relatively swift shift in monetary policy is affecting the economy. Along with raising the target interest rate, the Fed is likely in May to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities by up to $95 billion a month, a move that may further increase key long-term interest rates.
Some policymakers have suggested the additional tightening coming from the Fed's balance sheet decisions might allow slower or fewer increases in the federal funds rate.

Changes to the balance sheet, however, ""have already been absorbed by markets,"" Bullard said, and shouldn't influence the Fed's rate decisions.
Likewise he said that ""as it stands right now"" the war in Ukraine should not influence the Fed's inflation fight.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) -Pakistan's central bank raised its policy rate by 250 basis points to 12.25% in an emergency meeting on Thursday, the bank said in a statement, the biggest hike in years. 
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) cited a deterioration in the outlook for inflation and an increase in risks to external stability, heightened by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as domestic political uncertainty.
The hike was unscheduled as the next monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting was set for late April, but the bank had warned last month that it could meet earlier than expected to safeguard external and price stability.
""Since the last MPC meeting, the outlook for inflation has deteriorated and risks to external stability have risen,"" SBP said in a statement on Thursday.
""Futures markets suggest that global commodity prices, including oil, are likely to remain elevated for longer and the (U.S.) Federal Reserve is likely to increase interest rates more quickly than previously anticipated,"" the statement added.
Domestically, the bank said the March inflation turnout was higher than expected and political uncertainty, which has peaked with a standoff between Prime Minister Imran Khan and the opposition, had worsened matters. 
""Heightened domestic political uncertainty contributed to a 5 percent depreciation in the rupee and a sharp rise in domestic secondary market yields as well as Pakistan’s Eurobond yields and CDS spreads since the last MPC meeting,"" the bank said.
It also pointed to pressure from a sharp drop in foreign currency reserves. Reserves held by the central bank dropped by $728 million to $11.3 billion by April 1, compared with $16.2 billion on March 4. 
The bank said the decline had largely been due to debt repayments and government payments pertaining to the settlement of an arbitration award related to a mining project.
Some of the decline is expected to be reversed as creditors renew loans, the bank said, assuring that Pakistan’s external financing needs in FY22 are fully met from identified sources.
It said average inflation forecasts had been revised upwards to slightly above 11 percent in FY22. 
The SBP is in the process of taking further action to reduce pressure on inflation and the current account, including increasing rates on refinancing schemes.
""This step of SBP was also necessary as market yields of T-bills were not in line with policy rate, creating an abnormal situation,"" said Muhammad Sohail of Topline Securities.

Pakistan's government raised 645 billion Pakistani rupees ($3.43 billion) in a treasury bill auction on Wednesday, with 12-month yields at 13.3%.

Credit Suisse also projected 2023 gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 8%, up from a prior estimate of 3%.
""These are not typos! If we are accurate, these might end up being among the strongest growth prints globally for these years,"" it said in the April 6 dated report.
Venezuela's economy hit ""rock bottom"" in 2020 and the new forecast is largely based on the expectation that oil GDP will rise more than 20%, it said.
A high-level meeting between U.S. and Venezuelan officials in Caracas in early March has opened the doors to talks about a possible easing of sanctions Washington imposed on the OPEC member's oil industry since 2019.
Credit Suisse said Venezuela could make up for the shortfall of Russian oil, pointing out that the United States imported roughly 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil products from Russia in 2021, while Venezuela's oil export capacity last year was between 500,000 bpd and 700,000 bpd. 
""It seems feasible that with a loosening of sanctions, Venezuelan authorities might pump that number up,"" it said.

""Suddenly, amid oil supply concerns, some have remembered that the alleged largest oil reserves in the world are in a country that is relatively not that far away from the U.S..""
The prospect of easing sanctions has state-run oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) and some foreign companies taking steps in anticipation of higher oil exports. But export data shows PDVSA is still hobbled by years of mismanagement and lack of basic maintenance to key infrastructure for producing, upgrading, refining, storing and exporting oil.

The trade legislation, passed on a rare 100-0 vote, would put Russia and Belarus in the same category as pariah states such as North Korea and Cuba, and adds to the growing list of economic barriers erected by the U.S. and its allies to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government over the assault on Ukraine. The bill allows the U.S. to impose large tariff increases on goods from Russia and Belarus.
Under the legislation, the tariffs on iron and some steel products could be raised to 20% from 0%. Plywood could face a 50% levy and some reaction engines could have import taxes of 35%, according to a Senate Democratic aide.
“No nation whose military is committing war crimes deserves free trade status with the United States,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the floor Thursday morning.
President Joe Biden last month already banned imports of signature Russian products including oil, gas, vodka, seafood and industrial diamonds.
The trade bill was delayed in the Senate for about a week because of a hold up from Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, about the wording of an expansion of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which was embedded in the bill. Other squabbles among senators also delayed the bill. Lawmakers ultimately reached a deal after weeks of haggling.
That provision would authorize the Biden administration to impose further sanctions on Russian officials for human rights violations. Paul wanted the legislation, which is named for a Russian lawyer who died in custody after investigating tax fraud, to be more specific about the types of transgressions that would trigger sanctions. He agreed to stop blocking the bill after reaching a compromise with Senate leaders.
The House overwhelmingly passed the trade measure earlier in March, but revisions in the Senate mean the legislation will need to go back to the House for another vote. 
All House lawmakers except for eight Republicans voted to sever trade ties with Russia and Belarus, which has hosted some of the Russian troops who invaded Ukraine. 
By mid-March, a quarter of the World Trade Organization’s 164 members -- collectively representing 58% of the global gross domestic product -- were poised to stop treating Russia as a so-called most-favored-nation under WTO rules.

Having managed to service its debt in foreign currency since the beginning of what Moscow calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russia has encountered difficulties with foreign exchange payments on its Eurobonds.
On Wednesday, Russia said it had to pay roubles to holders of its dollar-denominated Eurobonds maturing in 2022 and 2042 as a foreign bank had refused to process an order to pay $649 million to holders of its sovereign debt.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States' latest round of sanctions on Russia includes two new targets: Russian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters, Katerina and Maria, who U.S. officials believe are hiding Putin's wealth. 
Putin's daughter Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova is a tech executive whose work supports the Russian government and its defense industry, according to details in the U.S. sanctions package announced on Wednesday.
His other daughter Maria Vladimirovna Vorontsova leads government-funded programs that have received billions of dollars from the Kremlin toward genetics research, and are personally overseen by Putin, the United States said. 
""We have reason to believe that Putin, and many of his cronies, and the oligarchs, hide their wealth, hide their assets, with family members that place their assets and their wealth in the U.S. financial system, and also many other parts of the world,"" a senior U.S. administration official told reporters.
""We believe that many of Putin's assets are hidden with family members, and that's why we're targeting them,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
On Thursday, the Kremlin said it was bewildered by the U.S. decision, and described the move against the daughters as part of a broader Western frenzy against Russia. 
Reuters was not able to reach Putin's daughters or their representatives.
The sanctions announced Wednesday also include the daughter and wife of Russian foreign affairs minister Sergei Lavrov. The U.S. also banned Americans from investing in Russia, and targeted Russian financial institutions and Kremlin officials, in response to what President Joe Biden condemned as Russian ""atrocities"" in Ukraine.
Russia denies intentionally attacking civilians and says images of bodies in Bucha north of Kyiv were staged to justify more sanctions against Moscow. 
Moscow says it is engaged in a ""special military operation"" designed to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and Western governments reject that as a false pretext for Russia's invasion.
The extent of Putin's wealth is a sensitive subject in Russia. The Kremlin last year denied that he was the owner of an opulent palace on the Black Sea, as alleged by opposition politician Alexei Navalny in a video that draw a huge audience on YouTube.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in February that sanctions introduced against Putin himself were pointless.
""(Putin) is quite indifferent. The sanctions contain absurd claims about some assets,"" Peskov said. ""The president has no assets other than those he has declared.""
But U.S. lawmakers believe otherwise.
""Putin and his oligarchs stow their dirty money in rule-of-law nations by purchasing mansions, mega-yachts, artwork, and other high-value assets,"" U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said a few weeks ago, while introducing legislation that offered cash rewards for information that leads to the seizure of assets held by sanctioned Russian oligarchs.
ROCK 'N ROLL DANCER 
Putin's daughters, who the U.S. believes help him hide his wealth, have never confirmed publicly the Russian leader is their father, and he has refused to answer questions about them. 
A Reuters investigation from 2015 detailed the connections and influence Katerina, an acrobatic rock ’n’ roll dancer, holds in the next generation of Moscow's elite. (For story, see: https://reut.rs/3ubo3kR)
""Katerina, 29, described herself as the spouse of Kirill Shamalov, son of Nikolai Shamalov, a longtime friend of President Putin,"" the report said. ""Shamalov senior is a shareholder in Bank Rossiya, which U.S. officials have described as the personal bank of the Russian elite.""
As husband and wife, Kirill and Katerina had corporate holdings worth about $2 billion, according to estimates provided to Reuters by financial analysts. This was in addition to other property and assets.
Putin's elder daughter Maria studied biology at St. Petersburg University and medicine at Moscow State University, according to the Reuters investigation. She is also heavily involved in genetic research work, which Putin has in the past described as a field that will ""determine the future of the whole world.""
According to Russian and Western media reports, Maria married Dutch businessman Jorrit Joost Faassen. 

She was pursuing a biomedical career specializing in the endocrine system in 2015, as a doctoral candidate at the Endocrinology Research Centre in Moscow, and is the co-author of a book about ""idiopathic stunting"" in children, the Reuters report said.
Her husband used to work for Gazprombank, a large lender with strong links to the elite around Putin, the report noted. No estimates were immediately available for their assets and holdings.

Western companies from McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Shell (LON:RDSa) have stepped back from Russia, under pressure from customers and their governments to inflict an economic price on Moscow for its actions in Ukraine.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a 'special operation' that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
Moscow city authorities have also doubled the total funds in the support programme to 1 billion roubles, they said on social media, adding 17 companies, including Russian pancake chain Teremok, requested the funds for projects in the city of 12.7 million.

Miratorg, Russia's top meat producer which also runs its own burgerhouses, has also submitted a request for funding, hoping this would enable it to open 30 or more new sites, in addtion to the 15 openings originally intended for this year, a spokeswoman told Reuters.

Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve may have to raise interest rates further than the market is currently expecting in order to bring inflation down, St Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Thursday.
Bullard, who has been out in front of his colleagues at the Fed in assessing the seriousness of the inflation surge in recent months, said in a speech that the Fed is still well ""behind the curve"" in the battle against inflation, and argued that even a ""generous"" reading of current data implies that the fed funds rate should be around 3.5%.
As U.S. inflation surged over the winter to its highest in over 40 years, interest rate futures and other derived market measures of expectations for Fed policy continued to reflect expectations that the central bank wouldn't lift the fed fund rate much above 3%. The Fed had aggressively cut the fed funds target range to just above zero in response to the pandemic, as well as revved up its quantitative easing policy again.
However, it hiked the target range for fed funds to 0.25%-0.50% in March, the first rate hike since 2019, and the minutes of that meeting - released on Wednesday - indicated that many wanted a half-point increase instead, and were only persuaded to make a smaller hike by the uncertainty to the economic outlook caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Bullard's presentation acknowledged that the Fed may not be as far ""behind the curve"" as simple monetary policy rules of thumb would suggest. He noted the discrepancy between surveys of inflation expectations and the yields on inflation-linked Treasury bonds, and also said that the credibility of the Fed as an inflation fighter had already ensured that long-term bond yields hadn't risen as far as short-term ones. 
""Credible forward guidance means market interest rates have increased substantially in advance of tangible Fed action,"" Bullard said. ""By this second definition of 'behind the curve,' the Fed is not as far behind, but it must now increase the policy rate to ratify the forward guidance previously given.""
 "
219,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 09:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said monetary policy benchmarks using “generous assumptions” suggest that the U.S. central bank may need to raise interest rates to about 3.5% to counter inflation that’s running far too high.
“One concludes that the current policy rate is too low by about 300 basis points, according to this calculation,” Bullard said Thursday in prepared remarks at the University of Missouri. That could suggest, by that measure, the Fed is “behind the curve,” he said.
The Fed raised its benchmark overnight rate by 25 basis points last month to a target range of 0.25% to 0.5% with Bullard, who favored a half-point increase, the lone dissenter.
But minutes of the March 15-16 policy meeting released Wednesday showed that “many” officials had been of the same mind and only opted for the smaller increase out of caution in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The minutes also showed that many of them also noted that one or more half-point hikes could be appropriate going forward to counter the hottest inflation in four decades.
Bullard cited a version of the Taylor Rule, a guideline developed by Stanford University’s John Taylor that uses inflation, the unemployment rate and an estimate of the neutral interest rate -- a rate neither contractionary nor expansionary -- to come up with his estimate for how high rates should go.
Markets have already incorporated Fed tightening into their pricing, with the 2-year Treasury yield trading at around 2.45%, or 1 percentage point below what might be needed, Bullard said.
“This suggests the Fed is not as far ‘behind the curve,’ although it would  still have to raise the policy rate to ratify the forward guidance,”  Bullard said.
Bullard said he expects growth of “a slower but still robust 2.8% pace in 2022,” despite a weak first quarter and impact from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He said the unemployment rate may fall below 3% this year.
“The expansion is not ‘old’ and can continue for a long time,” he said.
Turning to the yield curve, however, the St. Louis Fed chief said recent inversion of parts of it could be a warning signal for growth.
“This market-based signal has been an accurate predictor of recessions in the postwar data, and so it must be taken seriously,” he said, adding there could be a number of explanations for a depressed 10-year yield including the Fed’s large balance sheet and safe-haven demand due to the war in Ukraine.

Opening a BoE conference on sovereign capital markets research, Pill said the central bank might not want to repeat the hundreds of billions of pounds of additional bond purchases announced in March 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which were made partly to calm bond market turmoil.
""Maybe we were just lucky to confront these challenges at a time when macroeconomic and monetary considerations did not conflict with efforts to support market functioning and underpin financial stability,"" he said. 

""Now that inflation is much higher, and threatening to go higher still, that can no longer be taken for granted,"" Pill added.
""Some of the papers to be presented here ... give reason to question whether monetary policy is the appropriate tool to address these sovereign market functioning concerns.""

222,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 08:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank officials meeting last month were divided over how to respond to the economic shock-waves from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
While some sought a firm end-date for asset purchases and an opening to an interest-rate increase in the third quarter due to the worsening inflation outlook, others preferred a “wait-and-see approach” amid the exceptionally high uncertainty, according to an account of the ECB’s March 9-10 policy meeting published Thursday.
Some policy makers argued that “preserving optionality on asset purchases was not without cost, especially considering the risk of ‘falling behind the curve,’” the account showed. Others cautioned that in the new environment, “bold steps were even less justified” than in the pre-war situation and “could further dent confidence.” 
Faced with the fastest inflation since the euro was created, the ECB surprised markets last month by mapping out a speedier exit from asset purchases. The question now is how soon record-low interest rates will be raised following the end of net bond-buying, with monetary-tightening cycles already underway at other major central banks.
Some Governing Council members are pushing for two hikes by year-end. Others are more cautious while the economic implications of the war remain unclear. They meet next on April 13-14 in Frankfurt.
Risks to the inflation outlook stemming from the conflict “were seen as largely one-sided, with experience suggesting that wars tended to be inflationary,” according to the account. But there were “different views” over how persistent the recent spike in prices would be.
Economic projections presented at the time showed the euro-area economy would grow by more than 2% even in under an adverse outcome. 
“While the war would likely dent economic growth in the short term, annual growth was projected to remain positive even in the severe scenario, pointing to ‘slowflation’ rather than stagflation,” according to the account.

223,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 08:21AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -European Central Bank policymakers appeared keen to unwind stimulus at their March 10 meeting, with some pushing for even more action, as conditions for raising rates had either been met or were about to be met, the accounts of the gathering showed.
Policymakers agreed at the meeting to end bond buys some time in the third quarter but made no further commitment to roll back stimulus, even as inflation continued to soar on high energy and food prices. 
But a sizable group wanted to go even further, setting a firm end-date for the bond purchases as they have fulfilled their purpose and inflation was now at risk of overshooting the target for a prolonged period, the accounts showed on Thursday. 
""A large number of members held the view that the current high level of inflation and its persistence called for immediate further steps towards monetary policy normalisation,"" the accounts of the meeting showed.
""It was argued that, for all practical purposes, the three forward guidance conditions for an upward adjustment of the key ECB interest rates had either already been met or were very close to being met,"" the ECB added.
But caution prevailed, with policymakers arguing that the war in Ukraine created so much uncertainty that the ECB needed to keep its options open and not commit to policy too far down the road.
Policymakers nevertheless argued that ECB staff were likely to be underestimating the persistence of inflation, and that wars tend to generate inflation, even if growth is likely to take a hit.
They also argued that growth is likely to stay positive, so that stagflation, a period of high inflation coupled with stagnating growth, is unlikely. 
All these factors raised the risk that inflation expectations could move above the ECB's 2% target, a worrisome phenomenon for central banks.
""In such circumstances, the Governing Council could no longer afford to look through higher inflation, even if it was driven by an adverse supply shock,"" the accounts showed. 
The debate is likely to have moved on since the meeting, however, as inflation continues to beat expectations, hitting a record high 7.5% last month, with some analysts now talking about the possibility of double-digit readings by mid-year.
But the war in Ukraine is likely to complicate discussions. High fuel prices and sanctions will weigh on growth, and the 19-country euro zone economy is likely to stagnate at best in the first half of the year.
Conservative policymakers, or ""hawks"", are nonetheless likely to push the ECB to set a more precise end-date for bond purchases, probably early in the third quarter, putting the bank in a position to raise interest rates by autumn if such a move is warranted then. 

Markets are now pricing in a combined 60 basis points worth of rate hikes in the bank's minus 0.5% deposit rate this year, even if no policymaker has made the case for such aggressive tightening.
The ECB will next meet on April 14 and a more detailed timeline for rolling back stimulus is possible.

224,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 07:52AM ET</span>","MADRID (Reuters) - The Bank of Spain told lenders on Thursday to adequately monitor credit risks of some of their customers most exposed to the economic impact from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and urged banks not to release provisions given the current uncertainty. 
""In view of the new shock, we will have to closely monitor the effects of the crisis on institutions and their borrowers,"" Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said in the presentation of the central bank's supervisory report.
He said lenders needed to maintain a high degree of prudence, with ""appropriate and early recognition of the associated risks, in order to preserve confidence in the sector and to facilitate the continued flow of credit to the economy"".
On Tuesday, the central bank lowered its economic growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023.
Deputy Governor Margarita Delgado warned in the report that ""it is important that lenders...do not release provisions until uncertainties dissipate.""
Spanish banks such as Santander (MC:SAN) and Sabadell have recently started to release provisions, mainly in the United States and Britain. 
Although Spanish lenders have little exposure to Russian credit, estimated at just above 700 million euros ($770 million) by the central bank, they fear an indirect impact of high energy prices on some of their customers. 
Analysts have also warned that the conflict could delay interest rate hikes in the long run, and Delgado said it was ""difficult to establish clear scenarios for the evolution of interest rates"".

She saw a more limited scope for further domestic mergers but growing chances of cross-border deals in Europe. The number of significant lenders in Spain has dropped to 10 from 55 before the 2008 financial crisis. 
Despite a significant rise in property prices in 2021, De Cos did not see any evidence of a ""clear overheating in the Spanish real estate sector"", but said the bank would closely monitor its performance. Spain's property price index rose 6.4% in the fourth quarter, the biggest increase since early 2019.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Recession risks in the euro area are rising, with euro zone inflation seen running hot for the remainder of 2022 and the European Central Bank likely to increase its deposit rate by year-end, a Reuters poll showed.
While inflation hit another record high of 7.5% in March, it is still months from a peak, as Russia's war in Ukraine continues to push up food and energy prices, leading to speculation that higher price rises may become entrenched.
With the euro zone economy recovering, unemployment at a record low and nearly every other peer central bank now tightening policy, the ECB looks set to end its asset purchases this year and raise rates for the first time in well over a decade.
Of the 41 of 53 respondents in an April 1-6 poll who forecast the deposit rate to rise from a record low of -0.50% this year, 31 expect it to do so in the fourth quarter, with ten saying it will happen as soon as July-September, up from six in a poll last month. None expected a rate rise by mid-year.
However, the policy space is narrowing for the ECB, with a median 30% probability of a recession this year and the euro zone's proximity to the Russia-Ukraine war leaving it the most vulnerable.
""There is a risk the economic impact of the war could be somewhat worse than expected, or that the situation could deteriorate further,"" said Gordon Scott, euro area economist at RBC. ""A recession thus remains a meaningful possibility, about 30-40% chance of at some point in the next year.""
Forecasters who in March expected the recovery to continue as businesses reopened following the Omicron variant wave have now downgraded their forecasts for economic growth to just 0.4% for this quarter, less than half of what was expected one month ago.
It was then forecast to pick up to 0.6% in the third and fourth quarter. The euro zone economy is expected to expand 2.9% this year and 2.3% next, down from 3.8% and 2.5% predicted a month ago.
Growth forecasts for 2022 in Germany, Europe's largest economy, were nearly halved to 2.2% from 4.0% in the previous quarterly poll in January. Expected growth in France and Italy were downgraded to 3.2% and 2.8% from 3.7% and 4.2%, respectively.
All but two of 39 economists said further escalation in the war in Ukraine is the biggest risk to the euro zone economy over the next 12 months. The two said the biggest risk is a resurgence in COVID-19.
Forecasts for inflation this year have risen for the 10th consecutive survey -- to 7.3%, 6.9% and 5.8% for the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, from 5.3%, 4.5% and 3.3%, in the March poll, well above the ECB's 2.0% target. 
The three biggest economies of the bloc - Germany, France and Italy - saw a significant upgrade in annual inflation forecasts for this year.
Although ECB President Christine Lagarde has said the bloc faces no risk of stagflation - a sustained period of stagnant growth and high price rises - 21 of 38 economists, or 55%, saw a high or very high chance of it in the next two years. The remaining 17 said that risk was low.
About half of respondents, 18 of 39, said it is only a matter of time before wage growth, a key indicator of second-round inflationary effects follows. The others, 21, disagreed.
""A price-wage spiral can't be ruled out .... Record high inflation could mean workers and unions with bargaining power will push harder for higher settlements,"" said Simon Wells, chief European economist at HSBC.
""So far, though, demands have been fairly restrained – though the autumn will be a test with some big bellwether deals likely."" 

Euro zone unemployment, which fell to a record low 6.8% in February, was expected to edge up only slightly and average 6.9% for this year and next.

China's financial hub has fallen largely silent after the city imposed harsh curbs to stem the spread of COVID under the country's ""zero tolerance"" policy, with only healthcare workers, volunteers, delivery personnel or people with special permission allowed on the streets. 
Authorities say that has whittled the number of couriers, who must keep the city's 26 million residents supplied, to just 11,000. Still operating but overloaded services include Meituan and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Freshippo online grocery platform and its Ele.me service. 
Lockdowns for the city's residents east of the Huangpu river began on March 28, while lockdowns for the rest of the city started on April 1. The exercise originally was intended to last five days.
The Shanghai branch of China's Communist Party called on members to ""dare show their swords and fight against all kind of behaviour that interferes with and destroys the overall efforts against the pandemic"" in an open letter on Wednesday night.
Shanghai has sufficient reserves of staples such as rice and meat, but issues have cropped up in distribution and last-mile deliveries because of epidemic control measures, Shanghai's vice mayor, Chen Tong, said at a news conference on Thursday. 
He said the city would try to reopen some wholesale markets and food stores and allow more delivery personnel out of locked-down areas. Officials will also crack down on price gouging, he added. 
Many residents are beginning to worry about food and drinking water, as well as obtaining products such as infant formula.
ONLINE OUTRAGE
Some have complained on social media about having to wake up at dawn for a chance at booking a grocery delivery, but finding them sold out within seconds. Others have turned to community WeChat groups to try to bulk-buy fruit and vegetables.
Social media users have also widely shared outrage over individual tragedies, including the alleged suicide of woman after being cyberbullied for paying too little to a delivery worker, and a healthcare worker beating to death a corgi dog after its owner allegedly was taken to quarantine.
Shanghai, which has been conducting multiple rounds of testing, reported close to 20,000 new locally transmitted cases for Wednesday, 98% of which it said where asymptomatic. 
However, there are signs that transmission is still happening in spite of the lockdowns. Of its 19,660 asymptomatic infections, 633 involved people who were not under quarantine or who faced control measures, the data showed. 
China's most-populous city has yet to give an indication of when lockdown measures will be lifted, fuelling uncertainty and prompting European businesses and economists to warn about the mounting toll they are having on its economy and attractiveness as an international financial hub.
The economic impact is not confined to Shanghai, however, with 87 out of China's top 100 cities imposing some level of restrictions on activity and mobility ""in hopes of keeping COVID under control and avoiding Shanghai's fate"", Gavekal Dragonomics analyst Ernan Cui said in a note on Thursday.
The coronavirus was first identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. 
From Monday, Shanghai will reduce cap loads on international flights by foreign airlines at 40%, down from 75% previously in a bid to reduce imported cases, two sources told Reuters on Thursday.
The city is a hub for the very few international flights still coming into China.
On Thursday, Shanghai's disciplinary body said it had dismissed an official at a Shanghai Airport Group subsidiary as well as the deputy secretary of a district mental health centre over their poor implementation of virus control measures. 

Although Shanghai's case numbers remain small by global standards, the city has emerged as a test bed for China's ""dynamic clearance"" strategy, which seeks to test, trace and centrally quarantine all positive cases and close contacts.
Shanghai has converted dozens of buildings into quarantine facilities that can house tens of thousands of positive cases.

(Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday that Russia should be expelled from the Group of 20 major economies forum, and the United States will boycott some G20 meetings if Russian officials show up.
Yellen, who spoke at a U.S. House Financial Services Committee hearing, was referring to an April 20 G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting, a Treasury spokesperson said – raising questions about the forum's role in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Since 2008, the club has addressed issues from COVID-19 relief to cross-border debt. It also includes countries such as China, India and Saudi Arabia that have been reluctant to condemn the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"".
Yellen told lawmakers that Russia's invasion and the killings of civilians in the town of Bucha ""represent an unacceptable affront to the rules-based global order and will have enormous economic repercussions.""
The United States and allies have placed greater emphasis in recent months on the G7 grouping of industrial democracies, whose interests are more aligned, using those meetings to coordinate their response to Russia's war.
Yellen said the Biden administration wants to push Russia out of active participation in major international institutions, though it was unlikely it could be expelled from the International Monetary Fund given its rules.
""President Biden's made it clear... that it cannot be business as usual for Russia in any of the financial institutions,"" Yellen said. 
""He's asked that Russia be removed from the G20, and I've made clear to my colleagues in (presidency holder) Indonesia that we will not be participating in a number of meetings if the Russians are there.""
Yellen's testimony came as the Biden administration announced a new round of sanctions to punish Russia.
She also warned China - which has given its backing to Russia staying in the G20 - that the Treasury was prepared to turn its sanctions tools against Beijing in the event of aggression against Taiwan, which China claims as a wayward province.
FLEXIBILITY ON ENERGY
Russia's participation in the April G20 meeting, to be held in Washington on the sidelines of IMF and World Bank meetings, is unclear at present.
Moscow has said President Vladimir Putin intends to attend the G20 summit in Bali in November.
Indonesia, which will also host a G20 finance meeting in July, could not expel or ""disinvite"" any G20 members, including Russia, a government official familiar with the matter said, adding that whether a country attended was up to that nation.
The new U.S. sanctions against Russia ban Americans from investing there and lock Sberbank, Russia's largest lender and holder of a third of its bank deposits, out of the U.S. financial system, along with other institutions.
But transactions allowing European allies to purchase Russian energy were exempted because many European countries ""remain heavily dependent on Russian natural gas, as well as oil, and they are committed to making the transition away from that dependence as rapidly as possible,"" Yellen said.
A complete ban on oil exports from Russia, the world's third-largest producer, would likely prompt ""skyrocketing"" prices that would hurt both the United States and Europe, Yellen said.
But she hoped oil companies elsewhere could be enticed to ramp up production which, along with the release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, may allow for tougher restrictions on Russian oil.

Asked if the United States would look to impose sanctions against China if Taiwan was threatened, Yellen said: ""Absolutely... In the case of Russia... we’ve imposed significant consequences. And I think that you should not doubt our ability and resolve to do the same in other situations.""
Asked about Yellen's comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Taiwan was an ""inalienable"" part of China's territory, saying Washington was “playing with fire.”

RMGS is a mechanism to facilitate the transfer of OFR that is not needed for the conduct of monetary policy and financial stability from the central bank to the government, for longer-term investment by GIC, the sovereign wealth fund.
The optimal amount of OFR that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) estimates it needs is currently 65% to 75% of gross domestic product. 
The MAS manages policy through exchange rate settings rather than interest rates, letting the Singapore dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed policy band, known as the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate, or S$NEER.
The stock of OFR reached S$563 billion, or about 106% of GDP, at the end of 2021, reflecting the persistently strong appreciation pressures on the S$NEER from Singapore's positive net savings and large capital inflows from abroad, the MAS said.
After the transfer of S$75 billion, the central bank estimated the stock of OFR remaining on its balance sheet at around 95% of GDP.

It said it expects further transfers of excess OFR to the government over the course of the year to bring it to the optimal amount.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's economy is seen expanding by 3.8% this year under a baseline scenario, a slower pace than a previous projection of 5.0%, the head of the central bank told its annual meeting of shareholders on Thursday.
""The war in Ukraine is a new, major exogenous supply-side shock to the global economy that also affects, through various channels, aggregate demand,"" Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras said.
He said this was occurring at a very ""critical time"", when economies were rebounding from the health crisis and a severe recession.
Stournaras said Greece's main economic policy objectives this year should be to maintain growth momentum and keep up efforts to regain investment grade.
""The latter should become a national goal,"" he said. 
Under the central bank's adverse scenario, economic growth is seen limited to 2.8%. The economy rebounded strongly last year with gross domestic product growing by 8.3%. 
The economy's performance will depend on the extent and duration of the shocks in international prices of energy and food, as well as deterioration in confidence and financial market turmoil, Stournaras said.
Under the central bank's baseline scenario, consumer inflation is projected at 5.2% this year while a further increase to 7.0% is projected under an adverse scenario.

""Although the main drivers of growth this year are domestic demand and tourism, there is significant uncertainty: the negative impact of inflation on households' real disposable income will drag down private consumption,"" Stournaras said.
Greece's annual consumer inflation accelerated to 7.2% in February, hitting its highest in 25 years on the back of surging costs of energy, housing and transport.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog said on Thursday it will create 80 new jobs to shut down problem companies faster as it faces pressure from lawmakers to deal with corporate collapses more efficiently and tackle a rising volume of scams.
The Financial Conduct Authority said its new three-year strategy plan would be a ""step change"" which should over time cut serious harm to consumers, thereby bringing down compensation bills and the watchdog levy on firms.
It is the latest leg in a transformation which CEO Nikhil Rathi has said will turn the watchdog into a faster, more aggressive regulator to cope with demands such as the surge in online scams and the emerging crypto sector.
It has also faced criticism for being too slow to prevent failures such as the collapse of investment fund London Capital & Finance, which is costing taxpayers up to 120 million pounds in compensation.
The watchdog, which employs around 4,000 people, was already hiring 95 people to strengthen its authorisation unit to stop unsuitable companies being licensed in the first place.
The FCA has an increased budget of 640.1 million pounds ($836.93 million) this year, up 4.3%.
Internal changes have led to disquiet among some staff, with the outcome of a union vote on industrial action due next week.
The FCA said on Thursday it will, for the first time, measure itself annually against published outcomes and targets.
Currently the watchdog has patchy powers to intervene when problems arise in sectors including cryptoassets and in cases of online financial fraud until the government legislates to bring them under the regulatory net.
""Our expectation is that over time we will be able to intervene before harms become systemic,"" Sarah Pritchard, the FCA's executive director of markets, said.
Firms also face a tougher 'consumer duty' later in the year.
Simon Morris, a financial services partner with CMS law firm, said the strategy plan was ambitious and augurs real change in tone and substance.
""But in positioning itself as a more powerful and controlling regulator the FCA’s greatest challenge is accountability, especially to the firms it regulates,"" Morris said.
The FCA will consult shortly on ""side pockets"" to ring-fence Russian assets in investment funds, Pritchard said.
There will also be a consultation on regulating stablecoins following the government's announcement this week. [nL5N2W23WH

Investing.com -- Bond markets calm down and stock markets consolidate after a rough two days of adjustment to the Federal Reserve's latest thinking about tightening monetary policy. China is set to ease monetary policy, however, as its economy slips into contraction due to the spread of COVID-19. Samsung and Mercedes-Benz show the two sides of an ongoing shortage of silicon chips worldwide, while oil prices consolidate below $100 after more bearish inventory data from the U.S. and Shell says its exit from Russia will cost a cool $5 billion. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 7th April.
1. Bonds calm after hawkish Fed minutes; jobless claims due
A measure of calm returned to bonds as the market adjusted to the likelihood of one of more half-point rate increases by the Federal Reserve in the coming months.
The minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting in March, released on Wednesday, had indicated that only the uncertainty created by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had kept it from hiking the fed funds rate by 50 basis points, and had also shown concern at perceptions that the central bank was “behind the curve” in tackling inflation.
The yield on the benchmark 10-Year Treasury was down 3 basis points at 2.58% by 6:10 AM ET (1010 GMT), while the 2-Year yield – more sensitive to expectations for official short-term rates – was down 6 basis points at 2.43%.
The week’s barrage of Fed speakers continues Thursday with interventions from New York’s John Williams, Chicago’s Charles Evans and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic. Treasury Secretary and former Fed chair Janet Yellen will also speak at 10:30 AM ET. The week’s initial jobless claims data are expected to show layoffs still running at historically low levels around 200,000
2. China signals imminent monetary easing 
The rest of the world may be tightening monetary policy, but China is about to loosen it. The State Council said in a statement that it will use monetary policy at an “appropriate time” to support an economy that slipped into contraction mode in March, according to three business surveys released earlier this week.
The Council said that risks to the economy have “intensified” and “exceeded expectations” in some areas.
The announcement comes as residents in Shanghai, locked down since last week for mass COVID-19 testing, begin to run out of fresh food, according to reports from people in the city. The city posted a record 20,000 new infections on Wednesday, despite the draconian measures.
3. Stocks set to open a little higher; Buffett spends again
U.S. stocks are set to open marginally higher after two straight days of losses caused by fears of tighter monetary policy and an intensification of the disruptions to the global economy by Russia’s war in Ukraine.
By 6:20 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 17 points, or less than 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.5%. The Nasdaq Composite had lost over 2% again on Wednesday, while the Dow and S&P had lost 0.4% and 1.0% respectively.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include HP (NYSE:HPQ), which rose 10% in premarket after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) disclosed it had bought a $4.2 billion stake in the company. Also in focus will be Facebook owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), which is reportedly working on a plan to introduce virtual coins, tokens, and lending services to its apps. That comes after its plans to launch a global stablecoin were scuppered by regulators.
4. Two sides of the ongoing global chip shortage
The ongoing global shortage of semiconductors was in evidence in overnight disclosures in Asia and Europe.
Samsung (KS:005930), one of the world’s biggest chipmakers, said its operating profit in the three months through March will be around $11.6 billion, higher than widely expected and its best quarter for four years. That’s due largely to strong demand not only for its chips but also its smartphones.
By contrast, Mercedes-Benz (DE:MBGn) said its deliveries fell 16% year-on-year due to a shortage of chips that forced it to concentrate on higher-margin products. Its deliveries of battery-powered vehicles rose 210%, while deliveries of all BEVs and hybrids together rose 67%. It had sent over 5,600 employees in Brazil on leave due to chip shortages earlier this week.
China’s Geely (HK:0175), meanwhile, eked out a gain of only 1% in deliveries year-on-year.
5. Oil consolidates after bearish inventory data; Shell takes a hit from Russia exit
Crude oil prices consolidated below $100 a barrel as U.S. government data confirmed a rise in crude and distillate stockpiles last week.
China’s lockdown continued to make themselves felt on global demand: data show average flight movements in China at their lowest since the very depths of the initial COVID-19 panic in Wuhan two years ago.
In corporate news, Shell (LON:RDSa) predicted a post-tax hit to earnings of as much as $5 billion from its exit from Russia, but said adjusted earnings will still look good due to the surge in crude prices that has boosted its trading operations.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 1.8% at $97.91 a barrel, while Brent was up 1.7% at $102.82 a barrel."

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said on Thursday that Russia's war in Ukraine would have a significant impact on its finances this year, as it reported its highest ever profit in 2021.
The EBRD, which on Monday suspended Russia and Belarus from access to its financing, said in a statement that its profit of 2.5 billion euros ($2.72 billion) last year beat its previous record set in 2006.
It attributed this to ""excellent performance"" of its equity and technology investments, plus a reduction in non-performing loans as economies recovered from the coronavirus pandemic.
However, the bank warned of the effect on its finances of the war in Ukraine, to which it is delivering a 2 billion euro support package and whose economy its chief economist said last week would shrink 20% this year without a ceasefire.
""The war on Ukraine is likely to have a significant impact on 2022's financial performance,"" the EBRD said in its statement. ""The EBRD has a large portfolio of investments and equity holdings in Ukraine, as well as portfolios in Belarus and Russia.""
It said that at the end of 2021 it had loans of 2.1 billion euros in Ukraine, 0.2 billion euros in Russia and 0.5 billion euros in Belarus, plus equity exposure of 0.3 billion, 1.2 billion and 0.1 billion euros respectively to the three.
Majority owned by G7 top economic powers, the EBRD was set up three decades ago to invest in the former communist economies of eastern Europe and now invests in 38 economies across the region as well as Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco in Africa. 

The EBRD has not put new money into Russia since Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014 nor Belarus since 2021, after its disputed 2020 election.

LVIV, Ukraine(Reuters) - In western Ukraine, some 1,100 train wagons carrying grain are stuck near the main rail border crossing with Poland, unable to transport their cargo abroad.
They are just some of the 24,190 wagons carrying various goods for export, including vegetable oil, iron ore, metals, chemicals and coal, that were waiting to cross Ukraine’s Western border as of Tuesday, according to data from the state-run railway company that hasn’t previously been reported.
With war raging along the country’s southern coast, and its main ports blocked off by Russia's invasion, Ukraine is struggling to export its grain and other goods, according to government officials and industry insiders. But as Kyiv looks for alternative export routes by land, that effort has been hampered by logistical challenges and red tape, industry officials and commodity traders say.
Valerii Tkachov, deputy director of the commercial department at the state-run railway company Ukrzaliznytsia, said that 10,320 wagons - or about half of the total - are waiting at the junction near the village of Izov, the main rail border crossing into Poland. Sitting some 130 kilometres north of Lviv, the junction serves as a gateway for reaching the Polish seaport of Gdansk.
One key issue: the sheer volume of goods that needs to find an alternate route, which is causing shortages of everything from rail cars to staff, according to industry insiders and the government. Ukraine, one of the world’s biggest grain exporters, had prior to the war exported 98% of its cereals via the Black Sea. Typically, only a fraction of the country’s exports went by rail, where transport costs are higher than shipping.
Those difficulties are being compounded by logistical issues, such as differences in rail-track gauges used in Ukraine and neighbours such as Poland - a legacy from when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. While the west of the country has been spared by the worst fighting, there have been missile strikes near Lviv, including on oil facilities, and security around the border is very tight.
The disruptions to Ukraine’s exports mean that countries that rely on imports of Ukrainian grain - including China, Egypt, Turkey and Indonesia - will need to find alternative supplies or face food shortages, aid agencies have warned.
Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has heightened concerns about global food security, sending prices of global grain, fertilizer and fuel soaring. Global food prices have been rising since mid-2020 due to disruption to planting and harvest in many countries during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, and later due to supply chain problems.
Even as Russia scales down operations around Kyiv and the northern region of Chernihiv to focus on battles in the east, the prolonged blockade of ports in the south is dealing a major blow to Ukraine. Grain exports are a cornerstone of Ukraine’s economy - totalling about $12.2 billion in 2021 and accounting for nearly a fifth of all the country’s exports, according to official data.
The Ukrainian government didn’t respond to a request for comment. Ukraine has said that grain exports last month fell to a tenth of the figure of March 2021 amid port closures and that the disruption impacts people in many countries. “Hundreds of millions of people around the world will not receive food unless Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports is lifted in the near future,” the agriculture ministry said in an April 1 statement.
Russia launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, aiming to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say the invasion was illegal and unjustified.
The Kremlin didn’t respond to a request for comment. Russia has denied deliberately targeting civilians and civil infrastructure, despite documented attacks on hospitals, apartment buildings and railroads.
Ukrainian farmers - who produced a record grain crop last year - say their wheat yields could be cut in half, and perhaps more. Russian forces are repeatedly damaging grain storage facilities in eastern Ukraine, a U.S. official has said. Kyiv and Moscow have accused each other of laying mines in the Black Sea creating dangers for merchant shipping.
The war has upended the country’s agriculture sector and “has destroyed Ukraine’s roads, railways, and rail stations that facilitate overland transportation,” a U.S. official told Reuters last week. “As Putin’s War continues, more and more arable Ukrainian land is ruined by Russian tanks, shells, and landmines—risking a much longer-term food crisis.”
Ukraine and Russia are major wheat exporters, together accounting for about a third of world exports- almost all of which passes through the Black Sea. Its waters are shared by Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia and Turkey, as well as Ukraine and Russia, which have been at war since President Vladimir Putin invaded his southern neighbour on Feb. 24.
BACKED UP
Clearing the backlog could take a long time.
Because the Ukrainian railway network uses a Russian gauge measuring roughly 1.5 metres, or some 10 centimetres more than the tracks used in most of Europe, railway staff have to lift wagons with a jack and manually change the chassis to fit the Polish tracks, Tkachov said. Alternatively, they can unload the grains from the Ukrainian wagons and pour them into the Polish ones - a process that can take up to half-an-hour per wagon.
Tkachov, from the state railway, told Reuters there are currently up to 500 wagons crossing the border near Izov per day - effectively a three week backlog. He added that there are another dozen crossing points, many of which aren’t backed up.
The state railway is working to increase capacity to 1,100 wagons of grains a day crossing into Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia within three months - nearly a tenfold increase from its March level, he said.
It is hiring more people and buying equipment to help switch the rail chassis, diverting staff from passenger trains to cargo transport, and also working to ease other hurdles, such as customs procedures, according to Tkachov.
""We are working to speed up the process...reducing the number and duration of wagon inspections, and the amount of paperwork,"" he said.
HIT TO EXPORTS
One company impacted by the backlog is Astarta Holding NV, a Ukraine-based food producer. The company had agreed to deliver 25,000 metric tonnes of corn to European customers in April, but had yet to receive the required all-clear from railway authorities, according to Julia Bereshchenko, Astarta’s investor relations and business development director.
Astarta said it also has some 150,000 tonnes of grains, mostly corn, sitting idle in its silos. At this time of the year, the tall storehouses should be almost empty, it said. 
Official figures released by the government on Sunday cited exports of 1.4 million tonnes of corn and wheat in March. That was about a quarter of February's figure and down from some 3 million tonnes in March 2021.
But the most recent month’s export volume includes grain loaded onto vessels stuck at blockaded Ukrainian seaports, deputy agriculture minister Taras Vysotskiy told Reuters.
Vysotskiy told Ukrainian national television on Monday that just 300,000 tonnes of agricultural products left the country, via railways.
Analysts have said Ukraine, which had exported 43 million tonnes of grain from the start of the season in July up to the invasion in late February, could export only around 1 million tonnes in the next three months, due to logistics difficulties. Before the war, the government forecast grain exports could reach 65 million tonnes this season.
Vysotskiy, in his remarks to television Monday, expressed hope that Ukraine might be able to export 1.5 million tonnes a month by rail, adding that would be only a third of volumes typically handled by the ports but would still generate some much-needed income for the agricultural sector.
‘DROP IN THE OCEAN’
Commodity traders, such as Cargill Inc, are looking for ways to get foodstuffs out of the country but there is no easy fix, an industry source said. 
Cargill didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Kyiv is in talks with Romania on shipping its agricultural commodities via the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta, the agriculture ministry said on March 30. That would involve transporting the grains by rail to cargo ports on the Danube river and then uploading them onto barges for sailing towards Constanta, industry officials said.
Once at the Romanian port the grains would have to be moved across to large vessels for shipping worldwide - making the whole process complex and costly. According to APK-Inform, a Ukrainian agriculture consultancy, the cost of delivering Ukrainian grain to the Romanian port of Constanta was 120-150 euros ($133-$166) per tonne.
Before the war, traders paid around $20 to $40 per tonne to transport grain to Ukraine's Black Sea ports.
Any hopes of a quick re-opening of that route was further dashed at the weekend. On Sunday, Russian rockets hit the port of Mykolaiv and also struck oil facilities near the major hub of Odesa on the Black Sea, local officials said. Russia's defence ministry said its missiles had destroyed an oil refinery and three fuel storage facilities near Odesa. It said they had been used by Ukraine to supply its troops near Mykolaiv.
The Ukraine government says it is also worried about the country's own food supplies, even though it says it has enough stocks for three years.
Last month, Ukraine suspended exports of rye, oats, millet, buckwheat, salt, sugar, meat and livestock since the invasion, and introduced export licences for wheat. The government said it would allow free exports of corn and sunflower oil, however.

A manager at one of the main foreign commodity traders operating in the country said that even if the country succeeded in boosting its agricultural export capacity to 700,000 tonnes a month to 1 million tonnes a month by rail and via the Danube quickly, that would just be a ""drop in the ocean.""
""We may reach 10-15% of the capacity that is actually needed,"" he said. ""I believe the risks for the economy are huge.""

MALE (Reuters) - A day after coal and fertilizer billionaire Andrey Melnichenko was placed on the European Union's sanctions list on March 9, his superyacht Motor Yacht A stopped broadcasting its location while in Maldives' waters, maritime data shows. 
    In Italy, four days later, authorities seized another of Melnichenko's vessels – the world's largest sailing yacht, estimated by Italian financial police to be worth $578 million.
    Switching off devices that allow authorities to track a ship's whereabouts can help keep yachts out of their sight. 
But in Maldives, the chances of action against the property of sanctioned oligarchs are in any case slim, according to interviews with a dozen people familiar with internal discussions about how to respond to U.S. and European financial sanctions, including government ministers, diplomats and experts in the country's superyacht industry.
The cautious approach by authorities in Maldives to enforcing the sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine means that the Indian Ocean island nation has emerged as an attractive destination for yacht-owning Russian oligarchs. 
Melnichenko's vessel is one of six Russian-linked yachts that have glided between Maldives' atolls, southwest of India, since Western nations hit some oligarchs with sanctions in response to the Feb 24 invasion.
Three of the yachts obscured their live locations, changed reported destinations or moved into international waters, according to data supplied by MarineTraffic, a marine analytics provider.
    The idea of seizing yachts is ""far-fetched,"" because Maldives legal system is not robust enough, the country's chief prosecutor, Hussain Shameem, said in an interview, adding that authorities could not easily confiscate visiting vessels unless a crime was committed under local law.
Requests for comment about the deactivating of Motor Yacht A's location devices and its current ownership status, sent to Melnichenko's spokesperson as well as his charitable foundation, fertiliser producer EuroChem Group and coal company SUEK - two companies he resigned from in March - went unanswered. 
Last month, his spokesperson told Reuters the businessman would dispute the sanctions, adding that he had no political affiliations. 
The 119-metre (390-foot) Motor Yacht A features crystal furniture and three swimming pools, photos released by its builder show, and it has been valued in specialist boating publications at $300 million. Melnichenko's wife has said she was involved in the interior design. 
A spokesperson for Melnichenko in 2017 acknowledged in a statement to the BBC that the sailing yacht belonged to his boss. Both vessels were styled by Philippe Starck, the renowned French designer. 
SAFE HAVEN
The situation in Maldives underscores the difficulty Western powers face in choking off the wealth of oligarchs targeted by sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as several nations around the world still offer safe havens, the sources consulted by Reuters in Maldives said. 
    The United States, Britain and the European Union introduced wide-reaching sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin, lawmakers and businessmen in the wake of the invasion, which Moscow calls a special military operation aimed the ""demilitarization"" and ""denazification"" of Ukraine. 
    European countries have seized property including villas and boats, with authorities confiscating at least six vessels they say belong to some of the dozens of oligarchs hit by sanctions.
Peter Stano, a spokesperson for the European Commission, said the sanctions were not binding for non-EU members or non-aligned states such as the Maldives though he called on all countries to adhere to them.
Maldives voted to condemn Russia's invasion at the United Nations and publicly maintains it will assist international efforts against sanctioned Russians. 
In reality, officials say they are concerned about the economic impact of deterring wealthy Russian visitors.
    With its powder-white beaches and some 1,200 islands, the majority uninhabited, Maldives is a favourite destination of the super-rich. 
    From a backwater with scant natural resources beyond tuna and coconuts, tourism propelled it to a middle-income country over the past three decades. It has a GDP per capita before the pandemic of more than $10,000 – the highest in South Asia.
    Tourism accounts for about a third of the $5.6 billion economy. Russians have a higher than average spend and made up by far the largest number of arrivals in January, the last month before the Ukraine invasion, tourism ministry data shows.
    Since then, Russian arrivals have fallen 70%, Tourism Minister Abdulla Mausoom said. He wants that to be reversed. 
    ""Our entrance policy is very open. Maldives is an open country,"" he said.
    ""NOBODY CAN TOUCH THEM""
    Abdul Hannan runs Seal Superyachts Maldives, providing fuel and food to vessel owners including Russian clients. 
    Hannan said the yachts' costs typically run at hundreds of thousands of dollars a week and that around half his customers are Russians. Like other superyacht owners, they often winter in the Indian Ocean and spend the summer season in Europe, he said.
    Hannan said he has met some Russian owners aboard their superyachts since sanctions were announced, describing them as ""humble, normal people"" passing through a difficult moment. He did not say if the people were under sanctions. 
""For the time being, they are trying to keep the yachts in international waters,"" where they can potentially idle for months at a time, he said.
    ""Then, nobody can touch them.""
    He declined to name the clients, citing confidentiality. 
    A spokesperson for Maldives' customs authority, which monitors maritime traffic in its waters, did not respond to a request for comment on the number of Russian-owned yachts currently present. 
    DELICATE DIPLOMACY
    While Maldives' institutions would find it difficult to ignore a warning by the U.S. Treasury that failing to confiscate Russian assets would affect its access to U.S. financial markets, such a message has not been sent, said an official familiar with Maldives international financial arrangements.
Asked about locations including Maldives, Andrew Adams, head of a U.S. taskforce aiming to freeze oligarchs' assets, told Reuters that Washington was seeing cooperation ""at an all time high,"" even as oligarchs try to hide yachts, planes or other mobile property in countries they believe to be secretive.

However, forcing politically unstable and financially constrained Maldives to make a hard choice over sanctions could drive it closer to China, two Western diplomats said. A previous government had strengthened relations with Beijing though relations with the West and traditional ally India are now improving.
    ""We're cognizant of the economic risks that are entailed,"" for Maldives if it takes a hard line, one of the diplomats said.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China warned on Thursday it would take strong measures if U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan and said such a visit would severely impact Chinese-U.S. relations, following media reports she would go next week.
China considers democratically ruled Taiwan its own territory and the subject is a constant source of friction between Beijing and Washington, especially given strong U.S. military and political support for the island.
The possible visit has not been confirmed by Pelosi's office or Taiwan's government, but some Japanese and Taiwanese media reported it would take place after she visits Japan this weekend.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters that Beijing firmly opposed all forms of official interactions between the United States and Taiwan, and Washington should cancel the trip.
""If the United States insists on having its own way, China will take strong measures in response to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity. All possible consequences that arise from this will completely be borne by the U.S. side,"" he added, without giving details.
In Taipei, Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Joanne Ou would only say that inviting U.S. officials and dignitaries had always been ""an important part"" of the ministry's work, and that it would announce any official visits at an appropriate time.
Sunday marks the 43rd anniversary of the United States signing into law the Taiwan Relations Act, which guides ties in the absence of formal diplomatic relations and enshrines a U.S. commitment to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.
The last time a House speaker visited Taiwan was in 1997, when Newt Gingrich met then-President Lee Teng-hui.
Pelosi, a long time critic of China, particularly on human rights issues, held a virtual meeting with Taiwan Vice President William Lai in January as he wrapped up a visit to the United States and Honduras.
Pelosi is one of the ruling Democratic Party's most high-profile politicians, and second in the U.S. presidential line of succession after the vice president.
Taiwan has been heartened by continued U.S. support offered by the Biden administration, which has repeatedly talked of its ""rock-solid"" commitment to the island.

That has strained already poor Sino-U.S. relations.
In March, a delegation of former senior U.S. defence and security officials sent by President Joe Biden visited Taiwan, a strong show of support coming soon after Russia invaded Ukraine.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The benefits of a weak yen outweigh the demerits for Japan's export-oriented economy, central bank policymaker Asahi Noguchi said on Thursday, brushing aside the view the currency's recent decline would hurt the economy by boosting import costs.
Unlike other countries worried about surging inflation, Japan's primary goal is to end deflation and prop up inflation to more desirable levels, Noguchi said.
A weak yen is more favourable for achieving this goal than a strong yen, which would push down prices and hurt exports, he added.
""It's true some sectors could suffer from a weak yen. But as a whole, the merits of a weak yen outweigh the demerits,"" Noguchi told a news conference.
The remarks echo those of Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who has consistently preached the benefits of a weak yen such as the boost it gives to Japanese firms' overseas profits.
Once welcomed as giving a boost to exports, a weak yen has become a headache for Japanese policymakers as it inflates the cost of fuel and raw material imports, which are already soaring due to the war in Ukraine.
Some analysts and lawmakers have blamed the BOJ's ultra-low interest rate policy for fuelling unwelcome yen declines.
Noguchi said Japan's core consumer inflation may exceed the central bank's 2% target from April on rising energy costs and the dissipating effect of past cellphone fee cuts.
But with the increase clearly driven by external factors rather than a recovery in domestic demand, the BOJ must keep monetary policy ultra-loose to support the economy, he said.
""Japan is not experiencing the kind of high inflation seen in many other countries,"" Noguchi said in a speech prior to the news conference.
""In a country still mired in a sticky deflationary mindset, it will take significant time to stably achieve our 2% inflation target and justify a withdrawal of stimulus,"" he said.

Japan has not been immune from surging fuel and commodity prices with wholesale inflation hitting record highs. Analysts also expect consumer inflation to hit or even exceed the BOJ's 2% inflation target as early as this month.
The proportion of Japanese households expecting prices to rise a year from now has hit a 14-year high, a central bank survey showed on Thursday, as inflationary pressures from rising raw material costs grew.

(Reuters) - Some Asian central banks are shaking off their long-held reluctance to follow their global peers in lifting benchmark interest rates off historic lows, as the Ukraine war blows consumer prices well out of policymakers' comfort zones.
The region's economies have largely lagged U.S. and European reopenings from the pandemic and central banks in Australia, India and Southeast Asia have up until now mostly looked past the inflation pressures caused by global supply snags, and focused more on shoring up their recoveries.
This week, however, there has been a marked shift in the language of some of the region's less hawkish central banks on worries the renewed surge in commodity costs caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine could destabilise their economies.
Australia's central bank on Tuesday dropped a previous pledge to be ""patient"" in its assessment of current conditions, taken widely as a signal that the door was now open to the first interest rate increase in more than a decade.
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Deputy Governor Michele Bullock said on Wednesday the change in the policy outlook reflected growing evidence of inflation pressures.
""It seems external inflation dynamics have become enough for the RBA to pre-emptively flag a shift,"" said Ben Jarman, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
""The RBA guidance suggests upcoming consumer price index and labour cost data are likely to clinch the case for normalisation,"" he said, projecting the first rate hike to come in June from the previous forecast for November. 
Setting the global pace, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates for the first time since 2018 last month and looks on track for an aggressive tightening cycle to fight surging inflation.
In the Philippines, central bank governor Benjamin Diokno said on Tuesday he was ready to take ""pre-emptive action"" if ""inflation expectations"" risked becoming ""disanchored.""
His comments contrast with more passive remarks in March about being ""ready to respond"" and follow data that showed consumer inflation nudging the upper end of the central bank's projected range. Analysts currently expect the bank to raise its benchmark interest rate in the second half of this year.
The Reserve Bank of India is not expected to raise rates at its meeting on Friday. But inflation holding above the upper end of the central bank's 6% threshold has cast doubt on its current strategy of keeping rates low to bolster growth.
Taiwan's central bank last month surprised markets by raising rates, and some economists expect more hikes to come this year.
""The big picture is that inflation is becoming more challenging for the region's central banks, after being a non-issue in recent years,"" said Krystal Tan, an economist at ANZ.
""On balance, the odds of policy rate adjustments being brought forward are rising.""
SHIFTING VIEWS
Some Asian economies, such as South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand, already commenced their shifts away from pandemic era monetary stimulus last year as surging prices unsettled policymakers.
At the other extreme, Asia's two largest economies are a long way from tightening monetary policy, with the Chinese and Japanese central banks both in no rush to withdraw stimulus as they focus on underpinning growth.
Ironically, some of the world's most circumspect central bankers have been in emerging Asian markets - historically seen as the most vulnerable to Fed rate hikes and inflationary shocks.
In Southeast Asia, government subsidies and price controls have eased pressure on central banks by containing inflationary pressure.
As such, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia remain publicly dogged in their commitment to low rates and talking down domestic prices pressures, but also acknowledge the emerging and persistent threats from global inflation.

Bank Negara Malaysia's governor said last week she recognised that the unprecedented conditions that heralded monetary support during the pandemic were almost over.
""So with the policy rate at its historical low, we are mindful of the consequences of keeping interest rates low for an extended period of time, which could lead to an unhealthy buildup in financial imbalances,"" Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union nations should speed up negotiations on new climate change policies and also increase the ambition of those proposals to quit Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible, 11 countries said on Thursday.
EU countries and European Parliament are negotiating a raft of green measures this year, including a revamp of the EU's carbon market, a 2035 ban on new combustion engine cars, and higher targets to expand renewable energy.
The proposals are designed to cut net EU greenhouse gas emissions 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels. But their links to energy security have come into the spotlight as the bloc seeks to end its reliance on Russian fuels by 2027 - partly through renewable energy and energy savings - in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""Now is the time to be bold and to move ahead with determination with the green transition. Any delay or hesitation will only prolong our energy dependence,"" 11 EU countries said in a joint statement, seen by Reuters and due to be published on Thursday.
""Negotiations on the package should therefore be accelerated and ambitions ramped up,"" they said, urging countries to get behind the proposals.
The statement was led by Denmark and signed by Austria, Germany, Spain, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Latvia, the Netherlands, Sweden and Slovenia.
Danish climate minister Dan Jorgensen said the countries were calling for a ""green road to EU energy independence of Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible.""
Not all countries agree. Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, said on Wednesday the EU should suspend its carbon market, the bloc's main emissions-cutting tool, in response to high energy prices. Poland has said the climate negotiations should be halted to assess the impact of the war. 

Russia supplies 40% of Europe's gas. The 11 countries said the dash to replace that with non-Russian gas must avoid locking in emissions, and ensure the EU stays on track to eliminate its net emissions by 2050. 
Brussels expects the climate proposals, if approved, to cut EU gas use 30% by 2030. A faster expansion of renewable energy and energy savings could also help rein in energy bills, which have soared amid high gas prices in recent months.

(Reuters) - Investors are gauging whether comparatively quick balance sheet reduction by the Federal Reserve could perk up the flattening Treasury yield curve, which has been flashing warnings of a potential recession. 
Minutes from the central bank’s March meeting showed Wednesday that the Fed intends to begin reducing its $9 trillion balance sheet in coming months, eventually reducing its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage backed securities by $95 billion per month – a faster clip than when it undertook quantitative tightening from 2017 to 2019.
The pace of the Fed’s runoff could help boost yields of longer dated Treasuries back above shorter dated ones, depending on how the Treasury restructures its debt issuance to make up for the Fed’s declining purchases. 
That may prove a relief for some market participants, who have been concerned by the inversions of various parts of the yield curve in recent weeks, including the closely watched gap between two-year and 10-year yields. 
Though such an inversion has been a harbinger of past recessions, analysts are divided on whether the signal may be distorted this time, with some saying that the Fed's unprecedented bond purchases are holding longer-dated yields lower than they would otherwise be.
A briefer incursion into negative territory might reduce concerns about a recession, and bolster the view that the inversion was related to Fed bond holdings.
“This should steepen the curve. They obviously are well aware that a flat curve is very concerning to us as market participants,” said John Luke Tyner, fixed income analyst at Aptus Capital Advisors. 
The two-year, 10-year yield curve steepened to 13 basis points on Wednesday, after inverting as far as minus 10 basis points on Monday. Benchmark 10-year yields reached 2.659%, the highest since March 2019. Two-year yields reached 2.602%, the highest since Jan. 2019. 
A steeper yield curve would fly in the face of market consensus. A recent Reuters poll of nearly 60 fixed-income strategists showed no sharp rise was imminently expected in 10-year notes, leaving the yield curve either flat or consistently at risk of further inversion over the coming year.
The yield curve could also steepen if the Fed decides to rely more on balance sheet reduction to tighten financial conditions, which could allow them to be less hawkish on rate hikes. [[L1N2UB1UH]]
The big question is how much is balance sheet reduction worth compared to rate hikes, said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. If the Fed relies more on balance sheet reductions “that might help steepen the curve a little bit, because it’s been the front-end of the curve that’s been furiously selling off and that could start to stabilize.”
With few signs that surging inflation will abate any time soon, expectations of increasingly hawkish Fed policy have grown on Wall Street in recent weeks, along with concerns over its potential consequences. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) on Tuesday became the first big bank to forecast a recession, saying a cocktail of geopolitical upheaval and inflation stemming from the war in Ukraine and hefty Fed tightening would throw the U.S. economy into a downturn by next summer and precipitate a 20% decline in equities. 
The bank’s analysts expect the Fed to raise rates by 50 basis points at its next three meetings ""with balance sheet rundown adding at least another 75bp-equivalent in rate hikes,"" according to a recent report. 
Wednesday’s minutes appeared to jibe with those expectations, setting the stage for meatier interest rate hikes down the line and reinforcing the view that the Fed is squaring off against sky-high rising consumer prices. Policymakers raised interest rates by 25 basis points last month, the first increase since 2018.
“A lot of this is an affirmation of the (Fed’s) hawkishness,” said Christopher Alwine, head of the Global Credit Team in Vanguard Fixed Income Group. “They're trying to slow down the economy, and typically, the pattern of the Fed has been they do that until something breaks, and something usually breaks in the financial markets first.""

Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), meanwhile, said in a recent note the Fed's projected estimates exceeded their forecast of $80 billion per month.
""The overall tone of the minutes showed substantially more concern among policymakers around upside risks (to) inflation compared to relatively more limited discussion about growth and risks to the growth outlook,"" they wrote.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Investors in Russia's international bonds face an increasingly uncertain path to recover their money should Russia ultimately default, while the country itself would face increased financial isolation and hurdles to regain investor confidence.
Russia's ability to fulfill its debt obligations is in focus after sweeping sanctions in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine have frozen nearly half of its $640 billion in gold and foreign reserves and limited access to global payment systems.
The U.S. Treasury Department this week halted Russia's ability to use foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at U.S. financial institutions to pay its debt.
That forced Russia to come up with an alternative to pay more than $600 million in sovereign debt dues, placing the rouble equivalent of those payments for bondholders from so-called unfriendly nations in special accounts at Russia's National Settlement Depository.
How bondholders get to the funds is a big question mark. 
""Bondholders are doing scenario planning now,"" said Kenneth Rivlin, a partner at Allen & Overy’s New York office. ""If they're not, they should be.
""I think it's going to be a long and winding road for bondholders to get recovery.""
Rivlin said the process of getting money transferred from Russia to international bondholders was fraught as financial institutions in the chain would risk sanctions and have to engage external lawyers to seek a license from sanctions authorities to proceed. 
Funds from Russia to bondholders have until now followed the process of going through correspondent bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to paying agent Citi. That unraveled this week, when JPM was prevented by the U.S. Treasury from proceeding.
The amounts involved are not insignificant. JPM analysts said last month that foreigners owned around $79 billion of Russia's debt securities, including local currency bonds, sovereign hard currency euro bonds, and corporate hard currency eurobonds.
Data from industry tracker Morningstar Direct showed large money managers such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), PIMCO and Western Asset had exposure to Russian bonds before the conflict started. PIMCO and BlackRock declined to comment. Western Asset did not immediately respond to a comment for request.
Russia has a 30-day grace period to make the dollar payment, but if the cash does not show up in bondholders' accounts within that time frame it would constitute a default. If that happens, expect bondholders to sue, experts said. 
""I imagine bondholders could sue Russia for nonpayment, and perhaps they would try to get courts to attach frozen Russian assets as payment,"" said Benjamin Coates, a history professor at Wake Forest University who is investigating the history of economic sanctions in the 20th century.
Under sanctions put in place after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at U.S. financial institutions were frozen. But the Treasury Department had been allowing the Russian government to use those funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a case-by-case basis. 
The payments had been allowed to ""prevent disruption to U.S. and European financial markets,"" a U.S. Treasury spokesperson said on Monday.
    ""The first few bond payments were also relatively small, and as the payments were going to get larger, this was the right opportunity to force Russia into more difficult decisions,"" the spokesperson told Reuters. 
Brian O'Toole, nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/brian-o-toole and who was previously at the Treasury, said allowing the payments to be made was likely out of concern about the ripple effect from a potential Russian default. 
The Treasury spokesperson added on Wednesday that the decision to block payments was part of a broader plan to ramp up pressure against Moscow and was in the works before the emergence of grim images from the Ukrainian town of Bucha after being retaken from Russian forces, where bodies of civilians shot to death had been found.
Blocking payments from its frozen reserves would force Moscow to make a choice ""between draining remaining valuable dollar reserves or new revenue coming in or default,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Tuesday.
DEFAULT IMPLICATIONS 
When looking at Russia's fiscal position, with a $250 billion current account surplus, a default on a few billion dollars would be ""largely a symbolic gesture,"" said Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.
Still, a default - which would have been unthinkable before the invasion - could create a host of headaches for Russia. 
While it is already locked out of the international borrowing markets due to the West's sanctions, a default would mean it couldn't regain access until creditors are fully repaid and any legal cases stemming from the default are settled. 

If sanctions are removed at some point in the future, Russia's reputation in financial markets would still be tarnished. That would depress Russia's credit ratings and push up the borrowing rates paid by the Russian government and companies.
""Even if the war ends and sanctions are removed, to what degree will foreign firms and investors be willing to reengage with the Russian economy?"" said Coates.

(Reuters) -Federal Reserve officials in March ""generally agreed"" to cut up to $95 billion a month from the central bank's asset holdings as another tool in the fight against surging inflation, even as the war in Ukraine tempered the first U.S. interest rate increase. 
Minutes of the Fed's March 15-16 meeting showed deepening concern among policymakers that inflation had broadened through the economy, which convinced them to not only raise the target policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point from its near-zero level but also to ""expeditiously"" push it to a ""neutral posture,"" estimated to be around 2.4%.
""Many"" Fed officials said they were prepared to raise rates in half-percentage-point increments in coming policy meetings to try to bring prices under control, even though the rising risks tied to the Ukraine war held them to the standard hike in March, according to the minutes, which were released on Wednesday. 
But they also moved forward with plans to pull out of key financial markets that have been benefiting from massive Fed support since March of 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic prompted the central bank to buy trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
After months of debate, policymakers rallied around a plan to as soon as next month reduce the Fed's holdings of Treasury bonds by up to $60 billion per month and its MBS holdings by up to $35 billion per month, with the amounts phased in over three months or slightly longer, the minutes said.
The pace of the planned balance-sheet rundown, which should have the effect of increasing long-term interest rates, is nearly double that of the Fed's ""quantitative tightening"" from 2017 to 2019, and could also include outright sales of MBS down the road, said the minutes. 
""All participants agreed that elevated inflation and tight labor market conditions warranted commencement of balance sheet runoff.""
SWOLLEN BALANCE SHEET
The details of the balance sheet program included in the minutes are in line with analysts' expectations, and pave the way for it to be set in motion after the Fed's May 3-4 policy meeting.
The Fed unveiled its bond-buying program in the spring of 2020, swelling its holdings of Treasuries and MBS from $3.8 trillion to $8.5 trillion. 
Yields on U.S. Treasury securities ticked higher after the release of the minutes, with the 10-year note yield climbing to 2.6%, while the dollar rose to its highest level since late May against a basket of currencies. Major U.S. stock indexes closed the session sharply lower. 

""I don't think there's anything material that would garner a change in sentiment, as opposed to yesterday where there was a real change and I think it really spooked investors,"" said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz and Associates in Toledo, Ohio, referring to comments made by Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday.
Brainard told a Minneapolis Fed conference that she expected a combination of interest rate increases and a rapid balance sheet runoff to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year, with further tightening to follow as needed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the world's wealthy democratic powers roll out new sanctions against Russia in response to horrifying images of executed Ukrainians in the city of Bucha, it has become clear that the easiest options are now exhausted and stark differences have emerged among allies over next steps. 
The European Union proposed a first stab at curbing Russia's energy sector in response to its invasion of Ukraine launched in February, banning imports of Russian coal. But EU countries remain divided even over this move, much less restricting imports of Russian oil and gas that are more important to their economies. 
The United States and Group of Seven allies announced new sanctions on Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, more state-owned enterprises and more Russian government officials and their family members, cutting them out of the U.S. dollar-based financial system.
The United States also has banned Americans from new investment in Russia and barred Moscow from paying sovereign debt holders with money in U.S. banks. 
Although Russia's heavily restricted rouble rallied to a six-week high on Wednesday, U.S. Treasury officials say the sanctions are starting to turn Russia back into an austere, 1980s Soviet-style closed economy, 
But the U.S. sanctions contain carve-outs allowing Russia to continue collecting revenue from energy exports, which can help fuel its Ukraine invasion. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday that stronger curbs on Russian energy are not yet possible for European allies dependent on Russian oil and gas. 
Russia supplies around 40% of the European Union's natural gas consumption, which the International Energy Agency values at more than $400 million per day. The EU gets a third of its oil imports from Russia, about $700 million per day. 
""We are at the point where we have to take some pain,"" said Benn Steil, international economics director for the Council on Foreign Relations think tank in New York. ""The initial batches of sanctions were crafted as much to not hurt us in the West as much as they were to hurt Russia."" 
(Graphic: Russia's biggest oil customer: China by far - https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/SANCTIONS/dwpkrldklvm/chart.png) 
The divisions in Europe have become more apparent this week. After Lithuania announced on Saturday it would stop importing Russian gas for domestic consumption, Austrian Finance Minister Magnus Brunner voiced opposition to sanctions on Russian oil and gas, telling reporters in Luxembourg that these would hurt Austria more than Russia.
NEXT STEPS
Lack of unity on curbing energy imports means that options are limited to increase pressure further, but the investment ban announced on Wednesday could push more multinational firms to leave Russia, said Daniel Tannebaum, a former compliance officer at the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.
""You could outright start banning trade in more industries,"" a move that would cut Russians off from more types of Western products such as pharmaceuticals, similar to a luxury goods ban imposed in the early days of the war, said Tannebaum, who leads consulting firm Oliver Wyman's anti-financial crime practice.
The United States has been pushing European allies to inflict more pain on Russia while trying to make sure that the alliance against President Vladimir Putin does not fray, a balance that only gets tougher. 
""You've kind of hit the ceiling - on both sides of the Atlantic - for what can be done easily and what can be done in short order,"" said Clayton Allen, U.S. director at the Eurasia Group political risk consultancy, referring to the sanctions.
To move to a tougher round of sanctions, U.S. officials will need to provide some assurances to European countries that energy markets and supplies can be stabilized to avoid severe economic hardship, Allen said. An economically weakened EU helps no one, Allen added. 
""If Western Europe is plunged into a recession, that's going to drastically limit the amount of support - both moral and material - that they can provide to Ukraine,"" Allen said.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to press the case for more actions in Brussels this week at NATO and G7 meetings of foreign ministers. U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo held similar meetings last week in London, Brussels, Paris and Berlin.
There also are still loopholes to close, including continued sales by German and French companies into Russia, and the ongoing hunt for luxury yachts and other assets parked by Russian oligarchs, according to one European diplomat involved in sanctions talks.

LONDON (Reuters) - More than one in five bankers earning at least 125,000 pounds ($164,000) a year in Britain have benefited from non-domiciled tax status, as have many high-paid workers in other sectors, a study showed on Thursday.
Non-dom status - which exempts more than 75,000 mostly foreign nationals in Britain from tax on overseas income - has raised questions about the fairness of the tax system, as it overwhelmingly benefits the very rich.
The research from the University of Warwick and the London School of Economics showed that just 0.3% of British taxpayers earning under 100,000 pounds in 2018 had claimed non-dom status at some point in the past 20 years. By contrast, 27% of taxpayers earning 1-2 million pounds had done so.
Two in five top earners in the oil industry, one in four car industry executives and one in six top-earning sports and film stars also benefited from the status.
""The biggest shock might be to bankers and others working in City jobs, when they realise how many of their colleagues are benefiting from a tax regime they don't have access to,"" said Arun Advani, an assistant economics professor at the University of Warwick.
Non-dom status is only available to British residents who claim that their 'domicile' - the centre of their personal and financial interests - is outside the United Kingdom.
The top three nationalities for non-doms in 2018 were the United States, India and France, and 93% were born outside the United Kingdom. 
Non-doms were most likely to live in central London and around 80% of them reported their main source of income was from employment or a pension, while 20% lived off investment income or other overseas earnings.
""A significant minority of non-doms do appear to be the 'rentier rich',"" the report said.

The research is based on anonymised individual tax data from 1997 to 2018 provided by Britain's revenue office.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States targeted Russian banks and elites with a new round of sanctions on Wednesday, including banning Americans from investing in Russia, in response to what President Joe Biden condemned as ""major war crimes"" by Russian forces in Ukraine.
The new sanctions hit Russia's Sberbank, which holds one-third of Russia's total banking assets, and Alfabank, the country's fourth largest financial institution, U.S. officials said. But energy transactions were exempted from the latest measures, they said.
The United States is also sanctioning Russian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's wife and daughter, and senior members of Russia's security council, the officials said.
""There's nothing less happening than major war crimes,"" Biden said in a speech to labor leaders, referring to the Ukrainian town of Bucha retaken from Russian forces, where bodies of civilians shot to death had been found.
""Responsible nations have to come together to hold these perpetrators accountable,"" he said. ""And together with our allies and our partners, we're going to keep raising economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin.""
Grim images emerging from Bucha include a mass grave and the bodies of people shot at close range, some of them bound, prompting calls for tougher action against Moscow and an international investigation.
Russia, which says it launched a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24, denies targeting civilians and said images of the deaths were a ""monstrous forgery"" staged by the West. 
Wednesday's ""full blocking sanctions"" will freeze Sberbank and Alfabank's assets ""touching the U.S financial system,"" the White House said.
Britain also froze Sberbank's assets, and said it would ban imports of Russian coal by the end of this year as part of a coordinated allied effort to ""starve Putin's war machine.""
Sberbank and Alfabank said the new sanctions would not have a significant impact on their operations.
Also among those sanctioned were Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president and ex-prime minister and one of Putin's closest allies. Others included Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Justice Minister Konstantin Chuychenko.
Later on Wednesday, Biden signed an executive order that prohibited ""new investment in the Russian Federation by a United States person, wherever located."" This includes a ban on venture capital and mergers, officials said.
Even as new sanctions were rolled out, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was critical of some in the West and said he could not tolerate ""any indecisiveness.""
""The only thing that we are lacking is the principled approach of some leaders -- political leaders, business leaders -- who still think that war and war crimes are not something as horrific as financial losses,"" he told Irish lawmakers.
European Union diplomats on Wednesday failed to approve new sanctions, as technical issues needed to be addressed, including on whether a ban on coal would affect existing contracts, sources said.
'SOVIET-STYLE LIVING STANDARDS'
Washington targeted Putin's daughters because it believes many of his assets ""are hidden with family members,"" a senior Biden administration official said.
Putin's daughter Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova is a tech executive whose work supports the Russian government and its defense industry, according to details released by the U.S. Treasury Department.
His other daughter, Maria Vladimirovna Vorontsova, ""leads state-funded programs that have received billions of dollars from the Kremlin toward genetics research and are personally overseen by Putin,"" the Treasury said.
By cutting off Russia's largest banks, the United States is ""dramatically escalating"" the financial shock on Russia, a senior administration official told reporters.
""The reality is the country is descending into economic and financial and technological isolation,"" the official said. ""And at this rate, it will go back to Soviet-style living standards from the 1980s.""
White House Economic Council Director Brian Deese said that, according to estimates, the Russian economy will contract by 10% to 15% in 2022 and that inflation in Russia is running at 200%.
Daniel Fried, a former State Department coordinator for sanctions policy in the Obama administration, said the latest package ""basically makes Sberbank untouchable."" But he added: ""What is missing is what are we going to do on oil and gas,"" Russia's most lucrative exports.
Under the latest sanctions, special U.S. Treasury licenses exempted transactions with the targeted banks involving European allies' purchases of Russian oil and gas.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said flexibility on Russian energy transactions was needed because many European countries remain heavily dependent on Russian oil and gas ""and they are committed to making the transition away from that dependence as rapidly as possible.""
In the latest in a series of law enforcement actions against Russia, the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday charged Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev with violating sanctions imposed on Moscow after its invasion of Ukraine, saying he provided financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea.

Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the department is cooperating with prosecutors in Europe to start collecting evidence of possible Russian war crimes.
Seeking to further ratchet up pressure on Putin, the United States is also imposing full blocking sanctions on what the White House called ""critical major Russian state-owned enterprises."" Those entities included United Aircraft and United Shipbuilding, the White House's Deese said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The International Monetary Fund (IMF) cut Japan's economic growth forecast on Thursday and urged policymakers to consider preparing a contingency plan in case the Ukraine crisis derails a fragile recovery.
While rising commodity costs could push up inflation, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) must maintain ultra-easy policy for a prolonged period to sustainably hit its 2% inflation target, the IMF said in a staff report after its Article 4 policy consultation with Japan.
""Escalation of the Ukraine conflict poses significant downside risks to the Japanese economy,"" the IMF said, pointing to the potential hit to trade and noting that rising commodity prices could stifle domestic demand.
""In view of elevated uncertainty including from the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine, the authorities could consider preparing a contingency plan that is readily implementable"" in case its economy faces a severe shock, it said.
The IMF said it now expects Japan's economy to grow 2.4% this year, lower than a projection for 3.3% expansion made in January, due to an expected contraction in the first quarter and the spillover effects of the Ukraine war.
Domestic demand will likely slow from surging commodity prices, while geo-political tensions and a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China's growth were risks to exports, it said.
On prices, the IMF said Japan will likely see inflation momentum pick up on higher commodity prices, and an expected rebound in consumption as coronavirus infection cases fall.
""A prolonged period of monetary policy accommodation will be required,"" however, as headline consumer inflation is expected to stay at 1.0% this year, it said.
The IMF repeated its recommendation for the BOJ to make its policy more sustainable, such as by steepening the yield curve by targeting a shorter maturity than the current 10-year yield.
The BOJ said it saw no need to adjust its current framework and ""expressed concern"" over the IMF's recommendation to shorten the yield curve target, according to the staff report.

Under a policy dubbed yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ guides short-term interest rates at -0.1% and the 10-year government bond yield around 0%. The 10-year yield cap has been criticised by some analysts for flattening the yield curve and crushing the margin of financial institutions.
The IMF released the final version of its Article 4 staff report, signed off by its executive board, after issuing a preliminary finding in January.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia edged closer to a potential default on its international debt on Wednesday as it set aside roubles to pay holders of international bonds that need to be repaid in dollars and said it would continue to do so as long as its foreign exchange reserves are blocked by sanctions.
The United States on Monday stopped Russia from paying holders of its sovereign debt more than $600 million from frozen reserves held at U.S. banks, saying Moscow had to choose between draining its dollar reserves at home and default.
Russia has not defaulted on its external debt since reneging on payments due after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, but its bonds have remerged as a flashpoint in the diplomatic crisis and sanctions tit-for-tat between Moscow and western capitals.
""This speeds up the timeline around when Russia runs out of space on willingness and ability to pay,"" one fund manager holding one of the bonds due for payment on Monday said.
The Kremlin said it would continue to pay its dues.
""Russia has all necessary resources to service its debts... If this blockade continues and payments aimed for servicing debts are blocked, it (future payment) could be made in roubles,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. 
Moscow has managed to make a number of foreign exchange coupon payments on some of its 15 international bonds with a face value of around $40 billion outstanding before the United States stopped such transactions. 
While sanctions have frozen roughly half of $640 billion in Russia's gold and foreign currency reserves, the country still receives billions of dollars from exporting crude and gas.
Russia's finance ministry said on Wednesday it had to pay roubles to holders of its dollar-denominated Eurobonds maturing in 2022 and 2042 as a foreign bank had refused to process an order to pay $649 million to holders of its sovereign debt.
The finance ministry said the foreign bank, which it did not name, rejected Russia's order to pay coupons on the two bonds and also did not process payment of a Eurobond maturing in 2022.
Russia's ability to fulfil its debt obligations is in focus after sweeping sanctions in response to what Moscow calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine have frozen nearly half of its reserves and limited access to global payment systems.
The United States on Wednesday targeted Russian banks and elites with a new round of sanctions in response to what President Joe Biden condemned as ""major war crimes"" by Russian forces in Ukraine.
'ARTIFICIAL SITUATION'
JP Morgan, which had been processing payments on Russian sovereign bonds as a correspondent bank, was stopped by the U.S. Treasury from doing for the two payments due on Monday, a source familiar with the situation said. JP Morgan declined to comment. 
Russia may consider allowing foreign holders of its 2022 and 2042 Eurobonds to convert rouble payments into foreign currencies once access to its forex accounts is restored, the finance ministry said.
Until then, a rouble equivalent of Eurobond payments aimed at bondholders from so-called unfriendly nations will be kept in special 'C' type accounts at Russia's National Settlement Depository, the ministry added. 
Both bonds were issued in 2012 and stipulate payment in U.S. dollars - unlike some bonds that were sold later and allow for payment in alternative currencies such as euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc or even rouble. 
Russia has a 30-day grace period to make the dollar payment, but if the cash does not show up in bondholders account within that time frame it would constitute a default, global rating agencies have said. 
Moscow introduced stringent capital controls to shore up its currency in the wake of the war, which in combination with financial sanctions make it impossible for foreign investors to repatriate any payments.
Default warnings were flashing brightly again on Wednesday. 
One-year upfront credit default swaps - a way of insuring exposure to Russia's sovereign debt - jumped to 69 points from 60 points, according to IHS Markit.
Russia's longer-dated dollar bonds, where trading has all but ceased, were quoted well below 20 cents in the dollar, while euro-denominated issues were bid at 15 cents. 
DEFAULT FALLOUT 
Russia dismissed this as being a default situation. 
""In theory, a default situation could be created but this would be a purely artificial situation,"" Peskov said. ""There are no grounds for a real default."" 
Bondholders had been tracking bond payments since sweeping sanctions and counter measures from Moscow which have severed Russia from the global financial system. 
A Russian default would have been unthinkable before the invasion with the country still holding an investment grade rating as recently as February from major ratings agencies.
Russia is already locked out of the international borrowing markets due to the West's sanctions, but a default would mean it could not regain access until creditors are fully repaid and any legal cases stemming from the default are settled.
A default could also create a host of headaches if countries or companies that would normally trade with Russia have self-imposed rules prohibiting transactions with a defaulted entity.

Furthermore, Russian debt default insurance policies known as credit default swaps (CDS) taken out by investors for this kind of situation could be triggered. JP Morgan estimates there are roughly $6 billion worth of outstanding CDS that would need to be paid out.
Russia on Wednesday paid coupons on four OFZ treasury rouble bonds. These were once popular for their high yields among foreign investors, who are now blocked from receiving payments as a result of sanctions and Russian retaliation.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - With an election looming, Canada's province of Ontario is moving to rein in surging home prices with populist measures like a bigger foreign-buyer tax, but economists warn rising interest rates are likely to do most of the work.
Already there are signs the red-hot markets are cooling after last month's central bank rate hike. Toronto's average selling price dropped 2.6% in March from February, data showed on Tuesday, and annual gains slowed.
""The higher rates will douse the flames somewhat,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. ""We likely will see sales pull back from elevated levels and almost certainly see a slowing in unsustainable house price growth.""
Mortgages are fast becoming more expensive with the Bank of Canada signaling multiple hikes this year. Economists are betting on a rare half-point increase in April, with the policy rate seen above pre-pandemic levels by year-end.
This is a sharp shift from ultra-low borrowing costs that helped drive a pandemic price surge. Canada's average home price soared 50.6% over two years to a record high of C$816,720 ($654,213). (Graphic: Canadian housing prices soared amid the pandemic - https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-ECONOMY/HOUSING/gdpzyjaqavw/chart.png) 
With housing affordability becoming a political liability, governments are stepping up efforts to bring prices under check. Housing is set to be a focal point in Thursday's federal budget, one senior government source said.
The budget will include a ""significant"" crackdown on foreign homebuyers, CTV National News reported on Wednesday, and the federal government will set aside C$4 billion to help municipalities accelerate construction of residential units. 
In Ontario, where voters go to the polls in early June, Premier Doug Ford last week laid out plans to ""cut red tape"" on new home construction and to boost the foreign-buyer tax to 20% from 15%, while also expanding it to cover the entire province.
""Going after foreign speculation is always very popular. So I think that's an easy one, politically, to do,"" said Mike Moffatt, a senior director at the Smart Prosperity Institute think tank.
Non-residents held just over 168,000 residential properties in Ontario in 2020, worth C$66.9 billion, or about 3% of all owned properties, said Andy Yan, director of the City Program at Simon Fraser University, citing official data.
While that is a relatively small stake overall, foreign capital plays an outsized role in certain markets, like newer-build Toronto condominiums, and can help drive price escalation, he said.
Yan also found that taxes can shift demand. By looking at the Bank of China's Canadian mortgage disclosures, Yan mapped a surge of new lending in Ontario after British Columbia imposed a foreign-buyer levy in mid-2016.

(Reuters) -The Federal Reserve might have raised interest rates by half a percentage point last month to deal a more decisive blow to soaring inflation, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine gave policymakers cold feet, minutes of the U.S. central bank's March meeting showed on Wednesday.
""Many participants noted that ... they would have preferred a 50-basis-point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting,"" the minutes said. ""In light of greater near-term uncertainty associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they judged that a 25-basis-point increase would be appropriate at this meeting,"" the minutes stated. 
Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, days after several Fed policymakers had indicated an openness to lifting the benchmark overnight interest rate by half a percentage point at the March 15-16 meeting. 
In an appearance before Congress a week later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell called the war a ""game changer"" and revealed he would support a quarter-percentage-point hike, effectively telegraphing the Fed's decision ahead of time and delivering some measure of policy certainty even as financial markets remained on edge from the invasion.
The minutes show that Powell's view on a smaller incremental rate rise was then widely shared by his colleagues, who duly decided at the March meeting to raise the federal funds rate to a range of 0.25%-0.50% from the previous near-zero level, and signaled that borrowing costs would continue to rise this year and in 2023. 
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard dissented, preferring a bigger move in the face of inflation that's running more than three times the Fed's 2% target.
""Looks like they delayed a 50-(basis) point increase because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which makes sense,"" said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz and Associates in Toledo, Ohio.
Primary among the Fed's fears at the time was heightened uncertainty about the impact on the U.S. economy from the war and the West's sanctions on Russia, which have driven up energy and food prices.
'GET THE MARKET READY'
Since the March meeting and as the war has dragged on with no clear end in sight, a number of Fed policymakers including Powell have noted that the primary risk from the conflict is further upward pressure on inflation, not a hit to U.S. economic growth, bolstering the need for bigger U.S. rate hikes.
In stating that a half-percentage-point hike would have been in the offing if not for the conflict in Ukraine, Fed policymakers are putting financial markets on notice of what's ahead, said Joseph Lavorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis.
""They’re mentioning that just to get the market ready for the 50,"" Lavorgna said. 
That message seemed to have gotten through, even before the release of the minutes. Market participants are betting that a half-percentage-point rate increase is still ahead, likely not just for the upcoming May meeting, but at the June and July meetings as well. A string of three 50-point increases would mark the sharpest increase in the fed funds rate since the early 1980s. 

""Many participants noted that one or more 50-basis-point increases in the target range could be appropriate at future meetings, particularly if inflation pressures remained elevated or intensified,"" the minutes said. 
The Fed's last half-percentage-point rate hike was in 1995.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada will earmark C$15 billion ($12 billion) over five years for a Growth Fund to attract private investment in new and green technologies, a senior government source said on Wednesday, a day before this year's budget presentation.
The money being set aside for the fund will come from the ""existing fiscal framework"" and the government will seek to attract C$3 of private investment for every C$1 of public funding, the source said.
The finance ministry declined to comment. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland is due to present the 2022 budget around 4 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) on Thursday. 
""This is about attracting international capital and investment into Canada,"" the source said, in part because the transition to a net-zero emissions economy ""is going to require huge technological shifts and investments and new industries.""
The fund, to be drawn from money set aside in the past, will be outlined in this year's budget, but it will take a few months to flesh out its mandate and make operational, said the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record. 
Investment professionals at arm's length from the government will run the fund, though it will be held accountable by a ministry, the source said without providing details. 
The aim of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government is to use the fund to stand up projects that may not be possible without public support. Private international or domestic investors will be eligible to use it, the source said.
Reuters this week reported Canada would invest in a critical minerals strategy in the budget. That investment of at least C$2 billion will be separate.
However, as an example, the Growth Fund could also be used to develop a critical minerals mine in a remote corner of the country that would be too costly for a company to do on its own, the source said. 
Trudeau's government has already committed to spend more on defense following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The government could add as much as C$8 billion in defense spending in the budget, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) reported on Wednesday, citing a source.

No timeline for the spending was given and it can be spread out over multiple years. The increase in expenditure will be focused on upgrades to NORAD, which is the North American defense organization, buying weapons for Ukraine, and equipment shortfalls in the armed forces, CBC said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. markets regulator on Wednesday voted to propose new rules that would require platforms that execute trades of security-based swaps to register with the agency in a bid to increase transparency of the over-the-counter derivatives market.
The proposals from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would fulfill a mandate under the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Law, passed in the aftermath of the 2007-09 global financial crisis, to bring clearer oversight to the opaque multitrillion-dollar derivatives market, the agency said. 
The measures, which are subject to public consultation, would require platforms known as swaps execution facilities (SEF) to register with the SEC and would see the agency more closely regulate platforms that trade security-based swaps.
Wednesday's package of proposals, known as Regulation Swaps Execution, was voted on unanimously by the agency's three Democratic officials and its lone Republican commissioner.
They would better harmonize the SEC's rules with a similar but more sweeping rule introduced by the Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC).
While the CFTC oversees all financial contracts in which two counterparties agree to exchange or “swap” payments with each other as a result of changes in interest rates or commodity prices, the SEC's rules would focus on swaps based on a security or a credit default swap.
SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the rules would work to bring together buyers and sellers with transparent, pre-trade pricing, lowering risk in the marketplace, and would ultimately protect investors. 
The SEC's new proposals would see SEFs implement a version of the so-called trade execution requirement - and its cross-border application - which makes it unlawful to engage in a swap transaction unless it is first submitted for clearing to a derivatives clearing organization.
The move aims to mitigate conflicts of interest at newly registered security-based SEFs, exchanges and clearing agencies and would promote competition and market integrity, the SEC said.
The measures would not apply to platforms already registered with the SEC as a clearing agency and those whose operations are designed to further the accuracy of end-of-day valuations, it added.

Industry groups praised the SEC's new proposals to build out the regulatory framework.
Providing broader access to all market participants and harmonizing the regulatory framework with the CFTC would promote more ""fair, open, competitive and transparent markets,"" said Bryan Corbett, who leads the Managed Funds Association, a Washington-based group representing hedge funds.

“My biggest takeaway is that when the fed talked about the potential need for 50 basis point hikes, it was sort of explicitly clear that it wasn’t at every meeting from here on out. And when you started to see some of the verbiage and some of the Fed funds pricing and futures pricing for the rest of the year, you were getting some uber-hawks out there that were thinking even more than 250 basis points Fed funds rate by the end of the year. Now that sort of gives way that maybe they are going to try and use some of the balance sheet reduction to offset some of the need to hike so fast. I don’t know exactly what it means for risk assets from here.”
“We have gotten spoiled with the amount of liquidity the Fed has pumped into the market and it’s like staying out late and drinking – it is all good until the hangover kicks in – and we are sort of at the place where the hangover is kicking in. And while the economy is doing fairly well it is a tighter liquidity type of scenario.”
RYAN DETRICK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, LPL FINANCIAL, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA
“We finally have a firm number: $95 billion a month, is (the rate at which the Fed) is going to shrink the balance sheet and in all likelihood will start next month. So now we have a firm number to the tapering we’ve been talking about for quite some time now.”
“Yields were higher once again, with jitters in the bond market over the potential tapering, and the  impact it could have on the market when the largest holder of bonds begins to sell.”
“There’s a realization that some of the doves have come over to the 50 basis point (interest rate)  hike territory and that is likely what we’re going to see at the next several meetings going forward as inflationary pressures remain elevated.”
“The Ukraine conflict uncertainty likely prevented a 50 basis point hike last month, so it could put a little cold water on extremely hawkish policy. But still, we know multiple hikes are coming very soon.”
“10-year yields continue to soar higher, punishing growth stocks.”
JOE SALUZZI, CO-MANAGER OF TRADING, THEMIS TRADING, CHATHAM, NEW JERSEY
“The bonds are saying this wasn't as bad as anticipated. Stocks will jerk around like this and go back and forth for a while just because it's mostly algorithm trading and a lot of people just chasing others around.”
“Fed minutes could have been a lot worse and the market at this point sees it as a little bit of a relief…Yesterday her (Brainard) comments were fairly hawkish and today these minutes appear to be pretty much in line or actually a little bit maybe less hawkish than what the market expected when it comes to balance sheet reduction.”
ALAN LANCZ, PRESIDENT, ALAN B LANCZ & ASSOCIATES, TOLEDO, OHIO
    ""Looks like they delayed a 50-point increase because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which makes sense. I don't think there's really anything earth shattering... I think people are reading it, and realizing it's not really a change in stance. Yesterday's (news) was much more material to investors and their psyche than the release of the minutes.

“There's nothing new here from what I see, and that's probably why the market is not reacting. But clearly we've got rate hikes ahead of us, and we have a shrinking balance sheet ahead of us. The Fed is determined to rein in inflation, and we just hope and pray that there will there will be a soft landing of the economy and not a hard landing that sends us into a recession.”

ROME (Reuters) -Italy on Wednesday slashed its growth estimate for this year as the war in Ukraine weighs on the economy, while confirming a previous budget deficit target of 5.6% of national output.
The Treasury's annual Economic and Financial Document (DEF) forecasts gross domestic product in the euro zone's third largest economy will grow by 3.1%, down from a 4.7% projection made last September.
For 2023, the government sees GDP growth of 2.4%, down from the previous target of 2.8%.
""It's clear the war has caused a weakening of the outlook,"" Prime Minister Mario Draghi told reporters after cabinet signed off on the targets. ""Confidence has diminished a lot, consumers and companies see a less positive future.""
The economy probably contracted by 0.5% in the first quarter, the DEF showed. It is expected to recover between April and June, the document said, while acknowledging mounting difficulties connected with events in Ukraine.
A lasting war ""would have strong repercussions on inflation as well as on economic growth"", it added.
In a worst-case scenario assuming an embargo on Russian gas and oil and serious shortages in supplies, the Treasury estimated growth of just 0.6% in 2022 and 0.4% next year.
Several independent bodies have already cut their GDP forecasts for Italy well below the government's. The Milan-based Ref think tank sees 2022 growth of 2.0%, while employers lobby Confindustria forecasts 1.9%.
Confindustria chief Carlo Bonomi has said the country is already facing recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP. Draghi told reporters he may be right.
""Bonomi is seeing things as they are,"" he said. ""At the moment you're more likely to be right by being pessimistic than by being optimistic.""
The government forecast inflation, measured using the consumption deflator, of 5.8% this year and 2.1% in 2023.
The public debt, proportionally the highest in the euro zone after Greece's, is targeted at 147% of GDP this year, down from a previous 149.4%, and seen declining to 145.2% in 2023.
In confirming the 5.6% deficit goal this year, Draghi is helped by the fact the fiscal gap is on course for 5.1% under an unchanged policy scenario.
This allows potential leeway worth 9.5 billion euros ($10.38 billion) of additional spending or tax cuts. 
However, 4.5 billion euros will go to finance schemes to cap energy prices approved earlier this year that were only temporarily funded, leaving 5 billion euros available for the government to spend this year without hiking the 5.6% target.
Rome plans to use these resources in April to keep capping energy costs, extend financing for existing guarantee schemes on bank loans and help Ukrainian refugees, the DEF said.

The deficit is seen at 3.9% of GDP in 2023, unchanged from the previous target. It should fall to 3.3% in 2024 and return below the European Union's 3% ceiling in 2025.

Investing.com -- Federal Reserve officials discussed the prospect of stepping up the pace of monetary policy tightening including plans to cut the size of the central bank’s balance sheet after the May meeting, the Fed’s March meeting minutes showed Wednesday. 
""[P]articipants agreed they had made substantial progress on the plan and that the Committee was well placed to begin the process of reducing the size of the balance sheet as early as after the conclusion of its upcoming meeting in May,"" according to the Fed minutes. 
The minutes also detailed plans about the size and pace of balance reduction, which will be phased-in over the course of three months or modestly longer. 
Under the plan, the fed would allow about $60 billion in Treasury securities and about $35 billion in agency MBS to roll off its balance sheet, which current stands at nearly $9 trillion. 
The size of balance sheet reduction at a size of $95 billion a month is significantly larger than the start of the previous balance sheet reduction program in 2018. 
In the Fed's previous balance sheet reduction program, the central bank allowed about $10 billion of securities a month - $6 billion a month in Treasury securities and $4 billion in mortgage-backed securities a month – to roll off its balance sheet, with a view to gradually speed up the process.      
But as the pace of the runoff reached $50 billion a month, the central bank was forced to stop the process in late 2019 after a key short-term overnight lending rate, which supports the plumbing of the financial system, jumped and risked the stability of funding markets. 
The Fed, however, appears keen to avoid a repeat of taper tantrum prevalent in the previous tightening cycle, with members agreeing that it ""would be appropriate to first slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances were above the level the Committee judged to be consistent with ample reserves.""
At the conclusion of its previous meeting on Mar. 16, the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-setting arm, raised its benchmark rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%.
The Fed’s decision in March was also accompanied with several projections on the path of economic growth, inflation, and unemployment. 
But it was the central bank’s estimates on rate hikes that caught many by surprise. Fed members seemingly backed six rate hikes for 2022, forecasting the benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end. 
The minutes revealed that many ""participants ... would have preferred a 50 basis point increase in the target range"" at the March meeting, citing the upsides risks to inflation. But ultimately opted for a 25 basis point hike, pointing to ""greater near-term uncertainty associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.""
Still, the prospect of one of more 50 basis points rate hikes at upcoming meetings remains on the table as inflation hasn't shown any sign of abating. 
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 5.4% in the 12 months through March, the fastest gain since April 1983.
About 80% of traders expect the Fed to hike rates by 50 basis points at its May meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. "

In a three-plus hour hearing at the House Financial Services Committee, Yellen got an earful of concerns -- and voiced many of her own -- about the two largest global rivals to the U.S.
The Treasury chief said U.S. officials wouldn’t take part in some Group of 20 meetings this year if Russia were allowed to participate. A spokesperson later clarified that she was referring to a gathering of finance ministers scheduled for this month in Washington.
“I’ve made clear to my colleagues in Indonesia that we will not be participating in a number of meetings if the Russians are there,” Yellen told lawmakers.
Yellen responded somewhat positively to a proposal from Republican Representative Andy Barr of Kentucky to create an escrow account for proceeds from Russian oil and gas sales. She called it “worth exploring” as the U.S. and its allies seek ways to tighten sanctions on Russia amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
“We have a way for Russia to sell oil and gain proceeds in the form of a general license,” Yellen told Barr. “But the license is temporary, it will expire. We need probably a better mechanism. It is a constructive suggestion that we could work with you on.”
Yellen also made clear the Biden administration would be prepared to use all its sanctions tools against China if Beijing moved aggressively toward Taiwan.
“We’ve shown we can” impose significant pain on aggressive countries, as evidenced by sanctions against Russia, Yellen said. “You should not doubt our ability and resolve to do the same in other situations.”

Under the post-World War Two U.S. scheme known as the Marshall Plan, the United States granted Europe the present-day equivalent of some $200 billion over four years in economic and technical assistance.
""I think that what we need for Ukraine, at the end of the day, is an updated model of the Marshall Plan,"" Hahn told a news briefing.
Hahn said it would help Ukraine recover quickly, rather than over decades, from the massive destruction by the Russian army and would lead to a faster convergence of Ukraine with the European Union. 
Kyiv has applied to become a formal candidate to join the 27 nation bloc. Even in peacetime that process is long, and it has been made almost impossible by the war raging in the country.
Hahn did not give any estimate of how much money could be needed, but said the effort of rebuilding Ukraine could not be shouldered by Europe alone and that probably G20 countries would have to participate, including Russia.
Hahn reiterated that for now the EU was not planning to start another joint borrowing scheme to deal with the economic and social consequences for the bloc of the war in Ukraine.

He noted that there was still plenty unused for cheap loans in the EU's recovery fund that governments could request. He said that of the total 380 billion euros of cheap loans available in the fund, governments have so far asked for only 166 billion, leaving 214 billion euros still available.
He also said that to cover some expenses related to dealing with millions of Ukrainian refugees who fled to EU countries since the war started on Feb 24, member nations could use some of the funds allotted to them under the 2021-2027 EU budget.

Equities largely lost ground after the United States announced a new round of sanctions targeting Russian financial institutions, as well as Kremlin officials and their family members. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" and denies targeting civilians.
The new sanctions hit Russia's Sberbank, which holds one-third of Russia's total banking assets, and Alfa Bank, the country's fourth-largest financial institution, U.S. officials said. But energy transactions were exempted from the latest measures, the officials said.
The rouble-based MOEX Russian index ended the day 1.9% lower at 2,611.4, heading further away from an all-time high of 4,292.68 reached in October.
Shares in Sberbank underperformed the market after the new sanctions, falling 8.1% to 141.60 roubles ($1.78) per piece.
Its rival, the second-largest lender VTB, shed 4.9% on the day.
Sberbank and Russia's largest private lender Alfa Bank have both said new U.S. sanctions would not have a significant impact on the banks' operations.
Downside pressure on shares emanating from negative sentiment around news on Western sanctions could be limited as the government has promised to support Russian companies by buying their stocks with money channelled from the rainy-day National Wealth Fund.
The Russian stock market is showing ""miraculous resilience"" to sanctions and a rapid drop in activity in the domestic manufacturing and services sectors in the absence of foreign investors that are still barred from taking part in trading in Russia, Finam brokerage said in a note.
The dollar-denominated RTS index received support from the weaker dollar and rose 3% to 1034.79.
ROUBLE RALLY
The Russian rouble extended recovery gains on Wednesday, returning to levels seen before Russia sent tens of thousands of troops to Ukraine on Feb. 24 as it headed further away from an all-time low of nearly 121.53 to the dollar and 132.41 to the euro it hit in Moscow trade in March.
The Russian currency also shrugged fears that Russia edged closer to a potential default on its international debt as it paid dollar bondholders in roubles and said it would continue to do so as long as its foreign exchange reserves are blocked by sanctions.
The rouble added more than 4% on the day to 79.70 to the dollar, having earlier hit 79.01, a level last seen on Feb. 23. The market turnover in the main session reached $706 million, far below an average of $4 billion to $6 billion seen before Feb. 24.
Against the euro, the rouble gained 5% to 87 after hitting 85.5975, its strongest since Feb. 17, supported artificially by capital control measures and a ban on buying cash forex.
The rouble is driven by export-focused companies selling foreign currency and a low activity of importers, Promsvyazbank said, adding that it cannot be ruled out that the Russian currency firms to 74-76 to the greenback in coming days.
The rouble is also likely to retain support from the central bank's monetary policy as inflation accelerated to a seven-year high of 16.7%.

The central bank, which raised its key rate to 20% in an emergency move in late February, will next meet on rates on April 29.

The Russian economy is ""reeling"" from the sanctions imposed after the late February invasion, Yellen told the House Financial Services Committee. The market for rubles has become so distorted by actions of the Russian government and its central bank to limit capital outflows that ""you should not infer anything"" from the value of the ruble, which fell to a record low against the U.S. dollar immediately after the invasion but has since retraced most of those losses.

261,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 12:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve policy makers on Wednesday said officials would continue to tighten monetary policy, ahead of a key disclosure expected to shed light on how quickly they plan to trim the central bank’s bloated balance sheet.
“I expect a series of deliberate, methodical hikes as the year continues and the data evolve,” Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker told the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday. “I also anticipate that we will begin to reduce our holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities soon.”
Long-awaited details of how officials plan to proceed on shrinking the Fed’s $8.9 trillion balance sheet are expected when the central bank publishes minutes of its March 15-16 policy meeting at 2 p.m. in Washington.
U.S. central bankers began to remove pandemic emergency stimulus last month, raising the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point to a range of 0.25% to 0.5% and penciling in seven increases for all of 2022 to confront the hottest inflation in four decades. Chair Jerome Powell has said they could begin to start allowing their asset holdings to run off as early as May. 
In addition, remarks on Tuesday by Fed Vice Chair nominee Lael Brainard that they could move rapidly on asset rolloff helped sent yields on 10-year Treasury notes sharply higher, as investors digested what they viewed as a more hawkish tone from the typically dovish policy maker, who is awaiting Senate confirmation to become vice chair. 
Her comments were the latest to affirm the Fed’s commitment to tackling price pressures that have surged way above their 2% target and look likely to stay too elevated after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushed the cost of food and energy higher.
Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin separately told the Central Maryland Chamber on Wednesday that officials could move faster on rate increases if needed to get inflation under control.
“We have moved at a 50-basis-point clip in the past and we could certainly do that again if it is necessary to prevent inflation expectations from unanchoring,” Barkin said. “I’d say it is a judgment call.”
Powell has previously said a 50 basis-point increase was on the table for the Fed’s May-3-4 meeting if needed and investors have leaned into that bet, according to pricing in interest-rate futures markets which also show around another 220 basis points of tightening this year.
Bother Harker and Barkin tempered their remarks by noting the risk that officials push too hard on the policy brakes and tip the economy into recession -- a concern that’s been flagged by economists and also potentially indicated by the inversion of certain segments of the U.S. Treasury yield curve -- a traditional harbinger of economic downturns in the past.
“We do need to cool the economy a little bit, not take it into recession, not even close, but cool the housing market a little bit,” Harker said. “But we don’t want to overdo it. This is where we in the policy world are trying to thread this needle, of getting inflation under control but not stomping on the brakes so hard that we create real problems on the other side.”

Orban, whose government has pursued close business relations with Moscow for over a decade, swept to power for a fourth consecutive term in elections on Sunday.
Orban stabilised the economy with a host of windfall taxes on banks, retail and energy firms after taking power in a 2010 landslide that helped reduce Hungary's budget deficit while avoiding austerity measures, shoring up Orban's poll standings.
""Whether we will need special taxes on multinational companies or others like the ones levied after 2010 will depend on the decision of the European Union,"" Orban told a news conference.
""If the EU cannot tame the rise in energy prices, then we will have to take some measures in Hungary. They call them taxes on windfall profits, which are earned in certain sectors and which can help fund policies protecting families.""
He did not elaborate on what sectors could be affected of the amount of revenue targeted from any such measure. Orban also needs to reduce a swelling budget deficit.
Faced with a surge in inflation to near 15-year highs ahead of the vote, the 58-year-old nationalist leader imposed caps on basic foods, fuels and mortgages, extending price curbs on household energy bills in place since 2015.

However, economists say the increase in European gas prices is making the cap on household bills unsustainable, while the cap on fuel prices in place since mid-November is causing losses for Hungarian energy group MOL.
""The price caps measures have an expiry, they will stay in place until then definitely, and I would like to keep them as much as possible later as well, we are negotiating ... we need to have talks with banks, MOL... food retailers,"" Orban said.

""We've committed to raising rates methodically..we are both raising the Fed funds rate and reducing the balance sheet and both will have an effect of slowing down the economy, but again doing that in a way that isn't so aggressive that we risk putting the economy in recession,"" Harker said during an event held virtually by the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce at which he largely repeated comments made the previous week about his outlook for the economy.

More details are set to emerge later on Wednesday about the Fed's plan to cut several trillion dollars from its balance sheet when it publishes minutes of the central bank's last policy meeting.

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve ""has some time"" to raise rates towards a more neutral level, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said Wednesday, a counter to calls for a faster pace of rate increases beginning at the upcoming May Fed meeting.
""There has been a lot of debate about whether the Fed should move faster"" by raising rates in half-point rather than quarter-point increments, Barkin said in comments to the Central Maryland Chamber.

Russia’s attack on Ukraine has undermined confidence that world powers would be able to prevent a crisis from similarly erupting over Taiwan, a democratically governed island of more than 23 million people and key global source of semiconductors. China has long claimed Taiwan as a renegade province and threatened to invade to prevent its independence.
Last month, China warned the U.S. against trying to build what it called a Pacific version of NATO, while declaring that security disputes over Taiwan and Ukraine were “not comparable at all.”

China will establish a financial stability protection fund to beef up its ability to cope with major financial risks, and set up a comprehensive cross-agency mechanism for risk detection and disposal, the central bank said. 
""In the face of complex economic and financial situations at both home and abroad, it is necessary to proactively set up an authoritative and efficient system to prevent, resolve financial risks, and prepare for rainy days,"" the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its website.
China's economy is slowing amid a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, a sluggish property market, and the fallout from the Ukraine crisis, straining the finances of already heavily-indebted local governments.
China's financial stability fund, to be used to tackle major systemic risks, would be financed by the country's financial institutions and financial infrastructure operators. The PBOC can also provide liquidity support to the fund when needed, according to the draft law. 
But financial institutions and their major shareholders must rescue themselves first, before seeking external help, so as to minimise reliance on public money, the PBOC said. 
Meanwhile, the risk-disposal mechanism, to be headed by the finance committee of China's State Council, or cabinet, puts more onus on financial institutions, local governments, and financial regulators to head off financial risks. 

Mismanagement at financial institutions, and misuse of capital by their shareholders contributed largely to financial risks in the past, the PBOC said. 
The draft law, which seeks public opinions, was jointly published by seven government agencies, including the PBOC, the finance ministry, and China's banking, securities and foreign exchange regulators.

268,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 10:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Risks of rising inflation could prompt the Swiss National Bank to start exiting its ultra-loose monetary policy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggested on Wednesday.
Although uncertainty remains high, the pickup of inflation is expected to be temporary, with inflation returning to the SNB's 0%–2% target band in the first half of 2023, the IMF said in a review of the Swiss economy, putting inflation at 2.5% in 2022 and 1.6% in 2023.
The Swiss franc's appreciation has mitigated price rises and wage pressures appeared muted despite a tight labour market. 
""But there are risks of inflation rising further and becoming more persistent. The SNB should continue to closely monitor inflation developments and prospects, including at the international level,"" it said.
""After a long period of very accommodative monetary policy -- a policy rate of -0.75 percent since 2015 -- the time may be approaching to normalise monetary policy,"" it added.
The SNB said last month while keeping policy on hold it would take ""all necessary measures"" to tackle higher prices, indicating a shift in tone at the central bank that for years has battled to tame the safe-haven franc's strength.
Inflation gaps versus the euro area and the United States suggest possible room for nominal franc appreciation to ease inflation pressures, the IMF said.
It forecast the Swiss economy, which it said had weathered the COVID-19 pandemic well, to grow around 2.25% this year and just under 1.5% in 2023 as spillover from the war in Ukraine weighs.

The IMF said capital and liquidity buffers protected the Swiss financial system during the pandemic, but warned a sharp rise in interest rates could trigger a property market correction that could hit banks' balance sheets. 
It also recommended that authorities strengthen their evaluation of big banks' internal governance and risk assessment. 
 
"
269,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 09:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker said inflation is “far too high” and steady interest-rate increases and balance sheet reduction should help reduce price pressures over the next few years.
“Inflation is running far too high, and I am acutely concerned about this,” Harker said Wednesday in prepared remarks to the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will add to inflation pressure, not only hiking oil and gas prices but other commodities, like wheat and fertilizer, as well.”
U.S. central bankers began to remove emergency levels of stimulus last month, raising the benchmark lending rate a quarter point to a range of 0.25% to 0.5% and penciled in seven increases for all of 2022. Chair Jerome Powell has also said that the central bank could begin to start allowing its asset holdings to run off as early as May.  
“I expect a series of deliberate, methodical hikes as the year continues and the data evolve,” Harker said. “I also anticipate that we will begin to reduce our holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities soon.”
Minutes of the March 15-16 meeting released later on Wednesday are likely to provide more details on the pace of balance-sheet reduction, which could tighten financial conditions further. The balance sheet has ballooned in size to $8.9 trillion after the central bank aggressively bought bonds during the pandemic to ease financing costs and shelter the U.S. economy from Covid-19.
Fed officials banked on an untangling of snarled supply chains easing inflation pressures last year, but rolling waves of the coronavirus and now Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have kept price pressures firm.
The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge rose 6.4% in the 12 months through February, more than three times its 2% target.
Harker is currently voting on monetary policy as an alternative member of the Federal Open Market Committee, in place of the Boston Fed, which is currently without a president. Its new leader, University of Michigan economist Susan Collins, will take up the post on July 1.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada will raise its overnight interest rate by 50 basis points at its next policy meeting on April 13, according to a majority of economists polled by Reuters, who also sharply raised their inflation forecasts for this year.
The central bank is expected to raise rates more swiftly than previously thought in coming months to control soaring inflation, caused in part by supply-chain disruptions and higher energy costs fueled by the Russia-Ukraine war.
After raising rates by 25 basis points to 0.50% in March - the central bank's first hike since October 2018 as the economy recovers strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic - it was expected to follow up with another 50 basis points this month.
A majority of economists, or 18 of 29, in the March 31-April 6 poll are now calling for a 50 basis point hike this month, including the five biggest banks in Canada - BMO, CIBC, RBC, TD and Scotia, as well as National Bank.
The big five banks also expect another half-point rate rise at the June meeting, even though the wider poll expects the pace of rate rises to slow to quarter-point increments each month, taking rates to 2.00% by the end of 2022. 
Interest rate futures pricing shows the overnight rate even higher, at 2.75% by end-year.
The shift in expectations for a larger move in April comes after BoC Deputy Governor Sharon Kozicki said late last month the bank was ready to act ""forcefully"" with rate hikes to return inflation to the bank's target. 
It also coincides with a move in expectations for half-point moves from its larger neighbour, the U.S. Federal Reserve. If realised, April's move would be the BoC's first 50 basis point hike since May 2000.
""Given that they (the BoC) are already well behind the curve on tightening and inflation is well above their 2% target, there's really no reason for them to wait any longer and they really should be getting policy rates up to neutral as quickly as they can,"" said Benjamin Reitzes, Canadian rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Markets.
According to the poll, the BoC was forecast to take rates to 2.25% by Q2 2023 and then pause until at least end-2023.
Canada's inflation rate was expected to average 5.6% last quarter and 5.9% this quarter, before easing to 5.0% and 4.4% in the next two quarters, a sharp upgrade from 4.5%, 4.1%, 3.2% and 2.5% predicted three months ago.
While inflation was expected to cool significantly next year it was still forecast to stay above the central bank's target until at least 2024. 
A regular survey by the BoC released on Monday showed a record number of Canadian businesses were facing capacity pressures amid intense labor shortages and supply chain difficulties.

The economy was expected to grow 4.3% this quarter, seasonally adjusted and annualized, lower than the 6.0% expected in January. It was then predicted to expand 3.5% and 3.1% in the following quarters, compared with 4.7% and 3.5%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Asset managers Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) Inc. and Ashmore Group Plc. are among the top holders of Sri Lanka's international bonds that form part of a creditor group as markets prepare for a potential debt restructuring, a source said on Wednesday.
The bondholder group, which hasn't been formally announced yet, holds more than 30% of country's foreign sovereign bonds, the source familiar with the situation told Reuters.
While members so far are mainly real money investors, the group is set to expand and include both hedge funds and secondary market funds in the near future, the source added. 
BlackRock and Ashmore did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A debt restructuring would be the first for the island nation, facing its worst economic crisis in decades. The country's foreign exchange reserves stand at $2.3 billion, with a $1 billion dollar bond maturing on July 25. 
The country holds around $12 billion of outstanding international debt. 
The country has struggled to pay for critical imports including fuel, food and medicines. 
Sri Lanka announced last month it would seek help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help it solve its worst financial crisis in years. Rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said on Wednesday that the extended period of political uncertainty could delay ongoing discussions to secure other external financing.
President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who is governing the country since 2019 with other family members in top positions, will not resign despite demonstrations and street protests, a government minister said on Wednesday. 

Rajapaksa revoked a state of emergency late on Tuesday after dozens of lawmakers walked out of the ruling coalition, leaving his government in a minority in parliament.
Sri Lanka's sovereign dollar bonds dropped more than 3 cents in the dollar. The 2027 bond slipped 3.44 cents to trade at deeply distressed levels of less than 40 cents in the dollar, according to Tradeweb data.

Analysts expect China's central bank to lower borrowing costs or pump more cash into the economy to spur growth.
""All departments should study contingency policy plans in response to changes in the situation and roll out measures conducive to the stability of market expectations in a timely way,"" the cabinet said.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's top European business group warned on Wednesday that its ""zero-COVID"" strategy was harming the attractiveness of Shanghai as a financial hub, echoing analysts voicing caution over the mounting economic toll of the country's coronavirus curbs. 
China has for the past month been tackling multiple outbreaks with an elimination strategy that seeks to test, trace and centrally quarantine all positive COVID-19 cases.
Nomura estimated on Tuesday that a total of 23 Chinese cities have implemented either full or partial lockdowns, which collectively are home to an estimated 193 million people and contribute to 22% of China's GDP.
The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said that the strategy was causing growing difficulties transporting goods across provinces and through ports, harming factory output.
Chamber President Joerg Wuttke told a media roundtable that this would likely impact China's ability to export, which could eventually stoke inflation. 
""In China, COVID is still associated as if it were the plague. I think there needs a bit more education from the Chinese authorities, to take the fear away in order to make people more comfortable to live with this kind of uncertainty,"" he said on Wednesday.
TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS
China, which has severely restricted international travel for the last two years, shows little inclination to ease up on its approach for now. 
On Wednesday, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center For Disease Control and Prevention, said that the epidemic situation would improve soon if China strictly implements existing COVID measures.
A handful of economists have lowered growth forecasts for the first half of 2022, as the COVID surge, coming amid persistent property weakness and global uncertainties, makes it harder for China to hit its full-year target of around 5.5%.
Shanghai-based Bank of Communications cut its forecast for China's first-quarter GDP growth from 5% to 4%, with the drop coming solely from slowing activity in March, said senior economist Tang Jianwei. 
Shanghai has put strict movement curbs on its 26 million residents, barring them from even leaving their front doors other than for COVID tests.
Dan Wang, chief economist at the Hang Seng Bank China in Shanghai, said the primary ripple effect for now from the city's lockdown was in the financial and legal services sector.

For example, companies looking to go public typically have to work in person with legal teams based in Shanghai - but current travel restrictions make that impossible.
""Macro confidence will collapse if this lockdown continues like this, and it will be reflected in the stock market,"" she said. ""I expect monetary easing happening pretty soon in the second quarter.""

ATHENS (Reuters) -Thousands protested in Athens on Wednesday during a day-long nationwide strike over what workers call a ""deepening crisis"" of rising prices and squeezed incomes, disrupting transport, ferries, schools and public hospitals.
The country's two biggest labour unions, representing about 2.5 million public and private sector workers, called the general strike that culminated in a rally outside parliament.
For many of those there, everyday life has become unaffordable.
""Our life now is just being in debt,"" said Georgios Alexandropoulos, a 60-year-old courier worker.
""I owe the electricity company and my landlord, I'm two months behind in rent, and I owe the last two electricity bills. Soon we will be in debt to everyone...we can't go on like this.""
Another protester, 57-year-old psychologist Michalis Tokaras, said he was forced to ""cut back on everything"".
""We have to choose between paying our mortgage or paying bills. We've reached the bottom,"" he said.
Police estimate at least 10,000 people turned up for the rally. ""We won't compromise with inflation,"" one banner read. 
Greece emerged from a decade of financial crisis in 2018, only for the coronavirus pandemic to bring global travel to a standstill two years later, hurting its vital tourism industry. 
Now, soaring energy prices, exacerbated by sanctions against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February, have further hurt workers' pockets.
""For the last 14 years, workers have been carrying the burden of a deep crisis that has affected everyone's incomes and lives,"" said GSEE, the country's umbrella private sector union.
""As the years go by the crisis is constantly deepening, the burdens remain, our rights are shrinking.""
Greece's annual consumer inflation surged to a 25-year high of 7.2% in February on the back of rising energy, housing and transportation costs.
The government has spent about 3.7 billion euros ($4 billion) since September to alleviate the burden of rising energy and fuel costs for farmers, households and businesses.
GSEE said in March it had proposed a 13% increase in the monthly gross minimum wage to 751 euros due to inflation.
The conservative government raised the minimum wage by 2% to 663 euros in January and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has promised a second, larger increase from May 1.
For the striking workers, the measures do not go far enough.

Investing.com -- Bond markets are under pressure again. U.S. yields are at three-year highs after the Fed's Lael Brainard warned of a faster tightening of policy, while the Eurozone's are spooked by the prospect of Marine Le Pen winning the French presidency later this month. Stocks are set to open lower, with JetBlue's rival offer for  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) providing the day's main M&A action. China's services sector had a wretched March due to Covid-19, and oil prices are up as Big Oil executives prepare for a grilling in Congress from worried Democratic lawmakers. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 6th April.
1. Bonds under pressure after Brainard comments; DB forecasts a recession in 2023
Bond markets are front and center again a day after Lael Brainard, President Joe Biden’s nominee as vice-chair for the Federal Reserve, warned of a “rapid” reduction of the Fed’s balance sheet as early as May.
Reacting to the comments,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) DBKGn became the first major bank to call a U.S. recession in 2023, caused by the tightening of monetary policy.
Benchmark 10-Year Treasury yields hit their highest in three years after Brainard warned of the “paramount” need to bring inflation down, using both interest rates and quantitative tightening. After a modest consolidation, they rose again overnight to stand within 1 basis point of Tuesday’s high of 2.63%.
More detail on the Fed’s discussion of the interplay between interest rates and quantitative policy is likely to emerge when the Fed publishes the minutes of its March meeting at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT).
2. Eurozone markets rattled by Le Pen progress
Bond markets in the Eurozone are also under pressure, but from a different angle. The chances of Marine Le Pen winning the French presidential elections this month have risen sharply in recent days, as the far-right, anti-EU leader has capitalized on the drop in living standards due to soaring inflation.
Macron has seen his lead over Le Pen in a two-way contest shrivel from 15 percentage points to barely 3 points in the last month. The first round of voting is due on Sunday.
The spread between the 10-Year French and German bond yields, a barometer of political risk at the heart of the Eurozone, widened to 46 basis points, its widest in more than three years.
As with the U.S., inflation fears are also haunting European bond markets. Eurozone producer prices rose 31% year-on-year in February, albeit due largely to supply squeezes rather than to overheating demand.
3. Stocks set to open lower; JetBlue's bid for Spirit in focus
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower again after falling sharply on Tuesday in reaction to comments from Brainard and Kansas City Fed President Esther George, who also warned of the need for a faster tightening of monetary policy.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 195 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 futures were down 0.7% while Nasdaq 100 futures were down 1.0%. The three main cash indices had fallen by between 0.8% and 2.3% on Tuesday.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Spirit Airlines, after JetBlue crashed Frontier Airlines' (NASDAQ:ULCC) party with an all-cash bid for the discount flyer.
AT&T (NYSE:T) and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) are also likely to gain attention after WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar and Ann Sarnoff, CEO of WarnerMedia Studios and Networks, both said they will step down ahead of the planned merger of Discovery with AT&T’s media assets.
4. Wretched March for the Chinese economy
China’s services sector followed the country’s manufacturers into contraction territory in March as ever-broader lockdowns damped the hospitality and travel sectors.
The Caixin Services PMI fell to 42 in March, its lowest since April 2020 and well below the 50 line that separates growth from contraction.
Money spent by tourists during the Qingming holiday weekend fell to less than 40% of pre-Covid levels, according to official estimates, while economists at Nomura noted that around 193 million people – accounting for some 22% of China’s GDP – are currently affected by public health measures of varying degrees of severity. That includes a near-total lockdown of activity in Shanghai.
5. Big Oil in Congress; EIA inventories due
Big Oil representatives are to testify in Congress later to give assurances that they are not exploiting this year’s surge in crude prices to indulge in price gouging.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) Chair Darren Woods and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) CEO Mike Wirth are both likely to face a grilling from Democratic lawmakers who risk losing their control of both houses of the legislature in this year’s midterms due to popular anger at rising prices and squeezed living standards.  
By 6:25 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 1.6% at $103.55 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 1.5% at $108.15 a barrel. Both contracts were reacting to talk out of Europe expressing discontent at the mildness of the bloc’s latest sanctions package. The EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell noted that the bloc has sent Russia 35 billion euros in payments for energy since it invaded Ukraine, compared to only 1 billion euros to Ukraine itself.
 The U.S. government’s weekly stockpiles data are due at 10:30 AM ET, a day after the American Petroleum Institute’s numbers showed the first rise in crude stocks in three weeks."

Taiwan has condemned Russia's attack and already joined the Western-led sanctions effort, though it is largely symbolic as there is only minimal direct trade between the island and Russia.
Taiwan's Cabinet said in an announcement that any companies wishing to export a long list of tech-related goods to Russia would need to seek permission.
The move has been made ""in order to prevent our country from exporting high-tech goods to Russia for the production of military weapons"", the Cabinet added.
The list includes equipment for making semiconductors, the production of which Taiwan is a world leader in, as well as lasers and navigation systems. 
The Economy Ministry added in a separate statement that it ""urges industry to follow the export control laws, conduct due diligence before exporting, and avoid exporting products from the 'Russian export list' that can be used for weapons proliferation to Russia without approval"".
It said it had produced the list based upon what other allied countries were doing and that in total it covered 57 ""controlled items"".

A U.S. official said last week that Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, had exited the Russian market, cutting off the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies' access to Elbrus chips, which are widely used in Russian intelligence and military systems.
Ukraine's plight has won broad public sympathy in Taiwan due to what many people view as the parallels between what it happening in the European country and what could happen if China ever uses force to bring the island it claims as its own territory under Chinese control.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday will release more details on what's evolving as a three-year plan to trim several trillion dollars from the stash of assets purchased to stabilize financial markets through the coronavirus pandemic, its next step in the move to tighten credit and lower inflation.
The reductions, which officials say could begin as soon as next month, were debated at the Fed's March meeting, and minutes of that session released at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) may indicate just how fast and how far policymakers will proceed in getting rid of the $4.6 trillion in U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities accumulated since March 2020.
Rising interest rates on home mortgages, bonds and other longer-term debt are already accounting for the Fed getting rid of perhaps $80 billion to $100 billion of assets per month, economists say, so the immediate market response may be muted.
But the plan will send a powerful signal of officials' intent to make credit steadily more expensive and, by doing so, help lower inflation currently running at more than triple the Fed's 2% target. 
The Fed ""will continue tightening monetary policy methodically through a series of interest rate increases and by starting to reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting,"" Fed Governor and Vice-Chair nominee Lael Brainard said on Tuesday. Referring to the 2017-2019 period when the Fed took a year to reach a pace of $50 billion in monthly reductions of its holdings, Brainard said ""I expect the balance sheet to shrink considerably more rapidly"" this time.
Last month the central bank raised its target federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point, the first of an anticipated series of hikes this year and into next. 
Fed officials as of March projected six more quarter-point increases this year, and the minutes may also provide insight on that debate, which has already shifted in favor of larger half-point hikes at one or more of their upcoming sessions. Traders in federal funds futures contracts expect an aggressive Fed will use half-point increases at three upcoming meetings in what may be one of the fastest tightening cycles since at least the 1960s.

'FULLY PRICED' 
Shrinking the balance sheet adds even more pressure to credit markets by decreasing demand for the assets that the Fed holds, which adds upward pressure on interest rates. While estimates of the impact vary, Fed Chair Jerome Powell after March's meeting said the reductions might have the same effect as an additional quarter-point increase in the short-term rate the Fed uses as its primary tool.
Lorie Logan, a top market official at the New York Fed, last month estimated that by not reinvesting the monthly payments it receives on its assets, the Fed could shed an average of $80 billion a month in Treasuries and $25 billion in MBS.
Most analysts expect somewhat smaller amounts, but absent a major surprise in Wednesday's minutes ""the market is fully priced"" for the Fed to reduce its balance sheet by perhaps $3 trillion over three years, said RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas.
Details of the plan and the language from Brainard and others, he said, at this point ""appear to be aimed at keeping (inflation) expectations anchored"" by following through on a shift officials have been publicly discussing since last fall.
Powell laid out the broad contours of the plan when he told Congress last month the Fed would ""in the range of three years"" return its asset holdings to ""a size relative to our economy that it was before"" the pandemic.
In response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the Fed through several rounds of ""quantitative easing"" accumulated around $4.2 trillion of assets, the equivalent of around 24% of U.S. gross domestic product. From 2017 to 2019 it reduced those holdings to less than $3.6 trillion, or about 16.5% of GDP.

'IN THE BACKGROUND'
More is in play this time. The Fed between March 2020 and March 2022 ran its Treasury and mortgage holdings up to $8.5 trillion, roughly 35% of GDP, a level some elected officials worried put the central bank too deeply into financial markets and government finance.
As the Fed begins its withdrawal, economists expect it may end up targeting a balance sheet level equivalent to perhaps 20% of GDP, or around $6 trillion depending on how fast the economy grows and, perhaps more importantly, what level of reserves commercial banks require.
Policymakers have said they do not want to repeat their mistake of 2019, when the balance sheet got so low it drove up the interest banks charge each other to borrow reserves overnight. That forced the Fed to put more cash into the system.
""They want this to operate in the background so they will be very careful about the language they use,"" said Andrew Patterson, senior international economist for Vanguard. 
Patterson said he thought the Fed would aim to reduce the balance sheet to around ""20ish"" percent of GDP, but may take four or five years to get there, a slightly slower pace than Powell flagged to Congress.
Whatever the parameters set, New York Fed President John Williams said Saturday it will likely take a shock to the economy to change course once agreement is reached.

""The idea at least during the initial phase is to have that operate in a very predictable way, in the background,"" Williams said.

279,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 05:56AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Growth rates in the euro zone could dip into negative territory this year and European Central Bank policy tightening to bring down high inflation in the near term risks crashing the economy, ECB board member Fabio Panetta said on Wednesday.
With euro zone inflation at a record-high 7.5%, the ECB is increasingly coming under pressure to tighten policy, even if the bulk of rapid price growth is due to high energy prices, which are largely outside the bank's control.
Instead, Panetta said European governments should help the most vulnerable households and jointly finance what is likely to be a costly transition away from Russian energy. 
""Quarter-on-quarter growth rates will be very low this year,"" Panetta said in a speech. ""The adverse impact of the war could well bring them into negative territory and produce longer-lasting effects.""
Panetta argued that oil and gas prices will stay high for longer and food prices could also increase more, so it would be quite costly for the ECB to bring down current inflation while medium-term expectations remain around its target.
""We would instead have to massively suppress domestic demand to bring down inflation,"" he said. ""In practice, we would have to amplify the ongoing sacrifice in real income suffered by the European economy.""
Tax cuts and subsidies could help in the short term, while joint borrowing and spending by European Union governments could be the longer term solution. 
Germany has long frowned upon the idea of joint borrowing but agreed to the one-off, 750 billion euro Next Generation EU scheme, aimed at speeding the bloc's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Panetta argued that the green transition and increased defence spending are the types of investments where centralised fiscal responsibility would outweigh the costs. 

""If the responsibility for higher investment and the associated costs were to fall exclusively on the shoulders of the individual member states, it could lead - depending on the country - to underinvestment or a narrowing of fiscal space,"" he said. 
For its part, the ECB needs to watch whether high inflation risked raising or ""de-anchoring"" inflation expectations but there is no evidence of such second-round effects for now, Panetta added.

(Reuters) - Ethereum blockchain scaling platform Boba Network raised $45 million in its series A round, with participation from investors including Will Smith-led Dreamers VC, Paris Hilton and husband Carter Reum and cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com, the company said on Tuesday. 
The funding round gives Boba a valuation of $1.5 billion, with former football quarterback Joe Montana and crypto funds Hypersphere and Infinite Capital also making investments. 
Boba allows users to develop decentralized apps on the ethereum blockchain with more features and at lower fees, and also transfer non-fungible tokens (NFTs) across ethereum's different layers. 
The company plans to use the funds to expand Web3 offerings and invest in projects built on its ecosystem, founder Alan Chiu said. 
The market capitalization of Boba Network's crypto token rose over 19% to $272.1 million after the announcement, while its price rose to $1.71 from $1.44, according to CoinMarketCap. 

Ethereum's ""gas"" fees, or the price of executing transactions, has risen steeply over the past few years as the blockchain became more popular, giving rise to platforms designed to reduce expenses and speed up transactions. 
Venture capital firms have plowed money into blockchain technology startups with SoftBank's Vision Fund 2 and Bain Capital Ventures among those who have launched crypto-focused funds or invested in blockchain tech companies since the start of 2022.

LONDON (Reuters) - The race is on to declare a paradigm shift in the world economy toward higher inflation and interest rates and the jolt to public borrowing costs could compound the dizzying shocks that led to this.
Lampooned by fiscal hawks as belief in a 'magic money tree', ever higher public borrowing and spending had seemed manageable and sensible for many years - hinged as they were on persistently low inflation that allowed central banks largesse to square the debt sustainability maths.
Embrace of the coincidentally acronymed Modern Monetary Theory - which espouses active use of cheap borrowing to invest in future growth and a sustainable global energy refit - marked a crescendo of that thinking.
But the big test of these ideas is coming far quicker than many suspected only 12 months ago.
In a one-two punch, pandemic lockdowns first floored borrowing rates and exploded government borrowing to prop up economies. But a rush to reboot created wild price distortions and supply bottlenecks that appear persistent and have now been exaggerated by an energy and commodity price squeeze since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.
Central banks have been forced to scramble and rethink, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England already raising key policy interest rates to rein in decades-high inflation rates.
On Tuesday the head of the world's main central bank forum - the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements - called time on the era of accommodative monetary policy in a speech entitled ""The return of inflation"" and rebuked calls for easy policies come what may.
BIS General Manager Agustin Carstens said years of below target inflation meant cheap central bank credit had ""hit two birds with the one stone"" - stimulating both activity and prices. But the unfolding ""paradigm shift"" now required a change of mindset that would neither be easy nor popular, even if central banks had been here before and knew what to do.
""Central banks cannot single-handedly ensure global growth by keeping an accommodative stance in all conditions,"" Carstens said, adding real interest rates now needed to rise above neutral estimates for a time.
""Amid low inflation, this perception became commonplace. It is one central banks must continue to fight against, even more so in an inflationary environment.""
More a policy watchdog than central bank mouthpiece, the BIS gained a reputation for being something of a Cassandra in recent decades - most notably for its oft repeated and largely ignored warnings about the danger of lax monetary policies before the global banking crash of 2007/08.
But it's far from alone this time around. 
Markets are already pricing a rise in U.S., UK and euro zone policy rates to well above pre-pandemic levels within 12 months and see U.S. Federal Reserve rates at their highest since the 2008 bust by the summer of 2023.

REGIME CHANGE
In his annual letter to shareholders, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon on Monday said the number of Fed rate hikes could be ""significantly higher"" than markets even now expect.
And Dimon's long-term investment strategists at JPMorgan doubt this is a flash in the pan.
Flagging changes in 40-year trends in localization, geopolitics, corporate margins, demographics and climate they see upward pressure on real rates over the next 10 years. 
What's more, strategists Alexander Wise and Jan Loeys reckoned there was a ""strong risk that we have entered a new regime with higher macro volatility and on average higher inflation"", leaving long-term inflation stuck at 3% on average over the decade. If so, they said that would imply a nominal long-term target of over 5.5% for 10-year Treasury yields over the decade.
Paradigm shifters are everywhere. 
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) chief Larry Fink told shareholders last month the Ukraine war ""put an end to the globalisation we have experienced over the last three decades"" and supply chain inflation that was already brewing would be exaggerated further by that.
Amundi's chief investment officer Vincent Mortier said this week the inflation environment was more difficult than it had been for 15-20 years and was at the centre of all investment portfolio construction.
""The rise of populism in the Western world, as well as the pandemic, catalysed nationalistic policies to protect important sectors and have caused a period of de-globalisation which should continue to keep inflation higher than in the previous decade,"" Mortier told clients.
So what does that mean for government borrowing or the fabled money tree?
A report released by asset manager Janus Henderson on Wednesday detailed how global government debt has almost tripled in the past decade even though easy monetary policy associated with successive crises meant that the interest cost has only increased by a third. The latter part of the equation was now about to adjust sharply, they warned.
The report showed that global government debts rose almost 8% to $65.4 trillion last year, even though roaring post-lockdown economic growth pulled global debt/GDP ratio back down to 80.7% from the pandemic peak of 87.5% in 2020.
However, government debt was projected to rise by almost 10% further this year to $71.6 trillion - and further to more than $80 trillion by 2025.
""The big change for 2022 and beyond will be in the cost for governments of servicing this debt,"" it concluded, adding the interest burden is set to rise by 14.5% on a constant-currency basis next year alone.
Temporary or not, the cost of borrowing is back in the calculus once again.

He told the Handelsblatt business daily the issue of residential property loans continued to rise, although buyers were bringing less and less equity with them.
""The growth is taking place in a market that is becoming increasingly vulnerable because of rising property prices,"" he said, adding that there was a danger of buyers becoming over-indebted. 

Wuermeling said rising interest rates also posed a threat, as banks had promised customers fixed interest rates for 10 years on more than half of all housing loans for private households.
""In the middle of an interest rate turnaround, banks would still have very low-interest loans on their balance sheets for a few years, but would already have to pay higher interest rates for refinancing,"" he said.

283,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 12:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve will unveil details of its likely plans to shrink its massive balance sheet with the release of minutes of the U.S. central bank’s March meeting, as policy makers confront the highest inflation in four decades.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell promised “a more detailed discussion” of the $8.9 trillion balance sheet laying out “pretty much the parameters of what we’re looking at,” in his comments during a press conference following the March 15-16 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Officials at that meeting raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.
The minutes, published at 2 p.m. Washington time Wednesday, will probably show a much faster pace of reduction than the last time it conducted this exercise between 2017 and 2019. This could include details on monthly caps that increase over time to govern the roll off of the Fed’s holdings of maturing Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, which officials bought aggressively to shield the economy as Covid-19 spread. 
Governor Lael Brainard said Tuesday that the process could start as soon as May and go considerably faster than in 2017, when they rose over the course of a year to a maximum monthly roll off of $50 billion combined. 
Officials only halted bond purchases last month as surging inflation accelerated plans to reduce the balance sheet, viewed as a passive way to tighten monetary policy that supplements increases in interest rates. 
“They will have a full-on plan,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC. “They want to set the table for being able to make an announcement in May. Because inflation is so high, it has become an urgent issue.”
Economists say the caps on runoff could total roughly $100 billion monthly, allowing around $1 trillion in reductions per year. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Michael Feroli estimates caps at $60 billion for Treasuries and $30 billion for MBS, while Evercore ISI’s Krishna Guha sees $50 billion and $30 billion and Deutsche Bank expects $60 billion and $45 billion. 
The Fed could also allow runoff of Treasury bills right away, not counting toward the caps.

With inflation the highest since 1982 and the Fed having recent experience with runoff, reaching the maximum levels could happen relatively quickly.
It’s likely to be “a very short phase-in period of just two months,” said Aneta Markowska, chief U.S. financial economist at Jefferies LLC. “ There is really no need for a long phase-in.”
There’s a high degree of uncertainty over the economic impact to the balance sheet cutbacks. Powell said the reduction “might be the equivalent of another rate increase.” The FOMC has committed to using rates, not assets, as its main monetary policy tool.
The goal will be to have runoff to be “more of a background measure,” Grant Thornton chief economist Diane Swonk said. “They really prefer to use rate hikes to be the primary tool to tighten. The Fed will leave door open to adjustments in balance sheet if necessary but would like focus to be on the rates for now.”
Downsizing assets will be the Fed’s latest maneuver to try to cool inflation pressures.  Policy makers in March raised their key rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 0.25% to 0.5% after two years of holding borrowing costs near zero to insulate the economy from the pandemic. 
In the Fed’s so-called dot plot of quarterly interest-rate forecasts, officials’ median projection was for the benchmark rate to end 2022 around 1.9% and then rise to 2.8% in 2023. 
While the balance sheet details will be the focus of the minutes, investors will also scrutinize the discussion of the past meeting for clues on whether the Fed will raise rates by a half point in May. Powell said on March 22 that he was open to a larger hike if needed at the May meeting and other policy makers have voiced the same sentiment since then.
The minutes don’t name names -- opting instead to characterize how many officials voiced one side of an argument or the other -- but could still provide a clear sense if there was general support for such a move at the time of the meeting. And any backing among officials for a half-point move could have increased since then.
“I think there will be a discussion of a 50 basis point hike, with at least “several” -- or “many” -- participants open to such a move in the coming months,” Markowska said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Most of Australia's major banks now expect a rise in interest rates as early as June, though opinions on the pace of tightening and the peak point still vary widely.
The first hike in a decade is clearly on the cards after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on Tuesday surprised many by dropping a pledge to be patient on policy.
""We now expect the RBA to lift the cash rate by 15 basis points in June, previously September, with follow-up 25 basis point rate hikes in July and August,"" said analysts at ANZ. The cash rate is currently at a pandemic-era low of 0.1%.
Economists at NAB also now look for a move in June, while CBA has been tipping it for some time. Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac, chose to hedge his bets.
""There has been a major change in the rhetoric and the Board has now increased its flexibility to start raising rates as early as June, two months earlier than our current call which remains August,"" he said.
A move at the RBA's May 3 policy meeting has been considered unlikely because key data on wages is not due until May 18 and a federal election is set to be held sometime in the month.
Markets have been wagering on a June hike for months, in part reflecting hawkish pivots by the U.S. Federal Reserve and many other major central banks. 
Indeed, futures imply a real risk the RBA could hike all the way to 0.5% in one go. That would be a radical departure for the central bank which has not hiked by more than 25 basis points since early 2000.
Markets have also priced in a series of rapid-fire increases to at least 1.75% by year end, and to 3.25% by late 2023. 
Such a drastic tightening would again be out of character for the RBA.
""A lift in the cash rate to 3.25% over the next two years would be both higher and importantly much steeper than all cycles in the post 1993 inflation targeting era,"" noted Tapas Strickland, a director of economics at NAB.
A major reason for restraint is households' record high debt levels, which would see interest payments swallow a punishingly large share of income should rates rise so precipitously.
""The Australian household sector is one of the most indebted in the world,"" cautions Gareth Aird, head of Australian economics at CBA. ""This means hikes have a more powerful impact on our household sector than they do in almost all other jurisdictions.""
As a result, he believes the neutral level for rates is as low as 1.25% and expects the RBA to reach that by early 2023 and stay there for the rest of that year.

David Plank, head of Australian economics at ANZ, looks for rates to peak somewhere above 3% but for the cycle to be much more drawn out than implied by the market.
""We expect to see a steady tightening pace ahead, with lots of pauses, which could extend the cycle for a number of years,"" said Plank. ""These pauses essentially allow the economy to adjust to a higher level of rates.""

(Reuters) - Gold prices were flat on Wednesday as hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials bolstered the dollar and Treasury yields to multi-year highs, denting bullion's safe-haven demand and offsetting support from uncertainty around the Ukraine war.
Spot gold was flat at $1,922.59 per ounce, as of 0320 GMT, after declining 0.4% earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures were down 0.1% to $1,926.20.
""Traders remain heavily net-long on gold futures markets, and that's clearly helping to support prices overall,"" said City Index senior market analyst Matt Simpson.
""Yet, the stronger U.S. dollar and lack of safe-haven demand are capping its upside potential.""
The dollar scaled its highest in nearly two years as Fed officials pushed for a quick reduction in the central bank's bloated balance sheet, with one of them expressing openness to hefty rate increases of half a percentage point. [USD/] 
A stronger dollar makes gold less attractive for other currency holders. 
""Hawkish comments from key Fed members yesterday likely overshadow today's FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) minutes, as they point towards a 50 bp hike at the next FOMC meeting and a faster balance sheet reduction than anticipated,"" Simpson said.
The Fed will release on Wednesday minutes of its March meeting that could provide details on its plans to reduce its bond holdings.
U.S. Treasury yields hit multi-year highs, with longer-term yields moving more quickly and partly reversing some of the recent inversions in the U.S. curve. [US/]
Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates and higher yields, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.

Meanwhile, the United States and its allies were set on Wednesday to impose new sanctions on Moscow over civilian killings in northern Ukraine.

286,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 11:37PM ET</span>",,,,,,"MANILA (Reuters) - Growth in developing Asia will likely be slower this year than previously thought, the Asian Development Bank said on Wednesday, as the war in Ukraine is expected to derail economic recovery in the region still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The bloc's combined economy, which includes China and India, is projected to expand 5.2% this year, the ADB said in a report, down slightly from 5.3% forecast in December, and sharply lower than the previous year's 6.9% growth. 
For 2023, the region is forecast to grow 5.3%. 
""The Russian invasion of Ukraine has severely disrupted the outlook for developing Asia which is still contending with COVID-19,"" the ADB said in its Asian Development Outlook report.
The Manila-based multilateral lender said other factors could also cloud the region's growth outlook, including ongoing increases in commodity prices, heightened financial stability risks that may stem from aggressive interest rate hikes in the United States, and the emergence of deadlier COVID-19 variants.
China's economy will probably grow 5.0% this year, the agency said, slower than its December projection, and much weaker than its 8.1% expansion in 2021, as COVID-19 outbreaks disrupt economic activities and chill consumer spending. 
Except for South Asia, all sub-regions were expected to post slower-than-expected growth this year. The ADB now sees East Asia and Southeast Asia growing 4.7% and 4.9% respectively, instead of 5.0% and 5.1%.
With the sharper-than-expected increases in commodity prices, the ADB raised its inflation forecast for the region to 3.7% in 2022 from its earlier forecast of 2.7%, before easing to 3.1% in 2023.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India will delay its first interest rate rise by at least four months to August at the earliest, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the central bank must now start worrying about inflation.
Inflation has held above the RBI's 6% upper threshold so far this year, casting doubt on its current strategy of keeping rates low to bolster growth even as some central banks are already raising borrowing costs in this cycle.
At its last policy meeting in February, the RBI did not deliver what was expected to be a small rise in its reverse repo rate to set the stage for lifting the repo rate, the main policy tool, from 4.0% where it has been for nearly two years.
All but six of 50 respondents polled March 29-April 5 forecast no repo rate change on Friday. Thirty-two expected rates to still be unchanged by end-June.
Twenty-five forecast the repo rate to climb by 25 basis points to 4.25% in the third quarter, while 15 saw rates rising to 4.50% or higher. The RBI meets to set policy in both early August and late September, meaning a rate rise is at least four months away. 
In a February poll, 28 of 41 respondents expected at least one rate hike by end-June.
""The key reason for pushing out our repo (rate) hike to Q3 is the RBI's staunch defence of its accommodative stance, viewing inflation largely as a supply-side issue that will pass,"" said Dhiraj Nim, economist at ANZ.
""I don't see a reason for another delay unless the expected rise in core inflation doesn't materialise and inflation eases. With oil prices where they are, that is extremely unlikely. The RBI should start giving more weight to inflation in their policy assessment.""
While its dovish stance matches most of its Asian peers, the RBI is well behind major central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in tackling the latest surge in global inflation.
Asked whether the RBI's Monetary Policy Committee should now shift its focus to inflation from growth, 23 of 37 respondents said it should, while the remaining 14 said it should not.
""I think the extremely dovish members of the MPC need something of a reality check on inflation if they are ever to act. It will probably take some upward shocking inflation numbers for them to pay more attention,"" said Miguel Chanco, chief emerging Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

Inflation was expected to have peaked at 6.1% last quarter but is forecast to remain above the RBI's 4.0% medium-term target until at least 2024. All median forecasts for inflation were higher than in a previous macroeconomic poll in January.
Economic growth, on the other hand, was downgraded to 8.7% for the previous financial year and 7.5% for the current one, from 9.2% and 8.0%, respectively. This comes after lacklustre growth in the final quarter of 2021.
Twenty-six of 35 economists saw a low or very low chance of the Indian economy entering stagflation, a prolonged period of high inflation and low growth, in the next two years. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das recently dismissed this as a risk. 
The remaining nine respondents said there was a high chance of stagflation. 

""The conflict in Europe brings risks of higher inflation and slower growth. From a macroeconomic standpoint, India's policymakers have experienced a narrowing of their policy options in the last few weeks,"" noted Rahul Bajoria, chief India economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).

Yellen and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus discussed the importance of continuing efforts to vaccinate 70% of the population in all countries this year, and working to strengthen the global architecture to fight pandemics.
""They agreed on the urgency of tackling the chronic under-funding of pandemic preparedness before the world’s attention turns elsewhere,"" Treasury said in a statement.
Nearly 491 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and over 6.5 million have died, according to a Reuters tally.
Yellen underscored the United States’ commitment to working closely with the WHO, the World Bank and the Group of 20 major economies to develop a financial intermediary fund on pandemic preparedness housed at the World Bank.
She and Tedros agreed such a fund would be an important element of the pandemic preparedness architecture.
Yellen emphasized the U.S. remains committed to helping countries get more COVID-19 vaccines in arms around the world and to supporting robust, well-coordinated efforts, including with the international financial institutions.
She stressed the G20 Finance-Health Task Force should work to bring finance ministers and their health counterparts more closely together to strengthen the global health architecture.

Tedros welcomed Yellen's leadership in pushing for a stronger global response to COVID-19, better longer-term pandemic preparedness and greater health finance collaboration, a source familiar with the meeting said.
They also discussed the obstacles to boosting vaccination rates and the need for stronger coordination, as well as clear political, financial, operational and public messaging.

Yellen, in prepared remarks to the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee for a hearing on Wednesday, said she will ask institutions including the World Bank and the African Development Bank to expand ways to address food security, ""including long-term investments in agricultural productivity and agricultural infrastructure.""
The international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, will play a critical role in addressing spillovers from the Ukraine conflict that are heightening economic vulnerabilities in many countries battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, she said.
""The IMF, World Bank, and EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) will be critical partners in rebuilding Ukraine, alongside bilateral donors, and they also will provide vital support to neighboring countries welcoming refugees,"" Yellen said.
The IMF has provided $1.4 billion in rapid financing for Ukraine, while the World Bank has provided $490 million in rapid financing for Ukraine, part of a $3 billion package of support planned in coming months. The EBRD has proved an initial 2 billion-euro package for Ukraine.
Yellen said this assistance has given Ukraine fiscal space to pay salaries for soldiers, doctors, nurses and civilian government employees while meeting its external debt obligation.
""These are admirable acts of credibility by a government under siege,"" she said.

Yellen added that the multilateral development banks should promote energy efficiency and capital investments to help governments diversify away from fossil-fuel-based energy sources including Russia.
She said the Biden administration was seeking congressional authorization to provide financing to bolster IMF lending facilities for poor and vulnerable countries -- the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust and the new IMF Resilience and Sustainability Trust.

290,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 07:20PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global government debt is set to rise 9.5% this year to a record $71.6 trillion, driven by the United States, Japan and China, asset management firm Janus Henderson said in a report on Wednesday.
Governments across the world have ramped up borrowing since the COVID-19 pandemic erupted two years ago, as they tried to shield their economies from the fallout. 
That took global government debt to a record $65.4 trillion in 2021, compared to $52.2 trillion in January 2020, Janus Henderson said. China's debt rose the fastest and by the most in cash terms, up a fifth or by $650 billion last year, it added. 
Among large, developed economies, Germany saw the biggest increase in percentage terms, with its debt rising by 15%, almost twice the average global pace.
According to Janus Henderson, government debt has tripled in the past two decades but a mitigating factor was low debt servicing costs.
With the effective interest rate on all the world's government debt slipping to 1.6% last year from 1.8% in 2020, debt servicing costs fell to $1.01 trillion.
And a strong global economic recovery meant the global debt-to-GDP ratio improved to 80.7% in 2021 from 87.5% in 2020, the report added. 
Now though, debt costs may rise sharply, the asset management firm forecast, estimating the global interest burden to increase by almost 15% on a constant-currency basis to $1.16 trillion in 2022. 
""The biggest impact is set to be felt in the UK thanks to rising interest rates, the impact of higher inflation on the large amount of UK index-linked debt, and the cost of unwinding the quantitative easing (QE) programme,"" the report said. 
""As interest rates rise, there is a significant fiscal cost associated with unwinding QE. Central banks will crystallize losses on their bond holdings which have to be paid for by taxpayers.""
The Bank of England has raised interest rates three times since December to 0.75%. Financial markets price in rates hitting 2% by the end of this year.
With inflation jumping and investors anticipating higher rates from major central banks, sovereign bond yields too have risen sharply. 

U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, for instance, are up almost 100 basis points this year to 2.45%. 
The Janus Henderson report said global government bond markets delivered a -1.9% total return in 2021, only the fourth time in 35 years to see a decline.

Senators Maria Cantwell, Dianne Feinstein and Ron Wyden, all Democrats from the U.S. West Coast, urged the agency to focus on trading practices that set benchmark prices that may have affected prices of fuel sold in California, Oregon and Washington.

With inflation at a record high 7.5%, the ECB is under increasing pressure to tighten policy, even if rapid price growth is mostly due to soaring oil and gas prices, which are largely outside the bank's control. 
But a rate hike would strengthen the euro, so the effective cost of energy would fall since these commodities are mostly denominated in dollars. 
""Time series models for Germany show that an interest rate increase would decrease headline inflation by 0.2% and heating and fuel prices by up to 4%,"" DIW, an influential think tank, said. 
""At the same time, an interest rate increase would derail industrial production and increase unemployment during an already slow economic recovery,"" it added. 
Although conservative policymakers, including the central bank chief of Germany, are pushing the ECB to put a rate hike on the agenda, the bank has made no commitment on rates, arguing that the war in Ukraine has created exceptional uncertainty. 
Still, around 60 basis points of rates hikes are now priced in by markets over the course of this year, with investors expecting the minus 0.5% deposit rate back in positive territory for the first time in a decade.

The move is still likely to be a dilemma for the ECB given the difficult tradeoffs, DIW argued.
""If it decreases inflation, it will also stall economic recovery. Nevertheless, it is crucial that the ECB fulfils its responsibilities and credibly conveys that it will take the necessary action.""

The proposed pay raise, if passed by the provincial legislature, would take the general minimum wage to C$15.50 ($12.41) per hour starting on Oct. 1, nearly four months after the province's June 2 election, according to a statement from the Ontario government. That would translate to an annual pay increase of C$1,768 for minimum-wage workers working 40 hours a week. 
""For many Ontarians, wages haven't kept up with the increasing cost of living, making it harder than ever to make ends meet,"" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in the statement.
On Jan. 1, the hourly minimum wage in the province rose to $C15 from C$14.35.
Inflation in Canada is at a 30-year high, and a Bank of Canada survey showed on Monday that businesses now expect inflation to stay above the central bank's target range of 1% to 3% over the next two years.
Ford's government, which is favored to be re-elected, has announced a host of measures it says are aimed at reducing living costs for Ontario residents.
On Monday, the government introduced legislation to reduce taxes on gas and fuel that, if approved by the legislature, would take effect after the June election.

Ontario has removed tolls on some highways and eliminated vehicle license plate renewal fees in recent weeks. Ford has also announced an increase in the real estate speculation tax for foreign buyers to 20% from 15%.

Vilsack is in Mexico meeting with Villalobos to discuss cooperation on ""shared priorities including open trade, science-based policy making and sustainable and climate-smart agricultural production,"" the two governments said in a statement.
U.S. and Mexican authorities concluded all necessary plant health protocols and agreed to a visit by Mexican officials in April to finalize expanded access to the Mexican market no later than May 15 for all U.S. table stock and chipping potatoes, the statement said.

The ECB has kept rates in negative territory since 2014 and has not raised them in more than a decade, but a surge in inflation is now making an increase in the minus 0.5% deposit rate increasingly topical. 
""Based on the current outlook, so with positive economic growth, we will raise interest rates to 0 by the end of the year,"" Wunsch told Belgian magazine Knack. ""It's actually a no-brainer for me.""
""But I have to say that even within the ECB there has been no discussion about raising interest rates,"" he added. 
Inflation hit a record high 7.5% last month on surging oil prices, but some policymakers still argue that underlying trends are weak and price growth could slip back below the ECB's 2% target over the medium term.
Wunsch took a different view, arguing that the target, even further out in time, has essentially been met, so it is time for the ECB to roll back extraordinary stimulus. 
He also said that rates could eventually peak at 1.5% or 2%, above the 1% anticipated by markets. 
The central bank governors of Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, all considered among the most conservative on the rate-setting Governing Council, have also made the case for a rate hike in recent weeks, suggesting that a discussion about a move will soon be on the agenda. 

Wunsch added that Belgium could suffer a recession if it lost access to Russian gas, but that was still a relatively minor price to pay in the current environment. 
""That's not too bad when I see what is happening in Ukraine,"" he said. ""Even a temporary recession is really just a detail compared to the economic downturn in Ukraine and the thousands of deaths that have already occurred there.""

 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities cut its 2022 earnings per share estimates across the industry on Tuesday, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc downgraded the retail sector to a hold-equivalent rating last week. Both were concerned that consumer demand may weaken as prices jump, and Barclays also cited higher input costs for companies.
“There is building concern of a potential slowdown in the consumer — as geopolitical events, rising inflation and rising [interest] rates are already impacting consumer sentiment,” Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow wrote in a note. He said annual guidance from the group looks “increasingly unrealistic” and questioned how long consumers can withstand mounting macroeconomic headwinds.
The dismal performance of apparel and footwear stocks this year reflects Wall Street’s increasingly negative outlook. The S&P Supercomposite Apparel and Accessories Index is down 19%, versus a 4.6% year-to-date drop in the S&P 500 Index.
Pessimism around retail stocks is building just one week before the corporate earnings season starts in earnest. Investors will be closely watching corporate America’s financials to assess how companies have fared amid rising rates and inflationary pressures, Russia’s war in Ukraine and the omicron coronavirus variant.

“As macroeconomic conditions continue to weaken, we see the end of the ‘buy everything rally,’” CFRA analyst Zachary Warring wrote in a note last week, referring to a period in 2020 and 2021 that saw stimulus and pent-up demand send retail shares broadly higher.
Warring recommends investors become more selective and seek out strong brands with proven management teams and consistent growth. He sees opportunities in off-price retailers as consumers return to shopping for deals, and luxury brands, which he expects will continue to have pricing power.

""There will have to be an amendment on Title 42 in order to move the bill,"" McConnell said at a news conference. 
""There are several other amendments that we’re going to want to offer. And so there we’ll need to enter into some kind of agreement to process these amendments in order to go forward with the bill,"" he said.
U.S. health officials are expected to end what is known as Title 42, a sweeping, pandemic-related expulsion policy that has effectively closed down the U.S. asylum system at the border with Mexico.

Republicans argue that doing away with the restrictions, set in place in March 2020 under former President Donald Trump, will encourage more migrants to enter the United States illegally at a time when border crossings are already breaking records.
An amendment vote on Title 42 could complicate Democratic plans for a $10 billion COVID-19 relief bill unveiled on Monday. The sum for COVID-19, which dropped international aid from the package, is less than half of the $22.5 billion President Joe Biden had sought.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has suspended information exchanges with Russia's tax authorities in a bid to hamper Moscow's ability to collect taxes and fund its war against Ukraine, the Treasury Department told Reuters on Tuesday.
Under a 30-year-old tax treaty, the IRS and Russia's Federal Tax Service have shared information to aid domestic tax collections and enforcement of tax laws in both countries. The IRS can request information about U.S. taxpayers from Russian authorities and vice-versa.
The Treasury said it has not shared any tax information with Russian authorities since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, but the action disclosed on Tuesday formalizes the suspension.
""This ensures that the United States is not providing any information that could contribute to the enrichment of the Russian government through increased tax collections or facilitating in any way the persecution of Russian dissidents or the targeting of Ukrainian citizens or businesses,"" the Treasury said in a statement to Reuters.
It was not immediately clear how much revenue might be denied to Russia because of the suspension, which stops short of suspending the entire tax treaty that allows American companies and expatriates in Russia to claim U.S. tax credits against taxes paid to Russia. 
U.S. Senators Rob Portman and Ben Cardin had urged that step https://www.portman.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/Russia%20Tax%20Convention%20Letter%20to%20President%20-%20FINAL.pdf in a letter President Joe Biden.
Portman, an Ohio Republican on the tax- and trade-focused Senate Finance Committee, welcomed the suspension of tax information exchange.
""The atrocities that (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and Russia are committing in Ukraine make it abundantly clear we must do all we can to hold them accountable. Suspending tax-related benefits is one small, but meaningful step towards that goal,"" Portman said in a statement.
The panel's Democratic chairman, Ron Wyden of Oregon, said he would soon introduce bipartisan tax legislation to increase pressure on Russia.
""Countries sharing tax information is part of welcome participation in our global economy - and Vladimir Putin’s war machine is no longer welcome,"" Wyden said.

Britain, which in recent years had become a haven for wealthy Russian elites, said last month that it had halted tax information exchanges with Russia and Belarus, which is an ally of Moscow.
Late on Monday, the Treasury also blocked Russia from making $600 million in sovereign bond payments from funds held in frozen U.S. accounts, a move meant to force Moscow to drain dollars away from its war effort or default.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government may need more than 100,000 charging stations to support widespread electric vehicle use, a government watchdog told a congressional hearing on Tuesday.
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) said in testimony that as of March, federal agencies own about 1,100 charging stations. President Joe Biden in December signed an executive order directing the U.S. government to end purchases of gas-powered vehicles by 2035.
The House Oversight and Reform Committee is holding a hearing on the U.S. Postal Service's (USPS) plans to buy mostly gas-powered next-generation delivery vehicles. USPS is not covered by Biden's executive order.
Less than 0.3% of the government's 657,000 vehicles were electric as of 2020, or 1,777. In 2020, the government spent $4.2 billion on vehicle costs, including $730 million for fuel.
The General Services Administration (GSA) on Tuesday said that as of March 10, federal agencies have ordered an additional 1,854 zero-emission vehicles since the prior report.
The GAO noted that the GSA has been able to negotiate lower purchase prices for some EV models, saying that the ""GSA negotiated a discounted price for the Chevrolet Bolt in fiscal year 2021 - at almost $10,000 below its market retail price.""
The U.S. government typically purchases about 50,000 vehicles annually. Biden's executive order said that light-duty vehicles acquired by the government will be what the White House calls ""emission free"" by 2027. 
That ""emission free"" definition includes plug-in hybrid EVs that also have a gasoline-powered engine.
Congress approved infrastructure legislation last year providing $7.5 billion to build out a nationwide network of 500,000 EV chargers.

The Biden administration endorsed separate legislation last year to provide $9 billion for USPS and federal government to buy EVs and charging stations that remains stalled.
Biden has resisted calls to endorse California's plan to end the sale of new light-duty gas-powered vehicles by 2035.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Driven by Chinese demand, the growth in use of feedlots in Brazilian beef production rose to about a fourth of the country's overall slaughtered cattle, industry sources said.
Cattle fattened to produce meat for the Chinese market, which buys about 50% of Brazil's exported beef, is sold for 20 reais ($4.29) to 30 reais ($6.43) more per arroba (15 kilograms) than conventional cattle. 
This has contributed to the use of confinement facilities like feedlots being used in Brazil, the world's biggest beef supplier, as opposed to grass-fed cows living on large estates, the sources say. 
""Most confined cattle are directed to exporting slaughterhouses, and China only buys animals that are 30 months' old,"" said Hugo Cunha, manager at Dutch nutrition company DSM. ""And we can only do that by finishing the cycle in confinement or on a semi-intensive system,"" he said.
In 2021, 27.54 million head of cattle were slaughtered in Brazil, according to government statistics bureau IBGE. The DSM Confinement Census shows that 6.5 million animals were finished in confinement last year, corresponding to 23.7% of cows slaughtered coming from feedlots here.
Five years ago, 29.7 million cattle were slaughtered in Brazil, according to IBGE data. This compares with 3.75 million animals raised in confinement, or 12.6%, DSM data for 2016 show. 
The adoption of confinement facilities gathered pace from 2019, when many Brazilian beef plants were approved for sale of products into China. 

That year alone, 22 beef plants were approved. Currently, 37 Brazilian beef units can sell beef to China, according to industry and government data.

(Reuters) -Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday said she expects methodical interest rate increases and rapid reductions to the Fed's balance sheet to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year, with further tightening to follow as needed.
""I think we can all absolutely agree inflation is too high and bringing inflation down is of paramount importance,"" Brainard said at a conference at the Minneapolis Fed. 
To do so, she said, the Fed will raise rates ""methodically"" and as soon as next month begin to quickly ramp up reductions to its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet to a ""considerably"" more rapid pace of runoff than the last time the Fed shrank its holdings. 
The rapid portfolio reductions ""will contribute to monetary policy tightening over and above the expected increases in the policy rate reflected in market pricing and the Committee’s Summary of Economic Projections,"" she said.
Brainard's remarks, her first since the Fed last month raised rates for the first time in three years, sent stocks down and Treasury yields up to multi-year highs as investors digested the hawkish tone from one of the Fed's usually more dovish policymakers.
Investors are concerned by ""the speed and aggressiveness of the Fed with its balance sheet reductions,"" said CFRA Research's Sam Stovall.
Fed projections released after the March meeting showed most policymakers thought the policy rate would end the year at least in the range of 1.75%-2%, if not higher, a pace that would require quarter-point rate increases at all six remaining Fed meeting this year.
Markets see the Fed moving faster, delivering half-point rate hikes in May, June and July, to bring the rate to 2.5%-2.75% by the end of this year. That would be above the 2.4% level that most Fed policymakers view as ""neutral."" 
The Fed on Wednesday releases minutes of its March meeting that are expected to provide fresh details on the pace and scope of the Fed's plans to reduce its bond holdings. Brainard provided a bit of a preview.
""Given that the recovery has been considerably stronger and faster than in the previous cycle, I expect the balance sheet to shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous recovery, with significantly larger caps and a much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017–19,"" Brainard said. 
Back then, the Fed began by limiting runoff from its $4.5 trillion balance sheet to $10 billion a month, and took a year to ramp that up to a maximum of $50 billion a month. Analysts expect a pace about twice that this time around.
MORE IF NEEDED 
The Fed targets 2% inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index. In February the PCE price index was up 6.4% from a year earlier. 
Brainard said she sees upside risks to inflation from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and noted that COVID lockdowns in China could worse supply chain bottlenecks that have kept upward pressure on prices. 
And though the geopolitical events could pose risks to growth, she noted, the U.S economy has considerable momentum and the labor market is strong. 
Unemployment last month fell to 3.6%, just a hair above its pre-pandemic level. 
The Fed's signaling on policy has already tightened financial conditions, Brainard said, with mortgage rates up a full percentage point in the past few months.
""We are prepared to take stronger action"" if warranted by readings on inflation or inflation expectations, Brainard said, adding that she would also be watching the yield curve for any signs of downside risks to the economy. 
It was unclear from Brainard's remarks whether she feels a rapid portfolio runoff would render bigger-than-usual rate hikes unnecessary. 

Kansas City Fed President Esther George, who also supports a faster balance sheet runoff, left that door open. 
""I think 50 basis points is going to be an option that we’ll have to consider, along with other things,"" George told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday.

Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have cut Moscow off the global financial system and from nearly half of its $640 billion in gold and foreign exchange reserves.
Oleg Tishakov, a board member with the National Card Payment System (NSPK), said Russia is facing a shortage of microchips as Asian manufactures suspend production amid a coronavirus pandemic and European suppliers have stopped cooperating with Moscow following sanctions. 
""We are looking for new microchip suppliers and [have] found a couple in China, with certification process ongoing,"" Tishakov told a conference on Tuesday, without giving further details. 
Some of Russia's biggest banks no longer have access to the SWIFT global banking messaging system, and international payment cards Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard have stopped servicing Russian accounts abroad. Mir's connection to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay was removed last month.
NSPK issued over 2 million Mir cards between the end of 2021 and March, according to Reuters calculations based on the system's data, with total cards outstanding now at 116 million. 

All major Russian banks have reported an increased demand for the domestic card, which some now issue in a co-brand with China's UnionPay, an alternative payment system to Visa and MasterCard for purchases by Russians abroad. 
Mir cards are also accepted by some banks in Turkey, Vietnam, Armenia, Uzbekistan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Georgia breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

LONDON (Reuters) - The world is facing a new era of higher inflation and interest rates as deteriorating ties between the West, Russia and China and COVID after-effects drive globalisation into reverse, the head of the Bank for International Settlements has warned.
Soaring global energy and food prices mean almost 60% of developed economies now have year-on-year inflation above 5%, the largest share since the late 1980s, while it is over 7% in more than half of the developing world.
While major economies like the United States and Britain and swathes of less developed ones are now raising interest rates from all-time lows, a rapid acceleration would be needed if a fundamental paradigm shift took hold.
""A key message is that we may be on the cusp of a new inflationary era,"" the general manager of the BIS central bank umbrella group, Agustín Carstens, said on Tuesday.
""We need to be open to the possibility that the inflationary environment is changing fundamentally,"" Carstens added. And ""if my thesis is correct, central banks will need to adjust"".
That thesis is the rebound in energy, commodity and food prices was being amplified by the war in Ukraine. Supply chains have been damaged by both the pandemic and trade wars, while rising living costs mean workers are demanding higher wages.
There are also signs that the expectations of consumers, businesses and financial markets for how high inflation will go are becoming ""unmoored"".
Carstens pointed to professional forecasts which now see inflation of over 4.5% in the United States and much of Europe over the next two years, and above 3.5% in many other advanced economies. 
Rising inflation is global trend: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klpykjjazpg/Pasted%20image%201649169022463.png 
The immediate implication would be that policymakers would have to quickly shift their ""mindsets"" to how to stop inflation running out of control, a problem few have had since the 1970s. 
""Most likely, this will require real interest rates to rise above neutral levels for a time in order to moderate demand,"" Carstens said, acknowledging that it could make them unpopular.
""But central banks have been here before,"" he said. ""They are fully aware that the short-term costs in terms of activity and employment are the price to pay to avoid bigger costs down the road.""
He urged governments to resist the temptation to try and offset the pinch of inflation or higher interest rates.
""The key to higher sustainable growth cannot be expansionary monetary or fiscal policy,"" Carsten's said. 

""Many of the economic challenges we face today stem from the neglect of supply side policies over the past decade or more.""

The Fed on Tuesday announced the penalties for Autumn Jordan and Manuel F. Pinazo, who previously worked at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, along with Dedryck O. Carson, Wendy Rodriguez Legon, Michael T. Lemley, and Tracy L. Mallory, who were at Regions Financial Corp (NYSE:RF). The regulator said all six applied for assistance under one of the government’s Covid-19 relief programs “based on false and fraudulent representations and used the funds for unauthorized personal expenses.”
The former employees obtained funds through the Small Business Administration’s Covid-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, according to the Fed. Authorities have been trying to crack down on abuses of that federal effort and others. 
The former bankers didn’t admit or deny the conduct, according to the Fed.

(Reuters) - Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) said on Tuesday it will not recommend Russian government accounts to users as part of a rule change affecting accounts run by states which limit access to the open internet and are engaged in armed interstate conflict.
The social media company also said it would now require the removal of posts depicting prisoners of war posted by government or state-affiliated media accounts. Ukraine's government has posted content featuring prisoners of war on social media in recent weeks. 
Russia has battled big tech companies to control information flows after it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. The Kremlin calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation."" Moscow has throttled access to Twitter by slowing its service and has banned Meta's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram. 
""When a government blocks or limits access to online services within their state, undercutting the public's voice and ability to freely access information, but continues to use online services for their own communications, a severe information imbalance is created,"" Twitter said in a blog post. 
The company said its new measure of not amplifying the accounts would apply whether Twitter itself was blocked or not and that it would first apply the policy to Russian government accounts.
It said under the new rule it would not amplify or recommend Russian government or state affiliated media accounts, including on users' Home timeline, or the search or explore functions. A spokesperson said this would affect more than 300 Russian government accounts.
The company also said it would require government or state affiliated media accounts to remove any media published that features prisoners of war. It said in cases where there was a ""compelling public interest"" in accessing the content, such as for evidentiary purposes, it would instead add a warning to the tweets. 
During the conflict, Ukrainian government social media accounts have posted videos appearing to feature Russian prisoners of war answering questions or making phone calls home. Asked about these posts on a call with reporters, Twitter's head of site integrity Yoel Roth said such tweets would be covered by the scope of the new rules but the policy would not be applied retroactively. 

""We don't want Twitter to be used by state actors to infringe on international humanitarian law and, to the best of our ability, we want to disincentivize governments from engaging in this type of behavior,"" said Roth, citing the Geneva Convention, which protects prisoners of war against abuses including insults and public curiosity.
Twitter also said it would require the removal of tweets posted by any user with prisoner of war content shared with abusive intent.

Russia's ability to continue servicing debt in foreign currencies is in focus as the government, which has so far avoided a default, faces issues paying holders of its sovereign debt.
State-owned VTB, Russia's second-largest bank, made coupon payments in roubles on its two bonds denominated in foreign currencies issued on its home market in 2021, regulatory fillings disclosed by the bank showed.
On Monday VTB made a total of 255.7 million roubles ($3.1 million) in coupon payouts on its two euro-denominated bonds and 312.3 million roubles on the dollar-denominated bond issued last year, the documents showed.
Some of Russian companies in other sectors have encountered difficulties in servicing their external debt obligations as western payment agents were delaying payments as more checks are needed amid a wave of sanctions.
Earlier on Tuesday diamond producer Alrosa said it had asked its trustee to apply to the UK's sanctions regulator for a special licence to allow it to make coupon payments on its $500 million Eurobond.
State-owned Russian Railways has said it attempted to make interest payments on bonds denominated in Swiss francs but was unable to do so.
Steelmaker Evraz on Tuesday said it had made a regular coupon payment on $700 million of bonds maturing in 2024, with payment transferred to investors on time and via their respective clearing systems. 
The default risk carries possible lasting consequences for Russia, which now has limited access to its gold and foreign exchange reserves because about $300 billion of state assets have been frozen by Western sanctions in response to what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
If Russia fails to make any of its looming bond payments within their pre-defined timeframes, or pays in roubles where dollars, euros or another currency is specified, it will constitute a default.

While Russia is unable to access international borrowing markets because of sanctions, a default would prohibit it from accessing those markets until creditors are fully repaid and any default-related legal cases are settled.

They see the Fed raising rates by 50 basis points at each of its next three meetings on its way to a peak above 3.5% by the middle of next year. The Fed’s current target for the federal funds rate is 0.25% to 0.5%, after it lifted off levels near zero last month. 
Deutsche Bank is one of the first major banks to forecast a U.S. recession.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a report on Monday that an economic downturn was “far from inevitable,” in part because consumers and companies are “flush” with cash.
“Our call for a recession in the U.S. next year is currently way out of consensus,” Folkerts-Landau and Hooper acknowledged in their report, adding, “We expect it will not be so for long.”
On top of the Fed rate increases, Deutsche forecasts the U.S. central bank will reduce its $8.9 trillion balance sheet by almost $2 trillion by the end of next year, the equivalent of three or four additional twenty-five basis point hikes.
“The U.S. economy is expected to take a major hit from the extra Fed tightening by late next year and early 2024,” Folkerts-Landau and Hooper wrote in a report entitled “Over the Brink.”
Under the forecast, U.S unemployment rises sharply to 4.9% in 2024. Joblessness in March clocked in at 3.6%.

Austin, Texas-based Ghost said it had raised $2.5 million from investors including HOF Capital, 305 Ventures, Hustle Fund and Active Capital. The company provides small businesses operating ghost kitchens with insurance, loans, credit cards and other financial products. 
As food delivery soared in popularity during the pandemic, many ghost kitchens sprouted up to meet the demand. They are separate from sit-down restaurants and focus solely on delivery. The young businesses often buy their inventory using cash, checks or debit cards, rather than credit, which hampers their growth, said John Meyer, chief executive of Ghost Financial.
“What seems to be lacking is a very clear banking and financial layer to support the ... ghost kitchen industry,” said Meyer. 

Major restaurant groups such as Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) Inc have also embraced ghost kitchens in recent years, spurred by the sector's lower upfront cost and labor expenses, Reuters has reported.
Though the popularity of food delivery took off during the pandemic, there is no sign the trend is ebbing, Meyer said, noting that some popular figures such as YouTube star MrBeast have begun dabbling in ghost kitchens.

Investing.com -- China’s economy is facing its biggest test since the Covid-19 coronavirus erupted in Wuhan two years ago.
The emergence of new strains and substrains of Covid-19 was always likely to challenge Beijing’s zero-tolerance policy, forcing ever stricter lockdowns to contain a disease that is becoming less dangerous at the same time as it grows more infectious.
And so it has proved. Omicron and its sub-variant BA.2 have broken through the country’s defenses. Even official figures, which were widely considered to have underreported the actual state of affairs in Wuhan, now show case rates at their highest in two years. They don’t acknowledge any deaths from the disease in the last week, but unverified social media footage speaks of a health system under enormous strain.
While other countries are now able to manage high numbers of infections without their health systems being overrun, Beijing doesn’t have that confidence. It continues to insist on what it calls the “dynamic zero” policy of complete suppression.
It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Xi Jinping signaled in a speech in mid-March that the government would try harder to minimize the impact of health measures on economic life. Instead, almost all of Shanghai’s 25 million residents are firmly locked down - some at the office, but most at home. Factories are closed and delays at ports are lengthening again, threatening a new wave of supply chain-related problems for western industry and retailers.  
Shanghai’s port authority denied reports at the weekend that over 300 ships were waiting to get into the port, but similar measures at the port of Shenzhen earlier this year led to a one-third reduction in throughput, according to data from the consultancy FourKites.
Domestic travel has taken a big hit: official data estimate that the number of air passengers on the weekend before this week’s Qingming holiday fell 87% from last year to only 562,000.   
The disruption is almost certainly big enough to put China’s official growth target this year of 5.5% in jeopardy. Already in March, the world’s largest manufacturing sector fell back into contraction, with both the official purchasing managers index (which tracks mainly the big state-owned enterprises) and the Caixin PMI, which tracks smaller and private businesses, falling below the 50 level that signifies growth.
But the disruption also threatens to create fresh product shortages in western markets, ensuring that the spike in inflation, both at the producer and consumer level, stays higher, for longer, than first thought. The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said that 82% of its members had suffered “slowed or reduced production” as a result of the lockdowns. Tesla’s factory there, which makes 16,000 cars a week, has been shut since March 28.  
The only good news, economically speaking, is that this wave of outbreaks comes at a time when global demand for manufactured goods is beginning to revert to the mean, after surging during the pandemic. The stress on global supply chains may consequently be less than it would have been a year ago. In almost all of China’s key export markets, Covid is largely history. Global deaths from the disease are at their lowest since March 2020. Hospitalizations have plummeted even though case rates are close to record highs, mask mandates have been lifted, and stadiums and restaurants are full again. U.S. data released last week show a clear swing of the pendulum back to spending on services such as dining out.
However, the country which Covid-19 struck first is now on course to be its last great victim. Nature has outpaced policy. Unless Beijing can adapt as quickly as the virus, it risks undoing much of its remarkable success in taming it.",,,,,

CHICAGO (Reuters) -It will take $15 billion in grants this year and another $10 billion annually after that to establish and maintain an adequate toolkit to respond to COVID-19 and address future pandemic threats, according to four organizations focused on global health and the economy.
The estimate is laid out in ""A Global Strategy to Manage the Long-term Risks of COVID-19,"" a working paper published on Tuesday by the International Monetary Fund, in partnership with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Global Fund and Wellcome Trust.
In the paper, the four global groups said that ending the pandemic everywhere remains an urgent economic, health and moral priority for the world.
""Given the many possible scenarios for the evolution of COVID-19 (from benign to severe) and given the limited resources countries have, we need a new strategy,"" Gita Gopinath, the IMF's First Deputy Managing Director, said in a statement.
The IMF estimated the pandemic resulted in $13.8 trillion in cumulative losses as of January 2022.
Gopinath told a news briefing that the IMF expected to revise down its global growth forecast later this month to factor in the cost of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the continued pandemic.
""The cost to the economy of more general disruptions and the war in Ukraine is going to be very significant,"" Gopinath said, adding that the estimated cost of the pandemic would also rise.
""Since the pandemic is not over, and we have disruptions to the supply chain that continue and other costs, including human capital, that number is only going up,"" Gopinath added.
Gopinath said countries need vaccines, tests, treatments and an improved health infrastructure to tackle COVID-19 and other deadly diseases.
""These last two years have shown that remarkable progress is possible when the world comes together and supports science boldly at scale, across borders,"" said Jeremy Farrar, director at the Wellcome Trust charity. ""Now is not the time to ease up – the virus's next move is anything but certain and the risk of new variants high."" 

Richard Hatchett, chief executive of CEPI, said vaccines will be critical to any future response, but they must be accompanied by investments in global surveillance, research and development, manufacturing and health systems.
""This is a crisis that will continue to unfold and unspool over time if we don't put the resources against it that it requires,"" Hatchett said.

Foreign net portfolio outflows for emerging markets came to $9.8 billion in March, IIF data showed, following a $13.3 billion inflow in February. Developing stocks lost $6.7 billion, while bonds saw $3.1 billion depart.
IIF considered China outflows of $11.2 billion in bonds and $6.3 billion in stocks an ""unprecedented dynamic that suggests a market rotation"" away from assets of the world's second-largest economy. This is the first time China assets have seen outflows in equities since September 2020.
""While it is premature to draw any definitive conclusions, the timing of China outflows suggests foreign investors may be reevaluating their exposure and a rotation in preferences could start to take form,"" said Jonathan Fortun, an IIF economist, in the statement.
""Overall, the first quarter of the year has seen investors being more selective,"" he added, as ""higher risk sensitivity"" mounts due to tighter monetary conditions and rising inflation.
Emerging markets ex-China saw net inflows of $8.2 billion coming to debt and a marginal outflow of less than $400 million in equities. The March report didn't include specific figures for Russia.

Regionally, Latin America saw a net inflow of $10.8 billion compared with $7.7 billion in February and a $5.7 billion outflow in March 2021. Data shows this is the biggest inflow for the region since July. 
""Moving forward we see greater volatility on flows dynamics, as some countries have bottomed up and could potentially benefit from higher commodity prices but may also be greatly exposed to risk factors.""

Despite an economic recovery, borrowing will stay elevated because of high debt rollover requirements and war in Ukraine, the ratings agency said in an annual note.
While 137 countries will borrow an equivalent of $10.4 trillion in 2022, an estimated 30% lower than 2020, the overall figure is one-third higher than average borrowing between 2016 and 2019, S&P said.
""Tightening monetary conditions will push up government funding costs,"" S&P analysts said. 
""This will pose additional difficulties to sovereigns that have been unable to restart growth, reduce reliance on foreign currency financing, and where interest bills are already critically high on average.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's Liberals find themselves in a bind ahead of this week's budget: the economy has recovered from the pandemic, yet Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged billions in new stimulus, a political poker chip that could further torch runaway inflation.
Trudeau's Liberals will present their 2022 budget on Thursday, just seven months after promising C$78 billion ($62.7 billion) in new spending in a re-election campaign. Much of that, to be spread over five years, has not yet been budgeted.
But fresh fiscal spending could be risky at a time when inflation is already running at a 30-year high. If too broad, measures could fuel further price increases and end up hurting lower-income Canadians.
""When you look at the impact of this elevated inflation on lower-income households, clearly they are hurting,"" said Rebekah Young, director of fiscal & provincial economics at Scotiabank.
""But at the same time, from an economic perspective, there's a risk that if you put even more money at the problem, it can create more pressures.""
Young said major new spending initiatives should be set aside for the near term, even though total government revenues are expected to be higher than previously forecast due to higher inflation-linked tax revenue.
But that may be easier said than done. The government has already committed to spend more on defense following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Trudeau's Liberals currently spend less than 1.4% of GDP on defence, under the NATO threshold of 2%.
The budget will also include about C$2 billion on a strategy to accelerate Canada's production and processing of critical minerals needed for the electric vehicle supply chain, Reuters reported exclusively on Monday.
Green technologies and initiatives on housing will be focal points of the budget, said one senior source.
And the Liberals will have to start to deliver a national dental-care program for low-income Canadians - a costly initiative that is a cornerstone of a support deal with the New Democrats meant to keep Trudeau in power until 2025.
Structural spending will end up adding to the deficit once the stronger than expected revenues are no longer rolling in.
This could derail efforts to reduce Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio, which skyrocketed during the pandemic amid extraordinary emergency spending and was last forecast to peak at 48.0% this year.
""Any near-term drop in the federal deficit from today's improved economic outlook could be fleeting. As such, we feel the risks to our baseline debt-to-GDP forecast are very much skewed to the upside,"" said Randall Bartlett, senior director of Canadian economics at Desjardins. 
Rising interest rates - the Bank of Canada is widely expected to hike its policy rate by 50 basis points to 1% at a decision on April 13 - will add to debt pressures. Canada's federal debt was last forecast to top C$1.19 trillion this year. 
Trudeau, facing backlash over surging home prices and rents, has also promised to make housing more affordable, including measures to make it easier for first-time buyers to get into the market. 

""That does get us into a problem where typically the prices just adjust to reflect the improvement in affordability,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's central bank on Tuesday lowered its economic growth forecast for this year and next due to the impact of inflation stoked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and said the pace of recovery had already slowed down in the first quarter.
Inflation is projected to rise to 7.5% in 2022.
The Bank of Spain now expects gross domestic product to expand 4.5% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 5.4%. Growth is then expected to slow to 2.9% in 2023, also less than the previously predicted 3.9%.
""The conflict in Ukraine and the economic sanctions imposed on Russia are expected to have a severe impact on growth prospects for the coming quarters,"" it said in a report.
It said it did not expect Spain to reach pre-pandemic output levels before the third quarter of 2023.
Last year, the Spanish economy rebounded 5.1% after a record 10.8% slump in 2020 induced by the coronavirus pandemic.
The government has yet to revise its bullish 7% growth projection for 2022 made last year. Economy Minister Nadia Calvino said the Ukraine conflict would weigh on growth, but recovery should continue.
The central bank put first-quarter GDP growth at 0.9% from the previous three-month period, when the expansion was 2.2%, and expects European Union-harmonised consumer inflation to have clocked 7.9% in the first quarter.
""The impact of the conflict will be concentrated in the second quarter under our central scenario which does not encompass an escalation,"" said Bank of Spain Chief Economist Angel Gavilan. He expected the economy to still eke out small growth in the second quarter but did not rule out a contraction.
Gavilan saw inflation, which hit 9.8% in March year-on-year, hovering around 10% until the summer, when it should start abating. For all of 2022, Gavilan said, inflation should reach 7.5%, double the bank's previous forecast of 3.7%, before gradually dropping to 1.6% by 2024.

Soaring energy prices have already caused transport strikes and stoppages in some sectors in Spain, aggravating supply chain disruptions and inflation.
Public debt is expected to fall to 112.6% of GDP in 2022 from 118.4% last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -An agreement to provide $10 billion in U.S. funding for COVID-19 aid has been reached in the Senate, lawmakers said on Monday.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber, and Republican Senator Mitt Romney hailed the deal, but Schumer said he was disappointed that an agreement on $5 billion of global health funding had not also been reached. 
The deal provides $10 billion in funding for COVID needs and therapeutics by repurposing unspent COVID funds. It is well below the $22.5 billion the Biden administration had sought.
Senate Republicans demanded any new requests for COVID funding be paid for by repurposing existing funds from prior COVID relief funds. Romney said the deal repurposes ""$10 billion to provide needed domestic COVID health response tools.""
The White House said it was ""grateful for the Senate's work on a bipartisan plan to help meet some of the country's COVID response needs"" but still wants more funding.
It urged Congress ""to move promptly on this $10 billion package because it can begin to fund the most immediate needs, as we currently run the risk of not having some critical tools like treatments and tests starting in May and June.""
Schumer said the bill provides ""urgently needed funding to purchase vaccines and therapeutics, maintain access to testing and accelerate the work on next generation vaccine research.""
Romney noted the agreement does not include funding for the U.S. global vaccination program, but he said he is ""willing to explore a fiscally-responsible solution.""

The bill cuts $2.31 billion from a COVID program to boost aviation manufacturing and repair businesses. The U.S. Transportation Department offered $673 million nationwide in three rounds of awards in the $3 billion program to support aviation jobs. Some major aerospace companies like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) opted not to participate.
It also eliminates nearly $2 billion in grant funding for shuttered venues like live performance venues, museums, and movie theaters. The program stopped taking applications in August.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury yield curve, already hammered into a flat line after one of its worst quarters in decades, is set to remain off its normal upwardly-sloping shape over the coming year, according to a Reuters poll of bond strategists.
The gap between two-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields has been inverted in the last several trading sessions. Such an inversion, when sustained, has been a reliable early warning of most U.S. recessions since the Second World War.
Forecasts for a flat to slightly inverted curve come despite expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon start reducing its bond holdings, letting securities accumulated during the pandemic roll off its near-$9 trillion balance sheet.
The March 29-April 5 poll of nearly 60 fixed-income strategists showed no sharp rise was imminently expected in 10-year notes, leaving the yield curve either flat or consistently at risk of further inversion over the coming year.
""If you asked me what's going to be the dominant trend over the next phase, six to 12 months, it's going to be the Fed pushing up the short rate expectations and a split between the behaviors of the yield curve that will drive further flattening,"" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist and head of global bonds at PGIM Fixed Income.
He said two-year notes would keep following the fed funds rate up but alongside that, ""the five-year and longer part of the curve keeping faith that at some point the secular fundamentals are going to become soft again.""
Just in the past few months, as inflation has soared to multi-decade highs, market expectations have surged from a series of steady 25 basis point Fed rate rises at each meeting this year to a succession of half-point moves.
That has led to concerns the Fed may end up overdoing its tightening campaign and put at risk the economic recovery from the pandemic, which has already shifted down a gear.
Median forecasts showed the U.S. 2-year Treasury note yield, currently at 2.47%, trading at 2.30%, 2.49% and 2.60% in the next three, six and 12 months respectively, suggesting those Fed rate rises have already been priced in. 
The benchmark 10-year bond yield was expected to trade around the current rate of 2.45% for the next three to six months before rising to 2.60% in a year, with the highest forecast at 3.25%.
If the median view is realized, that would be the flattest prediction and the first consensus forecast on a six-month horizon for a slight inversion in any Reuters poll for two decades.
Apart from a handful of respondents, most expected the spread to be less than 25 basis points, smaller than a single normal rate move by the Fed in a year when they are expected to deliver several increases twice that size.
""They (2s-10s) will remain inverted until the Fed stops. As long as they keep talking about going, it will remain inverted,"" said Michael Every, global market strategist at Rabobank, who said the yield curve was flashing a warning signal.
However, many analysts argue the Fed, which now owns a significant percentage of the U.S. Treasury market through years of quantitative easing, has robbed it of its predictive powers.
""The yield curve is also distorted by QE since the Fed has bought a significant share of Treasuries, depressing term premiums and flattening the curve,"" noted Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at TD Securities.

""The market is likely pricing in balance sheet run-off later this year, but implementation details are still forthcoming. This makes it difficult to have much conviction about the extent to which QT is priced in.""
There was no clear consensus among analysts asked to describe the gap between current U.S. Treasury market pricing and impending quantitative tightening from the Fed. Very few regular respondents to the poll ventured a guess.

321,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 08:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"PARIS (Reuters) - Poland on Tuesday blocked a French-proposed compromise on how to implement a minimum corporate tax across the European Union in another blow to a global overhaul of international tax rules.
The Polish revenue chief said that despite amendments, Warsaw still had concerns that the minimum tax could enter into force without the new rules preventing big multinationals from booking profits in the most favourable countries.
Nearly 140 countries, including Poland, reached a two-track deal in October on a minimum tax rate of 15% on multinationals and agreed to make it harder for companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to avoid tax by booking profits in low-tax jurisdictions.
France, which holds the EU's rotating six-month presidency, has pushed for a quick implementation of the deal in the 27-nation bloc, where tax issues require unanimous approval.
Poland was one of four countries to block an attempt last month to find a compromise, but Sweden, Estonia and Malta dropped their opposition after tweaks to the deal.
""It (the proposed compromise) is not a legally binding solution for assuring that both pillar I and pillar II enter into force in a similar point in time,"" Polish revenue chief Magdalena Rzeczkowska told a meeting in Brussels.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that he was ""absolutely not convinced"" by Poland's position, that Warsaw's concerns had been taken into account and other member states had also made concessions.
Le Maire said that he would put the issue back on the agenda of the EU finance ministers' next monthly meeting.

""I don't know yet where the capital boost will come from but it will come for sure. Not only for VTB but for the wider banking sector, I think,"" Kostin said on Tuesday, as he expected the financial sector to post losses this year. 
Western sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in February have cut Moscow off from the global financial system and from nearly half of its $640 billion in gold and foreign exchange reserves. 
Some of Russia's biggest banks, VTB included, were cut off from the SWIFT global banking messaging system, and international payment cards Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard stopped servicing Russian accounts abroad, adding pressure on banks.
Since major private banking bailouts in 2017 worth over 2 trillion roubles, the central bank has opted for removing banking licences over providing cash injections. 
Previously, VTB was allowed to pay smaller dividends on preferred shares held by the state to boost the bank's capital, in a non-cash form of the support. 

Russia's banks may need as much as 2.2 trillion roubles in state support, according to the Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-term Forecasting, of which the bulk, or 1.5 trillion, would be needed for top lenders, private included. 
The central bank did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - An advisory panel to Japan's finance minister on Tuesday recommended that the law should be changed to revoke Russia's most-favoured-nation trading status following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
The recommendation was made weeks after Prime Minister Fumio Kishida pledged to deprive Moscow of the status as Japan kept in line with the Group of Seven (G7) advanced nations over sanctions against Russia.
""Following G7 leaders' statement and from the standpoint of coordinating with international community in further adopting sanctions as needed against Russia, we will revoke Russia's most-favoured nation treatment on tariffs,"" the panel said.
The panel called for revoking Russia's adoption of preferential WTO treaty tariffs by revising the law and ordinances.
The law revision would raise tariffs on Japan's imports from Russia by 10%, or 150 billion yen. Currently, Japan's imports from Russia stand at an annual 1.5 trillion yen.
In 2021, Russia accounted for 81% of Japan's sea urchin imports and 47.6% of crab imports, government data showed.
As preferential World Trade Organisation treaty tariffs are removed when Russia's most-favoured-nation status is revoked, tariffs would rise to 5% from WTO rates of 3.5% on some fishery products such as salmon roe, salmon and trout. Crabs would face a tariff rise to 6% from 4%. 
Tariffs on shaven wood such as pine trees would rise to 8% from the WTO preferential rate of 4.8%, the panel said, adding the measures would take effect a day after promulgation through fiscal year-end of March 2023.

Russia calls the Feb. 24 invasion in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to disarm its neighbour. The West says it launched an unprovoked invasion.
Following the invasion, the Japanese government slapped asset-freeze sanctions on more than 100 Russian officials, oligarchs, banks and other institutions, in step with G7 economies. Japan has also banned high-tech exports to Russia.

Several companies with exposure to Russia are taking steps to comply with sweeping Western sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
Kinross will receive a total of $400 million for its Kupol mine and the surrounding exploration licenses and would receive a total of $280 million in cash for its Udinsk project.

Highland Gold is one of the largest gold mining companies in Russia and operates several mines in the country, including in Chukotka and Khabarovsk regions where the Kupol mine and Udinsk project are located.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Commission will propose on Tuesday to EU nations sweeping new sanctions against Russia, including banning imports of coal, wood, chemicals and other products worth about 9 billion euros ($9.86 billion) a year, an EU source told Reuters.
The European Union is also to propose a ban on exports to Russia worth another 10 billion euros a year, including of semiconductors, computers, technology for LNG gas, and other electrical and transport equipment, the source said.
Russian vessels and trucks would be prevented from accessing the EU, further crippling trade, the source said, with exceptions made for energy products, food and medicines.
The 27-country EU would also ban all transactions with VTB and another three Russian banks which have already been excluded from the SWIFT messaging system, the source said, while dozens more individuals, including oligarchs and politicians, would be added to the EU's sanctions list.
The ban on coal, if approved by EU states, would be the first on any energy import from Russia adopted by the bloc since Moscow launched what it calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The Commission had proposed such a ban in January should Russia invade its neighbour, but EU sources told Reuters it was blocked by Germany, the EU country most reliant on Russia coal.
A German government source told Reuters Germany would support a phased EU embargo on Russian coal imports. 
A ban on coal would be worth around 4 billion euros a year, the EU source said.
As a comparison, the EU imported about 100 billion euros' worth of oil and gas from Russia last year. Sources said the EU is working on measures on oil and gas, but has not made any decisions yet.
Import bans would be applicable immediately sanctions are published in the EU's official journal, with winding-down periods whose length is still to be decided, the source said.
CRIPPLING TRADE
The EU has already approved four rounds of sanctions, including freezing assets of the Russian central bank and the new measures are intended to further cripple trade with Russia. 
They would stop transport of goods by road and sea, with the exception of critical imports including gas and oil. The EU has already banned air traffic with Russia.
Applying some sanctions may be complicated, officials have repeatedly said, because it is not always easy to identify the origin of a cargo ship. 
Bans on importing wood, cement, rubber and chemicals from Russia, plus high-end foodstuffs including caviar and spirits such as vodka will also be proposed, together worth about 5 billion euros a year, the source said.

Including about 10 billion euros from the planned ban on technology exports to Russia, the new restrictions would reduce the value of trade between the EU and Russia by at least 20 billion euros a year, the source said.

The inflation forecast was raised to 3.5%-5.5% this year from a previous projection of 2.0%-3.0%, the group, which includes representatives from industry, banking and commerce, said in a statement. It maintained its export growth outlook of 3.0%-5.0% this year.
Inflation, which hit the highest level in 13 years in March, is weighing on a recovery in domestic demand and purchasing power, the group said.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy grew 1.6% last year, among the lowest growth rates in the region.
On Tuesday, the World Bank also cut its economic growth forecast for Thailand to 2.9% this year from a previous forecast of 3.9%, with risks skewed to the downside.
The economy, however, can grow only 2.6% this year if the wider impact of the war is more severe and fiscal measures have less positive effects than expected, World Bank economist Warunthorn Puthong told a news conference.

Thailand's benchmark interest rate is expected to remain at a record low of 0.50% as the economic recovery is likely to be gradual with tourism still weak, she added.
The economy is projected to return to pre-pandemic levels by early 2023, when growth is expected at 4.3%, the World bank said.

Investing.com -- The EU ducks the challenge of sanctioning Russian energy again. Elon Musk isn't looking like a passive shareholder at Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Stocks are set to open lower ahead of some verbal interventions from the Federal Reserve, and inflation pressures continue to send shockwaves through emerging markets. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 5th April.
1. EU avoids the elephant in the room, again
The European Union again shied away from the challenge of imposing meaningful costs on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, a day after reports of atrocities committed by Russian troops shocked the continent.
Diplomatic sources quoted by various reports indicated that the bloc’s new package of sanctions will still allow oil and natural gas to flow freely, generating nearly $1 billion a day in export revenues for Russia. Instead, the EU will only stop coal imports, as well as ban some 10 billion euros ($11 billion) worth of machinery and other equipment exports from the EU to Russia.
The EU will also ban imports of Russian and Belarusian potash fertilizer, as well as wood, chemicals, concrete and some foodstuffs, worth about $5.5 billion a year. It has also added several more business and political figures to its sanctioned list. However, the package appears to fall well short of proposals on Monday from French President Emmanuel Macron and the EU Council, owing to well-publicized resistance from Germany and Hungary.
2. Elon Musk: A not-so-passive shareholder
Twitter’s new shareholder didn’t stay ‘passive’ for very long. Elon Musk immediately carried out a poll of his 80 million followers on whether to introduce an edit button, a measure that Twitter’s own management has resisted. The poll split around 3:1 in favor, in line with Musk’s own preference.
Musk’s actions carry a thinly-veiled warning to CEO Parag Agrawal about the extent of his influence. However, under SEC rules, he is not allowed to conduct active campaigns for change without disclosing more details about his aims.
Twitter stock had its best-ever day on Monday, rising 27% after the announcement that Musk had taken a 9.2% stake. It ended the day with a valuation of nearly 8 times 2021 sales. The company has lost money for both of the last two years, failing to cash in on the boom in digital advertising as the pandemic receded.
3. Stocks set to open lower: Fed speakers, ISM non-manufacturing eyed
U.S. stocks are set to open lower later, unable to build on Monday’s gains against a backdrop of geopolitical tension in Europe and rising Covid-19 cases in China. Jamie Dimon’s warning to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) shareholders at the weekend of potential losses in Russia has also cast a shadow over the imminent start of the quarterly earnings season.
By 6:20 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 103 points, or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down in parallel.
The day will be dominated by speeches from various Federal Reserve officials, notably governor Lael Brainard at 10:05 AM ET and New York Fed President John Williams at 2 PM ET. Minneapolis’s Neel Kashkari, widely seen as the most dovish of the regional Fed presidents, is also due to speak at 10 AM ET. The Institute for Supply Management will also release its monthly non-manufacturing index.
4. Emerging market strains 
The strain of inflation continues to be felt around the world, with Peru declaring a state of emergency in its capital after protests against high food and energy costs turned violent.
Sri Lanka’s Finance Minister, meanwhile, resigned just one day after being appointed, unable to face a crisis caused by a crippling debt burden and a collapse in tourism revenues over the last two years.
The pressure from soaring food and energy prices is arguably worst in North Africa, which is dependent on imports of wheat from Russia and Ukraine. Tunisia’s president dissolved parliament on Monday, taking the country back a big step toward one-man rule, in an effort to keep control of a turbulent domestic situation. In Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has already all but established one-man rule, inflation is now running at 61%, according to data released last week.
In developed markets, the Australian dollar shot higher after the Reserve Bank of Australia dropped its pledge to remain 'patient' with regard to tightening monetary policy. Goldman Sachs analysts now expect it to start raising interest rates in June.
5. Oil shrugs off China woes; API data due
Crude oil prices rose again, shrugging off concerns about Chinese demand. That’s despite figures showing the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns on the domestic travel sector. The number of people flying at the start of the Qingming festival was down 87% year-on-year, local media reported. Shanghai has meanwhile extended its lockdown indefinitely, keeping 25 million people more or less entirely off the streets.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 1.2% at $104.56 a barrel, while Brent crude was up 1.1% at $108.71 a barrel.
The EU’s new sanctions will arguably make things marginally more difficult for oil exports, by banning Russian ships from European harbors. However, the sanctions appear to be easy to circumvent by re-flagging tankers.

328,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 06:41AM ET</span>","SOFIA (Reuters) - The Russian invasion of Ukraine and sanctions against Russia are likely to put the brakes on Bulgaria's economic growth this year and keep annual inflation in double digits, the finance ministry's macroeconomic forecast showed on Tuesday.
The Balkan country almost halved its 2022 growth forecast to 2.6% from 4.8% and saw annual average inflation under the EU-harmonised index at 10.4% from a previous 5.6% this year, the forecast showed.
""The military conflict led to an increase of the prices of energy and key raw materials, which will have a negative impact on households purchasing power,"" the ministry said in a statement.
The invasion and sanctions on Russia are expected to disrupt global trade and supply chains that will harm Bulgarian exports and investments in the country, the ministry said.
The country's tourism revenue will also be seriously impacted as Russian and Ukrainian holidaymakers are not likely to visit its Black Sea summer resorts this year.
The finance ministry sees economic growth slowly recovering to 2.8% in 2023. Bulgaria's economy expanded by 4.2% last year.
The ministry expects consumer prices to continue surging through the third quarter and to slow in the last, bringing year-end inflation to 10%, which should further drop to 3.1% in 2023.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States stopped the Russian government on Monday from paying holders of its sovereign debt more than $600 million from reserves held at U.S. banks, in a move meant to ratchet up pressure on Moscow and eat into its holdings of dollars.
Under sanctions put in place after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at U.S. financial institutions were frozen.
But the Treasury Department had been allowing the Russian government to use those funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a case-by-case basis.
On Monday, as the largest of the payments came due, including a $552.4 million principal payment on a maturing bond, the U.S. government decided to cut off Moscow's access to the frozen funds, according to a U.S. Treasury spokesperson. 
An $84 million coupon payment was also due on Monday on a 2042 sovereign dollar bond . 
The move was meant to force Moscow to make the difficult decision of whether it would use dollars that it has access to for payments on its debt or for other purposes, including supporting its war effort, the spokesperson said. 
Russia faces a historic default if it chooses to not do so.
""Russia must choose between draining remaining valuable dollar reserves or new revenue coming in, or default,"" the spokesperson said. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), which had been processing payments as a correspondent bank so far, was stopped by the Treasury, a source familiar with the matter said.
The correspondent bank processes the coupon payments from Russia, sending them to the payment agent to distribute to overseas bondholders.
The country has a 30-day grace period to make the payment, the source said.
DEFAULT WORRIES
Russia does have the wherewithal to pay from reserves, since sanctions have frozen roughly half of some $640 billion in Russia's gold and foreign currency reserves.
But a drawdown would add pressure just as the United States and Europe are planning new sanctions this week to punish Moscow over civilian killings in Ukraine.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"". Ukraine and the West say the invasion was illegal and unjustified. Images of a mass grave and the bound bodies of people shot at close range drew an international outcry on Monday.
Russia, which has a total of 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion, has managed to avoid defaulting on its international debt despite unprecedented Western sanctions. But the task is getting harder.
""What they're basically tying to do is force their hand and put even more pressure on (to deplete) foreign-currency reserves back home,"" said David Wolber, a sanctions lawyer at Gibson Dunn in Hong Kong.
""If they have to do that, obviously that takes away from Russia's ability to use those dollars for other activities, in essence to fund the war.""
It may also put pressure on Russian demands to be paid roubles for gas by European customers, he added.
Russia was last allowed to make a $447 million coupon payment on a 2030 sovereign dollar bond, due last Thursday, which was at least the fifth such payment since the war began.

If Russia fails to make any of its upcoming bond payments within their pre-defined timeframes, or pays in roubles where dollars, euros or another currency is specified, it will constitute a default.
While Russia is not able to access international borrowing markets due to sanctions, a default would prohibit it from accessing those markets until creditors are fully repaid and any legal cases stemming from the default are settled.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Former Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) official P. Nandalal Weerasinghe said on Monday he had accepted an offer from the country's president to become the bank's next governor amid a deepening economic crisis and unrest.
""The president called me and made the offer and I have accepted,"" Weerasinghe told Reuters.
Weerasinghe, who left CBSL in September as senior deputy governor, said he would arrive in Sri Lanka from Australia this week to formally accept the position.
The CBSL did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
CBSL Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said earlier on Monday he had offered his resignation as President Gotabaya Rajapaksa sought to form a unity government and find a way out of Sri Lanka's worst economic crisis in decades.
Rajapaksa also dropped his brother, Basil Rajapaksa, as finance minister and appointed the country's justice minister, Ali Sabry, in his place.

The debt-laden island nation of 22 million people is struggling to pay for imports due to a scarcity of foreign exchange, leading to hours-long power cuts and a shortage of essentials.

He also criticized the proposed delisting of Russian companies' depositary receipts from foreign exchanges, saying this would increase risks and undermine the rights of shareholders.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered that natural gas, exported mostly to Europe, be paid for in roubles instead of foreign currency following sweeping Western sanctions over Ukraine.
European capitals have rejected the demand, which Germany said amounted to ""blackmail"". 
Some politicians, including the speaker of the lower house of parliament Vyacheslav Volodin, suggested Russia should sell oil, grain, metals, fertiliser, coal and timber for roubles on global markets where it is profitable.
""For decades we've been fighting for export markets... We've been developing relations with thousands of clients in 70 countries. It's hard to imagine what would convince our buyers to switch to settlements in roubles and incur currency risks,"" Lisin told the newspaper.
""Logistics problems have already complicated delivery of goods. Switching to payments in roubles will just throw us out of international markets.""

Last month Lisin told employees at steelmaker NLMK, of which he is the chairman and main shareholder, that lives lost in Ukraine were a tragedy that was hard to justify, and called for a peaceful diplomatic resolution to the conflict.
Lisin said in a letter to staff that was posted on social networks by an employee that the company and its board hoped the conflict would be resolved soon.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Tuesday the yen's recent moves were ""somewhat rapid"", joining a chorus of policymakers who have warned that sharp falls in the currency could hurt the country's import-reliant economy.
The remark was the strongest warning by Kuroda on yen moves since the currency's slide to a six-year low last week, and a sign the BOJ shares the government's concern over the potential damage to corporate sentiment from sharp yen falls.
""Recent (yen) moves have been somewhat rapid,"" Kuroda told parliament, adding that the BOJ was carefully watching currency moves due to their ""huge"" impact on the economy and prices.
""It's extremely important for currency rates to move stably reflecting economic and financial fundamentals,"" Kuroda said.
Kuroda, however, also repeated his view that a weak yen benefits Japan's economy as a whole, in contrast to some market views that its decline is doing more harm than good to the economy by pushing up import costs.
The dollar slid below 122.4 yen on Kuroda's comment, before rebounding to near 123 yen on Tuesday, still off the six-year high above 125 yen hit last week.
""Market players see Kuroda as a stern believer of the benefits of a weak yen,"" Makoto Noji, chief currency strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""At best, today's comments may have been Kuroda's attempt to lean a bit closer to the government, which has warned of the side-effects of a weak yen.""
Once welcomed as giving a boost to exports, a weak yen has become a headache for Japanese policymakers as it inflates the cost of fuel and raw material imports, which are already soaring due to the war in Ukraine.
Some analysts and lawmakers have blamed the BOJ's ultra-low interest rate policy for fuelling unwelcome yen declines.
Kuroda repeated the need for the BOJ to keep monetary policy ultra-loose, even as rising fuel costs are expected to push consumer inflation close to its 2% target.
Unlike other Western economies, Japan was not seeing sharp rises in wages in tandem with inflation, he added.
""We will patiently maintain powerful monetary easing to support an economy still in the midst of recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic's impact,"" Kuroda said.
During his stint as top currency diplomat, Kuroda guided several rounds of yen-selling intervention from 1999 through 2000 to combat sharp yen rises that caused an economic slump.
Asked about the experience, Kuroda said it was ""hard to measure"" the effect of currency intervention on markets.
The BOJ, however, was ready to use a powerful tool to avoid long-term interest rates from rising too much, he added.
The BOJ last week offered to buy unlimited sum of 10-year Japanese government bonds to defend an implicit 0.25% yield cap, a move that weakened the yen as investors focused on the widening interest rate gap between Japan and the United States.

Kuroda said the BOJ will continue to defend the cap as allowing bond yields to breach that level could hurt corporate capital expenditure and the broader economy.
""If long-term interest rates rise rapidly, we are ready to deploy such market operations,"" Kuroda said, signalling the bank's readiness to step into the market again as needed.

Even the most dovish central banks are now caving in, and accepting the need to act against persistent inflation. The latest case in point is the Reserve Bank of Australia.
Earlier on Tuesday, the RBA opened the door to its first interest rate hike in over a decade, dropping a pledge to be ""patient"" on policy.
Markets were already positioning for higher Australian rates, but the RBA's pivot nonetheless pushed the Aussie dollar to its highest level since June. 
GRAPHIC: Aussie dollar surges on hawkish RBA- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdvzyjjbopw/AUD0504.png 
Another dove, Sweden's Riksbank, too changed tack recently and started talking about the need to hike rates this year. 
With some European Central Bank policymakers pushing for tighter policy in 2022, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank are now the outliers. But watch that space. 
Stock markets, meanwhile, are holding their ground. Asian shares rose to the highest in more than a month while European and U.S. stock futures are flat to a touch firmer.
On the geo-political front, the likelihood of more Western sanctions to punish Russia for the killings of Ukrainian civilians is lifting oil and hurting the euro.
The United States ratcheted up the pressure on Monday, stopping Russia from accessing more than $600 million out of reserves held at American banks to pay bondholders. 
And it's also time to start paying attention to France, which holds the first round of a presidential election this weekend.
Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen's presidential campaign has gained momentum. She captured 48.5% of voter intentions in a poll of a likely runoff against incumbent Emmanuel Macron, the highest score she has ever notched.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank on Tuesday opened the door to the first interest rate increase in more than a decade as it dropped a previous pledge to be ""patient"" on policy, a major surprise that sent the local dollar to nine-month highs.
Wrapping up its April policy meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept its cash rate at 0.1% but noted inflation had picked up and was likely to rise further, while unemployment had fallen faster than expected to 4.0%.
""Over coming months, important additional evidence will be available to the Board on both inflation and the evolution of labour costs,"" said RBA Governor Philip Lowe in a statement.
""The Board will assess this and other incoming information as its sets policy,"" he added, omitting any reference made in previous statements to the Board being patient.
Markets took the change as a step toward an eventual tightening and sent the local dollar up 0.9% to a nine-month high.
Previously, Lowe had said that it was plausible a first hike would come later this year, while markets have long wagered on an earlier move given how inflation has taken off.
Data for consumer prices is due on April 27 and analysts suspect it could show core inflation jumped by 1.0% or more in the first quarter to take the annual pace to at least 3.2%.
That would be the first time core inflation topped the RBA's 2-3% target band since early 2010 and make it harder to justify retaining rates at emergency lows.
""The retirement of the 'patience' mantra and is an acknowledgement that like the rest of the developed country complex, inflation in Australia has and will surprise with its magnitude and momentum,"" said GSFM investment strategist Stephen Miller.
""The RBA wishes to avoid meeting an inflation target by causing a recession, or allowing high and potentially destabilising inflation to persist well into 2023.""
Markets have long been priced for a June rate rise to 0.25%, and imply no less than six more hikes to 1.75% by year end. Yields on three-year bonds rose 6 basis points on Tuesday to 2.46%, having already surged 87 basis points in March.

That aggressive outlook in part reflects expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike by 50 basis points in both May and June, adding to pressure for other central banks to follow.

The compromise, if passed, would be less than half of the $22.5 billion initially sought by U.S. President Joe Biden to combat COVID, prepare for future variants and shore up the nation's pandemic infrastructure.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki in a statement urged Congress to move ""promptly."" 
""The House looks forward to considering this urgent package upon its passage in the Senate and sending it to the President's desk for signature,"" U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.
""While this agreement does not meet the Administration's full request, this package will fulfill immediate needs to secure more vaccines, boosters, testing and therapeutics to keep the pandemic at bay - and it must be enacted as quickly as possible,"" Pelosi added.
Biden has said more funding is needed as the world continues to fight COVID in the pandemic's third year. While U.S. officials have said they do not expect a surge from the latest BA.2 Omicron variant, they have pointed to the need to continue to make vaccines available at no cost and to boost surveillance and testing.
U.S. regulators last week approved a second booster shot for older and immunocompromised Americans, but administration officials have said without more funding from Congress money will run out for the free shots.
""The consequences of inaction are severe,"" Biden warned lawmakers at a White House event last week. 
Lawmakers had been weighing a $15 billion measure that included $5 billion in international aid. Health experts have said without full global immunization efforts the virus can continue to mutate, increasing the risk of infection and vaccine evasion. 
Members of Congress negotiating the package, however, could not agree on how to pay for the global response.

One of the negotiators, Republican Senator Mitt Romney, said he was open to funding global efforts in a separate, ""fiscally-responsible solution"" in coming weeks. 
A Senate vote on the $10 billion measure could come as soon as this week. Approval would send it to the House of Representatives.

The Washington-based lender said in a report on Tuesday it expected 2022 growth in the developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region, which includes China, to expand 5.0% percent, lower than its 5.4% forecast in October.
But growth could slow to 4.0% if conditions worsened and government policy responses were weaker, World Bank said.
China's economy is expected to grow 5.0% this year, down from a previous estimate of 5.4%, it said, noting its government's capacity to provide stimulus to offset adverse shocks. 
""The region confronts a triad of shocks which threaten to undermine its growth momentum,"" said World Bank East Asia and Pacific Chief Economist Aaditya Mattoo.
The war between Russia and Ukraine, which Mattoo said was the ""most serious risk"" to the region's growth outlook, is leading to food and fuel price increases, financial volatility and reduced confidence all over the world.
Mattoo said Russia's invasion of Ukraine was more worrying given that the region was still contending with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a structural slowdown in China and faster inflation that could prompt quicker U.S. monetary tightening.
The war's impact on economies in East Asia and the Pacific would vary depending on their exposure and resilience, Mattoo said. Excluding China, output in the rest of the region is projected to expand 4.8% this year. 

""Just as the economies of East Asia and the Pacific were recovering from the pandemic-induced shock, the war in Ukraine is weighing on growth momentum,"" World Bank Vice President for East Asia and Pacific Manuela Ferro (NYSE:FOE) said in a statement.

338,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 07:21PM ET</span>",,,,,,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's central bank should hike interest rates to ensure the country will not fall out of lockstep with the rest of the world in its monetary policy, an associate of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida whose ideas likely inspired the premier's economic policy framework said.
Kishida's government should unleash as much as $400 billion in public spending over the next five years to boost medical and anti-disaster investment, businessman George Hara also told Reuters in an interview on Friday.
The vision of Hara, who heads an organisation that aims to reduce poverty around the world, likely served as a backbone of Kishida's ""new capitalism"" agenda through which the premier is pushing for greater wealth distribution.
As the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks move forward with hiking interest rates, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) should follow along to avoid Japan's yield spreads widening too much, according to Hara, who published a book in 2009 also called ""New Capitalism"".
""The yen is weakening on yield differentials, so there's no problem if rates in Japan rise,"" said Hara, who added that Japan's monetary policy should move in line with the rest of the world.
Keeping rates around zero was negative for the many people in Japan who rely on savings or pensions to get by, Hara said. He added that those who would be hurt by higher rates in Japan were likely financial players such as hedge funds and high-frequency traders.
Hara got to know Kishida during the premier's 2012-2017 stint as foreign minister when Hara was serving as adviser to Japan's Cabinet Office, which oversees the government's long-term economic planning.
Hara, who also served as a finance ministry adviser for four years through 2010, said the government should ramp up spending on medical and anti-disaster infrastructure by as much as 10 trillion yen ($81.55 billion) a year over five years.
Kishida has so far ordered his cabinet to put together a relief package to offset the economic blow from rising energy prices, which would be funded by special reserves.
The premier has also faced pressure, including from his party's ruling coalition partner Komeito, to compile an extra budget to enlarge the size of that spending.

Japan entered the coronavirus pandemic already saddled with debt more than double the size of its $4.6 trillion economy, making it the industrial world's most-indebted nation as a result of decades of massive spending aimed at reviving growth.

LONDON (Reuters) -The fallout of the Russia and Ukraine war has just helped tip two of world's poorest countries into full-blown crises, and the list of those at risk - and the queue at the International Monetary Fund's door - will only get longer from here. 
They may be far from the fighting in Ukraine, but a mass resignation of Sri Lanka's cabinet on Monday and drastic weekend manoeuvres by Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan to avoid his removal, show how far the economic impact spreads. 
Both Sri Lanka and Pakistan have seen their long-festering public disquiet about economic mismanagement come to a head, but there is a double-digit list of other countries also in the danger zone.
A handful were already on the brink of debt crises in the wake of the COVID pandemic, the war's resulting surge in energy and food prices, however, have undoubtedly made things worse.
Turkey, Tunisia, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya and others that also import the majority of their oil and gas as well as basic foodstuffs, such as wheat and corn, which have all soared between 25% and 40% this year, have also been facing heavy pressure.
Mounting costs of imports and subsidies for those everyday essentials had already convinced Cairo to devalue its currency 15% and seek IMF help in recent weeks. Tunisia and a long-resistant Sri Lanka have asked for assistance too.
Ghana, still reluctant to approach the Fund, meanwhile is seeing its currency slide, while Pakistan, a country already with 22 IMF programmes to its name, is almost certain to need more having now sunk into turmoil again.
""This energy shock is certainly contributing to the political uncertainty in Sri Lanka and Pakistan,"" said Renaissance Capital's chief economist Charlie Robertson, flagging it as a key factor for both Egypt and Ghana too.
""It wouldn't surprise me if more countries were impacted,"" he added, citing Jordan as well and Morocco where a relatively sizable middle class makes it sensitive to political change.
HUNGER IN AFRICA
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has given a stark warning that ""war in Ukraine means hunger in Africa"".
The IMF's sister organisation, the World Bank, has also said https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/are-we-ready-coming-spate-debt-crises a dozen of the world's poorest countries may now default over the next year, which would be ""the largest spate of debt crises in developing economies in a generation"".
Overindebted ""frontier' economies"", as the least developed group of countries are referred to, now owe $3.5 trillion — some $500 billion above pre-pandemic levels, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimates.
Pakistan and Sri Lanka already spent the equivalent of 3.4% and 2.2% of their respective GDP's on energy before the pandemic. In Turkey the figure was an even larger 6.5%, and with oil prices having been above $100 a barrel for months now, the pressures are getting worse.
Every additional $10 spent on a barrel of oil adds 0.3% to Turkey's current account deficit, according to the IIF. For Lebanon it is 1.3%, while rating agency Fitch estimates that the cost of electricity subsidies in Tunisia could surge to over 1.8% of its GDP this year from 0.8%. 
UNREST
Food prices are a biting problem too. They were already rising as countries emerged from lockdowns, exacerbated in some regions by droughts.
With Ukraine and Russia accounting for 29% of the world's wheat exports and 19% of maize shipments, prices of these have gone up another 25%-30% this year.
Egypt buys over 60% of its wheat overseas, four-fifths from Russia and Ukraine. After devaluing its currency and approaching the IMF, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's government has also just fixed bread prices to contain runaway food costs.
""For many countries these (energy and food price) rises will have repercussions for budgets, for subsidies and for political and social stability."" said Viktor Szabo, an emerging market portfolio manager at abrdn in London.
""If you don't control prices you can have unrest, just think back to the Arab Spring and the role of food prices there.""

With global borrowing costs also now rising rapidly as major central banks start to raise interest rates, Max Castle, a fixed income portfolio manager at Mediolanum Irish Operations said several emerging markets commodity importers may have little choice but seek help.
""It is the right situation for the IMF to intervene supporting the more vulnerable countries – particularly the ones with a current account deficit,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), published his closely watched annual letter to shareholders on Monday, covering critical issues including the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, sanctions, inflation and interest rates.
Here are five of the key takeaways from the letter: 
THE U.S. ECONOMY IS STILL STRONG...
Dimon has long been bullish on the U.S. economy and repeated that message in his letter, noting the average American consumer is ""in excellent financial shape"" with leverage among the lowest on record, excellent mortgage underwriting, plentiful jobs with wage increases and more than $2 trillion in excess savings.
...BUT INFLATION WILL REQUIRE AGGRESSIVE RATE HIKES
The Federal Reserve and the government were right to take bold actions amid the pandemic, but stimulus probably lasted too long, said Dimon. He believes the rate rises needed to rein in inflation would be ""significantly higher than the markets expect."" 
Dimon also had some advice for the Fed: it shouldn't worry about the market volatility rate rises will cause unless that volatility affects the economy. It should be flexible in its plan and be prepared to respond quickly to events on the ground. 
THE WAR IN UKRAINE WILL SLOW THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
""The hostilities in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia are already having a substantial economic impact,"" Dimon wrote. 
JPMorgan economists think that the euro area, highly dependent on Russia for oil and gas, will see GDP growth of roughly 2% in 2022, instead of the 4.5% pace expected just before the invasion began. By contrast, they expect the U.S. economy to advance roughly 2.5% versus a previously estimated 3%, Dimon wrote. 
""These estimates are based upon a fairly static view of the war in Ukraine and the sanctions now in place,"" Dimon wrote. More Russia sanctions are possible, he noted. 
""Along with the unpredictability of war itself and the uncertainty surrounding global commodity supply chains, this makes for a potentially explosive situation,"" he wrote.
...THE WORLD MAY BE FACING AN ""UNPRECEDENTED"" MOMENT
The confluence of the dramatic stimulus-fueled recovery from the pandemic, the likely need for rapid rate rises, the war in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia may be unprecedented. 
""They present completely different circumstances than what we’ve experienced in the past – and their confluence may dramatically increase the risks ahead,"" Dimon wrote, adding the war will also affect geopolitics for decades. 
WITHOUT STRONG AMERICAN LEADERSHIP ""CHAOS"" WILL PREVAIL
""American global leadership is the best course for the world and for America,"" Dimon wrote. Since nature abhors a power vacuum, it is increasingly clear that without strong American leadership ""chaos likely will prevail,"" he added. 

However, he noted the world does not want an ""arrogant"" America bossing everyone around, but an America that works with allies, collaborating and compromising.
""We can organize military and economic frameworks that make the world safe and prosperous for democracy and freedom only if we work with our allies,"" he added.

Greece has received three international bailouts from the euro zone and the IMF worth 280 billion euros ($307.19 billion) since 2010. It emerged from its latest bailout in 2018 and has relied on the debt markets to cover its borrowing needs since.
""Greece concluded today the repayment of its debts to the IMF,"" Finance Minister Christos Staikouras said in a statement. 
After previous early repayments to the IMF, Greece owed 1.9 billion euros in loans due by 2024, the last batch of a total of 28 billion euros the Fund provided between 2010 and 2014.
The move allows Athens to reduce its debt servicing costs because IMF loans are more expensive than its debt to EU institutions. By paying off the IMF early, Greece is saving 230 million euros, Staikouras said.

Last week, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) said it agreed to allow Greece to pay back the IMF without a proportional early reimbursement of its loans to EU authorities.

343,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 12:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. jobs market has never been tighter than it is today, increasing the risks to the economy as Federal Reserve policy makers move to rein in inflation, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
The Wall Street bank’s economists have compiled a gauge of U.S. labor that they say better tracks wage gains -- which are key to inflationary pressures -- than other measures. They add the total number of employees and the number of job openings to estimate labor demand. For supply, they count the labor force, or people in work and those looking for positions.
The latest reading of the gap shows an excess of 5.3 million in labor demand versus supply of workers -- “the most overheated level of the postwar period both in absolute terms and relative to the population,” Jan Hatzius, Goldman’s chief economist, wrote in a note Monday. 
Much of the continued strong employment growth that’s likely in coming months will come from people who are currently outside the labor force -- something that will help ease this jobs-to-workers gap, Hatzius wrote. That will happen as Americans living off of savings work down their stockpiles, he said.
“The bad news, however, is that this is probably not sufficient,” Hatzius wrote. “In order to reduce wage pressure to levels at least broadly consistent with the Fed’s inflation target, we estimate that the gap needs to shrink by at least one-half.”
Fed policy makers target 2% inflation, and the most recent reading for the central bank’s preferred core gauge was 5.4%. As for wages, Friday’s March jobs report showed a 6.7% annual advance for production and non-supervisory employees, the biggest since 1982 after excluding spring 2020 distortions from the pandemic shutdown.
Given the magnitude of tightness, Hatzius warned of three potential consequences:
Hatzius also noted that, historically, there has never been a loosening in the job market on the order of 0.6% of the labor force -- “a share that would correspond to about 1 million at present” -- that wasn’t connected with a recession.
Similarly worrying, the U.S. unemployment rate -- at 3.6% currently, practically its pre-pandemic level -- has never risen more than 0.35 percentage point over three months without a recession.
Despite the alarming record, Hatzius takes heart from the fact that the sample size is small, at just 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II. He also said that episodes in other big economies showed moderate labor-market deterioration can occur without economic slumps.
Also encouraging: there are few signs of the kind of financial imbalances among American households and companies that were seen in the run-up to the 2001 and 2007-09 slumps.
Still, “the broader point is that once the labor market has overshot full employment, the path to a soft landing becomes narrow,” Hatzius concluded.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A record number of Canadian businesses are facing capacity pressures amid intense labor shortages and ongoing supply chain difficulties, with many expecting significant wage and input price growth, a regular Bank of Canada survey said on Monday.
The central bank's Business Outlook Survey Indicator dipped in the first quarter from a record high the previous quarter, but remained far above pre-pandemic levels. The survey was conducted before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""The number of firms reporting capacity pressures related to labor or supply chain challenges is at a record high,"" the survey said.
""Because of persistent capacity pressures and strong demand, firms expect significant growth in wages, input prices and output prices. Plans to increase investment spending and add staff continue to be widespread.""
Inflation expectations for the next two years continued to increase, with 70% of firms now expecting inflation to be above the Bank of Canada's 1-3% control range over the next two years.
Canada's inflation hit 5.7% in February, a 30-year high and the 11th straight month above 3%.
Economists said higher inflation expectations bolster the case for the Bank of Canada to hike interest rates by 50 basis points at its decision next week.
""If we still needed to cement the case for a half point rate hike in April, the Bank of Canada's Business Outlook survey provided it, at least in terms of inflation expectations,"" said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, in a note.
A separate survey of consumer expectations found the general public also anticipates inflation above target for the next two years, before easing. It noted long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.
Money markets estimate a 70% chance the Bank of Canada will go ahead with the larger increase on April 13. A deputy said last month the central bank was ready to act ""forcefully"" to rein in inflation.
The Bank of Canada also did a separate online survey on the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation,"" on Canadian firms. About half said they expect to be affected, mostly due to higher commodity prices and increased supply chain woes. 

Several firms, notably those tied to energy and other commodities, expect higher sales. 
The Canadian dollar rose 0.3% to 1.2480 to the greenback, or 80.13 U.S. cents.

345,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 11:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Treasury-curve inversions shouldn’t be ignored, but aren’t a sure-fire way of signaling that a U.S. economic recession is around the corner. So says Marc Seidner of Pacific Investment Management Co.
“A yield-curve inversion should never be dismissed just because the backdrop has changed,” Seidner, Pimco’s chief investment officer of non-traditional strategies, wrote in a blog post. “The curve’s signal may be less clear than in the past.” Yet some current inversions are “signaling caution, rather than recession.”
The Federal Reserve’s plans to likely lift rates at each of its remaining policy meetings this year, after hiking by a quarter-point last month, has unmoored short-term yields and inverted several parts of the Treasury curve. That has brought to the fore an array of opinions over whether an inversion is still the historic foreshadowing event to a recession or not.
Two-year Treasury yields exceeded 10-year rates by about 4 basis points at 9:16 a.m. New York time Monday while five-year tenors traded with about a 9 basis-point premium over 30-year yields. Money-market traders are pricing in over 200 basis points of additional Fed rate increases in 2022.
“Longer-dated gauges like the two-year/10-year and five-year/30-year Treasury curves can be more valuable than the widely followed three-month/10-year curve, in our view,” Seidner said. “The reason is that the Fed has already laid out its rate-hike projections in its ‘dot plot’ forecast, and looking at market rates over a short-term horizon may be less informative than focusing on what the Fed is saying it will do.”
In the Fed’s latest “dot plot,” officials’ median projection was for the target rate to end 2022 at about 1.9% and rise to about 2.8% in 2023. 
Campbell Harvey at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business was one of the first to show the historic link of inversions to recessions, focused on the spread between three-month and 10-year yields -- which is currently positive by around 185 basis points. High inflation and “geopolitical risk -- which we haven’t even felt the economic outcome of yet, besides at the gas pump -- is all acting like a tax,” Harvey said last month. “It all indicates slower economic growth.”

Pimco’s Seidner said the most-important sector to watch is the forward curve, which projects the spread between current rates into the future. He notes that the inversion between current one-year rates relative to where they are priced one year in the future in the forward market.
“Does this mean a recession is imminent? No, but it is a risk to monitor,” Seidner said. 
“Pimco is calling for above-trend growth and a gradual easing of inflation pressures from higher peaks in developed market economies. However, the risks of higher inflation and lower growth have increased, along with the risk of recession in 2023,” he said, adding that has sparked the firm to be underweight duration, primarily in the long-end of the curve.

346,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 10:21AM ET</span>",,,,,,"PARIS (Reuters) - Record low temperatures in many parts of France in the night from Sunday to Monday is expected to have caused severe damage to some fruit and wine production in the country for a second year running, growers said.
France recorded the coldest April night since at least 1947, at an average of minus 1.5 degrees Celsius (29.3°F), with record low temperatures for the month seen in many parts of the country, weather forecaster Meteo France said on Monday.
Forecasts ahead of the cold snap had prompted producers to try to protect vineyards and orchards with anti-frost systems on Sunday.
The frosts came after particularly mild temperatures in March that made shoots develop early, leaving them more fragile to cold snaps.
""This was another terrible night for fruit growers and winegrowers with temperatures down to minus 5 or minus 6 degrees (Celsius) (21.2°F),"" Christiane Lambert, head of France's largest farm union FNSEA told Europe 1 radio.
Producers of fruits such as plums, cherries, apples, pears were the most hit and some were set to lose at least 80% of their harvest, she said. 
Fresh fruit prices gained 4% in 2021, far above the rise of the average food index at 0.6%, statistics office Insee said.
A rise this year would come at a time when inflation is already hitting record highs in France, although fresh fruit and vegetable account for less than 2% of the total consumer price index in France.
In the wine sector, growers who had managed to prune a little later than usual may have less damage but it could be difficult for those who already had advanced vines, Lambert said.

Wine output last year was one of the lowest on record due to a combination of frost damage and pest attacks, with the Champagne harvest at the lowest in 40 years.
It was too early to assess potential damage to newly planted sugar beet, growers group CGB said. Last year's frosts had severely hurt sugar beet, forcing growers to replant tens of thousands of hectares.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Gulf Arab states are channelling up to $22 billion to Egypt to help it overcome a currency crisis, the third such rescue in a decade, as analysts watch for greater exchange rate flexibility to avert future crises. 
The central bank allowed Egypt's pound, which had been stable since November 2020, to drop by 14% against the dollar on March 21 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted investors to withdraw billions of dollars from Egyptian treasury markets. 
Last week Saudi Arabia said it had deposited $5 billion with Egypt's central bank and would make additional investments that could bring as much $10 billion in foreign currency into Egypt. 
Qatar has pledged investment deals worth $5 billion, Egypt's cabinet said, and details on the purchase of stakes worth a reported $2 billion by Abu Dhabi sovereign fund ADQ are expected soon.
""The flurry of Gulf investments into Egypt is reminiscent of the period after the ousting of President Morsi in 2013 when the Gulf pledged $23 billion in financial aid,"" said James Swanston of Capital Economics. 
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait sent Egypt $23 billion in grants, cash deposits and fuel shipments in the 18 months after Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, then army chief and now president, led the overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Mursi in 2013. 
That aid allowed Egypt to put off an IMF accord and spend more on supporting the currency, which came under severe pressure after the 2011 uprising that ended Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule. 
During a second currency crisis in 2016 Egypt devalued the pound by half, and Saudi Arabia deposited about $3 billion and the UAE $1 billion with the central bank, setting up an IMF accord in November 2016. 
Egypt, which continued to grow during the coronavirus pandemic but saw its current account deficit widen as import costs rise and tourism receipts dwindle, said last week it was in talks with the IMF for potential funds and technical support to hedge against the effects of the latest crisis.
Last month Sisi visited Saudi Arabia and hosted the UAE's de-facto ruler in Sharm el-Sheikh, as Egypt reinforced ties with Gulf allies and participated in an emerging Arab-Israeli axis.
HARD ASSETS 
This time around, Gulf countries seem to be toughening conditions by seeking hard assets in addition to central bank deposits, a demand that could increase the cost to Egypt, analysts said.
Inflows from Cairo's Gulf allies would reassure the IMF and encourage foreign investors to return to Egypt's high-interest, short-term treasuries, leaving the country still vulnerable to global financial shocks, said Amr Adly, an assistant professor at the American University in Cairo. 
""This is a message that we have rich friends, and that these rich friends are willing to give up money in times of need,"" he said. 
Egypt's currency could come under more pressure as higher global commodity prices feed into inflation, putting even more strain on the pound, other analysts said. 
""We continue to see a more flexible FX regime as critical to Egypt's long-term external account vulnerabilities,"" HSBC said in a note. 
""But with the bilateral inflows providing relief and seemingly having no policy conditions attached to them, the pressure for substantive change to the FX regime may be set to fade,"" it added.
On the day of the devaluation, the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee stressed ""the importance of FX flexibility to act as a shock absorber"".
Egypt's pound was at 18.22 to the dollar on Monday, just above the 18.17 to the dollar it fell to on March 21. 

Monica Malik of Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank said that because Egypt had exceeded its IMF borrowing quota, any new assistance could involve funding from other multilateral institutions and bilateral components such as Gulf Cooperation Council countries. 
""The GCC support measures are likely to be supportive for Egypt meeting the IMF's requirement under its exceptional access criteria,"" she said.

The value of the market would jump 72.6% from the Portland-based research firm's estimate of nearly $73 billion in 2020, when COVID-19 delays and reallocation of funds to support the health crisis ""severely affected"" the defence sector.
An increase in geopolitical conflicts and bigger military budgets would likely push the figure up at an annual compounded rate of 5.4% until 2030, the report said.
U.S. President Joe Biden last week requested a record peacetime national defence budget, which would prioritise modernizing its nuclear ""triad"" of ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles.
The report predicted that demand for small nuclear warheads, which can be easily deployed through aircraft and land-based missiles, would fuel faster growth in these segments, although submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) accounted for a quarter of the market in 2020.
While North America dominated more than half the global market in 2020, the report predicted the fastest growth would come from the Asia-Pacific region on initiatives by India, Pakistan and China to bolster their nuclear arsenals.
""However, international treaties and consortiums discourage nuclear testing,"" the firm said in a report summary. ""This hampers the market growth."" 
It predicted that the rising influence of non-nuclear proliferation treaties and national efforts should increase the number of warheads in storage or awaiting dismantlement.

Active weapons, however, accounted for the ""lion's share"" - more than two-thirds - of the market in 2020, it said, due to investment in nuclear arsenals and new warhead purchases.
Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States at the start of the year issued a joint statement saying there could be no winners in a nuclear war and it must be avoided.

Investing.com -- Chinese ADRs get a boost after state regulators say they'll lift the current ban on providing full audit information to foreign regulators. The EU plots fresh sanctions against Russia after evidence emerges of atrocities committed by its soldiers during their occupation of northern Ukraine. Elon Musk takes a 9% stake in Twitter and Howard Schultz pauses Starbucks' buyback program. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 4th April.
1. EU mulls new sanctions after evidence of Russian atrocities 
The EU is set to discuss fresh sanctions against Russia later after evidence emerged at the weekend of atrocities committed by Russian soldiers during their three-week occupation of areas around Kyiv. France’s President Emmanuel Macron called for an immediate embargo on oil and coal imports from Russia, but not on natural gas imports. Germany remains opposed to such measures.
The Mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said the authorities had found 280 people in a mass grave, all shot in the back of the head, some with their hands tied behind their back. Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, said 410 bodies of civilians had been recovered from the Kyiv region. Those executed included the mayor of the town of Motyzhyn, Olga Sukhenko, along with her husband and son.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the reports were fake and orchestrated by the Ukrainian authorities. An editorial by the Russian news agency RIA Novosti meanwhile called for the liquidation of the whole Ukrainian elite.
2. Chinese ADRs roar after regulators unveil new audit rules
Chinese tech stocks rallied in Hong Kong after mainland regulators said at the weekend they will lift the ban on providing full audit information to foreign regulators. That appears to remove the threat of the forced delisting of their American Depositary Receipts by the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission.
The Hang Seng index rose 2.1%, while mainland indices were closed for a public holiday. In premarket trading in New York,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs rose 4.9%, while Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) ADRs rose 5.0%, and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) ADRs rose 8.0%.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission unveiled draft rules on Saturday that the English-language China Daily publication said will provide clearer guidelines for confidentiality for overseas listings, as well as facilitating cross-border regulatory cooperation, including joint inspections.
3. Elon Musk takes a stake in Twitter
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock rose 25% in premarket after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) disclosed that its CEO Elon Musk had taken a passive stake of 9.2% in the social media company. Musk, who paid $40 million to settle SEC charges that he misled investors with tweets in 2018, has criticized the platform for restricting free speech.
The news comes after Tesla said at the weekend it posted a new record for deliveries in the first quarter despite what Musk called “exceptional” difficulties.
Tesla’s Shanghai factory is set to remain closed again this week after city authorities extended their lockdown order to allow for testing of all 25 million of its inhabitants for COVID-19. Reports from China suggest that outbreaks of the virus continue to spread, even as global deaths from the disease hit a two-year low.
4. Stocks set to push higher; Starbucks in focus; Durable goods data due
U.S. stock markets are set to push a little higher at the opening, still supported by a rock-solid employment report for March that showed continued rapid gains in jobs and wages.
By 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 23 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.4%.
Stocks likely to be in focus later (in addition to Twitter) include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), after chairman Howard Schultz paused the coffee chain’s buyback program on his return to the CEO’s seat, and J.P. Morgan (NYSE:JPM), after CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledged a possible loss of to $1 billion on its Russia exposure in the long term. Data for U.S. factory and durable goods orders are due at 8:30 AM ET.
5. Oil flat as EU sanctions talk balances Shanghai lockdown
Crude oil prices have opened the week in a mixed fashion, with the news from China and weekend talk of European nations joining the latest U.S. initiative to release strategic reserves weighing, while the talk of fresh EU sanctions on Russia has kept the threat of a squeeze on non-Russian supplies alive.
By 6:25 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up a modest 4c at $99.31 a barrel, while Brent futures were down less than 0.1% at $104.31 a barrel.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron risks seeing high inflation eroding economic gains achieved during his presidency as he seeks a second term.
Macron was elected in 2017 on promises to reboot the euro zone's second-biggest economy with a shock of pro-business reforms by cutting taxes, easing labour laws and aggressively promoting France to foreign investors.
His early reforms prompted violent anti-government ""Yellow Vest"" protests in late 2018, but Macron can point to a series of indicators as evidence his reform drive is paying dividends.
Opinion polls show Macron is likely to win the first round of the election on Sunday. But far-right leader Marine Le Pen is staging a comeback in the polls and the race is tightening between the two frontrunners for the April 24 run-off.
ECONOMIC OUTPUT 
During his presidency, France's economy outperformed other big European countries as well as the broader euro zone, bouncing back from the worst of the COVID crisis with the strongest growth in more than five decades.

UNEMPLOYMENT
Strong growth along with labour reforms to make hiring and firing easier have helped push France's stubbornly high unemployment to the lowest level since the start of the 2008 global financial crisis.
More remarkably, youth unemployment - a bane of Macron's predecessors for decades - has come down even faster as his government ramped up apprenticeship programmes and incentives to hire young people.

INFLATION
Record high inflation across the euro zone has left Macron's government increasingly at pains to convince voters that its cocktail of growth, tax cuts and targeted payouts to people on low incomes is translating into real purchasing power gains.
To keep those gains from evaporating, France put together a more than 25 billion euro ($27.6 billion) package of measures to soften the blow of an energy price-fuelled inflation spike.

While costly caps on gas and power price increases have kept French inflation lower than in most other euro zone countries, Macron's rivals are capitalising on voters' frustration with dwindling purchasing power.
COMPANY REGISTRATIONS
The inflation surge is tarnishing an economic record that otherwise suggests France has become more open to business during Macron's presidency.
Foreign direct investment has poured in and employers are shedding their fear of coveted long-term labour contracts, knowing they can more easily get rid of workers if necessary. 
Meanwhile, entrepreneurs are setting up new companies faster than ever in France, although a large share is of self-employed delivery workers setting up to ride the online shopping boom.

NATIONAL DEBT 
The public finances represent a blemish on Macron's economic record.
Promising to stabilise the economy at the start of the pandemic ""whatever it costs"", Macron ran a record budget deficits in 2020 of 8.9% of economic output, leaving the country saddled with debts the central bank says will take a decade to bring back to pre-COVID levels.

COMPETITION
Macron's progress in making France more business friendly has so far not translated into gains in competitiveness if the trade balance is anything to go by.
The trade deficit has swelled to record levels partly due to more expensive energy imports but also because French firms are still struggling to win foreign market share.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Australian venture capital firm Square Peg is raising $550 million to expand its commitment to back startups in its key markets of Australia and Israel, with a growing focus on Southeast Asia's booming tech markets.
""We do want to continue to double down in Southeast Asia in particular,"" Tushar Roy, a Singapore-based partner at Square Peg, told Reuters in an interview. ""We are currently exploring investment opportunities across most markets in the region."" 
Founded in 2012, the venture capital firm is one of Australia's largest, with more than $1 billion in assets under management across multiple funds.
Roy said Square Peg's Fund 4, targeting new investments, and Opportunities Fund 2, designed to invest in later-stage follow-on offerings in portfolio firms, were set to complete their fundraisings in the first half of the year.
Venture firms have been ramping up investments in Southeast Asia as rising consumer adoption of digital platforms since the COVID-19 pandemic fuels startups across many sectors.
""There's now more capital that's becoming available in these markets to take these companies from early stage to mid stage to growth stage,"" said Roy, who moved from Sydney in 2020 to set up Square Peg's Southeast Asia office.
""The overall prospects of success for companies from an end-to-end journey perspective are better today than they were, maybe five years ago,"" he said.
Last month, global venture capital firm Accel launched a $650 million fund for Indian and Southeast Asian startups, while Indonesia-focused Alpha JWC Ventures and AC Ventures raised new funding rounds late last year.
Square Peg's 50-plus investment portfolio includes Australian design collaboration platform Canva, Singapore-headquartered global e-scooter operator Neuron Mobility, and Southeast Asian fintech firm FinAccel.
The VC firm invests in areas such as consumer Internet and software as a service, and mainly participates in companies' Series A and B funding rounds. It hired Piruze Sabuncu, a former senior executive of U.S. digital payments firm Stripe, as a partner in its Singapore office in late 2020.
Roy said a sharp fall in equity markets in recent months had affected private fundraisings of companies. ""With round sizes stabilizing and possibly getting smaller, you should see the commensurate effect on valuations.""

Still, capital was available for some companies, he said.
""You are seeing a flight to quality in private markets where a smaller cohort of companies that have healthy unit economics, healthy balance sheets, healthy business and a proven product market are attracting more and more attention,"" Roy said.

Europe's largest economy is heavily dependent upon Russia for energy, and nations banks echoed concerns over possible energy disruption expressed by big names in industry in recent days.
Christian Sewing, the chief executive of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), said in his role as president of Germany's BDB bank lobby that banks expected sharply slower growth this year of around 2% due to the war in Ukraine.
""The situation would be even worse if imports or supplies of Russian oil and natural gas were to be halted. A significant recession in Germany would then be virtually unavoidable,"" Sewing told journalists.
""The question of government aid measures for companies and sectors would then become even more urgent,"" he said.
Sewing once again called on the European Central Bank to act to fend off inflation.

He said the ECB should end its net asset purchases soon and should send a signal with interest rates.
""A signal that is urgently needed,"" he said.

Investing.com -- European politicians are set to discuss fresh sanctions on Russia later Monday after the emergence at the weekend of evidence of atrocities committed by Russian troops against civilians in Ukraine.
However, the continent still appears no nearer to a complete boycott of Russian energy, seen by many as the only way to exert enough economic pressure on Russia to change its course.
Finance ministers from the Eurozone are due to meet at 6 AM ET (1000 GMT). Charles Michel, president of the EU Council that coordinates the actions of the member states, tweeted earlier that ""further EU sanctions & support are on their way,"" without specifying further.
French President Emmanuel Macron told the radio station France Inter earlier that EU sanctions should be extended to cover Russian oil and coal, although he left out natural gas. 
""What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,"" said Macron, who faces the first round of a presidential election at the end of this week. 
""Unless the sanctions target energy supplies to Europe, or firms from other countries (e.g. China or India) doing business with Russia, the marginal economic impact (of new sanctions) is likely to be limited,"" said Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, in a morning briefing.
Europe sends Russia nearly $1 billion a day to pay for its imports of oil, refined products, coal and natural gas. Benchmark northwest European gas futures were little changed on Monday morning, indicating low expectations of a dramatic change to policy. The euro fell 0.3% to $1.1025.
Various reports over the weekend uncovered evidence of mass executions of civilians by Russian troops during their three-week occupation of the area. The Mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, said the authorities had found 280 people in a mass grave, all shot in the back of the head, some with their hands tied behind their back. Iryna Venedyktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, said 410 bodies of civilians had been recovered from the Kyiv region.
Moscow said that the images distributed around the world were fake and had been staged by the Ukrainian authorities.
However, the German political establishment remains reluctant to impose a boycott that would have an immediate impact on the German economy, due to the practical difficulties of finding alternatives to Russian energy in the short term.
SPD head Lars Klingbeil said on a talk show late on Sunday that he still considers an immediate gas embargo to be ""the wrong course"". Bavaria's Governor Markus Soeder, head of the center-right CSU party, agreed, pointing to the fact that Russia is already looking for alternative customers such as India. 
Development Minister Svenja Schulze, also a member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left Social Democrats, told the TV stations RTL and NTV that sanctions should ""above all hurt Russia and not us."" She added that the steel and chemical industries would be particularly hard hit by a sudden stop of Russian energy supplies.  
Germany's Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck said last week that Germany will be unable to wean itself off Russian gas until 2024.

LIMA (Reuters) -Peru, the world's no. 2 copper producer, will target ""excess profits"" that mining firms have gained from soaring global metals prices for extra taxation, the country's economy minister told Reuters.
While President Pedro Castillo came to power last July pledging to increase taxes on the powerful mining sector, the current plan is far less ambitious than initial promises of sharp tax hikes that met fierce resistance from the industry and a divided Congress.
""The focus is on the surplus profits,"" Oscar Graham (NYSE:GHM), the country's minister of economy and finance, said in an interview in Lima late on Friday, adding that the government was looking at an ""adjustment"" to taxes.
Copper prices are currently trading at near record levels around $10,000 per tonne in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""The margins (of the adjustment) are being evaluated,"" he said, but added it was important that the sector did not lose competitiveness and that mining investment was not discouraged.
Graham said Peru needed better distribution of mining wealth to communities to quell mining protests that have rocked the sector and stalled production at key mines such as MMG Ltd's Las Bambas and Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO)'s Cuajone mine.
""We have to look at the issue of the efficient use of resources provided by mining, otherwise we will have recurrent conflicts in the country,"" he said. 
INFLATION
Graham also said Peru faced risk from any ""prolongation"" of the war in Ukraine, with domestic prices having risen at their fastest pace in a quarter of a century in March.
""We are net importers of oil and corn, which form the chain of inputs that most affect the family basket,"" he said, adding that the government was evaluating doubling the budget for social programs to mitigate inflation for the most vulnerable.
Graham said projections of economic growth this year of between 3.5% and 4.0% were unchanged, but he did not rule out a revision given the global crisis.
To rebuild investor confidence that has been dented by economic issues and political turmoil, Graham said he would present to Congress a plan to cut the deficit to 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2026.
The deficit was cut to 2.6% last year from 8.9% in 2020.
""This is very important to provide certainty, especially to international rating agencies and investors,"" he said.
In mid-March, ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut its rating for Peru, citing political uncertainty. President Castillo survived an impeachment vote in late March, the second time lawmakers have tried to remove him.

A closely-watched part of the yield curve, the gap between 2 and 10-year bond yields remained inverted and was last at mints 6.75 basis points.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - It will probably come good one day, but hedge funds' latest attempt to position for a steeper U.S. yield curve has once again backfired badly.
Futures market data for the week through March 29 show that funds expanded their net short position in 10-year Treasuries to the largest since 2018, and only modestly increased the size of their net short position in the two-year space.
The explosion in bets on a higher 10-year yield was the biggest since 2016 and the second largest since the Commodity Futures Trading Commission contract was launched in 1986.
It was the fifth week in six that CFTC funds have positioned for the ""2s/10s"" curve to steepen, but the spread between the short- and long-dated yields continued to shrink. 
The 10-year yield fell 5 basis points over the period while the two-year yield jumped around 15 bps. The curve inverted on March 29 for the first time since 2019 and by the end of last week the spread was negative eight basis points, the deepest inversion since 2007.
The CFTC report showed that funds increased their net short 10-year Treasuries position by 212,723 contracts to 476,557 and increased their net short position in two-year futures to 59,202 contracts from 47,448.

WATCH THE DATA
A short position is essentially a bet that an asset's price will fall, and a long position is a bet it will rise. In bonds, yields rise when prices fall, and move lower when prices rise.
Inversion of this part of the yield curve has preceded all six U.S. recessions since the mid-1970s. Many observers, including some Federal Reserve officials, argue that the curve's predictive powers are not as strong now because interest rates and yields are historically so low. 
Many economists expect the curve to invert further, but don't think recession will follow.

With inflation nudging 8%, traders expect the Fed to raise the so-called ""terminal"" rate - the anticipated peak in interest rates before they start to come down again - past the ""neutral"" level that neither runs the economy too hot nor too cold.
The terminal rate implied by Eurodollar futures rose further above 3% and is expected to be reached around June-September 2023.
CFTC data shows that funds cut their net short three-month Eurodollar futures position by 233,321 contracts to 2.423 million, the largest reduction since last July. The net short position a week earlier had been the biggest since October 2018. 
""We need to get closer to neutral but we need to watch the whole way,"" New York Fed President John Williams said on Saturday. ""There is no question that is the direction we are moving. Exactly how quickly we do that depends on the circumstances.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore's central bank is likely to tighten its policy settings at its review this month, the third time in a row, as inflationary pressures intensify due to global supply-side disruptions and an easing of the city-state's border controls.
All 15 economists polled by Reuters forecast the Monetary Authority of Singapore to tighten its policy, but they are divided on how aggressive the central bank is likely to be and which of its various settings it will change.
Instead of interest rates, the MAS manages policy by letting the local dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed band, known as the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate.
It adjusts its policy via three levers: the slope, mid-point and width of the policy band.
Of the economists polled, three expect the MAS to only raise the slope of the band, while another five expect the MAS to raise the slope of the band along with an upward re-centering of its mid-point.
""Downside growth risks due to current geopolitical tensions are manageable, in our view,"" ANZ economist Khoon Goh said in a research note. ""Tightening resource pressures in the economy and upside inflation risks mean the MAS has to be more forceful in normalising monetary policy.""
Adjusting the mid-point is typically seen as a more ""aggressive"" tool than only adjusting the slope, while width is usually used to control how much the Singapore dollar can fluctuate.
Five forecast the MAS re-centering the mid-point higher, with no change to the width or the slop.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) expects the slope to be steepened alongside a widening of the band -- a move last made in 2010, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) is predicting a change to all three parameters.
""With the heightened uncertainty from geopolitics, the upside risk to inflation, and the downside risk to growth, we now think that MAS could undertake both a slope steepening and a band widening,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.
While Bank of America only expects the slope to be adjusted, it said re-centreing is a ""close call"" and will ""likely be calibrated"", while not ruling out a band widening as well.
The central bank is expected to release its next semi-annual monetary policy statement no later than April 14.
The MAS tightened monetary policy in January this year in an out-of-cycle move, which followed a tightening in October.
February headline prices rose at their fastest pace in nine years due to higher private transport costs, while core prices eased for the first time since June last year.
The MAS is expecting core inflation to come in within 2–3% this year, up from 0.9% last year, while headline inflation is projected to average between 2.5% and 3.5%.
The government had projected gross domestic product to expand 3-5% in 2022 in a forecast provided before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Singapore's finance minister Lawrence Wong said in March the city-state's economy should continue to expand this year but that authorities were ready to deploy more fiscal and monetary policy measures if a worsening Russia-Ukraine crisis impacted growth and inflation.
Last month, Singapore made its biggest reopening moves from the COVID-19 pandemic, easing local restrictions and allowing vaccinated travellers from anywhere in the world to enter without having to quarantine.

(Reuters) -Companies raced to bond markets last month, undeterred by the Ukraine war as they tried to lock in relatively cheap borrowing, though the March rush did not prevent first-quarter sales in the euro market from slumping to a four-year low.
Bond markets globally endured immense volatility in the January-March quarter, stoked by hawkish turns from the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, as well as Russia's Feb. 23 invasion of Ukraine. That, coupled with lower funding needs, pushed bond issuance lower across all debt categories, with Refinitiv data showing it as the slowest first quarter in three years.
In the euro area, where debt markets froze for longer following the invasion, fundraising by investment-grade companies amounted to 93.6 billion euros, the worst first quarter since 2018, according to Refinitiv. 
But March turned out to be the busiest month since September 2020 for euro investment-grade sales with some 43.5 billion euros raised. 
The U.S. market enjoyed its highest monthly volume on record at any time except during the pandemic liquidity crunch in early 2020, with $130.6 billion of sales in March. First-quarter sales however dropped to a three-year low. 
""None of the syndicates expected it to go quite as well, said Helene Jolly, head of EMEA investment-grade corporate syndicate at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), citing volatility, some bond outflows and inflationary pressures.
The March issuance pickup came as credit markets stabilised and risk premia, the additional yield companies pay on top of government bonds, have slipped below levels seen at the start of the invasion. 
Still, borrowing costs in the euro area have tripled for investment-grade companies this year, with the average yield on BofA's index at 1.50%. 
For issuers, ""it's that dynamic of saying: yes (borrowing costs) are higher... but on a historical basis it still looks good and anyone who has come this year has looked smart pretty much immediately in terms of what rates have done,"" Jolly said.
Some companies have been bringing forward their near-term funding plans, she added. 
But for companies with sub-investment grade credit ratings, the backdrop remains challenging. The euro area saw virtually no ""junk"" debt sales last month, while just $10.6 billion was raised by U.S. junk names.
Issuance slumped 70% compared to first-quarter 2021 in both markets, to the slowest since 2016 in the U.S. and 2019 in the euro area.
A positive sign for the European market waiting to reopen came in recent weeks as two companies carrying split ratings -investment-grade and high yield - managed to place bonds. 
However, a third such company, shopping center owner IGD, postponed a deal after it received less demand than the amount it originally sought to raise, according to a lead manager. 
Daniel Rudnicki Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), head of EMEA leveraged finance at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), said based on client discussions, he expects the European high yield market to restart around Easter. 

""If the current market conditions don't worsen, we're going to go through a period of slow issuance that will show gradual progress."" 
Rudnicki Schlumberger said he expects most of the issuance to come from mergers and acquisitions financing, as the rise in borrowing costs and hefty issuance during the pandemic makes refinancing deals less likely.

360,"<span>Apr 03, 2022 09:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Japan should pay close attention to currency levels because its efforts to hold down interest rates are weakening the yen, according to a senior member of the Japanese ruling coalition party Komeito.
“From the point of view of the economy, I understand why they are holding down interest rates,” said Keiichi Ishii, secretary general of Komeito, the junior partner to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
“But the side effects of that are reflected in exchange rates,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg News in Tokyo on Friday. “How far can the side effects be tolerated? If the yen goes too low, things will be tough, so I want the BOJ to pay close attention to exchange rates.”
Kuroda Puts Yields Before Yen With BOJ’s Credibility at Stake
The central bank has been forced repeatedly to scoop up more Japanese government debt as the global sell-off in bonds put pressure on Japan’s yields. The differential between U.S. and Japanese yields helped push the yen as low as 125 against the dollar last week for the first time since August 2015.
Weakness in the yen is amplifying the impact of soaring energy prices that are squeezing households and businesses, a factor that could fuel discontent among voters ahead of a summer election. 
While Komeito’s No. 2 didn’t specify what the central bank should do if the yen weakens further, some BOJ watchers see the possibility of the bank tweaking policy by raising the ceiling on 10-year yields through a widening of its bond yield target range.
“In the past, a cheaper yen was seen as a benefit for Japan’s exporters, but at this point it’s coming as prices for various things are starting to rise,” Ishii said. “It could worsen already rising prices, so the lower yen is starting to become negative.”
While Japan’s inflation rates remain low by comparison with other major economies, the sharply higher fuel prices are putting pressure on lower-income households, who form a key constituency for the Buddhist-backed Komeito party. 
Ishii spoke amid speculation over who will replace Haruhiko Kuroda at the head of the bank and whether a new governor would change policy. Kuroda’s decade in office is set to end in a year.
The next governor must be someone able to achieve a successful exit from its policies, Ishii said. He emphasized the selection is up to the government and the ruling parties can do nothing more than make their wishes known. 
“The current policies of Mr. Kuroda cannot be continued indefinitely into the future,” he said. “The next governor will need to seek an exit. So we need someone who can do that skillfully.”

While the LDP has an outright majority in the powerful lower house of parliament, it has an agreement to consult on policy with its partner Komeito. The group often mobilizes its members to support the LDP in constituencies where it doesn’t have a candidate, and an upper house election is due in three months.  
Ishii’s party has called on the government to draw up an extra budget in the current session of parliament to help bolster the economy, amid uncertainty over the effects of the war in Ukraine and a resurgence of Covid cases. 
Kishida instructed officials last week to draw up economic measures aimed at countering the effect of sharp rises in fuel and other prices that could undermine voter support ahead of the election. 
The government will initially focus on using reserves to introduce such measures quickly, he told parliament.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Haruhiko Kuroda built a career battling a strong yen and the Bank of Japan governor is unlikely to change course in his final year at the helm, eight sources said, despite political pressure to acknowledge that the weak currency is now a problem.
Sources familiar with the bank's thinking and people close to Kuroda, whose decade in charge ends next April, said he is likely to protect his legacy by avoiding tweaks to a monetary policy that continues to treat a strong yen as enemy No. 1.
The BOJ's dovish signals may give markets a chance to drive down the yen further, as prospects of steady policy tightening by the Federal Reserve widen the Japan-U.S. interest rate gap.
""The BOJ looks at inflation, not yen moves, in guiding policy,"" one of the sources said.
Kuroda's career as a finance bureaucrat was marked by fighting rises in the yen that threatened Japan's export-reliant economy.
After landing the BOJ top job in 2013, he maintained that stance and engineered a dramatic yen fall by pumping in massive monetary stimulus, a policy that is considered among the key successes of former premier Shinzo Abe's pro-growth ""Abenomics"".
Now, Kuroda is increasingly alone in repeating the benefits of a weak currency, as government officials escalate their warnings against excessive yen declines that help push up import costs and consumer prices for energy and food.
The weak yen has emerged as a political hot-button as lawmakers demand measures to cushion the blow from rising inflation ahead of upper house elections due in July.
The mood among companies is starting to change, too. Kengo Sakurada, head of business lobby Keizai Doyukai, said on Tuesday that current yen levels were hurting retailers and can ""hardly be seen as appropriate"".
Even former finance ministry colleagues, most of whom like Kuroda struggled to combat a strong yen, are beginning to brand currency weakness as indicative of Japan's waning economic might.
Kuroda appears unfazed, and continues to argue that while a weak yen may hurt households and retailers, the benefits to the economy outweigh the cost.
The BOJ is still relentless in defending its 0% cap for long-term interest rates, set under its ultra-easy policy.
Undeterred by the yen's slide to a six-year low against the dollar on Monday, it offered unlimited, fixed-rate purchases of 10-year government bonds through Thursday and ramped up bond-buying for other maturities.
""In a sense, the BOJ is driving down the yen with unlimited bond buying,"" said former top currency diplomat Naoyuki Shinohara, who was Kuroda's colleague at the finance ministry. ""It probably doesn't see the yen's current levels as dangerous.""
UNWAVERING AND PRAGMATIC
So far, there is little sign of discontent within the BOJ over Kuroda's stance. Dovish board members, such as Goushi Kataoka, see the weak yen as a key channel through which the bank's easy policy boosts growth.
A summary of opinions of a March meeting made no mention of the pros and cons of a weak yen.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's administration meanwhile continues to defend the BOJ's ultra-easy policy as a necessary support to a still-fragile economic recovery.
""It's hard to tighten monetary policy to deal with cost-push inflation, which means monetary policy must remain loose,"" said deputy chief cabinet secretary Seiji Kihara, who is considered among the premier's closest aides.
Pressure to tweak the yield cap could become overwhelming if the yen, now hovering near 122 to the dollar, plunges to around 130, some analysts say.
But Eisuke Sakakibara, who is known as ""Mr. Yen"" for master-minding currency interventions in the 1990s, argues that hiking BOJ interest rates will do little to stop yen declines.
For now, Kuroda is expected to ensure the BOJ stays the course on ultra-easy policy. While political pressure may mount for him to budge, current law does not give the government power to fire the central bank governor. Kuroda is unlikely to be reappointed, having already served an unusually long term.
Kuroda's predecessor, Masaaki Shirakawa, voluntarily left the job several weeks before his term ended, after facing a barrage of criticism for doing too little, too late to beat deflation.

Stepping down early, or hiking interest rates in the face of political pressure, is not in Kuroda's nature, say people who have regular interactions with the governor.
""He may be under heat but that's probably not a concern to him,"" one of the people said. ""He's extremely pragmatic and unwavering, so I can't see why he would choose to step down or tweak policy now.""

362,"<span>Apr 03, 2022 08:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Cash sweeteners and cheaper petrol have failed to substantially boost the Australian government’s opinion polls ahead of an election that Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to call within days.
Two new surveys published by Newspoll and Ipsos late Sunday show the government is still trailing the opposition Labor Party, despite a high-profile pre-election budget delivered by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on March 29, which included payments for low-income earners and a cut to the petrol tax.
According to Newspoll, Morrison’s center-right Liberal National coalition has improved by just 1 percentage point in the past three weeks, to trail the Labor Party 54% to 46%. The Ipsos survey found the government was in an even worse position, with the opposition leading 55% to 45%.
The poor polling comes despite positive economic news in the 2022 Australia budget, including unemployment forecast to drop to 3.75%, a rapid drop in government debt thanks to high commodity prices and a prediction that wages will rise above inflation as early as next year.
Morrison must call an election on or before May 21 under Australian law, and he is widely expected to dissolve parliament and begin the campaign within days. While the government is currently trailing in the polls, Morrison was widely written off before the 2019 election only to win a surprise victory.
The government is hoping for another “miracle” win, but Morrison is facing internal division inside his own party even before the race has begun. In a speech to Parliament last week, a government senator called him an “autocrat” and a “bully,” adding he was “unfit” to be prime minister. 
Over the weekend, two media organizations published accusations that during Morrison’s selection for parliament in 2007, he used racist language to denigrate his opponent. Morrison has strongly denied the allegations made against him.
Morrison’s personal approval rating is still behind Opposition Labor leader Anthony Albanese’s in both Newspoll and Ipsos. The prime minister’s net satisfaction is -12% in Newspoll, a slight improvement in the past three weeks, while Ipsos puts him on -15%.
In comparison, Albanese has a net approval rating of -1% in Newspoll and -2% in Ipsos.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Prime Minister Viktor Orban faces unprecedented headwinds as he embarks on a fourth consecutive term in office when the Hungarian nationalist will have to navigate his self-styled 'illiberal state' through an economic slowdown and growing isolation over Ukraine.
Orban's fourth landslide victory on Sunday against a united opposition, which joined forces against him for the first time, has solidified the 58-year-old leader's support at a time when he is losing allies abroad.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Hungary's eastern neighbour on Feb. 24 upended Orban's decade-long efforts to deepen business and political ties with Moscow and set his campaign on a new course.
Since then, Orban's ambivalent stance on European Union sanctions and failure to condemn Putin have distanced him from Polish and Czech allies but his messages of peace appear to have resonated with many Hungarians at a time of conflict.
Sunday's victory against a united opposition, which won 57 of seats in parliament against 135 for Fidesz based on preliminary results, granted Orban yet another sweeping majority that had enabled him to rewrite the constitution and major laws.
""We have scored a victory so big, that it can be seen even from the Moon, but definitely from Brussels,"" Orban, who has built a career on portraying himself as a combative leader battling EU bureaucrats, told jubilant supporters after Sunday's election victory.
Orban has said his stance on the war in Ukraine was aimed at preserving Hungary's military and economic security, but this is increasingly called into question by long-time allies in Warsaw, who have been instrumental in backstopping Orban's battles with Brussels.
Orban's challenge is complicated by the central European country relying on Moscow for most of its oil, gas and nuclear energy, even after some improvement in cross-border energy links with neighbouring countries over the past decade.
""The decision to stake the country's energy future (both fossil and nuclear) on close ties to Russia is backfiring,"" economists at UniCredit said in a note. ""Hungary might find itself even more isolated inside the EU.""
Poland's ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said last week he was not pleased with Orban's cautious stance on Russia, while a meeting of defence ministers of the Visegrad Four alliance in Budapest was cancelled this week after the Czech and Polish ministers pulled out.
ECONOMIC HEADWINDS
Orban's new term also poses tough challenges domestically, with the central bank projecting economic growth at the slowest rate in any election year since Orban came to power in 2010.
With inflation on track to run at its highest in at least 15 years, the economy slowing amid the war and EU funds in limbo due to a row over democratic standards, Orban will have no honeymoon period after his election victory.
Since taking power in 2010, Orban has stabilised the economy with a host of unorthodox measures and unemployment has fallen to record lows due to billions of euros worth of foreign investment attracted by Hungary's low corporate tax rate.
But high government borrowing to drag the economy out of the pandemic has eroded much of the improvement in central Europe's largest debt pile and underlying indicators show the increase in living standards has trailed those in Poland or Romania.
The EU has suspended payments to Poland and Hungary from its pandemic recovery funds over democratic shortcomings, which economists say could begin exerting pressure on Budapest and Warsaw from the second half of the year, barring a compromise.
A 1.8 trillion forint ($5.45 billion) pre-election spending spree, a surge in energy costs and the looming expiry of price caps to keep inflation under control will also complicate Orban's efforts to keep the economy stable after the vote.
""The pandemic was a walk in the park compared to what's coming,"" said political analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis think tank.

""All economic growth and stability indicators are drifting in the wrong direction,"" he said.

The measure suspends taxes on 84 and 90 octane gasoline, gasohol and certain types of diesel until June 30, with a potential extension until December, the government said in a statement.
Spiking fuel prices have caused widespread protests by Peruvian truckers and farmers. The government has been taking measures to mitigate rising fuel prices, including subsidies that it says have already prevented a rise of 3 soles (81 U.S. cents) per gallon in the price of diesel and a hike of 5 soles ($1.36) in the price of 10-kg gas cylinders.
Oscar Graham (NYSE:GHM), the country's economy minister, told Reuters on Friday that the biggest threat to Peru's economy is the prolongation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Peru's inflation hit its highest level in 26 years, the government reported on Friday, largely driven by rising fuel and food prices.
The government also announced it was raising the minimum wage by about 10% to 1,205 soles ($278) a month starting in May. The government said the raise was to help improve workers' purchasing power after analyzing inflation and local economic performance.

Investing.com -- The highlight of the coming week will be Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s March meeting, which will be scrutinized amid widespread expectations for a half percentage point interest rate hike next month. Along with concerns over the economic impact of tighter monetary policy, developments around the war in Ukraine will remain front and center. While stocks have shrugged off concerns over the outlook for growth, the bond market is flashing warning signs. The European Central Bank will also publish minutes, while the Reserve Bank of Australia is to meet. Meanwhile, oil prices will remain in the spotlight after their steepest weekly decline in two years. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Wednesday’s minutes of the Fed’s March meeting will give investors an update on how officials view the monetary policy outlook and may also contain more details on plans to shrink the central bank’s $9 trillion balance sheet.
The Fed hiked rates last month by a quarter of a percentage point, the first step in a monetary tightening cycle aimed at curbing inflation, currently at a four-decade high. Since the March meeting several Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, have indicated that they are prepared to hike rates more aggressively to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched.
Friday’s solid employment report paved the way for a half percentage point rate hike from the Fed at its next meeting on May 4.
Several Fed officials are also due to make appearances during the week, including Fed Governor Lael Brainard, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, New York Fed President John Williams and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.
A closely watched part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted again on Friday after the strong U.S. jobs report solidified expectations for bigger rate hikes by the Fed.
An inversion of the yield curve, when shorter-dated yields rise above longer-dated ones, is a phenomenon that has predicted past recessions.
Stock markets have seemingly shrugged off concerns that tighter monetary policy and uncertainty arising out of the war in Ukraine could tip the economy into recession, but bond investors seem to have taken a more pessimistic view.
However, some analysts think the reliability of yield curve inversions as an indicator of recession has decreased, particularly as the Fed’s massive bond purchasing programs are keeping long-dated yields suppressed.
Both Brent and U.S. crude oil ended last week down around 13%, their largest weekly declines in two years after U.S. President Joe Biden announced a release of 1 million barrels per day of oil for six months from May, in what is to be the largest ever release from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has seen oil prices rise around 30% in the first quarter, with soaring energy costs becoming a key driver of inflation expectations.
But energy market analysts appeared skeptical of the plan’s success.
“The knee-jerk selloff from the SPR announcement of the release of 1-million barrels a day from the SPR over the next six months won’t have a lasting impact on oil prices, so if geopolitical risks continue to intensify, oil will recover most of this week’s losses,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.
Apart from Wednesday’s Fed minutes, the economic calendar is light for the coming week with the main focus likely to be Tuesday’s ISM services PMI.
Economists are expecting the index to rebound to 58.0 from what was a twelve-month low of 56.5 in March. The effects of the Omicron wave saw the index fall from an all-time high of 69.1 reached in December and concerns over soaring inflation may now limit consumer demand.
The U.S. is also to release factory orders, initial jobless claims, and trade balance.
The ECB is to publish the minutes of its March meeting, with slightly more than a week to go until its upcoming meeting on April 14. The ECB surprised markets last month when it announced that it was speeding up plans to withdraw stimulus measures.
Since then, data showed that Eurozone inflation hit a fresh record high of 7.5% in March, adding to pressure on the ECB to act to curtail inflation even as economic growth is slowing amid the lingering effects of the pandemic and fallout from the war in Ukraine.
Elsewhere, the Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to keep its rate on hold at its latest policy setting meeting on Tuesday.
The Bank of Canada is to publish its business outlook survey on Monday and an upbeat reading could cement expectations for a half percentage point rate hike at its next meeting on April 13.

PRINCETON, N.J. (Reuters) -The Federal Reserve needs to move monetary policy towards a more neutral stance, but the pace at which it tightens credit will depend on how the economy reacts, New York Fed President John Williams said Saturday.
Williams, in response to questions at a symposium about whether the Fed needed to hasten its return to a neutral policy rate that neither encourages or discourages spending, noted that in 2019 with rates set near the neutral level ""the economic expansion started to slow,"" and the Fed resorted to rate cuts.
""We need to get closer to neutral but we need to watch the whole way,"" Williams said. ""There is no question that is the direction we are moving. Exactly how quickly we do that depends on the circumstances.”
Williams' remarks suggest a more cautious approach to coming rate increases than has been pushed by colleagues who feel the Fed should race towards a more neutral stance by using larger than usual half-point rate hikes at upcoming meetings. 
The median policymaker estimate of the neutral rate is 2.4%, a level that traders currently feel the central bank will hit by the end of this year. Such a pace would require half point increases at 2 of the Fed's remaining six meetings this year, with expectations of a first coming at the Fed's May 3-4 session.
The Fed raised interest rates last month by a quarter of a percentage point, the beginning of what policymakers expect to be ""ongoing increases"" aimed to tame inflation currently running at triple the Fed's 2% target.
At the last Fed meeting the median policymaker projected quarter-point increases only at each meeting, but several since then have said they were prepared to move more aggressively if needed.
The outcome depends on whether inflation eases, Williams said.
""We expect inflation to come down but if it does not….we will have to respond. My hope right now is that won't happen,” Williams said.
The Fed will also be using a second tool to tighten credit when it starts to reduce the size of its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. Williams said that could begin as soon as May.
In prepared remarks to a Princeton University symposium Williams said high inflation was currently the Fed's ""greatest challenge,"" and is potentially being driven higher by the war in Ukraine, the ongoing pandemic, and continued labor and supply shortages in the United States.
""Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains extraordinarily high, and risks to the inflation outlook are particularly acute,"" Williams said. 

However, he said he expected the combination of rate increases and balance sheet reduction to help ease inflation to around 4% this year, and ""close to our 2 percent longer-run goal in 2024"" while keeping the economy on track.
""These actions should enable us to manage the proverbial soft landing in a way that maintains a sustained strong economy and labor market,"" Williams said. ""Both are well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will need to keep a careful eye on how the economy reacts as it raises interest rates, and scale the pace of its rate increases accordingly, New York Fed President John Williams said on Saturday.

CERNOBBIO, Italy (Reuters) - The European Central Bank plans to raise interest rates some time after winding down its bond purchase programme in the third quarter of this year, ECB board member Isabel Schnabel said on Saturday.
The head of the ECB's market operations said net asset purchases would be concluded in the third quarter, as long as data supported the expectation that medium-term inflation outlook will not ease.
""We will hike interest rates some time after, as appropriate, in light of incoming data,"" Schnabel said at an event in Cernobbio in northern Italy.
Annual consumer price growth hit 7.5% in March, the highest reading on record, as Russia's war in Ukraine is pushing up food and fuel prices, leaving consumers in the West poorer.
""The speed of normalisation ... will depend on the economic fallout from the war, the severity of the inflation shock and its persistence,"" Schnabel said.
Accelerating price growth is leaving the ECB, and other major economies' central banks with an acute policy dilemma. 
Inflation on its own would warrant monetary tightening, especially since record low unemployment foreshadows higher wages, the precondition for durable inflation. 
But policy tightening now could crash an economy that is already near stagnation as the war in Ukraine saps consumer spending power and depresses business investment. 
Still, Schnabel said inflation risk was skewed towards even higher readings given sharply rising producer prices, structural economic changes like de-globalisation and likely wage hikes.
The ECB's mandate is price stability so it should prioritise that in the face of high inflation while governments could support economic growth through targeted fiscal measures, avoiding overly expansionary policies that would complicate the bank's task, she said. 
""A central bank that is perceived as being committed to protecting its mandate can contain inflation at a lower economic cost,"" by bringing down inflation expectations, she said. 

The ECB will next meet on April 14. At its last meeting, it decided to end bond purchases in the third quarter but made no further policy commitment, arguing that policy must remain flexible.
Both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have begun monetary tightening.

The Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement was signed in a virtual ceremony by Trade Minister Dan Tehan and India's Minister of Commerce & Industry, Piyush Goyal.
Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi witnessed the virtual ceremony.
Morrison is expected to call a general election within days, and has been eager to secure the trade deal before campaigning begins, having been in negotiations with India for a decade. 
Speaking to reporters in Tasmania, Morrison said the agreement with the world's second most populous nation represented “one of the biggest economic doors there is to open in the world today”.
“These are never all or nothing deals as far as we're concerned, we see all of these as the next step and the next step and the next step,” he said, expressing both countries intention to build closer trade links.
Morrison’s government is seeking to diversify export markets and reduce Australia's dependence on its biggest trading partner China, after diplomatic spats led to Beijing sanctioning certain Australian products.
The deal with India removes tariffs on more than 85% of Australian goods exports to India, worth A$12.6 billion, rising to almost 91% over 10 years.
Tariffs will be scrapped on sheep meat, wool, copper, coal, alumina, fresh Australian rock lobster, and some critical minerals and non-ferrous metals to India.
It will see 96% of Indian goods imports enter Australia duty-free.
Both countries would continue to work towards a full free trade agreement, the federal government said on Friday.
After signing the deal, Minister of Commerce & Industry Goyal said India wanted to progress a full free trade agreement with Australia in an “accelerated manner”.
“Soon after this current agreement comes into force, we’ll get down to cracking the whip on the next stage to make this a comprehensive economic partnership,” he said.
Trade Minster Tehan said he was confident negotiations would advance even if the Morrison government was replaced at the upcoming national election. 

Scott Morrison lags in the polls leading up to the general election due in May.
“I have very strong hope, no matter who fills our chairs going forward, we’ll be able to … build on this ground-breaking agreement,” he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. prosecutors have found evidence that Russian oligarchs are trying to evade sanctions put in place to pressure Moscow to stop its invasion of Ukraine, the head of a new Justice Department task force said on Friday.
Andrew Adams, a veteran prosecutor tapped to lead the ""KleptoCapture"" task force established last month, told Reuters in an interview that in some cases, even oligarchs who have not yet had sanctions imposed on them are trying to move assets ahead of potential future sanctions. 
But even as they try to hide yachts, planes or other mobile property in countries they believe to be secretive, Adams warned that oligarchs trying to evade sanctions are facing an ""all-time high"" level of international cooperation to track the ill-gotten gains of Russian elites. 
""There are efforts afoot - some of them publicly reported - to move, for example, moveable property in the forms of yachts, airplanes ... into jurisdictions where, I think, people have the perception that it would be more difficult to investigate and more difficult to freeze,"" Adams said. 
The task force's goal is to put the finances of Russian oligarchs under strain in a bid to pressure President Vladimir Putin to cease his weeks-long assault on Ukraine.
The unit's name is a play on the word ""kleptocracy,"" which refers to corrupted officials who misuse power to accumulate wealth. The task force includes prosecutors, investigators and analysts from multiple federal agencies.
The United States and its allies have imposed several rounds of sanctions targeting Putin, many of his wealthy friends and dozens of Russian businesses and government agencies.
'SHARED SENSE OF PURPOSE'
Tracing oligarchs' assets is often difficult because they are hidden behind ""layers of shell companies scattered around the globe,"" Adams said.
U.S. prosecutors are receiving information from places previously thought to be safe havens, Adams said. 
""Especially in the current context, and the current climate ... the level of shared sense of purpose I think is at an all-time-high,"" Adams said.
He declined to provide details of specific jurisdictions that have provided the task force with information, or to name specific people under investigation. 
He said targeting assets located overseas was a major component of the unit's work, adding that the United States has not been an attractive country for supporters of Putin's government since around 2014 due to a series of sanctions over Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
European countries have already found and detained the yachts of wealthy Russian businessmen.
Spain's government temporarily seized the $140 million Superyacht Valerie, which has been linked to Sergei Chemezov, a former KGB officer who heads state conglomerate Rostec.
France last month detained a vessel belonging to Rosneft boss Igor Sechin, while Italy sequestered a yacht owned by Russian billionaire Andrew Igorevich Melnichenko.
The Justice Department said last month that information provided by U.S. law enforcement to foreign partners had contributed to multiple vessel seizures.
""The United States has not been a friendly place to be parking your money as an oligarch,"" Adams said. ""The most ostentatious, the most obvious sorts of assets are not in the United States.""
Adams cited a 2019 case in which U.S. authorities seized the Wise Honest, a North Korean cargo ship accused of making illicit coal shipments in violation of U.S. sanctions even though the vessel was initially located outside American waters, as a ""playbook"" for some of the task force's future cases.
LONG LEGAL FIGHTS AHEAD
Adams said that criminal charges and asset seizure warrants could come in the ""early days"" of the unit, which was also prepared for lengthy legal battles by oligarchs seeking to prevent the United States from permanently confiscating their assets through civil forfeiture. 
Those cases can allow the department to take ill-gotten property in cases where people are outside the country and cannot be extradited. Criminal forfeitures, meanwhile, can accompany an indictment against the property owner.
""We should anticipate that extremely well-heeled litigants will take things to court. We will be engaged in litigation that will take awhile,"" Adams said.

The task force may also target banks, cryptocurrency exchanges or other financial institutions who help sanctions violators by turning a blind eye towards suspicious transactions. 
Adams said many institutions had voluntarily provided information. ""The cooperation from the private sector has been already frequent.""

The ministry said in a published budget document that it expects the economy to expand by 3.5% in 2023.
""The persistent impacts of the pandemic on supply and demand imbalances, and the escalation of the geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have forced countries to adjust their growth expectations for this year,"" the document says.
The new figure compares to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's projection of 5% growth for the economy in 2022 and a prior government forecast for a 4.1% expansion. [nL1N2UD138]
The budget document projected inflation at 5.5% by the end of 2022, slowing to 3.3% by the end of 2023.
The exchange rate is seen at 20.7 pesos per U.S dollar for the end of 2022, and 20.9 pesos at the end of 2023, the ministry said, compared with 19.8 pesos on Friday.
Mexico expects this year's average oil price will be $92.90 per barrel, while crude production is estimated at 1.82 million barrels per day (bpd), rising to 1.85 million bpd in 2023.

The ministry expects an average of 879,000 bpd of crude exports in 2022.
The country will remain focused on promoting economic development and job creation through public spending, the document said, adding spending would not ""jeopardize the continuation and completion of key infrastructure works or priority social programs.""

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru, the world's no. 2 copper producer, will target ""excess profits"" that mining firms have gained from soaring global metals prices for extra taxation, the country's economy minister told Reuters.
While President Pedro Castillo came to power last July pledging to increase taxes on the powerful mining sector, the current plan is far less ambitious than initial promises of sharp tax hikes that met fierce resistance from the industry and a divided Congress.
""The focus is on the surplus profits,"" Oscar Graham (NYSE:GHM), the country's minister of economy and finance, said in an interview in Lima late on Friday, adding that the government was looking at an ""adjustment"" to taxes.
Copper prices are currently trading at near record levels around $10,000 per tonne in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""The margins (of the adjustment) are being evaluated,"" he said, but added it was important that the sector did not lose competitiveness and that mining investment was not discouraged.
Graham said Peru needed better distribution of mining wealth to communities to quell mining protests that have rocked the sector and stalled production at key mines such as MMG Ltd's Las Bambas and Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO)'s Cuajone mine.
""We have to look at the issue of the efficient use of resources provided by mining, otherwise we will have recurrent conflicts in the country,"" he said. 
INFLATION
Graham also said Peru faced risk from any ""prolongation"" of the war in Ukraine, with domestic prices having risen at their fastest pace in a quarter of a century in March.
""We are net importers of oil and corn, which form the chain of inputs that most affect the family basket,"" he said, adding that the government was evaluating doubling the budget for social programs to mitigate inflation for the most vulnerable.
Graham said projections of economic growth this year of between 3.5% and 4.0% were unchanged, but he did not rule out a revision given the global crisis.
To rebuild investor confidence that has been dented by economic issues and political turmoil, Graham said he would present to Congress a plan to cut the deficit to 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2026.
The deficit was cut to 2.6% last year from 8.9% in 2020.
""This is very important to provide certainty, especially to international rating agencies and investors,"" he said.
In mid-March, ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut its rating for Peru, citing political uncertainty. President Castillo survived an impeachment vote in late March, the second time lawmakers have tried to remove him.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico will use the extra revenue it collects from higher oil prices to subsidize domestic gasoline and diesel prices, Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio told Reuters on Friday.
While production has slid significantly in recent years, Mexico remains a major oil producer and exporter.
Without the fuel subsidy, annual inflation, which hit 7.29% in the first half of March, would rise above 9% within four months, Yorio said in an interview at his office in downtown Mexico City.
""I think that practically all the surplus that will be generated by higher prices will also be reflected in the cost of gasoline,"" he said. ""So we're literally going to have to use the surplus to finance the additional subsidies.""
Mexican motorists have largely been shielded from big spikes in fuel prices in recent weeks due to the subsidy policy championed by the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has long promised to insulate consumers from sharp price hikes at the pump.
The Bank of Mexico has hiked the key interest rate seven monetary policy meetings in a row to try to rein in inflation. The central bank's target is 3% inflation with a 1-percentage-point tolerance range above and below that.
""What we have calculated is that over a period of four months this measure avoids two percentage points of inflation. In other words, if over these four months annual inflation is around 7% more or less, this prevents it from rising to 9%,"" said Yorio.
Mexico's government is just the latest globally to try to cushion the impact of soaring fuel prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and one of the few that has the luxury of additional oil income to help finance those subsidies.
Governments from Brazil to France are considering pumping up subsidies or trimming taxes to shield consumers from the financial strain of higher fuel prices, reflecting the economic and political risks governments see in the current energy spike.
Yorio said investors' view of Latin America, and Mexico specifically, has improved amid the fallout from the war, as the region is seen as far removed from the conflict.
At a recent road show to New York and Europe, investors expressed interest in buying more Mexican debt, but Yorio said Mexico's government had no plans to issue additional dollar- or euro-denominated bonds this year.

He added that Mexico will likely, however, issue debt in Japan for refinancing purposes.
""At some point this year we're probably going to go to the Samurai market because we haven't done so in two years and we have upcoming amortizations in yen.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Punishing sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies on Moscow for invading Ukraine are pushing Russia into recession and starting to turn it back into a closed economy, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on Friday.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters that the Treasury sees Russia as struggling with steep inflation, diminished exports and shortages despite a recovery of its rouble against the dollar. The official dismissed the rebound as driven by stringent capital controls and foreign exchange curbs, not market forces.
Inflation that has run as high as 6% over the past three weeks is a better indication of the sanctions' performance inside Russia, revealing the rouble's diminished purchasing power, the official said, adding that black market rouble exchange rates were well below the international rate.
After Western democracies imposed initial sanctions immobilizing around half of the Russian central bank's $630 billion in foreign exchange assets and cutting several key Russian banks off from the SWIFT international transaction network, the rouble lost half its value against the dollar.
It has since recouped its pre-invasion value, touching a five-week high in early Moscow trade on Friday before settling in the 83-84 range to the dollar.
But the Treasury official said that will not stop a steep contraction in Russia's economic output that outside analysts now forecast at about 10% this year -- far worse than the 2.7% contraction it suffered during 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The economic consequences Russia is facing are severe: high inflation that will only get higher, and deep recession that will only get deeper,"" the official said.
CLOSING RUSSIA'S ECONOMY
The Treasury official said the cumulative effect of sanctions on banks, wealthy oligarchs tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin, key industrial sectors and U.S. export controls that deny Russia access to critical technologies, was to push Russia towards its Cold War existence as a closed economy.
But Russia, a producer of mainly commodities and raw materials, was ill-equipped to produce its own consumer and technology goods, the official said.
""As a closed economy, Russia will only be able to consume what they produce, which will be a stark adjustment,"" the official added.
The process will not happen immediately. China, India and other countries are still trading with Russia, and could replace some goods and parts that Russia would normally buy from Western firms.
However, its access to semiconductors, software and other technologies is limited due to the U.S. export restrictions that also will prevent China from selling Moscow any such chips since all its semiconductors are made with U.S. technology or software.
The United States intended for the sanctions and export curbs to be debilitating to the Russian economy and cripple the Russian military's ability to procure parts and equipment for the war effort, the official said
Washington was comfortable with enforcement of the sanctions and export controls thus far, but remained on the lookout for any violations.
The Treasury comments come as senior Biden administration officials traveled the globe to press world leaders to keep up sanctions pressure on Russia.

Washington planned to maintain humanitarian exemptions from the sanctions, given growing food insecurity problems and Russia's role as a major wheat producer, the Treasury official said.
Other exemptions were intended to protect Western financial institutions that hold Russian assets, through a license to allow Russian debt payments to be made.

378,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 06:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has decided against an additional cut in the IPI industrial tax because of questions about the legality of the measure, according to two sources from the Economy Ministry.
Economy Minister Paulo Guedes pledged last month that a tax cut on industrialized products would be extended to 33% from 25%, amid record tax revenues that have been boosted by higher oil prices.
Adopted in February, the initial 25% cut represents a fiscal loss of around 20 billion reais ($3.9 billion), with the federal government giving up 10 billion reais and the rest coming from state and municipal revenue.
The tax cut was aimed at helping industry recover from the pandemic downturn and fighting inflation by stimulating price reductions.
Officials had indicated that the additional reduction would come out this week, but Bolsonaro signed a decree published on Friday that only renews the rate cut of 25% for 30 days.
Five Economy Ministry officials said, on condition of anonymity since the discussions are private, that the president decided late on Thursday to hold the additional tax reduction.
Two of the sources said the reason was related to legal issues. An injunction filed by the Pros political party at the Supreme Court questions the constitutionality of the measure, arguing that it threatens the Manaus Free Trade Zone, in the state of Amazonas.

Companies operating in the Manaus Free Trade Zone are exempt from paying IPI, and can generate credits equivalent to the industrial tax and make deductions from other tax obligations. The lower the IPI rate, the smaller their potential credits, which reduces their fiscal advantage.
Politicians from Amazonas state said they would question the tax cut in court, saying it was an attempt to grant benefits in an election year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Fear that the war in Ukraine would tilt the U.S. economy towards a 1970s-style bout of stagflation has given way to signs that Americans plan to keep traveling, returning to restaurants, and continuing a steady if still incomplete return to ""normal.""
The latest nonfarm payrolls report released Friday showed employers added 431,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate fell to 3.6%, continuing a strong run of hiring that has left key aspects of the U.S. labor market ""little different"" from where they were before the pandemic, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. 
An additional nearly 600,000 people were employed or looking for work in March compared to the month before, adding to a recent steady rise in labor supply that Fed officials see as key to helping ease inflation, keeping hiring on track, and avoiding a joint run-up in both wages and prices. 
""The labor supply concerns of last year continue to fade,"" wrote Nick Bunker, economic research director at job site Indeed. ""The job market is on a solid trajectory as robust demand pulls more workers into employment with strong and increasingly stable wage growth.""
There remain major gaps in the post-pandemic economy. Downtown office buildings are still underused in what may be one of the more persistent changes as workers and employers realized many jobs could be done from home. Businesses still struggle to find supplies and hire workers at a time of record job openings.
But following a winter in which war, a new coronavirus surge, and already high inflation painted a potentially grim picture of even faster rising prices and slowing growth, recent government and high-frequency data show an expansion seemingly poised to roll on.
The number of people teleworking continues to fall, as does the number of people saying they were kept out of the labor force by the pandemic, which fell below a million in March, according to the BLS. 
Gasoline consumption did edge down in March as prices nationally topped $4 a gallon, but Energy Information Administration data still shows gasoline use remains around 95% of pre-pandemic levels, roughly where it has been since the start of 2022.
Air travel is nearing 90% of pre-pandemic levels. Data from restaurant reservation site OpenTable shows in-person dining at 95% of pre-pandemic levels on 15 of the last 18 days through March 30.
Inflation, which is running at three times the Federal Reserve's 2% target, may mean consumers are getting less for their money. Spending data for February showed consumption actually declined on an inflation-adjusted basis, and energy sapped a larger share of household budgets.
The drop, however, came after a spending surge in January, and analysts and Fed policymakers this week agreed that neither global events nor the ongoing pandemic have put much of a dent in the U.S. economy.
""To this point, high gasoline prices have not led to demand destruction,"" analysts from RBC Capital Markets wrote this week. Between rising wages and savings still flush for many households from pandemic assistance payments, ""the average American has never been more financially able to absorb $4 gasoline than today.""The outbreak of war in Eastern Europe threatened to further fan inflation, currently running at a four-decade high. The prospect of a more aggressive Fed response to the surge in prices amplified talk of a ""hard landing"" - a recession sparked by rising interest rates, tighter credit, and a subsequent pullback in business and household spending.
One closely watched part of the bond market this week showed continued concern about that outcome when yields on 10-year Treasury notes briefly fell below those for 2-year Treasury notes - a sign of sagging faith in future economic growth.
Still, what economists and Fed officials regard as more telling signals from the bond market remained healthy.
""It's premature to start the recession countdown,"" wrote Jefferies analysts Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons. ""This does not look like a late-cycle economy ... It's a mid-cycle economy and the business cycle has room to run.""
RETURN TO NORMAL
Far from hitting the brakes on the economy, the Fed's target policy rate remains far below the level that would discourage spending or investment. The U.S. central bank increased its federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point on March 16, lifting it from the near-zero level set in March 2020 to offset the economic impact of the pandemic.
Interest rates are expected to rise steadily from here, with Fed officials projecting increases of at least a quarter of a percentage point at each of their six remaining policy meetings this year - with the potential for even larger increases that could, by the end of the year, remove any remaining Fed support for economic growth.
Fed policymakers this week said they will carefully watch how those anticipated rate hikes impact inflation and economic growth, and be poised either to raise borrowing costs faster if prices don't respond or pause them if it is appropriate. 
But they emphasized the economy seems resilient at this point, with companies perhaps struggling to find workers and supplies but also filling record demand, booking strong profits, and lifting wages.
By some measures the return to normal is here. Oxford Economics recently ""retired"" its weekly economic recovery tracker because the data it indexed, measuring employment, financial conditions, mobility and other issues, were ""essentially back to pre-pandemic levels,"" Oxford analyst Oren Klachkin wrote. 
There are signs also that larger changes, expected by economists as part of a ""normalizing"" economy, are beginning to take shape.
Spending on services jumped in February while declining for goods, a rotation Fed officials have been expecting and which may be helpful in the inflation fight. Consumers bought record amounts of goods during the pandemic, when service spending options were limited by social-distancing rules and measures that shuttered many businesses. High demand for cars, bikes, appliances and other goods clashed with a global supply system unable to keep pace, resulting in rising prices.
Foot traffic data from cellphone tracking firm Unacast showed visits to home goods and electronics stores as well as auto dealers are down significantly in 2022 compared with last year, while the hotel sector was rebounding quickly.
There are even some tentative signs inflation may be moving in the right direction.

Data for February showed year-over-year prices continuing to increase, but a key measure of month-to-month inflation fell one-tenth of a percentage point.
One month does not make a trend, but at a news conference following the end of the March 15-16 policy meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that sort of month-to-month decline is ""really what we're looking for.""

(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell worked through the weekend after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, meeting with staff on both Saturday and Sunday for the first time since May 2020 when the central bank was deep into its pandemic crisis response. 
Powell had two 45-minute meetings with staff on Feb. 26, including one that started at 8 p.m., and also attended an hourlong meeting at the Treasury, his monthly schedule published Friday shows. 
On Feb. 27 he met with staff from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and then again at 8 p.m.; on the Monday, the day Treasury put sanctions on Russia's central bank and threatened more action if the war continued, Powell held another 45-minute 8 p.m. staff meeting.
Though the Fed chair calendars never detail the contents of notated meetings, the flurry of work suggests the pressure on Powell to figure out the fallout for the U.S. economy from what Russia calls a ""special operation"" designed to destroy its southern neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. 

The invasion sent world energy prices soaring just as the Fed was getting ready to begin a round of interest rates hikes to fight 40-year-high inflation. 
A few days after that weekend of work, Powell told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the near-term effects of the invasion, the war, the sanctions, and of events to still to come ""remain highly uncertain,"" but he signaled the Fed's rate increases would go ahead as expected.

381,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 01:45PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- It’s too early to talk about the risk of a recession in the U.S., where growth is likely to remain positive for the near future even as it slows down, according to the International Monetary Fund’s new chief economist.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has delivered a “sizable shock” to the global economy that will challenge policy makers to tame inflation without quashing growth, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said Thursday in his first interview since taking the job in January. Still, “we’re not looking at a recessionary environment in the U.S., at least in the near future,” he said. “What we are seeing is along the lines of a slowdown in growth but still solidly in positive territory.”
The IMF is in the process of updating forecasts it last issued in January, and is set to publish the results in its World Economic Outlook scheduled for April 19 during its Spring Meetings. Gourinchas said the fund is still gauging how much it will need to slash growth projections as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has sent energy and food prices soaring.
In the U.S., concerns about the growth outlook have been mounting as the Federal Reserve accelerates its plans for interest-rate increases to combat inflation that was already at the highest levels in four decades even before the war. 
This week, yields on two-year Treasury bonds exceeded those on 10-year debt -- a so-called inversion of the yield curve that’s historically been a harbinger of contractions. Consumer sentiment has slumped to a decade low, even though Friday’s jobs report showed a still-robust labor market.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).’s global chief economist said Thursday the odds of a recession are “significant” over the next 18 months, with about a one-in-three chance of a global downturn and one-in-four for the U.S.
‘Different Things’
Gourinchas, a professor on leave from the University of California, Berkeley, joined the IMF in January, taking over as chief economist from Gita Gopinath, who was promoted to become the fund’s first deputy managing director. 
Originally from France, Gourinchas earned his doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, writing his thesis on exchange rates and consumption. Olivier Blanchard, who himself went on to serve as IMF chief economist, was Gourinchas’s thesis adviser. 
The war in Ukraine will be the major driver of downward revisions to the IMF’s 2022 outlook, and it will likely hit neighboring Europe harder than the U.S., Gourinchas said.
“European economies are more vulnerable,” he said. “They are more dependent on some Russian gas, and there might be more of a shock to the aggregate demand.”
The fund is also watching for the potential for disruption from new pandemic lockdowns in China, Gourinchas said.
Central bankers face a tough challenge as they seek to bring economies back onto a stable inflation path without crushing growth, and their response is likely to vary based on their proximity to and trade linkages with Russia and Ukraine, he said.
“You might face a different trade off if you’re, say, in Frankfurt at the ECB than if you’re in Washington at the Fed,” he said. “We’re not going to see necessarily a very aligned cycle, in terms of monetary policy, because countries are going to have to do different things.”

(Reuters) - It's not as if U.S. central bankers needed more reasons to step up the pace of interest rate hikes.
But that's what they got on Friday, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest jobs report showed employers added 431,000 to payrolls last month and the unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.6%. 
All are signs of a strong labor market with little need for the kind of super-easy monetary policy that the Fed is currently delivering and has begun to unwind. 
""A very tight labor market got even tighter,"" wrote Oxford Economics' Kathy Bostjancic and Lydia Boussour.
Futures contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate fell after the jobs report, as expectations intensified that the Fed will go bigger at the Fed's next three meetings, hiking by a half-a-percentage point each time to deal a more decisive blow to price pressures. 
Rate futures contracts reflect odds-on bets for the policy rate to end the year in the range of 2.5% to 2.75%, with about a one-in-three chance of going even higher. Either way that is high enough to put the brakes on growth.
It was just two weeks ago that the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-of-a-percentage point in its first policy tightening in three years, and signaled ongoing rate hikes ahead to rein in inflation at a 40-year high and climbing. 
With average hourly pay that's 5.6% higher than a year earlier, March's labor market report reflected strong demand for workers despite rising borrowing costs that may, to central bankers, also contain a warning signal for a building ""wage price spiral"" that could make inflation even worse. 
At their mid-March meeting, policymakers had projected an end-of-year policy rate of about 1.9%. Since then a number, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have signaled their readiness to move faster. 
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who personally prefers the more measured path, told reporters Friday that he doesn't see a big risk in using ""some"" half-point rate hikes to bring borrowing costs to neutral sooner, as long as the goal was not to raise rates much faster and push them much higher.
The worry there would be that the Fed ends up tightening too much, tipping the economy into recession. Historically it's been rare that the Fed has avoided such an outcome once the unemployment rate falls as low as it is now. 
With inflation looking set to accelerate even more after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices higher and a COVID-19 outbreak in China threatens to further damage already strained supply chains, tamping down inflation is ""essential"" to sustaining a strong labor market, Fed's Powell has said. 
The Fed targets 2% inflation by a measure known as the personal consumption expenditures price index. In February that measure jumped to 6.4%.
Policymakers don't want to risk that expectations for ever-higher prices get baked into American household and business psychology. Rate hikes are designed to curb demand and blunt that risk. 
Besides, policymakers have argued, the labor market has met the standard of full employment, and is strong enough to withstand the kind of fairly rapid withdrawal of support they are contemplating. 
Friday's report offered more grist for that argument. The unemployment rate was ""little different"" than the pre-pandemic rate of 3.5%, the report's authors said. 
And it helps ratify the Fed's hope that workers sidelined by the pandemic would find their way back to the labor force as COVID-19 cases fall. 
Participation in the labor force by workers in their ""prime"" years of 25 to 54 rose to 82.5%, the highest level in two years. Most industries are now above or close to their pre-pandemic level of employment 

U.S. employment overall is still 1.6 million below the pre-pandemic level, the report showed. 
But Fed policymakers increasingly see that deficit as likely to get filled only slowly and not prone to be hurried along by keeping rates low.

383,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 12:09PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc may have difficulty paying for Russian gas supplies this month because the Kremlin wants payments transfered through U.K.-sanctioned Gazprombank JSC, according to two people familiar with discussions in Russia.
Gazprom PJSC (OTC:OGZPY), the single largest provider of natural gas to the European continent, now only accepts ruble payments for supplies of the fuel to so-called ‘unfriendly’ states, including the European Union and the U.K. Shell has at least two long-term contracts that would be affected by this rule, jointly equivalent to about 1.5% of Gazprom’s annual exports to key foreign clients. 
To keep receiving Russian natural gas, all European buyers now need two accounts in Gazprombank, one in rubles and one in a foreign currency, with the Russian bank responsible for making the conversion. This is not possible for Shell because the Gazprom-owned lender was sanctioned by the U.K. in March in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine.
European nations, which rely on Russia for about 40% of their gas, are still getting to grips with the payment rules imposed by the Kremlin and assessing their impact on the continent’s energy security. Europe has announced plans to wean itself off Gazprom’s supplies in the medium term since the Kremlin ordered the attack on Ukraine.
Shell has pledged to make a “phased withdrawal” from buying Russian oil products, pipeline gas and LNG, but will continue to receive some supplies under long-term contracts until they expire. It has a 20-year agreement with Gazprom’s export arm to receive 1.2 billion cubic meters of gas a year until 2031 with delivery to Germany. In 2009, the London-based firm signed an agreement with Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) for annual pipeline-gas supplies of about 1.4 billion cubic meters until 2028. 
Any purchases of liquefied natural gas from Russia are exempt from the ruble-payment requirement.
Gazprom is aware of potential payment issues with Shell and is looking into ways to resolve them, the people said on condition of anonymity because the discussions are not public. The Russian energy firm does not expect the switch to rubles to become a significant problem in its dealings with most of European clients, one of the people said. 
“We are monitoring the situation carefully,” Shell’s press office said in an email, declining further comments on any potential issues with transferring money to Gazprom.
Gazprom started notifying clients about the new payment order on Friday. Customers will have a few weeks to adjust to the new rules as payments gas received in April are only due later this month or in May, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. 
A number of EU officials have indicated that the new payment rules will probably have little effect on Russian supplies to the continent as the customers can still transfer the money in dollars or euros, depending on their contracts. Still, the question of whether the Russian decree undermines sanctions must be agreed at the EU level, according to a German official.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Anger against Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's handling of a deepening economic crisis in the island nation of 22 million people spiralled into violence late on Thursday, as hundreds of protesters clashed with police for several hours.
A severe shortage of foreign currency has left Rajapaksa's government unable to pay for essential imports, including fuel, leading to debilitating power cuts lasting up to 13 hours.
Ordinary Sri Lankans are also dealing with shortages and soaring inflation, after the country steeply devalued its currency last month ahead of talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan programme. 
HOW DID SRI LANKA GET HERE?
Critics say the roots of the crisis, the worst in several decades, lie in economic mismanagement by successive governments that created and sustained a twin deficit - a budget shortfall alongside a current account deficit.
""Sri Lanka is a classic twin deficits economy,"" said a 2019 Asian Development Bank working paper. ""Twin deficits signal that a country's national expenditure exceeds its national income, and that its production of tradable goods and services is inadequate.""
But the current crisis was accelerated by deep tax cuts promised by Rajapaksa during a 2019 election campaign that were enacted months before the COVID-19 pandemic, which wiped out parts of Sri Lanka's economy.
With the country's lucrative tourism industry and foreign workers' remittances sapped by the pandemic, credit ratings agencies moved to downgrade Sri Lanka and effectively locked it out of international capital markets.
In turn, Sri Lanka's debt management programme, which depended on accessing those markets, derailed and foreign exchange reserves plummeted by almost 70% in two years.
The Rajapaksa government's decision to ban all chemical fertilisers in 2021, a move that was later reversed, also hit the country's farm sector and triggered a drop in the critical rice crop.
WHAT HAPPENS WITH SRI LANKA'S FOREIGN DEBT?
As of February, the country was left with only $2.31 billion in its reserves but faces debt repayments of around $4 billion in 2022, including a $1 billion international sovereign bond (ISB) maturing in July.
ISBs make up the largest share of Sri Lanka's foreign debt at $12.55 billion, with the Asian Development Bank, Japan and China among the other major lenders.
In a review of the country's economy released last month, the IMF said that public debt had risen to ""unsustainable levels"" and foreign exchange reserves were insufficient for near-term debt payments.
In a note late last month, Citi Research said that the IMF report's conclusion and the government's recent measures were insufficient to restore debt sustainability, strongly indicating ""the need for debt restructuring"".
WHO IS HELPING SRI LANKA?
For months, Rajapaksa's administration and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) resisted calls by experts and opposition leaders to seek help from the IMF despite rising risks.
But after oil prices soared in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February, the government eventually drew up a plan to approach the IMF in April.
The IMF will initiate discussions with Sri Lankan authorities on a possible loan program in ""coming days"", an IMF spokesman said on Thursday. 
Before heading to the IMF, Sri Lanka steeply devalued its currency, further stoking inflation and adding to the pain of the public, many of whom are enduring hardship and long queues.
In the interim, Rajapaksa has also sought help from China and India, particularly assistance on fuel from the latter. A diesel shipment under a $500 million credit line signed with India in February is expected to arrive on Saturday.

Sri Lanka and India have signed a $1 billion credit line for importing essentials, including food and medicine, and the Rajapaksa government has sought at least another $1 billion from New Delhi.
After providing the CBSL with a $1.5 billion swap and a $1.3 billion syndicated loan to the government, China is considering offering the island nation a $1.5 billion credit facility and a separate loan of up to $1 billion.

385,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 10:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Treasuries selloff deepened as the monthly jobs report showed wage gains accelerated amid a tight labor market, prompting traders to bolster bets that the Federal Reserve will increase the size of its next interest-rate hike. 
Yields rose across the curve, with the biggest gains seen in shorter-term securities that are highly sensitive to Fed moves. 
The five-year rate climbed 11 basis points to 2.57%, while the three-year benchmark hit a peak near 2.64%. The moves also drove 2-year yields above those on 10-year Treasuries, signaling that traders expect that economic growth will slow as the central bank tightens monetary policy to curb the fastest inflation in four decades. 
Swaps contracts are pricing in around 46 basis points of Fed tightening at its next meeting in May, up from about 44 on Thursday. That shows widespread expectation that policymakers will increase interest rates by half a percentage point at the gathering, which would be its steepest increase since 2000. Around 216 basis points of tightening are priced for the rest of 2022, including the May meeting. 
The Fed raised rates by a quarter percentage point in its first move last month.
“The jobs report could push the Fed towards a 50-basis-points increase at their May meeting,” said Tom di Galoma, managing director of government trading and strategy at Seaport Global, noting the fall in the unemployment rate and the accelerating increase in average hourly earnings.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 431,000 last month after an upwardly revised 750,000 gain in February, the Labor Department report showed. The unemployment rate fell to 3.6%, near its pre-pandemic low, and the labor-force participation rate ticked up. Friday’s report showed average hourly earnings rose 0.4% from February and 5.6% from a year ago, the most since May 2020.
Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, have said in recent weeks that they would support more aggressive monetary policy to curb decades-high inflation, including a possible 50-basis-point hike at the next policy meeting. Central bankers have repeatedly pointed to a strong labor market as one reason that the U.S. economy can handle a series of interest-rate hikes that’s expected to extend into next year.
Some of the inversion to the yield curve may reflect trading positions as much as speculation about slowing growth, with some investors reposition what had been a popular bet during the first quarter that the gap between long- and short-yields would narrow.
“This is a Fed that wants to get out in front of the curve, and that means a very accelerated pace of tightening,” Jeffrey Rosenberg, senior portfolio manager for systematic multi-strategy at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., said on Bloomberg Television.

""Easter isn't showing any direct impact from uncertainty caused by the conflict,"" Secretary of State for Tourism Fernando Valdes said, adding that he was confident the industry would bounce back from the drop caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant in late 2021 and early 2022. 
Any future hit from the war to Spanish tourism would depend on its duration and intensity, he told a news conference.
Bookings for the long Easter weekend have already reached 90% of 2019 levels, according to data from market-intelligence firm ForwardKeys he showed at the news conference. 

Reservations from Denmark and Sweden were nearly 40% higher than over the same period before the pandemic, while the number is 26% higher for Germans and 13% for Britons, the data showed. The number of tourists from the United States is around 26% lower than in 2019.
The Balearic and Canary Islands are among the fastest recovering destinations, with Ibiza and Tenerife registering more Easter bookings than before COVID, the ForwardKeys data showed.

The UAE and Israel have between $600 million and $700 million in bilateral trade, UAE's economy minister Abdulla Bin Touq Al Marri said in September.
The UAE and Israel formally established relations in 2020 as part of the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords that also included Bahrain and Morocco.
The latest agreement included 95% of traded products, which would be customs free, immediately or gradually, including food, agriculture and cosmetic products, as well as medical equipment and medicine, the Israeli Economy Ministry said in a statement. 
The agreement included regulation, customs, services, government procurement and electronic trade and would come into effect when signed by the countries' economy ministers and ratified, the statement said, though no timetable was given. 
A separate UAE statement said the agreement would substantially reduce or remove tariffs on a wide range of goods, enhance market access for services and promote investment flows.

It would also create mechanisms for small-and-medium enterprises' expansion.

(Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans on Friday repeated his view that the U.S. central bank will likely need to make seven quarter-of-a-percentage-point interest rate hikes this year to rein in inflation, but signaled that his view may well change.
""Given the great deal of uncertainty we face today, I am well aware that developments may transpire in a way that would cause me to alter my assessment,"" Evans said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Prairie State College Foundation. 
Most of the text was an exact repeat of a speech Evans gave on March 24 in Detroit, when he called for ""timely"" rate hikes and said policymakers ""need to be cautious, humble and nimble as we navigate the course ahead."" 
A week earlier the Fed raised rates for the first time in three years and signaled more hikes were coming, likely on the same rate-hike path that Evans said Friday was his ""baseline assessment."" That path would bring the Fed's policy rate to a range of 1.75%-2% by year-end, and to 2.5%-2.75% by the end of next year.
But since the Fed's March meeting, with data pointing to an already tight labor market tightening even further and inflation surging to a 40-year high, policymakers have sounded increasingly ready to be more aggressive.

On Friday, Evans made a point of underscoring his personal uncertainty about the proper path of policy. 
""As we move through the year, we will certainly learn more and will be prepared to adjust policy as needed,"" he said.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's economy is expected to expand 3.5% this year due to higher energy prices and the Ukraine crisis, the International Monetary Fund said on Friday, lowering a previous 5.4% estimate made last summer.
""Growth is expected to remain robust despite the adverse impact of the war in Ukraine and high inflation,"" the fund said in a statement after a staff visit to Greece.
It said elevated risk aversion and weaker consumer confidence due to higher energy prices might delay investments and dent tourism's recovery.
Its new estimate is lower than Greece's own forecast for 4.5% growth this year. Greece's economy grew 8.3% in 2021. 
The IMF said average inflation will rise to 4.5% in Greece this year before it settles at 1.9% over the medium term. The country's annual consumer inflation surged to 7.2% in February, a 25-year high.
The IMF mission, which called for a growth-friendly fiscal adjustment and continuing structural reforms, said the government should return to primary surpluses next year and achieve a surplus of 2% of GDP by 2027.

Greece's public debt, at about 200% of GDP last year, is expected to decline and rollover risks appear manageable over the medium term, it said. 
""Though the overall risk of sovereign stress is moderate, considerable uncertainty remains about Greece's ability to sustain high primary surpluses and the future path of interest rates once Greece starts to replace official financing with market funding,"" the statement said.

""The rhino in the room has been unleashed and may now prove difficult to stop,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Wealth Management Global CIO Christian Nolting said in a research note, adding consumer price inflation in the United States had breached the 7% threshold.
""Longer-term issues such as the shrinking workforce and the growing share of GDP generated by labour-intensive services are likely to remain and inflation is therefore unlikely to return to its pre-pandemic level in the years to come.""
Nolting said the sanctions imposed on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine were making supply chain problems worse while the oil and gas price shock could drive prices even higher. 
""In the developed economies, already elevated inflation rates may now be driven even higher given the conflict-induced oil and gas price shock,"" he said. 
""Sanctions as well as businesses halting their operations in Russia are exacerbating supply chain problems,"" he said. ""Furthermore, shortages in platinum, palladium or even neon are hampering the manufacturing of intermediate products.""
Economic growth in the United States will outstrip that of the euro zone in 2022 and 2023 because of the conflict in Ukraine and Europe's dependence on energy imports, Nolting said.
""We now expect U.S. growth to outstrip that of the euro zone in both 2022 and 2023 because of the euro zone's geographical proximity to the conflict zone and Europe's structural disadvantage as the world’s largest net importer of energy.""

DETROIT (Reuters) - Major automakers are expected to report on Friday that first-quarter U.S. car and light truck sales fell sharply compared to a year ago, with more uncertainty ahead because of parts shortages, high fuel prices and rising interest rates.
J.D. Power and LMC Automotive forecast that January-March U.S. car and light truck sales will decline 18% from a year ago, and predict the annualized sales pace for March will slump to 12.7 million vehicles, down from 17.8 million a year ago.
Cox Automotive said earlier this week first quarter U.S. auto sales would be the weakest in a decade.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc could buck the downward trend. The world's most valuable automaker is expected to report its first quarter deliveries as soon as Friday, and Wall Street had been expecting an improvement from the fourth quarter figure of 308,650 vehicles. However, Tesla has had to shut down production at its Shanghai factory this week to comply with COVID lockdowns.
Two years after the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns derailed the U.S. economy, automakers are still trying to find their balance. The spike in gasoline prices, propelled by the war in Ukraine, and the worst inflation in 40 years have rattled consumer confidence. Rising rates coupled with high pump prices have often been harbingers of recessions for the auto industry in the past.
Consumer intentions to buy a new or used vehicle in the next six months have slumped in March for the second month in a row, and for used vehicles are at the lowest levels in 15 months, according to a survey released by the Conference Board this week.
Shortages of semiconductors and other supply chain bottlenecks have left U.S. dealers short of many popular vehicles.

At the same time, the job market is strong and demand for new trucks and sport utility vehicles, as well as electric vehicles, are so strong that average vehicle prices are still at near record levels around $47,000, Cox Automotive analysts said this week.
Automakers earlier this year predicted sales and production would increase as supply chain bottlenecks eased during the year. The Ukraine conflict and a surge of COVID cases in China have some analysts questioning how much improvement automakers can deliver.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will sign a trade agreement with India on Saturday that will eliminate tariffs on 85% of Australian goods entering India, helping farmers and miners to diversify export markets, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.
The Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement will be signed on Saturday in a virtual ceremony by Trade Minister Dan Tehan and India's Minister of Commerce & Industry, Piyush Goyal, Australia said in a statement in Friday night. 
Morrison and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will witness the signing of the interim agreement, and both countries would continue to work towards a full free trade deal.
Morrison is expected to call a national election within days, and wanted to secure the trade deal with India, a decade after negotiations between the two countries began, before the election campaign.
His government has pushed to diversify export markets to reduce Australia's reliance on its largest trading partner China, after diplomatic disputes resulted in Beijing sanctioning Australian products including wine, lobster and coal. 
The deal with India unlocks a market of almost 1.4 billion consumers and would strengthen Australia's economy, he said.
""This agreement opens a big door into the world's fastest growing major economy for Australian farmers, manufacturers, producers and so many more,"" Morrison said in a statement.
Tariffs will be eliminated on more than 85% of Australian goods exports to India, worth A$12.6 billion, rising to almost 91% over 10 years.
Under the agreement, 96 per cent of Indian goods imports will enter Australia duty-free.
Tariffs will be eliminated on fresh Australian rock lobster, sheep meat, wool, copper, coal, alumina, and certain critical minerals and certain non-ferrous metals to India. 
In a boost for Australia's wine industry, tariffs will be reduced from 150% to 50% over 10 years for bottles valued over US$5, and reduced to 25% in the same period for bottles valued over US$15. 
Tariffs of 30% on Australian agricultural produce including avocados, beans, nuts, and berries will be eliminated over seven years. 
Trade Minister Dan Tehan said the agreement would boost critical minerals trade, professional services, education and tourism, and lay the foundation for a full free trade agreement.
The two countries will recognise each other's professional qualifications and licenses, and Australia will extend visas for STEM students from India who graduate in Australia with first class honours.
In 2020, India was Australia’s seventh largest trading partner, with two-way trade valued at A$24.3 billion. 

""This agreement has been built on our strong security partnership and our joint efforts in the Quad, which has created the opportunity for our economic relationship to advance to a new level,"" Morrison said, referring to the security grouping of India, Australia, United States and Japan.
Australia exported A$19.3 billion worth of goods to India in 2021, representing 4.2% of Australia’s total exports.

COJIMAR, Cuba (Reuters) - Since the days of Ernest Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea"", whose main character toiled with oars to catch a marlin, few Cubans have enjoyed the luxury of a motor boat to chase the bounty of fish that lie just offshore of their island home.
That appears set to change. 
For the first time in decades, the island's communist-run government has granted authority to Cubans to import outboard motors of less than 10 horsepower for use on small boats and has said it will cut red tape to fast-track the process.
One fisherman already mulling an upgrade is Maydel Reinaldo Hechevarría, a 41-year old street vendor from the port of Jaimanitas, west of Havana. He said he has fished since he was a boy but that lacking a motor, his options were few.
""When we row there are many days we cannot go out,"" said Hechevarría, who told Reuters he began the process to import a motor just days after the announcement last week. ""I see more possibilities now.""
Limits on boat building and imports have long restricted private commercial and recreational fishermen like Hechevarría to vessels that predate Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, much the same as the island’s candy-colored vintage American cars. 
But those limits, presumably aimed at reducing attempts at the dangerous crossing north to the United States by sea, also hamper fishermen´s ability to catch fish to feed the island´s 11 million inhabitants.
Even before Castro´s revolution, most Cubans, like Hemingway´s Santiago, in ""The Old Man and the Sea"", were too poor to afford a motor. Little has changed since.
""This is a solution for some but it doesn´t resolve the necessities of all fishermen,"" said Fernando de la Rosa, 58, who oversees the Jaimanitas fishing marina, a ragtag collection of boats tucked into a palm and mangrove lined creek.
Larger-scale commercial fishermen around Havana told Reuters the measure was a step in the right direction but still fell short of what is needed to modernize the fleet and boost catches.
Cojimar fisherman Abilio Alcantara, 53, captains a decades-old 27-foot Japanese-built boat that requires far more power than the 10hp motor authorized by the government, he told Reuters.
""The measure is a good one,"" he said. ""But we need motors of at least 80 or 90 horsepower.""
Alcantara said concerns that outboard motors would be used by fishermen to migrate north to the United States were overblown. 
""I have been on my boat for 30 years,"" Alcantara said. ""If I haven't left by now, I'm not going anywhere.""

Since October, the U.S. Coast Guard has picked up more than 1,000 Cubans on the way to South Florida in rafts, homemade boats and even on surfboards — the largest number since fiscal year 2017, agency records show.
A grinding economic crisis has led to food and medicine shortages and prompted many Cubans to seek to immigrate from the poor Caribbean island.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Haruhiko Kuroda built a career battling a strong yen and the Bank of Japan governor is unlikely to change course in his final year at the helm, eight sources said, despite political pressure to acknowledge that the weak currency is now a problem.
Sources familiar with the bank's thinking and people close to Kuroda, whose decade in charge ends next April, said he is likely to protect his legacy by avoiding tweaks to a monetary policy that continues to treat a strong yen as enemy No. 1.
The BOJ's dovish signals may give markets a chance to drive down the yen further, as prospects of steady policy tightening by the Federal Reserve widen the Japan-U.S. interest rate gap.
""The BOJ looks at inflation, not yen moves, in guiding policy,"" one of the sources said.
Kuroda's career as a finance bureaucrat was marked by fighting rises in the yen that threatened Japan's export-reliant economy.
After landing the BOJ top job in 2013, he maintained that stance and engineered a dramatic yen fall by pumping in massive monetary stimulus, a policy that is considered among the key successes of former premier Shinzo Abe's pro-growth ""Abenomics"".
Now, Kuroda is increasingly alone in repeating the benefits of a weak currency, as government officials escalate their warnings against excessive yen declines that help push up import costs and consumer prices for energy and food.
The weak yen has emerged as a political hot-button as lawmakers demand measures to cushion the blow from rising inflation ahead of upper house elections due in July.
The mood among companies is starting to change, too. Kengo Sakurada, head of business lobby Keizai Doyukai, said on Tuesday that current yen levels were hurting retailers and can ""hardly be seen as appropriate"".
Even former finance ministry colleagues, most of whom like Kuroda struggled to combat a strong yen, are beginning to brand currency weakness as indicative of Japan's waning economic might.
Kuroda appears unfazed, and continues to argue that while a weak yen may hurt households and retailers, the benefits to the economy outweigh the cost.
The BOJ is still relentless in defending its 0% cap for long-term interest rates, set under its ultra-easy policy.
Undeterred by the yen's slide to a six-year low against the dollar on Monday, it offered unlimited, fixed-rate purchases of 10-year government bonds through Thursday and ramped up bond-buying for other maturities.
""In a sense, the BOJ is driving down the yen with unlimited bond buying,"" said former top currency diplomat Naoyuki Shinohara, who was Kuroda's colleague at the finance ministry. ""It probably doesn't see the yen's current levels as dangerous.""
UNWAVERING AND PRAGMATIC
So far, there is little sign of discontent within the BOJ over Kuroda's stance. Dovish board members, such as Goushi Kataoka, see the weak yen as a key channel through which the bank's easy policy boosts growth.
A summary of opinions of a March meeting made no mention of the pros and cons of a weak yen.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's administration meanwhile continues to defend the BOJ's ultra-easy policy as a necessary support to a still-fragile economic recovery.
""It's hard to tighten monetary policy to deal with cost-push inflation, which means monetary policy must remain loose,"" said deputy chief cabinet secretary Seiji Kihara, who is considered among the premier's closest aides.
Pressure to tweak the yield cap could become overwhelming if the yen, now hovering near 122 to the dollar, plunges to around 130, some analysts say.
But Eisuke Sakakibara, who is known as ""Mr. Yen"" for master-minding currency interventions in the 1990s, argues that hiking BOJ interest rates will do little to stop yen declines.
For now, Kuroda is expected to ensure the BOJ stays the course on ultra-easy policy. While political pressure may mount for him to budge, current law does not give the government power to fire the central bank governor. Kuroda is unlikely to be reappointed, having already served an unusually long term.
Kuroda's predecessor, Masaaki Shirakawa, voluntarily left the job several weeks before his term ended, after facing a barrage of criticism for doing too little, too late to beat deflation.

Stepping down early, or hiking interest rates in the face of political pressure, is not in Kuroda's nature, say people who have regular interactions with the governor.
""He may be under heat but that's probably not a concern to him,"" one of the people said. ""He's extremely pragmatic and unwavering, so I can't see why he would choose to step down or tweak policy now.""

The government revised down its forecast for growth this year to 3.1% from the 3.4% it saw in December. Headline inflation was seen averaging at 4.6%, up from 2.1% expected in December. 
""Russia's invasion of Ukraine brings with it rising prices, a great deal of uncertainty and lower trade,"" Finance Minister Mikael Damberg told reporters. ""Sweden will be affected by the war in Ukraine through lower growth and higher price rises.""
Earlier this week, the NIER think tank forecast growth in 2022 of 3.3% and inflation at 5.2% for the year.
Headline inflation was 4.5% in February, measured against the same month in 2021.
Sweden's economy bounced back quickly from the pandemic and despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine is expected to remain relatively strong.
However, surging inflation has forced the government into measures to ease the impact of higher energy and fuel prices on consumers and bring forward defence spending.

The war, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"", has also forced millions to flee Ukraine and the government has set aside nearly 10 billion crowns ($1.07 billion) in the upcoming mini-budget to provide housing and other services for refugees who reach Sweden.
The government will publish its spring mini-budget on April 19.

ACCRA (Reuters) -Ghana's parliament approved a new 1.5% tax on electronic payments, known as the ""e-levy,"" on Tuesday after the opposition walked out in protest.
Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta proposed the e-levy in November to widen the tax net and has presented it as a panacea for Ghana's raft of financial woes. Opposition was so fierce that it caused a brawl in parliament a month later.
Critics believe the e-levy will price lower-income people and small business owners out of the digital economy, while Ofori-Atta said it was a way to ensure Ghanaians ""contribute their fair share"" toward development.
Ruling members of parliament re-introduced the bill on Tuesday, when many opposition MPs were not present, a surprise move analysts had previously said would be one of the only ways for the tax to pass.
It was expected to be re-submitted next week, but parliament speaker Alban Bagbin said it should be treated as urgent business and fast-tracked it.
""The financial institutions of this country should not be subject to this punitive, insensitive tax. It would be a disincentive to the private sector of Ghana,"" minority leader Haruna Iddrisu said in a statement in parliament. 
After he spoke, opposition parties walked out, refusing to take part in the vote. 
The tax, which would cover mobile money payments, bank transfers, merchant payments, and inward remittances, could raise up to 6.9 billion Ghanaian cedi ($926 million) in 2022, according to government estimates.
Analysts have said that the passage of the e-levy could reassure investors and lenders of Ghana's ability to make tough choices to generate revenue, helping to narrow government bond spreads.
Markets reacted immediately after the tax passed. Prices on Ghanaian Eurobonds rose by as much as 2.77 cents on the dollar, reaching their highest value since the day before Russia invaded Ukraine.
But analysts say additional fiscal measures may prove necessary for Ghana to reverse its recent economic misfortunes.
Ghana, one of West Africa's largest economies, is facing rampant inflation, a depreciating currency and a heavy debt burden. Its credit ratings have been downgraded over concerns about the government's ability to pass legislation to raise revenues.
""Regaining market access will probably require a series of strong fiscal data over the course of the next several months,"" said Amaka Anku, consultancy Eurasia Group's Africa practice head. ""The e-levy will help but is not dispositive."" 

Consumer inflation reached 15.7% year on year in February, the highest since 2016. The cedi depreciated some 20% against the dollar this year, second only to the Russian rouble, and public debt hovers around 80% of gross domestic product.
The government announced sweeping spending cuts last week to tackle the deficit, blaming its economic hardships on the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

399,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 07:27AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Latin America is emerging as an oasis of stability amid the global bond rout spurred by the Ukraine war, benefiting from a 6,600-mile distance from the conflict.
The region’s dollar-denominated sovereign and corporate bonds returned 0.4% since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, compared to a 9.8% loss in Eastern European, Middle Eastern and African notes and an almost 3% slide in Asian debt, according to Bloomberg indexes. It was also a brutal period for U.S. Treasuries, which went through their worst quarter of modern times.
Investors have flocked to Latin America over the past month, steering away from securities directly affected by the war. Unlike most European-developing nations, the region’s major economies don’t have strong trade links to Russia and still benefit from the massive rally in commodity prices as big raw material producers.
The recent outperformance marked a U-turn from the first two months of the year, when Latin American bonds were hit by a selloff in developing-world assets caused by fears of the Federal Reserve tightening. While the region’s notes have since rebounded, a big portion of the global debt market continued to suffer as traders braced for a more aggressive series of U.S. interest-rate hikes.
The surge in commodity prices triggered by supply-shock concerns since the war started made investors particularly interested in bonds from the region’s resource behemoths. The debt market is the only way to invest in state-run companies including Petroleos Mexicanos and Corporacion Nacional del Cobre de Chile, which don’t have publicly-listed stocks. 
“Quasi-sovereign oil companies from Colombia to Brazil to Mexico are investment picks we like at this current juncture,” said Kathryn Rooney Vera, head of global macro research at Bulltick LLC, who recommends a buy-and-hold approach to energy credits since “there is more room for upsides.” 
While higher commodity prices benefit raw material producers, it also contributes to already elevated inflation in the region. For that reason, investors are also favoring inflation-linked bonds, seeking protection against rising consumer prices.
“We hold onto our real-rate overweights in Mexico and Brazil,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts led by Andrea Kiguel wrote in a March 29 report. The bank is long on Mexico’s inflation-linked bonds, known as Udibonos, due November 2023 and Brazil’s NTN-B notes maturing on August 2024. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also recommends wagers on Udibonos, favoring those due 2031.
Brazil and Mexico’s inflation rates are expected to finish 2022 above the upper bound of their central bank target ranges, according to a Bloomberg survey. In comparison, inflation expectations in other key emerging markets such as South Africa and Indonesia are well contained.

Investing.com -- The U.S. is expected to have added nearly half a million jobs again in March, as the surge in living costs lures inactive workers back into the labor force. Eurozone inflation hits an all-time high and manufacturing slows sharply as the effects of war in Ukraine appear in the economic data for the first time. Stocks are set to open the second quarter with a bounce after ending the first one on a low note, while China's Covid-19 lockdowns and a slew of stock market suspensions revive concerns about the world's second-largest economy. Oil prices are back firmly above $100 a barrel. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 1st April.
1. Payrolls seen posting another solid rise; look out for the participation rate
It’s payrolls day, and the monthly employment report at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) will cap a week of data from a labor market that remains as tight as a drum. The monthly JOLTS survey showed vacancies still close to record highs and the ‘quit rate’ ticking up in March.
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have risen by 490,000, which can be seen as a step toward normalization after even bigger leaps earlier in the year as Covid-related restrictions were lifted.
The unemployment rate is expected to have fallen to 3.7% from 3.8%, while average hourly earnings growth is expected to slow to 0.4% from 0.6%, taking a little pressure off the Federal Reserve as it tries to get up to speed with overshooting inflation.
However, arguably the most important element of the report will be labor force participation, amid suspicions that higher living costs will tempt people back into work.
2. Eurozone inflation hits record, U.K. energy prices soar - but Russian gas keeps flowing
Higher living costs are front and center in Europe again Friday, with Eurozone inflation hitting 7.5% in March, the highest since the euro was created. There’s worse to come, given the ongoing increase in energy prices, so a 13-month low in S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI)'s manufacturing PMI came as no surprise.
In the U.K., a rise in the household energy price cap takes effect, which will lead to immediate and sharp rises in bills for many consumers, especially poorer ones.
The situation is even worse in North Africa, where inflation is being driven by rocketing food prices, according to a new report by the UN’s World Food Program.
Both developments are traceable at least in part to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has disrupted world trade in grains, and oil and gas. Russian gas continues to flow to Europe, however, after a tweak to new rules insisting on payment in rubles. The net effects of the new arrangements are cosmetic. With spot prices spiking, transmission system data showed Russia shipping more gas to Europe than at any time in the last four months as buyers relied more on their long-term contracts with Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).
3. Stocks set to open higher; Ford, GM idle plants due to parts shortages
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher after finishing the first quarter on a sour note, with all the three main indices losing around 1.5%.
By 06:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 210 points, or 0.6%, while S&P 500 futures were also up 0.6% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.8%.
The mood is being clouded by renewed fears of supply chain disruptions as the Covid-19 lockdowns in China spread to affect more and more factories and logistics hubs.
Ford and GM both said late on Thursday that they will temporarily shut some plants due to component shortages.
4. China factories contraction; mass suspension of real estate developer stocks
China’s Covid-19 numbers remain a source of some controversy, but the Caixin Manufacturing PMI, which covers the country’s smaller and independent businesses, followed the state-dominated official PMI in signalling a contraction in activity in March. It fell to 48.1, its lowest in two years, from 50.4 in February.
There was also fresh evidence of the unsolved problems in the country’s real estate sector, as the Hong Kong Stock Exchange suspended over 30 companies for failing to meet a deadline for filing full-year reports. The companies suspended included developers Shimao – previously seen as one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector – and Kaisa, one of the biggest Chinese users of the foreign bond markets.
Chinese diplomats meet with the EU in Brussels later, but are not expected to signal any weakening of the country’s support for Russia in its war against Ukraine.
5. Oil back above $100 as OPEC+ hits the buffers
Crude oil prices regained their mojo after taking a big hit earlier in the week from President Joe Biden’s plan to unlock the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
By 6:25 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 0.1% at $100.19 a barrel, having earlier hit a high of $100.84 while Brent crude, the global benchmark, was up 0.1% at $104.85 a barrel.
That follows a routine refusal on Thursday by OPEC and its partners (most importantly, Russia) to increase output by any more than the planned 432,000 barrels a day from May 1. Anyone looking for extra barrels will have to look to Baker Hughes’ U.S. rig count later in the day, where signs of drilling activity have picked up sharply in recent months as the prospects for a lengthy period of above-trend prices have brightened."

(Reuters) - The governor of Ukraine's central bank urged the central banks of the European Union, the United States, Japan and Britain to ban transactions in the Russian or Belarusian rouble over Russia's war on Ukraine.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese exports to Russia have been buffeted as the rouble swings in value, clear evidence of a ripple effect that Western sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine are having in China, even as it sticks by its neighbour diplomatically.
Chinese multinationals have stayed in Russia while their Western rivals flee but it is smaller Chinese companies that are more vulnerable to exchange rate losses, with several telling Reuters that much of their Russian business is on hold as both sides wait out the volatility.
""The products I was supposed to send to Russia are sitting in my warehouse,"" said Deng Jinling, whose factory in eastern China makes vacuum flasks. 
Last year, about 30% of her 40 million yuan ($6.29 million) revenue came from Russia. 
""Our clients are all waiting to see if the exchange rate can improve a bit. Their costs are too high with the exchange rate at the moment,"" she said. 
Another Chinese trader, who only gave her surname Guo, said her firm acted as a middleman between Russian and Chinese clients but the volume of products such as bed sheets and kitchen equipment they usually handle had dropped by a third.
China is Russia's biggest source of imports and sold $12.6 billion of goods to Russia just in January and February - mostly computers, cars, shoes and toys, according to customs data.
Both Russian importers and Chinese exporters are putting off business on fears of being caught out by the roller-coaster rouble.
""The depreciation of the rouble means that you lose money every time there's a sale,"" said Shen Muhui, who heads a trade group representing more than 20,000 small Chinese exporters to Russia.
He said a few more Russian customers were willing to use Chinese yuan to pay for goods but not enough to make much of a difference, and demand for his warehousing services in Russia had slumped by about a fifth since the Ukraine war began and about 90% of his members had been affected.
""You can't raise prices because the Russians can't afford it ... So you make a loss when converting your receipts into yuan,"" Shen said.
""Exporting to Russia becomes undoable.""
LONG-TERM OPTIMISM
The rouble has seen huge volatility against both the U.S. dollar and Chinese yuan since Russia launched what it calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
The conflict triggered a slump of more than 40% in the rouble's value against the yuan, though the Russian currency has rebounded roughly 70% since a March 9 low. 
Against the U.S. dollar, the rouble tumbled as much 44% in just seven trading days following the invasion, but has surged nearly 90% since its March 7 low, trading at around 81 to the dollar in the interbank market. 
China has declined to condemn Russia's action in Ukraine or call it an invasion and it has repeatedly criticised what it calls illegal and unilateral sanctions.
Major Chinese companies such as Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) and Great Wall Motor have largely stayed silent on their Russia plans. 
But behind the scenes, China is wary of its firms running afoul of sanctions and is pressing them to tread carefully with investments there, Reuters reported on March 25.
State-run Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) Group has suspended talks on a major petrochemical investment and a gas marketing venture in Russia, the sources said. 
Winnie Wang, president of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-commerce Association, was optimistic about trade with Russia in the long term, saying she expected Chinese exports to increase in variety and volume, despite short-term challenges including the currency volatility. 

Wang said she hoped traders could wean themselves off U.S. dollar settlement.
""The two countries should work together to design a new payment framework for trade,"" she said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - With Russia threatening to cut off the supply of vital gas and oil, European governments are dusting off rationing plans that bring back memories of the 1973 energy crisis. 
Are Europeans heading for car-free Sundays, dimmer lights and what felt like government-mandated bedtime as TV broadcasts ended early - last seen at the time of the Arab embargo?
Probably not because that, and more recent episodes, show companies are quick to adapt, meaning the hit to the euro area's economic output may be smaller than 1% on some estimates.
And governments have also learned that imposing austerity measures like fuel rationing at the pump will yield little if the population doesn't support them.
So they are likely to go for something more consensual, such as getting households to turn down their thermostats or ease up on the gas pedal.
Still, choosing which industries should get their energy supply cut will be a thorny political decision, forcing governments to resort to the kind of ruthlessness normally reserved for wartime. 
DENT TO GROWTH MAY BE SMALL
While Europe might just about replace its imports of Russian crude with other sources, it's unlikely to be able to do so with gas any time soon.
This means a rationing of gas is certain if Russia turns off the taps in retaliation for sweeping economic sanctions.
But economists estimate the damage to economic growth would be small.
The European Central Bank puts the hit from a 10% reduction in energy supplies on European companies at about 0.7% of the euro area's gross value added, a measure of goods and services produced in the bloc.
This is in line with precedents both in Britain during the 1970s embargo and in Japan after the Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011.
Europe's service-oriented economies are also likely to come off more lightly than manufacturing-heavy China when it went through its own power crunch last year.
""Past episodes of energy rationing have not been as damaging as one might expect and firms have proved adept at achieving sizeable efficiency gains when required,"" Capital Economics wrote. 
For example, pork exporter Danish Crown has started to retrofit some gas-fired production plants with diesel and sales of diesel generators in Denmark rose 300-400% in March. 
Even for Germany, the western European country most reliant on Russian energy, the impact of an 8% cut to oil, gas and coal consumption would lower GDP by 1.4%, according to a paper by the ECONtribute network of economists. 
Of course, there are more pessimistic scenarios. Nomisma Energia estimates the Italian economy, which also depends on Russia for its energy, would suffer a 5.6% hit if gas supplies from Russia fell by roughly half, assuming some gains in efficiency but no switch to alternative sources. 
RATIONING DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT PUBLIC SUPPORT
Today's rationing strategies are mostly intended to spare households and concentrate any pain on companies, starting with those that can switch to other energy sources.
This is a key lesson learned from the 1970s. The two European countries that imposed fuel rationing for the population - Sweden and the Netherlands - had to quickly change course due to public backlash.
Instead, most governments at the time let the price of fuel rise, automatically depressing demand.
And they focussed on measures the population saw as more equitable, such as lower speed limits and more frequent public transport.
""Can rationing work? It's a function of the public's willingness to support it,"" said Alan Pisarski, who helped shape the U.S. strategy to deal with the 1973 oil embargo. 
He said Europe should focus on convincing people to turn down their heating - a campaign already underway in some countries.
WAR ECONOMY
Even drawing a list of which industries should get fuel for longest, as the German government is doing, can be politically difficult, history shows. 
When the oil embargo hit the United States, the senators of the mountainous states of Colorado and New Hampshire fought back at the notion of turning off lifts at ski resorts and sought to deflect the attention to energy used in hot houses for floriculture, Pisarski recalls.
In Germany, chemical group BASF has already warned of a ""complete cessation of operations"" if natural gas supply is cut to less than half of current needs.
In the end, industries that need heat as part of their production process, such as makers of chemicals, metals, glass and paper, are likely to get priority.

Those on interruptible contracts are likely to be the first to face supply stops and may even have to cut their working week, as happened in China during last year's rationing. 
""The rationing required by an immediate embargo would basically be comparable with the allocation mechanism of a war economy,"" said Kirsten Westphal, a member of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs that advises the government, in an interview with the Clean Energy Wire https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/russian-energy-embargo-would-force-drastic-rationing-decisions-security-expert.

CITY OF ORANGE, N.J. (Reuters) - Struggling with the rising cost of grains, aluminum and fuel due to inflation exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, New Jersey brewery Four City Brewing Company says it will have to raise prices in its taproom soon. 
The craft beer maker cans its product in Orange, New Jersey, in a labor-intensive operation, weighing the filled cans by hand as they are packed into boxes. 
So far, the company has managed not to raise prices, but that may not last.
""Grain has gone up 18, 20, 25 cents a pound. So when you're talking about hundreds, maybe a thousand pounds per batch, it's a lot of money,"" said co-owner Anthony Minervino.
Ukraine, among the world's leading exporters of grain and vegetable oils, has introduced export licenses for wheat and suspended exports of rye, oats, millet, buckwheat, salt, sugar, meat and livestock since the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special military operation."" 
""It's at least going to be $1 to $2 more, probably per pour in the taproom, probably a couple of dollars on each case per keg,"" said Roger Apollon Jr., another co-owner. 
""Nothing extreme. But we have to cover our costs because the costs have been pretty significant.""
Minervino said the war in Ukraine will likely have a ripple effect, and has been compounded by earlier inflation on everything from the barley - that is a key ingredient in brewing their beer - to aluminum for the cans, shipping and electricity prices. 

The brewery's biggest margin is in their taproom, which is where they hope to recoup some of their losses.
""If you want to compare prices three months ago to make the can of beer as opposed to today, we have the grain, the aluminum, there's fuel surcharges, the shipping and everything, it's gone up significantly,"" said Minervino.

405,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 05:27AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s economy has staggered through the first full month of the war with Ukraine but it may yet emerge with a sparkling balance sheet if some of its biggest trade partners don’t turn off the tap on its exports of energy.
For all the hardships visited on consumers at home and the financial chokehold put on the government from abroad, Bloomberg Economics expects Russia will earn nearly $321 billion from energy exports this year, an increase of more than a third from 2021. It’s also on track for a record current-account surplus that the Institute of International Finance says may reach as high as $240 billion.
“The single biggest driver of Russia’s current account surplus continues to look solid,” IIF economists led by Robin Brooks said in a report. “With current sanctions in place, substantial inflows of hard currency into Russia look set to continue.”
The calculus may change completely, however, in case of an embargo on energy sales. And even without it, Russia’s oil exports and output are already falling, with the International Energy Agency predicting it may lose nearly a quarter of its crude production this month.
Many of the country’s traditional customers are also looking elsewhere and choosing not to sign new contracts for Russian supplies amid widespread condemnation of President Vladimir Putin’s aggression. Others like India are getting steep discounts. 
The invasion of Ukraine has shocked Germany and its European Union allies into a radical shift in energy policy, and the bloc is rushing to cut its dependence on Russia. For now, Europe’s largest economy opposes sanctions or political pressure that would prompt a full energy embargo. Only a handful of nations -- including the U.S. and the U.K. -- have imposed explicit bans on imports from Russia.
Oil and gas account for about half of Russia’s exports and contributed around 40% to last year’s budget revenue.
What Our Economists Say:
“Hydrocarbon revenue is a lifeline for Russia’s economy, helping to damp the impact of otherwise severe sanctions and stave off a balance-of-payments crisis. But even without an energy embargo, inflation is soaring and a deep recession looms.”
--Scott Johnson.
Still, the combination of a steep ruble depreciation and a higher dollar price for oil will generate an extra 8.5 trillion rubles ($103 billion) in budget revenue this year, according to TS Lombard.
“The Finance Ministry will use some of it to cushion the blow but cautiously, not to spark inflation further,” said Madina Khrustaleva, an analyst at TS Lombard in London. “It seems that all these sanctions will destroy the non-energy part of the economy. Russia will depend on energy even more.”
Although the showdown over Ukraine has rattled energy shipments, the shock to imports and domestic demand will be so severe that the current account, the broadest measure of trade and services, may hit a new historical high after last year’s record $120 billion.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) GS)., whose upward revision for the current-account surplus this year puts it at $205 billion, says it may be enough for the Bank of Russia to meet the private sector’s demand for foreign exchange and allow it eventually to loosen capital controls. 
With Russian consumers already caught in a barrage of shocks from inflation to a hollowing out of incomes, Goldman economists predict a 20% collapse in imports this year, double the expected decline in exports. 
A healthy balance sheet won’t save Russia from a deep recession, but it’s helping sustain government spending at a time when the government has no access to international capital markets. TS Lombard analysts said the ruble’s exchange rate is effectively backed by current inflows now that sanctions froze much of the central bank’s currency reserves.
Russia’s ability to sell oil and gas abroad may be the only thing keeping the economy from descending into an even worse financial meltdown. 
The IIF, an association of the world’s biggest financial institutions, said an energy embargo by the EU, the U.K. and the U.S. would lead to a contraction of more than 20% in output and may cost Russia as much as $300 billion in export receipts, depending on price swings.

406,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 05:01AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russia's central bank said on Friday it was softening restrictions on foreign fund transfers for individuals for a six-month period. 
The bank said the measures, which raise an earlier limit on funds that can be transferred abroad, did not apply to residents and non-residents from countries that had imposed sanctions against Russia over Ukraine. 
""Within a calendar month, individuals have the right to transfer no more than 10,000 U.S. dollars or the equivalent in another currency from the Russian Federation from their account in a Russian bank to their account or to another person abroad,"" the bank said in a statement.
The bank added that transfers abroad from bank accounts of non-residents, individuals or legal entities from countries that had imposed sanctions were suspended for the next six months. 
The measure will ease strain on Russians who regularly send funds to relatives abroad, or to those who have left the country without access to their funds at home. 
""From an economic point of view, this is a first and still very cautious step towards easing restrictions on the movement of capital,"" said Dmitry Polevoy, an analyst at the Moscow-based brokerage Loko-Invest.
""The choice of (lifting some restrictions) for individuals is also understandable ...the risks for financial stability are lower.""
Earlier this month, the central bank said it was temporarily suspending transfers by foreign legal entities and individuals from several countries to accounts abroad. It also limited transfers at the equivalent of no more than $5,000 a month. 

The regulator said last week that Russia's central bank imposed in the past month on capital flows out of the country were a tit-for-tat move in response to part of its reserves being frozen by Western countries.
Western sanctions imposed on Russia for what Moscow calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine have limited the central bank's ability to support the rouble currency with dollars and euros held in its foreign currency and gold reserves.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks should beware of fake news that could trigger a run on their deposits, the European Union's banking watchdog said in a warning on Friday about potential fallout from the war in Ukraine.
""As market sentiment remains highly volatile and driven by news flow, banks' liquidity levels can become vulnerable due to spread of inaccurate information,"" the European Banking Authority said in its latest ""risk dashboard"", which focused on exposures to Russia and Ukraine.
""Such campaigns that spread inaccurate information may result in deposit outflows from targeted banks,"" EBA said.
EBA said exposures of banks in the bloc to Russia are too low to threaten financial stability, but economic fallout from the war in Ukraine and cyber attacks could hit the profitability of lenders.
EU banks had exposures totalling 76 billion euros ($84 billion) to Russia and 11 billion euros to Ukraine in the fourth quarter of 2021, mainly among Austrian, French and Italian lenders.
Only Austrian and Hungarian banks reported more than 2% of their total exposures, such as in loans and advances, towards Russia and Ukraine, EBA said.

""Based on the EBA's initial assessment, direct exposures to Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are limited, but second-round effects may be more material from a financial stability perspective,"" it said.
Second-round effects include direct economic fallout of the war such as the fiscal impact, the impact of sanctions, elevated risks from cyber attacks, and the longer-term impact on supply chains in the global economy, EBA said.
Higher inflation and lower growth could dent lending and offset the benefits of rising interest rates for banks, EBA said.
Banks in the EU continued to have overall strong core capital levels of 15.4% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, EBA said.

Federal Reserve minutes and a Reserve Bank of Australia meeting will provide insights on rate setters' thinking. Resilience in stocks and Russia's rouble could be put to the test.
Here's your week ahead in markets from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Tommy Wilkes, Marc Jones and Dhara Ranasinghe in London.
1/FED UP
Judging by the, albeit brief, inversion of a closely watched part of the Treasury yield curve, U.S. recession risks are rising.
An inverted curve has a solid track record for predicting recessions, but how to interpret recent bond moves presents a conundrum for investors. After the Federal Reserve's March 16 meeting offered a glowing assessment of the economic outlook, stocks are taking the bond selloff in their stride. 
On Wednesday, minutes of that Fed meeting should show how policymakers view the outlook. They've already flagged bigger rate hikes to tame inflation, which is at four-decade highs. Also key would be details on how quickly the Fed might reduce its $9 trillion balance sheet, a risk some believe markets are underestimating.

2/ WHEN DOVES BUY
The Bank of Japan has put its money where its mouth is, proving its position as the world's most dovish major central bank. Its standing offer to buy benchmark government bonds signals a potent defence of its yield curve control policy.
    The effect of that binge is debatable: yields have only eased slightly from six-year highs, and that arguably had as much to do with U.S. Treasury yields declining from multi-year peaks.
    And there's a collateral casualty of the BOJ's uber-easing: the yen, which has plumbed depths not seen since 2015. While the BOJ maintains a weaker currency is overall positive for the economy, jawboning by a queue of government officials suggests a differing view.
Australia's central bank meanwhile meets on Tuesday and while a policy change isn't expected, the bank may go further in laying groundwork for a rate hike. Markets expect one around June.

3/ BOUNCEBACK-ABILITY
Two-weeks ago Wall Street's S&P 500 and MSCI's main world stocks index were both down 14% for the year and the Nasdaq was officially in minus 20% ""bear"" market territory.
Now? Though the war in Ukraine rages on and interest rates are on the up, the S&P 500 is back to within 5% of its all-time high, MSCI World has recovered half of its drop and the Nasdaq is down a more manageable 8%.
Analysts hope that as and when the dust settles, corporate earnings will still look okay, and that the dreaded ""stagflation"" scenario will be avoided. TINA, or There Is No Alternative, is still alive and well it seems.
The next earnings season is approaching but if the Russia-Ukraine crisis does lead to a new Iron Curtain, it might get harder for stocks to defy gravity.

4/ REBOUND FOR REAL?
The rouble has staged a remarkable recovery from the record lows hit in the days following Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. In onshore, and offshore markets, where Western institutions trade with non-sanctioned Russian entities, the rouble is almost back to where it was in the run-up to the invasion.
The rise is partly down to capital controls that have suppressed rouble selling and artificially inflated the currency. But there is also a genuine improvement in Russia's balance of payments as imports collapse and soaring energy prices increase export revenues.
President Vladimir Putin's demand for rouble payments for gas, and whether European buyers agree, could be the next test for whether demand for the currency is real or engineered. 
Graphic: Russian rouble vs U.S. dollar- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbpgnmwjavq/rouble%20vs%20dollar.PNG 
5/ END OF AN ERA
While the U.S. yield curve inverted, a sea change was taking place in euro zone bond markets with German, French and Dutch two-year debt yields popping above 0% for the first time since 2014.
Yields across the bloc ended March with their biggest monthly surge in around a decade, on expectations the ECB will soon push its minus 0.5% depo rate to 0% and above.
That would be a key moment for negative-yielding debt, global volumes of which surged above $18 trillion in 2020. Savers, banks and pension funds should all benefit; risky corporate debt and emerging markets that gained from investors' ""hunt for yield"" may lose out.

But calling a trend change in these volatile times is not easy. Coming days could show if yield moves back above 0% are really durable.

409,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 03:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Julien Ponthus.
The deadline for European buyers of Russian gas to start paying in roubles and the release of that number one U.S. economic indicator, the non-farm payrolls report, means it won't be a quiet end to the week. 
It is not clear which side has the most to lose if existing gas contracts are halted but Germany, the most heavily reliant on Russian gas, has already activated an emergency plan that could lead to rationing in Europe's biggest economy.
For their part, oil prices are easing off after U.S. President Joe Biden this week announced a release of 1 million barrels per day for six months to tackle the sharp rise in energy prices which followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The gas showdown comes amid warnings that the euro zone could be heading towards a recession as confidence drops among consumers and businesses, while inflation numbers this week from the like of France, Germany and Italy showed a historic surge building up across the bloc. 
Flash euro zone inflation data is out later this session with some analysts saying the headline number could top 7%.
And talking about recession fears, the two-year/10-year part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted briefly again overnight. 
Whether this correctly predicts a recession within two years remains to be seen but there are plenty of factors jeopardising the post-lockdown recovery, from strained supply chains to the resurgent pandemic. 
On that front, China's factory activity slumped at the fastest pace in two years in March due to a local COVID-19 resurgence. 
The risk of a monetary policy accident is also on investors' mind. Some pundits worry that the European Central Bank is doing too little to tame inflation.
Money markets see the ECB exiting negative rates by year-end and in the meantime, the portion of euro zone debt carrying a negative yield is shrinking fast. 
As far as the Federal Reserve is concerned, the eagerly awaited U.S. March jobs data later on could help gauge the pace at which monetary tightening can be conducted without rocking the recovery boat. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday: 
- China March factory activity contracts at sharpest rate in 2 years 
-Indonesia's March inflation at 2-year high
-Japan business mood sours as Ukraine war
- Flash euro zone HICP inflation due
- EU officials Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel hold a virtual summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

LONDON (Reuters) -When euro zone interest rates turned negative in 2014, fixed income specialist Michael Hampden-Turner recalls having to explain to baffled bond investors how they could be charged to lend money to governments.
As central banks sought to help economies through a succession of crises by making it costly to hoard cash rather than put it to work, investors soon found themselves paying many countries - and even some companies - to take their money.
Savers complained that up-ending the practice of charging borrowers interest robbed them of wealth, but by late 2020, 75% of euro zone sovereign debt on Tradeweb's platform - roughly 6.7 trillion euros ($7.45 trillion) - carried negative yields. 
Nearly a decade later, Hampden-Turner, previously at Citi and now fixed income director at FTSE Russell, is watching borrowing costs climb back above 0%. Now, his younger colleagues must get their heads around positive yields. 
""Previously, it was just getting people familiar with it, and now we've got a whole generation of traders that have never known anything but negative yields,"" said Hampden-Turner. ""All of a sudden that's changing.""
More attractive returns could bring investors back to the region and boost the euro, while easing strains on banks and pension funds. Likely losers include riskier emerging and corporate bonds that were snapped up in a hunt for returns. 
Money markets see the ECB exiting negative rates by year-end as it tightens policy to tackle soaring inflation.
Less than a third of euro zone debt on Tradeweb's platform now carries a negative yield, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) estimates the global pool has shrunk to less than $3 trillion for the first time since December 2015, from a 2020 peak of over $18 trillion. 
Yields on German 10-year bonds vaulted above 0% in January for the first time since 2019 and are at 0.6%. Two-year yields turned positive for the first time since 2014 this week. 
NEGATIVE VERDICT
Switzerland and Japan also took rates below zero from 2015 in an experimental - and arguably failed - effort to revive inflation and growth. 
Blamed for a huge rise in debt and inflating housing and stock market bubbles, negative rates have also been bad news for pension funds and insurers, which use current bond yields to value future liabilities. 
Because they cannot make money holding ""safe"" government bonds, they have been forced take on more risk: a 2019 IMF paper showed large pension plans had doubled allocations to illiquid, alternative assets since 2007. 
German insurers whose investment products guarantee an income in old age have been under particular pressure, with regulators requiring they set aside additional reserves since 2011. 
For banks, negative rates have hurt profitability by eroding their net interest margins. Euro area bank stocks have slid some 40% since 2014 and Japan's banks 10% since rates there fell below 0% in 2016.
""If ... interest rates are like a guide to banks pricing power, interest rates in Europe have been at a 5,000-year low. So banks' pricing power has been at a 5,000-year low,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) chief European equity strategist Graham (NYSE:GHM) Secker.
CHANGE IN THE AIR
As short-dated bond yields turned positive this week, euro zone bank shares gained almost 4%. 
Each ECB rate hike could add 10% to lenders' earnings-per-share, Secker estimates - and 20% in southern Europe.
A return to positive yields could also bring back capital from higher-yielding assets.
Viktor Hjort, global head of credit strategy at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), estimates insurance companies owned 30% of European corporate bonds in 2016 but just 22% now, crowded out by the ECB.
A February BofA survey predicted such long-term investors would become the biggest marginal buyer of European credit. 
""If you're an insurance fund, the opportunities for investment for you have just expanded drastically,"" said Helene Jolly, head of EMEA investment-grade corporate debt syndicate at Deutsche Bank.
""Before this it was harder for you to hit targets. You maybe had to go slightly longer than you wanted to, or to a slightly lower credit rating."" 
Investors are already returning to higher-quality debt.
Thirty-year French and Belgian government bonds saw strong investor demand after yields rose above 1% in January, debt officials noted. 
David Gillard, who heads insurance and regulatory strategies at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, said the rise in yields ""provides insurers that were underweight rates and spread a good valuation point to increase credit market exposures"".
Covered bonds, the safest bank debt, and single-A rated corporate debt are among assets attracting insurers, he said. 
Such portfolio ""de-risking"" may hurt assets which benefited from negative yields. 
Already ""at the margin, (insurance companies) wanted to reduce some of that risk ... particularly from the likes of the emerging market area, that was an area of concern,"" said Gerard Fitzpatrick, head of fixed income portfolio management at Russell Investments.
But with euro zone rates expected to peak at just over 1% and no sign of hikes in Japan and Switzerland, unwinding could take years, especially as inflation-adjusted yields remain negative, unlike in emerging economies. 

""We're not going to have a party and get out the champagne because yields are above zero,"" said Ludovic Colin, a senior portfolio manager at Swiss asset manager Vontobel. 
""What we need to understand is where they are going, not where they are now.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Australia's central bank will end its longest easing cycle on record by the end of the third quarter, according to a Reuters poll in which a growing minority of economists expected a rate hike just weeks after a federal election in May.
When several of its peers have already tightened policy, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is expected to deliver multiple 50-basis-point hikes this year, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has been waiting for signs wage inflation is picking up.
Money market traders have bet on an RBA move in June, just weeks after the May election, given expectations high commodity prices and global supply constraints caused by the Russia-Ukraine war will increase inflation.
""The timing of the election is a complication for the RBA,"" wrote Felicity Emmett, senior economist at ANZ.
""While the Bank will lift rates if the case is compelling, no matter the timing, (RBA Governor Philip) Lowe would likely prefer not to raise rates either just before or just after an election. The RBA did cut rates in 2019 just after the election, but cutting is much more palatable than hiking.""
In the latest March 28-31 Reuters poll, the median forecast showed the RBA would raise its official cash rate from 0.10% to 0.50% by the end of the July-September quarter, compared with to 0.25% in a March poll.
However, economists were split on how the RBA would proceed.
A growing number expected the first rate hike by end-June, with 9 of 35 forecasting rates at 0.25% by then and three calling for rates at 0.50% by the end of the second quarter.
Just under half of respondents, 16 of 35, forecast rates to go up to 0.50% by end-September, with 12 calling for 0.25%. Three said rates would still be at 0.10% while four economists expected the cash rate to reach 0.75%, where it was before the pandemic.In response to an additional question on which month the RBA will start its first hiking cycle in over a decade, 12 of 27 said August and ten said June.
The remaining five were nearly divided between September and November. Among the major local banks, CBA is tipping a first rise in June, Westpac and NAB see August, ANZ said September.
""We see every meeting as live from May, with our expectation for a first hike of 15 basis points in August followed by two further hikes in 2022,"" said Alan Oster, chief economist at NAB.
While median forecasts showed the benchmark rate would rise to 0.75% by the end of this year, eight economists expect it to reach 1.00%.
More interest rate rises are on the way, with rates reaching 1.75% by the end of next year, up from 1.25% predicted in the previous survey.
Some economists said the federal budget walked a thin line between providing too much stimulus in the near term that could pressurise the RBA to move sooner than expected.
""We still expect inflation to approach 5% by Q3 and the additional stimulus measures announced add to the upside risks. With the government doing nothing to restrain demand, the RBA will have to do the heavy lifting to rein in inflation,"" said Marcel Thieliant, economist at Capital Economics.
The poll showed inflation would remain well above the RBA's target range of 2%-3% until the end of this year. 
It was expected to average 4.2% this year and slip to 2.8% in 2023, a massive upgrade from 2.5% and 2.3% predicted in January.

Australia's economy was expected to grow 4.2% this year and 2.8% in 2023.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Inflation is picking up in India, but the country's central bank is likely to maintain its loose policy even as its global peers raise rates, potentially forcing it to play catch-up aggressively later, economists and analysts say.
This view represents a shift in expectations, as market participants say the Reserve Bank of India is concerned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is damaging the global economy and India's recovery prospects, not just boosting prices.
A Reuters poll in early February found just over half of forecasters expecting the RBI to raise rates at its April meeting, but the war launched three weeks later has upended those predictions. 
RBI watchers now expect the bank to stand pat on April 8, even though inflation has broken above the 6% upper end of the bank's target band for two months.
Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist at Axis Bank, who had earlier expected the RBI to raise its reverse-repurchase rate next week, now says global uncertainties mean that ""it makes sense to remain at a status quo.""
Supporting such expectations, RBI Governor Shakikanta Das recently warned against a ""premature demand compression through monetary policy"". 
Deputy Governor Michael Patra said India's growth was as weak as in 2013, when a U.S. policy shift sent capital gushing out of emerging markets. ""The recent reverberations of war have in fact, tilted the balance of risks downwards"" for the economy, he said.
But economists warn inflation could spin out of control, hurting investors and savers alike - and most market participants say the RBI is already behind the curve on tackling inflation.
STOKING RISK OF OVERHEATING
Economists expect the RBI to raise its retail-inflation projection for the fiscal year starting on Friday by 50 to 80 basis points from the current 4.5%.
Upward price pressure is expected to continue as the war and resulting economic sanctions on Moscow send prices soaring for the grain, energy and other exports that Russia and Ukraine provide.
""In the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine war, the probability that higher-than-expected inflation will persist has increased. The longer we wait to address that, the faster that we may have to play catch-up with it eventually,"" said Churchil Bhatt, executive vice president of debt investments at Kotak Life Insurance.
Rising asset prices could feed through to demand-side inflation, while savers are being hurt as their returns lag behind inflation, said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Financial Services.
""By keeping interest rates artificially low, the chances of more aggressive tightening at a later stage have gone up significantly,"" she said.

Abhay Gupta, emerging Asia fixed income and forex strategist at BofA Securities, said the RBI must ""be vigilant for broader inflationary pressures.""
""Higher uncertainty would reduce room for error and markets would have to price in higher chances of a policy mistake,"" he said. Risks of eventual economic overheating suggest market interest rates must rise while the rupee should weaken, he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has little to cheer about a weak yen, which reflects its deteriorating economic fundamentals and trade deficit, the country's former top currency diplomat Mitsuhiro Furusawa said.
But monetary policy is not the right tool to curb yen falls, Furusawa said, brushing aside speculation that recent yen declines might prompt the central bank to raise interest rates.
""It's not good if the value of a country's currency keeps sliding,"" Furusawa told Reuters on Thursday, describing the weak-yen trend as reflecting Japan's waning competitiveness.
""Responding to a weak yen with monetary policy isn't right,"" he said, adding that the Bank of Japan will keep interest rates ultra-low to ensure inflation sustainably hits its 2% target.
Furusawa oversaw Japan's currency policy in 2013-2014, when BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's ""bazooka"" stimulus pushed down the yen and bolstered shares. His remarks point to changes in how Tokyo policymakers see a weak yen - once welcomed as giving Japan's export-reliant economy a boost.
The yen's real, effective exchange rate - an indicator that captures the international competitiveness of a currency - has slid to less than half the peak level of 150 hit in 1995.
The Japanese currency has lost around 8% against the dollar in March, dropping to a six-year low below 125 on Monday.
Some market players see 125 yen to the dollar as a level that raises alarm among Japanese authorities, as a previous drop to that level triggered verbal warnings by BOJ's Kuroda.
But Furusawa said the speed of yen moves, rather than the currency's level, were more important for policymakers in deciding whether to intervene in the market.
The dollar's spike to 125 yen on Monday was ""quite big,"" which is why incumbent currency diplomat Masato Kanda toned up his warning the following day, Furusawa said.

""It's meaningless to set a certain line-in-the-sand for currency levels,"" said Furusawa, who retains close contact with overseas and incumbent Japanese policymakers.
After his stint at Japan's finance minister, Furusawa served as deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund until 2021. He is currently president of the Institute for Global Financial Affairs at Japan's megabank SMBC.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg named Michele Bullock as Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), elevating her from her current position of Assistant Governor responsible for financial stability. 
Bullock starts her five-year term immediately following the surprise resignation of former Deputy Governor Guy Debelle in early March. Debelle left to join a green energy group founded by Australia's richest man, billionaire miner Andrew Forrest. 
Bullock joined the central bank straight out of university in 1985 and has served in the economic and international units, business services and currency departments.
In her new role, she will sit on the nine-member policy making Board of the RBA which sets interest rates. The next monthly meeting is due on April 5 when analysts assume rates will be kept at a record low of 0.1%.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe has said it was plausible a hike could come later this year as the economy is growing strongly and inflation is accelerating sharply.
Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) seven-year term as governor ends next year and he has said he would be happy to take a second term if the government offers it.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai on Thursday declined to say if Taiwan would be invited to join the Biden administration's Indo-Pacific economic plan, spurring Senate criticism that excluding the island would be a missed opportunity.
Taiwan has voiced its desire to be a ""full member"" in the forthcoming Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), one part of the administration's effort to counter what it says is Beijing's increasing economic and military coercion in the region.
The administration says the still fledgling IPEF aims to be inclusive, but it has not publicly detailed any membership plans. IPEF is intended as a flexible economic framework that would align members on supply chain security, infrastructure, labor standards, clean energy and other issues.
Tai, testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, called Taiwan an essential partner, but that no decisions had been made on membership. 
""On the point of Taiwan, we are in general in conversations with those who are interested in joining this framework,"" Tai said when asked by Senator Bob Menendez if the island would be invited to join the framework.
""Participation in the IPEF is still under consideration, and as far as I'm aware no decisions have been made,"" said Tai, the U.S.-born daughter of immigrants from Taiwan.
Menendez responded that the democratically governed island claimed by China was a key strategic and trading partner intertwined with U.S. economic security.
""I get a sense from that answer that we will not include Taiwan within the IPEF, which is missing an opportunity,"" he said.
The exchange followed a March 30 letter from 200 members of Congress from both parties, including Republicans Michael McCaul, Liz Cheney, and Elise Stefanik, and Democrats Ted Lieu, Ro Khanna, and Elissa Slotkin, urging Tai and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo to invite Taiwan to join IPEF.
""Taiwan's inclusion would also send a clear signal that the United States stands with its allies and partners, and will not be bullied by the PRC,"" the representatives said, referring to the People's Republic of China. 
The letter https://sires.house.gov/sites/sires.house.gov/files/documents/Taiwan%20IPEF%20Final.pdf was posted on the official Congress website of Democratic Congressman Albio Sires, who also signed it. 
Some analysts argue Taiwan's participation in the plan could make countries in the region hesitant to join for fear of angering Beijing, which opposes the idea as a tool for Washington to try to contain China's rise. 
Raimondo told members of the Senate Finance Committee last week that the administration was not contemplating Taiwan's inclusion at this time, according to two sources with knowledge of the closed-door meeting where she made the remark.
""I think it speaks to a broader issue that our trade agenda is sometimes just out of whack with our foreign policy agenda,"" one of the sources said.
The Commerce Department referred a Reuters request for comment to the White House National Security Council, which also said no decisions had been made on membership. 

Taiwan's de-facto embassy in Washington declined to comment on Raimondo's remark, but a spokesman said: ""Regarding IPEF, Taiwan continues to exchange views with the U.S. through existing economic and trade mechanisms and channels.""
Though it doesn't have formal ties with Washington, Taiwan is one of Asia's most vibrant democracies and economies, and is a dominant producer of semiconductors crucial to global supply chains.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian home prices are slowly coming back to earth as the sky-high markets of Sydney and Melbourne lose some heat, though there is still plenty of lift in the smaller cities and regions.
Figures from property consultant CoreLogic out on Friday showed prices in the combined capital cities edged up only 0.3% in March, from February, as Sydney dropped 0.2% and Melbourne 0.1%. Brisbane fared much better with a rise of 2.0%, while Perth rose 1.0% and Adelaide 1.9%.
Values in the regions jumped 1.7% amid a shift to country living and greater space. For the whole March quarter, regional prices climbed 5.1% compared to just 1.5% for the cities.
Combined, prices nationally rose 0.7% in March, to be up 18.2% on the year.
""Virtually every capital city and major rest-of-state region has moved through a peak in the trend rate of growth some time last year or earlier this year,"" said CoreLogic's research director, Tim Lawless.
""The sharpest slowdown has been in Sydney, where housing prices are the most unaffordable, advertised supply is trending higher and sales activity is down over the year.""
The median price of a home in Sydney is A$1.1 million ($823,240.00), well above the national median of A$739,000, while a house would set you back A$1.4 million.
The market had its strongest year ever in 2021 with the notional value of Australia's 10.8 million homes rising by A$2 trillion to A$9.9 trillion.
The boom was a windfall for household wealth and consumer spending power, but also caused concerns about affordability that will be hot-button issue for Federal elections due in May.

An explosion in mortgage debt also led regulators to tighten lending standards and is adding to the case for a rise in interest rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank decided on Wednesday to postpone payments to financial institutions for resources held in accounts from the Pix instant payment system, underscoring mounting risks from striking workers despite the relatively small impact for banks.
The payment, which was to add interest at the bank's Selic benchmark rate for the time the funds were held, was due to be made for the first time on Friday.
According to the central bank analysts association ANBCB, financial institutions will no longer receive around 2 million reais ($422,030) per day.
""The central bank's workers are carrying out daily partial stoppages and will go on strike from April 1, which affects the performance of various processes,"" Monetary Policy Director Bruno Serra said in a vote supporting the decision on Wednesday.
To preserve the security of the systems and the maintenance of essential activities ahead of the strike, Serra said it was considered appropriate to postpone the payments, adding they would be again proposed “when the issues are overcome.”
Brazil's central bank employees voted on Monday for an indefinite strike starting on April 1 in the face of unanswered demands about a wage increase. Until now, partial shutdowns have been affecting the release of economic indicators and other data.
The central bank said the measure aims to preserve the proper functioning of IT systems considering ""the potential risks"" imposed by the strike.

The financial industry group Febraban called the decision ""prudent"" adding that policymakers had avoided implementing new features on more sensitive days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Export-Import Bank's board of directors on Thursday voted to formalize the bank's withdrawal from any further business in Russia and approved financing and guarantee deals worth up to $381 million for Iraq, Sri Lanka and Albania.
The U.S. government export credit agency said its board also voted to notify Congress of a proposed renewal of a $450 million credit guarantee to Citibank that backs a $500 million facility to allow 365 suppliers of aircraft maker Boeing (NYSE:BA) to receive accelerated receivables payments related to export sales of Boeing aircraft. 
The notification is require for any transaction over $100 million. After 35 days, the board can hold a final approval vote.
EXIM said the board, meeting for the first time under new president and chair Reta Jo Lewis, approved a $48 million loan guarantee to support the sale of 12 U.S.-made Wabtec Corp locomotives to Sri Lanka Railways. Wabtec, which acquired  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s locomotive business in 2019, won the $56 million contract over Chinese competitors, EXIM said.
The lender also approved a preliminary commitment for a nearly $33 million energy efficiency authorization for Albania's national electric utility to rehabilitate its metering capabilities.
For Iraq, the board approved a resolution that authorizes EXIM bank officers to approve, deny and amend requests for insurance coverage on letters of credit used by the Trade Bank of Iraq for up to $300 million on purchases of U.S. goods and services.
The formal closing of Russian business follows an announcement last week by EXIM and export credit agencies in Britain and Canada to withdraw all support from Russia and Belarus in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. EXIM previously had an administrative hold prohibiting Russian business since Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. 

EXIM still has $410 million in prior credit exposure to Russia, primarily for aviation sector loan guarantees that were granted before Crimea's annexation.
""EXIM is working expeditiously to resolve those transaction repayments,"" the bank said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday unanimously passed a bill to improve oversight of ocean shipping, a step supporters say will help ease export backlogs.
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act, led by Senators John Thune and Amy Klobuchar, would strengthen the investigatory authority of the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC (NYSE:FMC)), the U.S. agency that oversees ocean shipping, and boost transparency of industry practices.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the legislation ""will reduce costs for the American people, by reforming unfair shipping practices hurting exports and consumers alike.""
Schumer noted ""supply chain backlogs have made it harder for goods to leave these ports and get to their international destination. Every single day that goods lie idle on our ports, it costs producers more and more money.""
The legislation would prohibit ocean carriers from unreasonably declining opportunities for U.S. exports that would be determined by the FMC, which would write new rules.
It would also require ocean common carriers to report to the FMC each calendar quarter ""on total import/export tonnage"" making port in the United States.
It would allow FMC to begin investigations of ocean common carrier’s business practices and apply enforcement measures. 
Klobuchar said ""Congestion at ports and increased shipping costs pose unique challenges for U.S. exporters, who have seen the price of shipping containers increase four-fold in just two years, raising costs for consumers and hurting our businesses."" 
Thune said the legislation would make ""it harder for ocean carriers to unreasonably refuse goods that are ready to export at U.S. ports.""
Similar legislation passed the U.S. House 364-60 in December but lawmakers must resolve differences before it can go to President Joe Biden.

On March 15, the White House unveiled a pilot information sharing effort to help clear supply chain bottlenecks at congested U.S. ports.
This month, the National Retail Federation said imports at major U.S. retail container ports are expected to be at near-record levels this spring and summer as consumer demand and supply chain challenges continue to spark congestion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate negotiators on Thursday were nearing a deal on a $10 billion COVID-19 bill to help the federal government acquire more vaccines and medical supplies as it prepares for future variants of the virus that upended American life.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said senators were ""close to a final agreement"" on a bill aiming to shore up stockpiles to be used both domestically and internationally.
If a deal is finalized in coming days, the Senate might be able to pass the bill and send it to the House of Representatives before the start of a spring recess at the end of next week.
""We need more money right away so we have enough vaccines and testing and life-saving therapeutics,"" Schumer said in a speech to the Senate.
The amount is a tiny fraction of the $4.6 trillion Congress has approved since early 2020 to fight the virus, much of which was devoted to offsetting its heavy economic hit.
Early this month, Congress failed to pass a $15.6 billion relief bill amid Republican opposition to new federal spending. Many Democrats, meanwhile, rebelled against taking back some money earmarked to help state and local governments in order to pay for the new round of coronavirus relief.
Schumer said a failure to adequately prepare for a possible new coronavirus variant could reverse progress in fighting the pandemic and reopening most American institutions.

Republican Senator Roy Blunt told reporters that nearly half of the financing for the bill would come from recapturing funding from previous COVID aid laws that were intended to help performing arts venues recover from being shuttered during long periods of the pandemic and for aid to aviation manufacturers. 
COVID-19 has caused 6.5 million deaths globally, with 980,000 in the United States alone. While the pandemic has been showing signs of easing, prompting many to shed the medical masks that had become part of daily life, U.S. deaths still lead the world with an average of 710 per day.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. banking regulator told banks on Thursday to be more vigilant about guarding against unlikely but extreme risk as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the surge in crypto trading has created a range of new of new financial threats. 
Michael Hsu, the acting comptroller of the currency, said depending on the outcome of the war in Ukraine, banks could face a number of ""tail risks,"" unlikely but extreme risk events.
He cited the potential spread of the conflict in Europe, Russian cyber attacks, and further surging inflation as risks banks need to stay on top of with internal scenario testing.

Hsu also flagged cryptocurrencies, particularly the use of crypto derivatives, as another area where banks need to be vigilant. As banks become increasingly involved in the space, they must grapple with unreliable price histories, he said. 
Hsu also said he was worried that banks may wrongly believe they have hedged the risk of certain crypto positions, when they have not. ""History is littered with examples of supposedly hedged positions blowing up,"" he said.

COLOMBO (Reuters) -Police imposed an overnight curfew in several parts of Sri Lanka's main city of Colombo early on Friday after protests over the government's handling of the country's worst economic crisis in decades turned violent, an official said.
Hundreds of protesters gathered near President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's private residence in a Colombo suburb late on Thursday and were broken up by police using tear gas and water cannons, a Reuters witness said.
Amal Edirimanne, a senior superintendent of police, said a curfew had been imposed in four police divisions of Colombo, the country's commercial capital.
Protesters, some clad in motorcycle helmets, dismantled a wall and hurled bricks at police, before setting a bus alight on a road leading to Gotabaya's residence, the Reuters witness said.
The island of 22 million people is experiencing rolling blackouts for up to 13 hours a day because the government does not have enough foreign exchange for fuel imports.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) will initiate discussions with Sri Lankan authorities on a possible loan programme in coming days, a spokesman said on Thursday, as the government looks for a way out of the crisis. 
The government is turning off street lights to save electricity, Power Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi told reporters, as a continuing shortage of diesel brought more power cuts and halted trading on the main stock market.
The power cuts add to the pain of Sri Lankans already dealing with shortages of essentials and rocketing prices.
Retail inflation hit 18.7% in March over the same period a year ago, the statistics department said on Thursday. Food inflation reached 30.2% in March, partly driven by a currency devaluation and last year's ban on chemical fertilisers that was later reversed.
Inflation was at its worst level in a over a decade, said Dimantha Mathew of First Capital Research.
A diesel shipment under a $500 million credit line from India was expected on Saturday, Wanniarachchi said, though she added that would not fix the issue.
""Once that arrives we will be able to reduce load shedding hours but until we receive rains, probably some time in May, power cuts will have to continue,"" she said.
""There's nothing else we can do.""
Water levels at reservoirs feeding hydro-electric projects had fallen to record lows, while demand had hit record highs during the hot, dry season, she said.
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) cut daily trading to two hours from the usual four-and-a-half because of the power cuts for the rest of this week at the request of brokers, the bourse said in a statement.

But shares slid after the market opened on Thursday and the CSE halted trading for 30 minutes - the third time in two days - after an index tracking leading companies dropped by more than 5%.
The crisis is a result of badly-timed tax cuts and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic coupled with historically weak government finances, leading to foreign exchange reserves dropping by 70% in the last two years.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's central bank board raised the benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points to 5% on Thursday, significantly lower than expected even amid continued increases in inflation.
The board was divided on how sharply to increase the rate, with five policymakers backing the 100-basis point increase and the remainder voting for a 150-basis point uptick.
The board also raised its economic growth projection for this year to 4.7%, from a previous 4.3%.
A majority of analysts in a Reuters poll last week - 13 of 16 - had estimated the seven-member board would raise borrowing costs by 150 basis points, with some later warning increases could reach as high as 200 basis points in order to control still-rising inflation.
Twelve-month inflation hit 8.01% in February, nearly three times the bank's long-term target rate of 3%, and the board pointed out in its statement on the decision that consumer price increases in food reached 23.3% last month.
""(The decision) is prudent given the current behavior of the economy, given the uncertainty we are seeing in the international scenario, and also that the need to improve employment remains,"" Finance Minister Jose Manuel Restrepo, who represents the government on the board, said in a press conference.
""It is a prudent decision to seek to control the increase in price expectations, but at the same time avoid that this decision could go against important achievements in terms of growth and job creation,"" he added.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine could intensify pressure on prices for some agricultural supplies, energy and oil, the statement added. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation”.
Central banks around the world are scrambling to control inflation stoked by global supply-chain issues, the COVID-19 pandemic and the invasion.

Some analysts expect the board will take the interest rate as high as 8% before the end of the year.
The board began rate hikes in September, after reaching a record low in borrowing costs of 1.75% amid the depths of the coronavirus pandemic.

Putin's decree on Thursday leaves Europe facing the prospect of losing more than a third of its gas supply. Germany, the most heavily reliant on Russia, has already activated an emergency plan that could lead to rationing in Europe's biggest economy.
Energy exports are Putin's most powerful lever as he tries to hit back against sweeping Western sanctions imposed on Russian banks, companies, businessmen and associates of the Kremlin in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Moscow calls its Ukraine action a ""special military operation"".
Putin said buyers of Russian gas ""must open rouble accounts in Russian banks. It is from these accounts that payments will be made for gas delivered starting from tomorrow,"" or April 1.
""If such payments are not made, we will consider this a default on the part of buyers, with all the ensuing consequences. Nobody sells us anything for free, and we are not going to do charity either - that is, existing contracts will be stopped,"" he said in televised remarks.
It was not immediately clear whether in practice there might be a way for foreign firms to continue payment without using roubles, which the European Union and G7 have ruled out.
Italy said it was in contact with its European partners to give a firm response to Russia, adding its own gas reserves would allow economic activity to continue even in the event of disruptions.
Meantime, Germany's energy firms said they were in close talks with Berlin about how to respond to possible supply disruptions and draw up a roadmap on what to do should Russia stop gas exports.
SEARCHING FOR ALTERNATIVES
Under the mechanism decreed by Putin, foreign buyers would use special accounts at Gazprombank to pay for the gas. Gazprombank would buy roubles on behalf of the gas buyer and transfer roubles to another account, the order said.
A source told Reuters that payments for gas delivered in April on some contracts started in the second half of April and May for others, suggesting the taps might not be turned off immediately.
Putin's decision to enforce rouble payments has boosted the Russian currency, which fell to historic lows after the Feb. 24 invasion. The rouble has since recovered much lost ground.
""What sounded grandiose has turned into a storm in a teacup. By making it the main recipient of money for gas, it puts an extra shield against sanctions around Gazprombank,"" said Jack Sharples of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.
Western companies and governments have rejected any move to change their gas supply contracts to another payment currency. Most European buyers use euros. Executives say it would take months or longer to renegotiate terms.
Payment in roubles would also blunt the impact of Western curbs on Moscow's access to its foreign exchange reserves. 
Meanwhile, European states have been racing to secure alternative supplies, but with the global market already tight, they have few options. The United States has offered more of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) but not enough to replace Russia.
""It is important for us not to give a signal that we will be blackmailed by Putin,"" Germany Economy Minister Robert Habeck said, adding that Russia had not been able to divide Europe. 
Payments would continue to be made in euros, Germany said.
French economy minister Bruno Le Maire said France and Germany were preparing for the possibility of Russian gas flows being halted. He declined to comment on technical details linked to latest Russian demands for rouble payment.
Putin said the switch to roubles would strengthen Russia's sovereignty. He said the West was using the financial system as a weapon, and it made no sense for Russia to trade in dollars and euros when assets in those currencies were being frozen.
""What is actually happening, what has already happened? We have supplied European consumers with our resources, in this case gas. They received it, paid us in euros, which they then froze themselves. In this regard, there is every reason to believe that we delivered part of the gas provided to Europe practically free of charge,"" he said.
""That, of course, cannot continue,"" Putin said, although he said Russia still valued its business reputation and would continue to meet obligations in its gas and other contracts.
STAYING UNITED
European gas prices have rocketed higher on mounting tension with Russia raising the risk of recession. Companies, including makers of steel and chemicals, have been forced to curtail production.
British and Dutch gas prices were up 4% to 5% after Putin's announcement.
European companies had little or no immediate comment on the Russian announcement or on their contracts with Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), which has a monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline. 
Poland's PGNiG said it remained in contact with Gazprom with which it has a long-term contract that expires at the end of this year, but it said it would not discuss details.
Italian energy firm Eni, another major European buyer of Russian gas, also had no comment. It bought around 22.5 bcm of Russian gas in 2020. Its contracts with Gazprom expire in 2035.

Danish energy firm Orsted (OTC:DOGEF), which has a long-term take-or-pay contract with Gazprom, said it was waiting to hear from the Russian firm and declined to comment further.
Uniper and EnBW's VNG, two major German buyers of Russian gas, declined to comment, while RWE did not immediately respond.

427,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 01:46PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -All foreign leased aircraft still in Russia after the termination of Western leasing contracts will remain in Russia, Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said on Thursday.
Sanctions imposed by Western powers in response to Russia's military campaign in Ukraine forced Western firms to terminate leasing contracts with Russian airlines for over 500 aircraft. Russia has said 78 of these planes were seized while abroad, meaning that well over 400 remain. 
""The entire fleet, meaning foreign aircraft, will remain in Russia,"" Borisov said on Russian television. ""Some were impounded(abroad) as sanctions were being introduced, (but) the vast majority of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (planes) remain in Russia.""
Moscow has passed a law allowing the aircraft, worth almost $10 billion, to be entered on its own register, in contravention of international rules.
Bermuda and Ireland, where most of the planes are registered, have suspended airworthiness certificates, which usually means they should be grounded.
Russian airlines have thus been hesitant to use the law, fearing that they might jeopardise ties with foreign partners. But Borisov said all the leased foreign aircraft had been entered into the Russian register. 
The sanctions also prevent Russian airlines buying aircraft parts or maintenance services from Europe or the United States, adding to the pressure on the world's 11th largest aviation market from a ban on using North American and European airspace.
President Vladimir Putin said he had instructed the government to work out measures to ease the burden of leasing payments on Russia's airlines.
""As for leasing payments, let me remind you that a significant part of them were supposed to be paid to companies from so-called unfriendly countries, and they violated their contractual obligations,"" Putin said in televised remarks after a meeting with representatives of airlines and airplane manufacturers.

He said Moscow would provide domestic airlines with 100 billion roubles ($1.25 billion) in support to help them deal with the consequences of the sanctions, and that domestic flights would receive government subsidies in 2022.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's inflation figures will have registered another increase in March, taking them to nearly triple the central bank's target rate and pressuring policymakers to further raise borrowing costs, a Reuters survey showed on Thursday.
According to the median estimate from 17 analysts, consumer prices will have increased 0.92% in March, compared to 0.51% in the same month last year and 1.63% in February.
Analysts estimates fluctuated between 0.71% and 1.10%.
If the median expectation is met, inflation will have accumulated 8.45% in the last 12 months, nearly three times the bank's target rate of 3%.
""We are predicting an inflation peak at a level of 8.5% for between March and April and from there inflation should fall,"" said Muni Jalil, head economist for the Andean region for BTG Pactual.
The government statistics agency will publish the figures on Tuesday.
Analysts estimates for inflation at the close of this year were up to 6.40%, from 5.50% in the previous survey at the end of February.
Expectations were also up for the end of next year, to 3.80% from 3.75% in the previous survey.

Those polled said inflation is likely to lead the central bank to increase borrowing costs to 5.50% on Thursday and to up to 8% by the end of this year.
Inflation is soaring in countries around the world, stoked by global supply-chain issues, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's month-old invasion of Ukraine. In Colombia increases in domestic consumption and the minimum wage are also pushing up prices.

429,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 12:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Demand for second homes in the U.S. is plummeting as mortgage rates climb steeply.
After a pandemic buying frenzy, mortgage-rate locks to buy second homes dropped last month to the lowest level since May 2020, according to a report by  Redfin  (NASDAQ:RDFN) Corp. While demand was still up 35% from February 2020, before Covid-19 hit the U.S., it was significantly lower than the previous month’s 87% jump, the brokerage said.   
Enthusiasm for vacation homes shot through the roof earlier in the pandemic as remote workers, untethered from the office, sought more sunshine and space. But escalating prices -- driven by fierce competition for a tight supply of listings -- and a recent surge in mortgage rates have slowed the boom.  
Those two factors “are hitting the second-home market much harder than the primary-home market,” said Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather. “That’s largely because vacation homes are optional. People don’t need a second home, but they do need a place to live.”
Vacation-home demand peaked in March 2021, Redfin said. That was two months after Freddie Mac’s average 30-year mortgage rate hit a record low of 2.65%. Borrowing costs have shot up since the end of last year, landing at 4.67% this week.
The rapid increase has pushed even some primary-home buyers to the sidelines at a time when inflation is hurting their budgets. The challenges are particularly tough for first-time buyers who have struggled to find affordable properties as bidding wars for the tightest supply of listings on record push prices out of reach. 
Contracts to buy previously owned homes declined for a fourth straight month in February as the inventory shortage restricted deals, the National Association of Realtors said last week. 
Would-be buyers of vacation homes face another potential obstacle: a fee increase ranging from an additional 1% to 4% on second-home loans backed by Fannie Mae or  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). That could tack on as much as $12,000 to a $300,000 mortgage, payable upfront or rolled into the loan.

While the increase officially doesn’t take effect until April 1, the fees have been priced into loans for almost a month, so that may have deterred some buyers already, according to Rebecca Richardson, a broker at Wyndham Capital Mortgage in Charlotte, North Carolina. The city is about a three-hour drive to both the mountains and the beach, making the area a popular vacation-home spot.
Combined with rising rates, the fee increase “has definitely dampened the enthusiasm” among her clients, Richardson said. “It’s becoming a much weightier decision versus last year.” 
That doesn’t mean the second-home boom is over, especially for people who can pay cash and whose remote-work plans have solidified.
“Still, people are buying up vacation homes more than they were before the pandemic, as work remains more flexible than it used to be,” Fairweather said.

""He is fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19, and has experienced mild symptoms,"" the agency said in a statement. 
Burns, 65, last saw President Joe Biden on Wednesday morning in a socially distanced meeting and was wearing an N-95 mask. Their encounter was not considered close contact.

The decision adds lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and manganese to a list of items covered by the 1950 Defense Production Act. It’s the same authority used by former presidents Donald Trump to spur mask production during the pandemic and Harry Truman to make steel for the Korean War.
This could help mining companies access $750 million under the Defense Production Act’s Title III fund. A senior administration official said industries supported by large-capacity batteries, including transportation and the power sectors, account for more than half of the U.S. carbon emissions.
The move also illustrates the tightrope President Joe Biden walks on this issue. On the one hand, climate-change activists, environmentalists and indigenous groups oppose many mining projects due to the impact on water supplies and nearby communities. On the other, the U.S. would need a colossal increase in domestic mining projects to begin providing even a fraction of the metals and materials that will be needed to supply the oncoming wave of electric vehicle production. 
“The clean energy transition cannot be built on dirty mining,”  Lauren Pagel, the policy director of the environmental group Earthworks, said in a statement. “Earthworks strongly opposes the employment of the Defense Production Act to bolster mining because it adds to the generational trauma experienced by mining affected communities, particularly Indigenous communities.”
Invoking the act provide key funding for existing operations, productivity and safety upgrades, and feasibility studies, but it won’t give the mining industry a tool it’s been clamoring for: an expedited process to dig ore out of the ground. Mining industry groups argue that it takes seven to 10 years to get a mine up and running in the U.S. That’s compared to about two to three years in neighboring Canada, according to the National Mining Association. 
Meanwhile, the Senate Energy Committee, whose chairman is West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, convened a hearing Thursday on producing critical materials domestically.
Manchin repeated his view that the reliance on foreign countries for materials needed for electric vehicles is a reason why he wants to give equal treatment to boosting hydrogen vehicles. He has also suggested using the Defense Production Act to accelerate final approval of a natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia.
Manchin and Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski have both backed using the act to boost production of these materials in hallway interviews with reporters at the Capitol this week.
Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp., which runs a project in Nevada, rose 4.5% on Thursday, while shares of MP Materials Corp.,, the sole U.S. company that produces rare earth metals needed for electric vehicles, rose 3.4% in New York trading.

433,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 12:43PM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - Russia accused Ukraine on Thursday of laying hundreds of mines near its coast and said some were drifting into open waters of the Black Sea and creating dangers for merchant shipping, a day after Kyiv said Moscow was responsible for planting mines.
The Black Sea is a major shipping route for grain, oil and oil products. Its waters are shared by Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia and Turkey as well as Ukraine and Russia, which have been at war since President Vladimir Putin invaded his southern neighbour on Feb. 24.
Ukraine's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that Russia was planting naval mines in the Black Sea as ""uncontrolled drifting ammunition"", turning them ""into a de facto weapon of indiscriminate action"".
Russia's defence ministry said on Thursday that from Feb. 24 to March 4, the remnants of the Ukrainian navy's mine-sweeping forces had placed about 420 sea anchor mines - 370 in the Black Sea and 50 in the Sea of Azov.
""As a result of storms in the Black Sea and due to unsatisfactory technical condition, cables with bottom anchors broke on about 10 Ukrainian mines,"" the defence ministry said. 
""Since then, under the influence of wind and surface currents, Ukrainian mines have drifted freely in the western part of the Black Sea in a southerly direction ... No one can know where the remaining Ukrainian mines are drifting today.""
Russia said Ukraine had ""created a direct mine threat to transport and cargo ships of all Black Sea countries"". Ukrainian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this month Russia's main intelligence agency accused Ukraine of laying mines to protect ports and said several hundred of the explosives had broken from cables and drifted away. Kyiv dismissed that account as disinformation. 
In recent days Turkish and Romanian military diving teams have been involved in defusing stray mines around their waters.
Turkey's defence ministry said it had not yet identified the source and number of drifting mines and had been in contact with Ukrainian and Russian counterparts over the issue. 
Tayfun Ozberk, a former senior officer with Turkey's navy, told Reuters it was difficult to determine reliable information on the mines which were being used by both Russia and Ukraine. 
""Considering that it has been under a blockade for about two months, it seems very unlikely that Ukraine has recently laid mines,"" Ozberk said.
""In order for there to be 420 free floating mines, Ukraine must have laid 2,000-2,500 mines here. Because every mine you lay does not break, either. Therefore, the possibility that Ukraine may have just mined this area does not make much sense to me.""
Ozberk said it was unlikely for even old mines to break away from their thick chains in large numbers.
Yoruk Isik, Istanbul-based geopolitical analyst and head of the Bosphorus Observer consultancy, said if the mines threat got bigger it could require an international response including help from Spanish, Italian, French and Greek vessels. 

London's marine insurance market has widened the area of waters it considers high risk in the region and insurance costs have soared.
Five merchant vessels have been hit by projectiles - with one of them sunk - off Ukraine's coast, with two seafarers killed, shipping officials say.

434,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 12:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. President Joe Biden wants oil drillers to pay penalties when federal leases go unused in an effort to prod the industry into pumping more.
The White House will call on Congress to “make companies pay fees on wells from their leases that they haven’t used in years and on acres of public lands that they are hoarding without producing,” the administration said in a statement on Thursday. “Companies that are producing from their leased acres and existing wells will not face higher fees.”
The proposal threatens to widen the gap between Biden and oil explorers who say his administration’s anti-fossil fuel agenda is partly responsibly for chilling investment in new oil wells. The White House has pushed back, saying the companies are plowing the windfall from $100-a-barrel crude into shareholder dividends and buybacks rather than new drilling that would help tamp down sky-high gasoline prices. 
U.S. oilfields are pumping about 11.7 million barrels a day, about 10% lower than they were prior to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, despite the doubling in domestic crude prices since the beginning of 2021. 
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has faulted oil producers for sitting on 9,000 approved-but-unused permits on leased federal lands. The industry’s defense is not every tract is a viable drilling target and that other White House moves like canceling the Keystone XL pipeline have made executives and investors wary about putting money at risk in new projects.

435,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 12:26PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Consumer inflation in Russia in 2022 is expected to accelerate to its highest since 1999, while the economy will stage its deepest contraction since 2009 as a result of sweeping Western sanctions, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
Economic expectations have deteriorated drastically in the past few weeks as Russia took a hit from unprecedented Western sanctions designed to punish Moscow for what it calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine, which started on Feb. 24.
The average of 15 analysts polled in late March suggested the Bank of Russia will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 20% at the April 29 board meeting after an emergency rate hike in late February.
The central bank is expected to lower the key rate to 16% by year-end, keeping rates high to help tame soaring consumer inflation, which dents living standards.
In 2022, inflation is expected to accelerate to 23.7%, the poll showed, far above Russia's 4% target. A similar poll in late January predicted 2022 inflation at 5.5%.
Reuters suspended its February poll on Russia's main economic indicators due to uncertainty about the economic outlook.
The economy is on track to shrink by 7.3% this year, the poll showed, marking a shift in market expectations for 2.5% growth in the January poll.
""Russia plunged into economic and financial turmoil this month,"" Capital Economics said, predicting a deeper 12% economic contraction this year.
Rouble volatility also adds to inflation risks and financial turmoil. The Russian currency hit an all-time low of 120 to the U.S. dollar in Moscow trade on March 10 before recovering to around 83.50 on Thursday.

""We expect the rouble to anchor within a range of 80-85 to the dollar in April... The geopolitical situation will remain the factor of uncertainty for the rouble exchange rate,"" said Mikhail Vasilyev, chief analyst at Sovcombank.
The poll suggested the rouble will trade at 97.50 to the dollar 12 months from now.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending barely rose in February as an increase in spending on services was offset by declining purchases of motor vehicles and other goods, while price pressures mounted, with annual inflation surging by the most since the early 1980s.
But the report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed spending in January was much stronger than initially estimated. That put consumer spending on track for solid growth this quarter, which would keep the economy expanding, despite the rising headwinds from inflation that is driven by shortages.
""Despite sagging confidence due to the war (in Ukraine) and inflation, American consumers are hanging tough, undergirded by strong employment growth and built-up savings,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.2% last month. Data for January was revised higher to show outlays rebounding 2.7% instead of 2.1% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.5%.
A significant decline in COVID-19 infections boosted demand for services like dining out, hotel stays, recreation, air travel and healthcare. Services increased 0.9%, the most in seven months, after rising 0.7% in January. But spending on goods dropped 1.0% after surging 6.5% in the prior month. 
The decline in goods purchases, which likely signals the rotation of spending back to services, was led by a tumble in motor vehicles. Consumers also cut back spending on food, household furnishings, recreational goods as well as clothing. Spending on gasoline increased at a $27.1 billion rate. 
Gasoline prices soared in February and broke above $4 per gallon this month following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Prices have dramatically increased across the board. 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.4% after climbing 0.5% in January. The so-called core PCE price index jumped 5.4% year-on-year in February, the biggest gain since April 1983. The core PCE price index increased 5.2% in the 12 months through January. 
The Federal Reserve this month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years, and adopted a hawkish posture as it battles inflation.
Though inflation is eating into households' budgets, consumers are getting some cushioning from massive savings accumulated during the pandemic as well as rising wages amid a shortage of workers. Economists estimate consumers are sitting on about $2.3 trillion in excess savings.
""We expect a decent chunk of it is at the disposable of households should they wish to rely on it,"" said Shannon Seery, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
STRONG WAGE GAINS
Personal income rose 0.5% in February, with wages shooting up 0.8%. The saving rate climbed to 6.3% from 6.1% in January.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0.4%. Data for January was revised higher to show the so-called real consumer spending surging 2.1% instead of 1.5% as previously reported. Real consumer spending is what matters in the calculation of gross domestic product.
""A combination of downward revisions to last year's data and an upward revision to January's gain means that real consumption is on track for a solid 4.0% annualized gain in the first quarter,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.
Growth estimates for the first quarter range from as low as a 0.4% annualized rate to as high as a 2.8% pace. The economy grew at a 6.9% pace in the fourth quarter.
The scarcity of workers is keeping layoffs very low. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 202,000 for the week ended March 26. Still, claims remained well below their pre-pandemic average.
They have declined from an all-time high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. There were a near record 11.3 million job openings on the last day of February, government data showed on Tuesday, which left the jobs-workers gap at 3.0% of the labor force and close to the post-war high of 3.2% in December.
More workers likely returned to the labor force in March. The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 35,000 to 1.307 million during the week ended March 19, the lowest since December 1969.
""The labor market remains in excellent shape in the first quarter,"" said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic advisor at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
A third report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, showed U.S.-based employers announced 21,387 job cuts in March, which was up 40.3% from February but down 30% compared to last year. Employers also announced plans to hire 
105,224 workers this month. 

The government's closely watched employment report on Friday is likely to show that nonfarm payrolls increased by 490,000 jobs in March, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The economy created 678,000 jobs in February. 
The unemployment rate is forecast falling a to a fresh two-year low of 3.7% from 3.8% in February.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund and Argentine government have been ""clear-eyed"" about the exceptionally high risks facing the Argentine economy and a new $44 billion IMF program approved Friday, IMF spokesperson Gerry Rice said on Thursday. 
Rice told reporters Argentina's economy was recovering more strongly than expected after three years of recession and persistent high inflation, but it was also subject to the global shock caused by the war in Ukraine, and its economic and social situation was fragile.
""So, it's no surprise that the risks to the Argentine economy, and therefore to the program, are high,"" he said, adding that the IMF would work closely with Argentine authorities to ensure successful implementation of the program.
The executive board of the IMF last week approved a new $44 billion financing program, but said that it comes with ""exceptionally high"" risks.
It marks the 22nd IMF program for Argentina and comes after more than a year of negotiations. It replaces a failed $57 billion program from 2018, for which Argentina still owes over $40 billion.
Rice said the IMF's board approved the new program because it set realistic and pragmatic objectives, along with credible policies, that would strengthen Argentina's macroeconomic stability and begin tackling its deep-seated challenges.
Implementation would now be key, he said.
""Paraphrasing Winston Churchill, we're at the end of the beginning of this process,"" Rice said. ""Now it's all about implementation so that those objectives ... can be achieved.""

While it saw the high risks involved, the IMF was committed to working closely with Argentine authorities to ensure successful implementation of the program, Rice said.
""It's in our shared interest to have a program that can be owned and ... successfully implemented by the Argentine authorities,"" he said.

Rice said the discussions would continue during the visit of Sri Lankan Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa in Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank next month. 
A 70% drop in foreign exchange reserves since January 2020 has left Sri Lanka struggling to pay for essential imports, including food and fuel, leading to growing unrest and even military deployments at gasoline stations.
""The Sri Lankan authorities have expressed interest in an IMF-supported financial program,"" Rice told a regular IMF briefing. ""We plan to initiate those program discussions with the Sri Lankan authorities ... pretty much in the coming days.""
Rice said the IMF would update its forecast for Sri Lanka when it releases its new World Economic Outlook next month, but gave no further details.

He confirmed that Rajapaksa would visit Washington next month for talks with IMF officials, as reported by Reuters last week.
Sri Lanka - which must pay about $4 billion in debt this year - will also seek World Bank assistance after it enters into an IMF program, Reuters reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter.

PRAGUE (Reuters) -The Czech National Bank lifted its benchmark rate by 50 basis points to its highest level since 2001 on Thursday and said it was ready to tighten policy further to keep inflation expectations anchored while the war in Ukraine pushed prices higher. 
The central bank board voted 5-2 to raise the two-week repo rate to 5.00%, with two policymakers opting to keep rates steady. It has raised that rate by 475 basis points since last June in one of the most aggressive tightening campaigns.
Czech inflation hit a more than two-decade high of 11.1% in February on the back of strong consumer demand, rising wages growth and rising costs of inputs for companies.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine added to the price pressures by driving up energy and commodity prices, while also prompting downward revisions to growth forecasts.
Governor Jiri Rusnok said the conflict would roughly halve this year's economic growth from earlier forecast 3.0%.
He also said the board was ready to keep raising interest rates to prevent inflation expectations from straying from the bank's 2% target in the longer term.
He said policymakers discussed a bigger hike but the majority settled for the 50 basis point move.
""We will adjust if needed, if new data shows this,"" Rusnok said.
The central bank anticipated a ""noticeable"" increase in inflation in the coming months, and Rusnok said restoring price stability was now CNB's ""absolute priority"".
Since the central bank's intervention early this month to counter the crown's slide, Rusnok has raised an option of using currency reserves not just as a tool to smooth out exchange rate swings but also to help fight inflation. 

Some central bankers have been hesitant about reverting to such a tool and Rusnok said on Thursday a debate on such option would continue, but no decisions have been made.
The crown has steadied since hitting a 10-month low in early March, and it traded up 0.25% on the day at 24.385 to the euro on Thursday, a swing of over 6% from March lows and around levels seen before the conflict started.

Economists at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) are among those now forecasting the U.S. central bank will boost its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points when policy makers convene in May and June, before they then return to 25 basis-point moves at the four subsequent meetings. 
Counterparts at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). expect jumbo hikes to be delivered at four straight policy meetings before they slow to quarter-point moves.
Powell and his colleagues will boost borrowing costs at each of the six remaining meetings through year-end, in the view of almost all major banks. The Fed raised its key rate from around zero to 0.25% to 0.5% this month in the first upward shift since 2018. It hasn’t delivered a half-point tightening salvo since 2000.
The latest forecasts mark a big turnaround since the end of January, when most banks were projecting hikes no bigger than 25 basis points and were divided over whether the Fed would take a pause in tightening at some point this year.
What’s changed is inflation continues to show signs of sticking around its highest level in four decades, and perhaps even accelerating further after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent commodity prices soaring. Powell also said last week that officials are prepared to raise rates by a half percentage-point at their May meeting if needed.
As to when the Fed will end its campaign, economists agree it won’t be until next year. But they are split over where the key rate will peak. Morgan Stanley says 3%, but Citigroup reckons 3.75%. Again, such levels are mostly higher than previously anticipated. 
“The Fed has accepted that it’s behind the curve and will be emboldened by the resilience of the economy and the financial markets,” Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., told clients in a report. “The remaining question is whether it will be willing to impose serious pain on the economy to rein in inflation.”
What Bloomberg Economists Say
“The Fed hikes at every meeting for the rest of 2022, with one 50 basis point move,” taking the benchmark to a 2% to 2.25% range by year-end, with a further percentage point of tightening in 2023.

(Reuters) - The United States is unlikely to face an economic recession in the next two years despite bond markets flashing warning signs, inflation at its highest in decades and rising geopolitical risks, portfolio managers at PIMCO and Amundi said.
A closely monitored part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve briefly inverted on Tuesday, a sign that investors were concerned the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes to tame inflation could tip the economy into recession.
""We see low probability of a recession this year or next. Our models show the risk is slightly higher than the historical average, but not at a level that is concerning,"" Erin Browne, multi-asset portfolio manager at bond giant PIMCO, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Wednesday.
Browne's view was echoed by Ken Monaghan, co-head of high yield at the U.S. arm of Europe's largest asset manager Amundi, who told the forum he does not expect a recession in 2022 and reckons it is unlikely in 2023 despite some elevated risks.
The last time this part of the yield curve, which compares yields on two-year Treasury with 10-year notes, inverted was in 2019 and the following year, the United States entered a recession - albeit one caused by the global pandemic.
Stocks, however, shrugged off the ominous sign earlier this week, with the S&P 500 closing up 1.2% on the day the curve inverted momentarily.

""I am not dismissing that a recession is possible. However, if we look at the fundamentals of the high-yield (bond) market and at the savings that the consumer - especially in the U.S. - has socked away ... we don't see a recession in the near-term,"" said Monaghan.
The portfolio manager cited low default rates on junk bonds and signs that investors were staying put despite the risks for his optimism.
Aided by the pandemic, U.S. household wealth rose to a record $150.3 trillion in the final quarter of last year, a financial cushion that may keep consumers spending and limit the economic damage from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Browne said PIMCO, which manages about $2.2 trillion in assets, is currently ""keeping powder dry"" as markets digest multiple risk factors. The money manager prefers equities - particularly U.S. large-cap stocks - over high-yield (HY) corporate credit, she said.
She also likes investment-grade company debt relative to rates, given widening spreads over Treasuries, and is cautious on longer-dated U.S. bonds until inflation expectations are clearer.

While Browne expects further yield curve inversions, she thinks its reliability as a recession indicator has decreased, particularly as the U.S. Federal Reserve's massive bond-buying purchases are keeping long-dated yields suppressed.
""Arguably we would not be experiencing the same flatness of the curve without quantitative easing,"" said Browne, adding that the ""real"" or inflation-adjusted yield curve was a better indicator of growth risks.

(Reuters) - In mid-March, U.S. central bankers raised interest rates for the first time since 2018 and published projections signaling a far more aggressive posture toward too-high inflation. 
Since emerging from their meeting-period blackout, their public commentary has taken if anything an even stronger tone. The two-week-old forecasts - with the median anticipating rates rising to about 1.9% by year's end - seem a dovish shadow of what might now be.
The palpable shift in officials' attitudes over a remarkably short period may prove highly consequential for how the remainder of the year plays out for their policymaking. 
Futures traders are now pricing in expectations officials will follow their quarter-point interest rate increase on March 16 with bigger half-point hikes in May and June, and by year-end lift the Fed's policy rate to the 2.5%-2.75% range. Economists are similarly marking up their views.
""We expect the Fed to use the popularity of inflation fighting among the public and politicians to frontload policy rate hikes,"" wrote Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank's Steve Englander. ""The lack of pushback even from relatively dovish FOMC participants points to FOMC consensus."" 
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari is a case in point. Just six months ago he believed there would be no need to raise rates at all this year because inflation would decline on its own: a receding pandemic would bring more workers back to the labor market, easing wage pressures, and supply chains would get unsnarled, allowing producers to meet demand. 
He's since abandoned those hopes, at least for the near term, and, though he still warned last week against ""overdoing it"" on rate hikes, he now wants to get rates up another 1.5 percentage points by year end, in line with that two-week old median view.
Chicago Fed chief Charles Evans and San Francisco Fed chief Mary Daly - who with Kashkari, Fed Governor Lael Brainard and New York Fed President John Williams had anchored the wing of policymakers more tolerant of a looser policy stance - have also laid out less dovish views in recent days, though neither appears to have shifted as far as Kashkari.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic also penciled more rate increases than previously, but his concern over uncertainty arising from the war in Ukraine left his rate forecast below the median of his colleagues.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who jumpstarted the speculation for faster rate hikes with his call last week for rates to rise ""expeditiously,"" has said he's hopeful that the labor market is strong enough to withstand the coming policy tightening, which will also include shrinking the Fed's balance sheet. 
Job openings hovered near record highs in February, data this week showed, and economists expect the Labor Department on Friday will report nearly half a million new jobs were created this month. Inflation by the Fed's preferred measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, rose to 6.4% in February, data on Thursday showed, the highest in four decades and more than three times the Fed's 2% target.
If rising rates can trim some of that excess demand for labor without biting sharply into growth, and easing supply chain constraints help bring inflation down, the Fed may be able to achieve the gentle glide to a slower but more sustainable level of growth that Powell seeks.
A closely watched part of the Treasury yield curve briefly inverted on Tuesday in what some on Wall Street see as a harbinger of a recession.

And even as she rejected the predictive power of that market move, Kansas City Fed President Esther George - one of Powell's more hawkish colleagues - warned that sharper and less politically palatable rate hikes may yet be needed to bring inflation under control.
""A soft landing is possible but not guaranteed,"" George said Wednesday. ""In the event high inflation persists while demand turns down, and the labor market falters, policymaker resolve could be tested.""

ROYDON, England (Reuters) - In a small corner of south-east England, vast glasshouses stand empty, the soaring cost of energy preventing their owner from using heat to grow cucumbers for the British market.
Elsewhere in the country growers have also failed to plant peppers, aubergines and tomatoes after a surge in natural gas prices late last year was exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, making the crops economically unviable. 
The hit to UK farms, which need gas to counter the country's inclement weather, is one of the myriad ways the energy crisis and invasion have hit food supplies around the world, with global grain production and edible oils also under threat.
In Britain it is likely to push food prices higher at a time of historic inflation, and threaten the availability of goods such as the quintessentially British cucumber sandwich served at the Wimbledon tennis tournament and big London hotels.
While last year it cost about 25 pence to produce a cucumber in Britain, that has now doubled and is set to hit 70 pence when higher energy prices fully kick in, trade body British Growers says.
Regular sized cucumbers were selling for as little as 43 pence at Britain's biggest supermarket chains on Tuesday.
""Gas prices being so sky high, it's a worrying time,"" grower Tony Montalbano told Reuters, while standing in an empty glasshouse at Roydon in the Lea Valley where for 54 years three generations of his family have farmed cucumbers.
""All the years of us working hard to get to where we are, and then one year it could just all finish,"" he said.
All 30,000 square metres of glasshouse at his Green Acre Salads business, which supplies supermarket groups including market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's and Morrisons, are currently empty.
Montalbano, whose grandfather emigrated from Sicily in 1968 and started a nursery to provide local stores with fresh cucumbers, decided not to plant the first of the year's three cycles in January.
SOARING COSTS
Last year he paid 40-50 pence a therm for natural gas. Last week it was 2.25 pounds a therm, having briefly hit a record 8 pounds in the wake of Russia's invasion. 
Fertiliser prices have tripled versus last year, while the cost of carbon dioxide - used both to aid growing and in packaging - and hard-to-attain labour have also shot up.
""We are now in an unprecedented situation where the cost increases have far outstripped a grower's ability to do anything about them,"" said Jack Ward, head of British Growers.
It means a massive contraction for the industry, threatening Britain's future food security, and further price rises for UK consumers already facing a bigger inflation hit than other countries in Europe following Brexit.
UK inflation hit a 30-year high of 6.2% in February and is forecast to approach 9% in late 2022, contributing to the biggest fall in living standards since at least the 1950s.
The National Farmers' Union says the UK is sleepwalking into a food security crisis. It warns that UK production of peppers could fall from 100 million last year to 50 million this year, with cucumbers down from 80 million to 35 million.
In winter, the UK has typically imported around 90% of crops like cucumbers and tomatoes, but has been nearly self-sufficient in the summer. 
The Lea Valley Growers Association, whose members produce about three-quarters of Britain's cucumber and sweet pepper crop, said about 90% did not plant in January, while half have still not planted and will not plant if gas prices remain high.
""There's definitely going to be a lack of British produce in the supermarkets,"" association secretary Lee Stiles said. ""Whether there's a lack of produce overall depends on where and how far away the retailers are prepared to source it from.""
Growers in the Netherlands, one of Britain's key salad suppliers, face similar challenges and have reduced exports. 
Spain and Morocco do not heat their glasshouses to a large extent, but delivery to the UK in chilled lorries adds time and cost.
Joe Shepherdson of the UK's Cucumber Growers Association said those growers that have planted are using less heat, but that reduces production and increases the risk of disease.
PRESSURE ON PRICES 
Britain's biggest supermarket groups, including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY), acknowledge the pressures in the market but say they are confident about supply, stressing their long-term partnerships with growers.
How far the increase in production costs will translate to higher prices on the shelf depends largely on whether supermarkets opt to absorb the difference themselves, or pass it on to consumers.
Smaller retailers buying from the market may struggle.
""Any cut in production from suppliers would undoubtedly put further pressure on prices,"" said Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at retail industry lobby group the British Retail Consortium.
Growers want help from the government. They have lobbied for tax and levies on gas to be removed, but finance minister Rishi Sunak did not mention it in his spring budget last week.
Despite the dismal backdrop and after much soul-searching, Montalbano will plant a crop next month, fearing the loss of future contracts if he does not. He may gamble on the British weather, and grow his plants ""cold"", with little or no heat.

""I feel like I have no choice, because if I don't, then I lose my place,"" he said, in a glasshouse that in a normal March would be packed with bushy green cucumber plants.
""Am I going to make anything out of it? I'll be quite happy to break even this year,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's finance ministry flagged several reforms on Thursday and defended regulators from criticism they are too slow to license firms, saying flawed applicants must not get through.
The ministry and regulators face pressure to make financial rules more flexible to keep London globally competitive after Britain's departure from the European Union.
The Financial Conduct Authority has been criticised for being slow in authorising crypto firms as it grapples with an internal revamp and pay structure that has disillusioned some staff.
Financial services minister John Glen said he has a ""very high regard"" for the leadership at the FCA and its counterpart at the Bank of England, and that some people criticised regulators just because they don't get what they want.
Glen said he was aware of frustration over licensing waiting times and has told FCA CEO Nikhil Rathi that the complexity of new types of financial firms like crypto means that some thought needs to be given to being more responsive.
Some applicants, however, had no experience of dealing with regulators and needed to recognise they must adhere to high standards, he said.
""Just not responding quickly to a request isn't necessarily a bad thing if there are underlying flaws in the business model of an applicant,"" Glen told a House of Lords committee.
""We should not be looking to be nimble at all costs.""
He faces pressure to use ""freedoms"" from Brexit and has been been considering rules for sectors like cryptoassets.
Glen said he may comment further next week on crypto, and a consultation paper is due after Easter on reform of the so-called matching adjustment in insurance solvency rules.
Legislation on a new framework for writing financial rules could be brought to parliament imminently, Glen said, which would help regulators respond faster to market changes.
But having a primary, rather than secondary objective for regulators to consider any impact of a proposed rule on the competitiveness of the industry was a ""non-starter"", he added.

A change in rules could allow for the growth in Britain of ""captives"" or licensed in-house insurers set up by corporates looking to cut costs through self-insurance, he said.
""It's ripe for further work to be done. I hope that we would see that evolution in the way insurance and reinsurance is offered to big corporates,"" Glen said.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) -Dutch lawmakers demanded of Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government on Thursday that it speed up the implementation of sanctions against Russia, saying the Netherlands was ""shamefully behind"" other countries in freezing targeted assets.
The debate came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to the Dutch parliament by video link earlier on Thursday, the first time a foreign head of state has addressed the 150-member Dutch lower house, with Rutte and the chairman of the Senate also attending.
""Stronger sanctions are needed so that Russia doesn't have a chance to pursue this war further in Europe,"" Zelenskiy said, adding that the Dutch should stop energy imports from Russia, which make up around 20% of the country's natural gas supply.
Zelenskiy received a standing ovation, but discussions then turned to the government's lack of progress in freezing or seizing much of an estimated 27 billion euros ($30 billion) in Russian assets registered in the Netherlands, often in shell companies.
Sanctions were ""agreed weeks ago and the Netherlands is shamefully behind,"" said opposition Labour Party leader Lilianne Ploumen, who submitted a motion asking Rutte's coalition government to urgently target the assets.
Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra responded that the government was working as quickly as it could, but legal hurdles and privacy laws were hindering progress.
Rutte told parliament on March 23 that assets linked to sanctioned Russian entities seized so far -- 392 million euros ($431.24 million) worth -- included only bank assets and not property or real estate.
His government promised to update parliament on progress on implementing sanctions later on Thursday.
In Zelenskiy's address he also thanked the Dutch for military support to date and as hosts of several international courts in The Hague, including the International Criminal Court that is investigating possible war crimes in Ukraine.

The Netherlands has supplied Ukrainian forces with anti-tank rockets and is also supporting NATO's increased presence along the military alliance's eastern flank with Patriot air defence systems. 
""Those who gave the orders (to bombard and shell Ukraine) must be called to account. In The Hague, city of tribunals, people know that,"" Zelenskiy said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Battered euro zone bonds recovered ground on Thursday, but were set to end March with one of their biggest selloffs in years as rising inflation and rate-hike risks left German Bund yields on track for their biggest monthly jump since 2009.
Most 10-year yields across the single currency bloc fell 6-8 basis points, a day after high German and Spanish inflation prints triggered fresh selling. 
Data on Thursday showed inflation in Italy hit 7% while prices in France were up 5.1%, but a more than 5% fall in oil prices brought some comfort to bond investors.
Surging inflation, which has raised expectations that the European Central Bank may have to hike interest rates sooner rather than later, and a more aggressive stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve have sent bond markets reeling.
Germany's 10-year Bund yield, down eight basis points (bps) at 0.57%, is up 42 bps in March and set to end the month with the biggest monthly surge since 2009. If yields rise much further they would be on track for the biggest move since 1996. 
Two-year German yields, trading just under 0%, have jumped around 45 bps this month - poised for their biggest monthly rise since 2011.
Dutch and French 10-year bond yields were set for their biggest monthly rises since 2012 and 2011 respectively, with monthly rises over 40 bps each.
""This is very significant,"" said ING senior rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. ""A move of this magnitude will have investors reassess the riskiness of their bonds portfolio and have market participants who thought their rates risk was negligible until now hedge it.""
Euro zone inflation is increasingly likely to stabilise around 2% but the ECB should be ready to change course if the outlook deteriorates due to Russia's war in Ukraine, ECB chief economist Philip Lane said.
""The ECB has relatively high inflation, but actually, inflation's undershot for a long period of time and the (euro zone) economy is not overheating to the same extent (as the U.S),"" said Andrew Sheets, chief cross-asset strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""There's also more flexibility at the ECB and I think the ECB would like to take rates to zero and get ahead of negative rate policy."" The ECB's deposit rate is at -0.50%. 

Yield surges in euro area bond tracked similar milestones in other major debt markets. 
U.S. 2-year Treasury yields are up around 85 bps in March, set for their biggest monthly increase since 1989, according to Refinitiv data. They are up 155 bps this quarter, on track for the biggest quarterly jump since 1984.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Raising the drawbridge has been a response to war and pestilence throughout human history, and the tumultuous winter of 2022 has similarly led trading nations to turn inward - though talk that the era of globalisation may be winding down seems premature.
The damage to international commerce stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the still unvanquished COVID-19 pandemic has made governments and companies more aware they need more resilient supply chains - even if that costs them more.
And as reliance on the mechanisms that drive the world economy gets called into question amid a scramble for resources, prominent voices - including asset management giant Blackrock (NYSE:BLK)'s head Larry Fink - have warned of an end to globalisation.
The World Trade Organization, meanwhile, senses at least a slowdown.
It is likely in coming weeks to halve its current 4.7% forecast for global trade growth this year, a Geneva trade official said. 
For its Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the best remedy for the twin shocks of war and COVID is to double down on trade.
""This is not the time to retreat inward,"" she told WTO members this week. ""This is the time to stress the importance of multilateralism, global solidarity and cooperation.""
She said supply resilience was best served by a deeper and more diverse international market, rather than by concentrating sourcing and production at home, which brought its own risks.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and western sanctions imposed on Moscow have already led to national curbs on food supplies as grain exports from the region dwindle.
The Global Trade Alert database of government policies on international commerce says this year has witnessed the most policy changes hitting essential goods since the outbreak of COVID-19, when medical supplies were limited, with 18 countries setting up export controls on food and fertilizers.
It says 49 controls have been put in place on the two products, 31 of them in the month since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with only two since removed.
EYES ON CHINA
Longer term, policymakers are waiting on China, which could fragment the world economy by choosing to align itself closely with Russia.
Addressing that concern, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the situation, along with sharp commodity price swings, was even more challenging than the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2007-09.
""I think it is important that... we make clear that we are not abandoning our commitment to an open world economy,"" he told an event on Monday.
China has opposed the sanctions against Russia and said it will maintain normal economic relations with Moscow.
Their bilateral trade has surged, although those figures are dwarfed by Chinese trade with the rest of the world.
Analysts say China could offset some of its neighbour's pain by buying more from Russia, but it would be wary of falling foul of sanctions itself. Behind the scenes, Beijing is pressing companies to tread carefully with investments in Russia.
Still, Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Beijing's Renmin University, said the Ukraine crisis had exposed Europe's reliance on Russian energy and would increase its concern about dependence on China.
""The Ukraine-Russia conflict has highlighted the risks of globalisation and accelerated a trend of deglobalisation,"" he said.
The world economy was moving more towards regionalisation, he said, citing the 15-member Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade pact as an example.
In his letter to shareholders a week ago, Blackrock's Fink was more blunt, declaring an end to three decades of globalisation. Companies were re-analysing their manufacturing footprints, something that COVID had already spurred them to do.
""And while dependence on Russian energy is in the spotlight, companies and governments will also be looking more broadly at their dependencies on other nations,"" Fink said.
Patrick Harker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said constant waves of COVID hitting supply chains had prompted a concerted effort to build a more resilient network, but this insurance would come at a cost.
As a reminder that the pandemic is not over, China's ""zero-COVID"" approach has left Shanghai, the country's most populous city and the world's largest container port, in lockdown. 
Former WTO chief Pascal Lamy said that, rather than deglobalisation, the world seemed set for a period of ""slow-balisation"". 

Services trade in particular should keep transfers across national borders growing, but there was likely to be some reshoring of goods, albeit limited.
""COVID and to some extent Ukraine have told us that we have to factor in more risks,"" he told Reuters. ""Offshoring happened because it was more efficient. Reshoring happens because fragilities that were not priced in have appeared.... It is limited by the fact that it is costly and that consumers will have to pay this extra price.""

High energy prices are sapping consumer spending power and business confidence is also taking a nose dive due to Russia's war in Ukraine, exacerbating supply-chain issues that held back industrial production.
""My impression is that growth in the first quarter of this year... will be slightly positive, we’ll have very low growth,"" de Guindos told a forum in Amsterdam. ""In the second quarter of the year, my impression is that growth will be hovering (around) zero.""
He added that some rebound in the second half was likely and stagflation, a phenomenon associated with high inflation and stagnating growth, was unlikely for now. 
De Guindos added that inflation was likely to keep rising over the coming months and peak around mid-year.

""I think inflation will continue rising over the next months but we expect that inflation will start to decline in the second half of the year and I hope the peak will be reached in three-four months (from now),"" de Guindos said. 
March inflation data, due on Friday, is expected to show a record high reading above 7%, well in excess of the ECB's 2% target.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Inflation continued to surge across Europe's biggest economies this month while growth took a hit, leaving households poorer as they picked up the bill for soaring energy costs in the wake of Russia's shock invasion of Ukraine.
Price growth hit multi-decade highs in Italy, France, Germany and Spain in March, intensifying a policy dilemma for the European Central Bank, which needs to fight the price surge but must also avoid choking off already fading growth.
Inflation in Italy hit 7% while prices in France were up 5.1%, driven by soaring fuel and natural gas prices that typically impact poorer households more than others.
The data, along with sky-high readings from Germany and Spain a day earlier, suggest that Friday's euro zone reading will be well above 7%, with three to four months still left before a likely peak, according to the ECB. 
While most of the surge is due to energy prices, Europe's labour market is also tighter than it has been for decades, suggesting that underlying price pressures are also starting to build and that wages will follow sooner or later.
Euro zone unemployment fell to a record low 6.8% in February, separate data showed on Thursday, and a further drop is projected by the ECB.
The conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which are both major grains producers, is also likely to push up prices of some staple foods. 
""Given the rise in inflation is almost exclusively driven by the supply side, the higher inflation gets, the weaker economic growth will be,"" ABN Amro analysts said in a note to clients.
""Indeed, economic growth is likely to disappoint ECB projections,"" they added. ""The ECB will probably balance these forces by tightening policy modestly.""
ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos acknowledged the deterioration, saying on Thursday that the economy would barely grow in the first half of 2022. 
""My impression is that growth in the first quarter of this year ... will be slightly positive, we'll have very low growth,"" de Guindos said. ""In the second quarter of the year, my impression is that growth will be hovering (around) zero."" 
RATE HIKES ... OR NOT
Markets are pricing in a combined 60 basis points of hikes this year in the ECB's deposit rate, now minus 0.50%, which would end a nearly decade long experiment with negative rates.
But market analysts are more cautious and even the most conservative policymakers are not calling for rates to move into positive territory quickly, indicating a disconnect between market pricing and the ECB's own signals. 
ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane, among the doves on the rate-setting Governing Council, even cautioned on Thursday that the war could force the ECB to ease, rather than tighten policy.
""We should also be fully prepared to appropriately revise our monetary policy settings if the energy price shock and the Russia-Ukraine war were to result in a significant deterioration in macroeconomic prospects,"" Lane said in a speech, calling for readiness to either ease or tighten policy. 
The caution is especially warranted as Germany, the biggest of the 19 euro zone economies, may already be skirting a recession and has started drawing up plans for rationing natural gas in case supplies from Russia are disrupted.
Others added that even if high inflation hurts the consumer and weighs on growth, it is increasingly difficult for the ECB to play it down, so talk of rates hikes are bound to intensify.

""Even though high inflation is a drag on growth, the ECB likely has some pain threshold on the inflation data as well,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s Greg Fuzesi said. 
""The bigger the upside surprises on inflation, the smaller the bar for any improving news from Ukraine to intensify a debate on the interest rate outlook.""

450,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 07:00AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russia's finance ministry has paid 50.2 billion roubles ($616 million) in coupons on seven OFZ treasury bond issues, data on its website showed.
The payments come as the finance ministry is due to make a $447 million coupon payment on Thursday on a dollar Eurobond that matures in 2030.
Investors are watching closely Moscow's servicing of its debt after Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically.
The sanctions have led European clearing houses Euroclear and Clearstream to limit their business with Russian clients. This has left foreign OFZ investors cut off from their rouble bond holdings and local sovereign Eurobond holders, in turn, from interest payments in hard currency. 
The National Settlement Depository (NSD), a Russian national clearing house, citing a central bank's order, said this month that foreign OFZ bond holders are barred from receiving coupon payments until further notice.
NSD, which processes OFZ interest payments on behalf of the finance ministry, did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for information on which investors received the coupon payouts.
OFZs are used by the government to finance some of its budget needs. Before a growing standoff between Moscow and the west made the bonds a risky asset, they were popular with foreign investors thanks to their lucrative yields and Russia's then-strong economic fundamentals. 
The share of foreign investors among OFZ holders declined to 17.8% in February, the lowest since late 2012, from 19.1% a month earlier. 
This week, Russia has offered to repay in roubles part of a $2 billion Eurobond that matures on April 4, to secure payments for local investors who may not be able to receive dollars. 

Investors declining the rouble offer would be paid in U.S. dollars on April 4 when repayment is due, a source has said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's central bank on Thursday pledged to ramp up scheduled bond purchases in the second quarter, signalling it will continue to aggressively defend its yield cap against the global tide of higher interest rates.
In a closely-watched bond buying schedule for April-June, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said it will increase purchases for government bonds across the yield curve compared with the current quarter.
The announcement came after the BOJ maintained its offer to buy unlimited amounts of 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGB) at a fixed rate of 0.25% for four straight days this week.
""We decided to increase bond purchases for a wide range of durations, from short- to super-long zones, as the yield curve remained under upward pressure,"" a BOJ official told Reuters.
The 10-year JGB yield fell half a basis point to 0.210%, after rising to as high as 0.225% on Thursday.
Longer-term yields retreated sharply, with those for 20-year JGBs falling 9.5 basis points to a two-year low of 0.670%. The 30-year JGB yield fell 8 basis points to 0.920%.
""The central bank boosted the amount of bonds it would buy by a large margin,"" said Ataru Okumura, strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. ""Its stance to defend yield curve control is clear.""
Under its yield curve control (YCC) policy, the BOJ pledges to target the 10-year JGB yield around zero and sets an implicit 0.25% cap around it.
""I think JGB yields will stabilise for now. The problem is what happens to U.S. Treasury yields. If U.S. yields spike, that could put upward pressure on Japanese yields again,"" said Hiroshi Ugai, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities.
With the economy still weak and inflation modest compared with Western economies, the BOJ has stressed its resolve to keep monetary policy ultra-loose even as the U.S. Federal Reserve eyes a series of rate hikes.
Prospects of widening U.S.-Japan rate differentials have pushed the yen down by around 8% against the dollar this month.
The yen's decline has exacerbated the rise in cost of fuel and raw material imports triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda on Tuesday hardened his language on sharp yen declines, saying Tokyo and Washington were closely communicating on currency issues.

But Rintaro Tamaki, a former top currency diplomat, said the yen's weakening was driven partly by Japan's ultra-low rates and not too far out of line with economic fundamentals.
""The yen is still moving with a range it has been boxed in since 2013, so it can't be said that (its recent declines) are a sharp deviation from fundamentals,"" he told Reuters.

Investing.com -- U.S. President Joe Biden is set to announce a massive release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a fresh effort to bring gasoline prices down in time for the midterms. OPEC meets with Russia and other allies and is expected to open the taps only a little. U.S. personal spending and income data are due, as is the February update for the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. Walgreens reports earnings. And China's manufacturing sector slips into contraction as COVID-19 lockdowns hurt activity. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 31st March.
1. Biden to announce SPR release
U.S. President Joe Biden will announce plans to release up to 1 million barrels of oil a day for six months from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a new effort to drive down oil prices, according to various reports.
Biden is under pressure to bring gasoline prices down far enough to have a material impact on inflation to neutralize it as an issue in the midterm elections due in November.
The planned releases are much larger than the last effort to bring prices down earlier this year and come at a time when the momentum in oil prices has weakened. However, it doesn’t alter the fact that the SPR is conceived as a reserve against physical shortages of oil rather than a mechanism for pushing the market one way or the other.
By 6:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down another 6.2% at $101.19 a barrel, while Brent crude was down 5.3% at $105.48 a barrel.
2. OPEC+ to meet as Lavrov seeks alternative buyers for oil in India
Biden’s initiative is timed to coincide with the latest monthly meeting of the so-called OPEC+ group, which is expected to sign off on another routine increase of 400,000 barrels a day. OPEC’s ministerial meeting starts at 8 AM ET (1200 GMT), and Russia and others will join half an hour later.
While Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak is meeting with OPEC, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is in Delhi, trying to nail down the terms of a mechanism that would allow India to pay for increased shipments of Russian oil bypassing the dollar-based financial system.
Russia’s oil system still faces constraints due to a buyers’ strike in Europe. Reuters reported that many refineries have either reduced or ceased operations due to their inability to find buyers abroad, while pipeline operator Transneft has reduced the amount of oil it accepts from major producers.
3. U.S. data to show pressure on consumer spending
The U.S. will release personal income and spending data for February, which are likely to be examined for any further evidence of a slowdown in activity as pandemic-era savings are whittled down.
January’s spending figures had shown a surprisingly strong 2.1% gain, but February’s are more likely to be influenced by the continuing surge in consumer prices, more data on which will be available in the price index for personal consumption expenditures in February, which is also due at 8:30 AM ET.
In addition, there are the weekly jobless claims, which are expected to stay below 200,000 for a second week.
Overnight, data in Europe pointed to an increasing battle with stagflation, with U.K. house prices rising at an 18-year high, German retail sales falling in February (even before Russia’s war with Ukraine) and French inflation running way ahead of expectations. The market is now pricing in some 60 basis points of tightening by the European Central Bank by the end of 2022.
4. Stocks set to open mixed; Walgreens in focus
U.S. stock markets are set to open mixed later, with the sharp drop in oil prices over the last two days offering some support to equities despite ongoing fears about inflation and monetary policy tightening.
By 6:20 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 11 points – effectively flat – while S&P 500 futures were up 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.3%. All three indices had finished in the red on Wednesday as hopes for a quick end to the war in Ukraine were damped by the Kremlin. President Vladimir Putin told Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi earlier that the conditions for a ceasefire are not in place.
Stocks likely to be in focus later in Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), which reports quarterly earnings, along with CVS (NYSE:CVS), which reached a $484 million opioid-related settlement on Wednesday. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) may also come in for some scrutiny after awarding a bumper options package to CEO Pat Gelsinger. Proxy shareholder service ISS has already come out against the package.
5. China's factories struggle with COVID; Shanghai set to extend lockdown
China’s manufacturing sector slipped back into contraction in March, under the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns and waning demand from the U.S. and Europe as pandemic-era stimulus programs fade.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index fell to 49.5 from 50.2, against a backdrop of continued problems with port and factory closures. The South China Morning Post reported overnight that Shanghai is likely to extend the lockdown of its Pudong district beyond the scheduled end date of Friday.
Elsewhere, the impact of a Chinese boycott was again evident in figures released by Swedish fashion retailer H&M (ST:HMb), whose quarterly profit fell well short of expectations. In addition to problems in China, the chain has also had to close its stores in Russia, its sixth-largest market, and has accelerated its plan for net store closures this year."
453,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 04:41AM ET</span>","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation is increasingly likely to stabilise around 2% but the European Central Bank should be ready to change course if the outlook deteriorates due to Russia's war in Ukraine, ECB chief economist Philip Lane said on Thursday.
While inflation probably exceeded 7% this month, the ECB has long argued that it is likely to dip back below target in the coming years as energy price rises are not expected to persist.
""It is also plausible that medium-term inflation will not revert to the pre-pandemic below-target equilibrium but, conditional on appropriately-calibrated monetary policy, rather may stabilise around the ECB’s 2% target,"" Lane said in a speech. 
""We should also be fully prepared to appropriately revise our monetary policy settings if the energy price shock and the Russia-Ukraine war were to result in a significant deterioration in macroeconomic prospects,"" Lane added.
The ECB plans to end bond purchases in the third quarter, a prerequisite to any interest rate increase, but has not made any commitments about a rate hike, although a growing number of conservative policymakers are calling for a move before the end of the year. 

Lane however stressed that given the uncertainty, the ECB must maintain ""two-sided"" optionality, meaning the next move could be either tightening or easing. 
""More than ever, it is important to maintain optionality in the conduct of monetary policy,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States will vigorously defend its economic interests and values against the negative impacts of China's economic policies as Beijing doubles down on its state-centered economic system, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said Wednesday.
Tai told the House Ways and Means Committee that Washington's talks with Beijing about its unmet purchase commitments under a Phase 1 trade deal and broader non-market policies had been ""unduly difficult"" and new tools were needed.
""Going forward, our strategy will expand beyond only pressing China for change and needs to include vigorously defending our values and economic interests from the negative impacts of China's economic policies and practices,"" she said.
Washington ""cannot stop pushing China for change,"" she added, but it could no longer wait for China to change policies, adding that tariffs on $300 billion to $400 billion in Chinese imports has not pushed Beijing to make fundamental changes.
China only met about 60% of its Phase 1 deal commitments to increase U.S. purchases by $200 billion during 2020 and 2021 compared with 2017 levels and improve protections for U.S. intellectual property and grant more Chinese market access to U.S. financial services and agricultural biotechnology. 
In addition to ""continuing to create pressure for China to change,"" Tai said the United States needed to take steps, such as passing legislation in Congress to promote investments in innovation, semiconductors and the return home of manufacturing supply chains.
""That is the plan that we need to pursue going forward,"" she said, echoing comments to Reuters last week.
In Beijing, a spokeswoman of the commerce ministry said cooperation between the two countries was the only correct choice and they maintained normal communications.
""We hope the U.S. could adopt a practical and reasonable trade policy on China, and work together with China to push forward a healthy and stable development of bilateral trade ties,"" Shu Jueting told a regular news conference on Thursday.

Tai has long said trade laws needed to be updated to tackle the challenges of China's massive industrial subsidies, but gave no details of specific changes she sought.
Regarding the Biden administration's proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, a series of negotiations with countries in the region aimed at countering China's influence, Tai said it would not reduce tariffs but would include ""meaningful economic outcomes"" aimed at setting new, market-based standards for digital commerce, the environment and labor.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Latin America has served as a respite for whipsawed emerging market investors during the first quarter, as accelerating inflation and a more hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve weighed on assets even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine late February.
Emerging market performance this quarter has been sharply determined by whether a country imports or exports energy and basic metals, which are key inflation pressure points.
Across the Atlantic and far from the war in Ukraine, Latin American currencies have continued to outperform on monetary policy tightening cycles that began last year and of exposure to key commodities, plus relatively low baselines after the region's economy was decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Graphic: Currency performance across emerging markets - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-EMERGING/CURRENCIES/lgvdwqjlnpo/chart.png 
EM stocks have fallen 6.8% this year, dragged by a large exposure to Asia and just shy of a 15% weighting from materials and energy, while developed economy stocks have lost 4.2% for the January-March quarter. Latin American stocks, by contrast, have chalked up a 26% gain, boosted by a near 35% weighting from the materials and energy sectors.
Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist for  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute, runs a thematic commodity exporter basket that he said ""has been in a downturn since 2012.""
""It has tilted back up to an uptrend for the first time in a decade.""
He said the overall EM stock index underperformance is partly explained by its skew toward China, South Korea and Taiwan. ""These are not your grandfather's emerging markets, they're a lot less commodity-centric than they used to be, heavily tilted to commodity importers."" said. 
Graphic - Stock performance across emerging markets - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-EMERGING/STOCKS/gdvzyjkqxpw/chart.png 
The further spike in energy and food prices triggered by the invasion has weighed mostly on Emerging Europe, as the broken trade relations take a toll on the region. 
""Spillovers to the rest of Emerging Europe will hit the region hard, particularly Bulgaria and the Baltic States where trade linkages with Russia are among the largest in the world,"" research firm Capital Economics said in a note.
Four of the five top-performing EM stock markets in dollar terms in 2022 are from Latin America, with returns from Colombia, Chile, Brazil and Peru hovering around 30%. Add Mexico to the list, and you have five of the six best-performing currencies this year against the dollar.
The best-performing bonds in local currency include Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and Peru.

Foreign currency bond yields have risen across developing economies as the Fed's tightening cycle takes hold, with Turkey and Argentina among those with the smallest total return losses, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) data.

ENERGY SHOCK
The sanctions against Russia for its attack on Ukraine included bans on oil imports from the United States, the largest global oil consumer, as well as Canada, Britain and others. The barrel of U.S. crude, which was already up 23% right before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is now up 43% for the quarter, the second largest quarterly gain since 1990.
Among big energy importers, Turkey's lira has stabilized below 15 per dollar after last year's crisis, but it's down near 10% on the quarter, with about half the loss coming in March. But its foreign sovereign bonds rank third-best among EMs. 
Egypt, a major food importer, devalued its currency by 14% to entice investors that had pulled their cash after the war started. The Egyptian pound is now the worst performing EM currency so far this year.

While Russia's rouble rallied over the past two weeks, currency controls could be making the rebound artificial. It remains more than 10% lower to the dollar so far this year, while Ukraine's hryvnia is down over 7%.
The dollar has strengthened 2.3% versus a basket of peers. EM currencies have ticked up 0.5% to the greenback this quarter, with the Latin America currency index jumping 14% to hit a quarterly record.

456,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 01:16AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Financial sanctions imposed on Russia threaten to gradually dilute the dominance of the U.S. dollar and could result in a more fragmented international monetary system, Gita Gopinath, IMF's First Deputy Managing Director, told The Financial Times.
Russia has been hit with a plethora of sanctions from the United States and its allies for its late-February invasion of Ukraine. Russia has called the invasion a 'special operation' to disarm its neighbour. 
""The dollar would remain the major global currency even in that landscape but fragmentation at a smaller level is certainly quite possible,"" Gopinath told the newspaper in an interview, adding that some countries are already renegotiating the currency in which they get paid for trade.
She said that the war will also spur the adoption of digital finance, from cryptocurrencies to stablecoins and central bank digital currencies.
The IMF did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Gopinath told the FT that the greater use of other currencies in global trade would lead to further diversification of the reserve assets held by national central banks.
She had earlier said the sanctions against Russia do not foreshadow the demise of the dollar as the reserve currency and that the war in Ukraine will slow global economic growth but will not cause a global recession.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) -Fears of a Russian gas supply crunch prompted some European countries on Wednesday to ask people to consume less energy in a move that could potentially yield big results.
Despite months of soaring energy prices and tight supplies most governments have avoided taking a step they fear could be unpopular but with concerns growing that Russia could turn off the taps, the message in some capitals is starting to shift.
""Every kilowatt-hour counts,"" German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Wednesday as Germany declared an ""early warning"" of a possible gas supply emergency.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) in Paris agrees that when done on a large scale, small behavioural changes can significantly reduce gas and oil demand.
It estimates that turning down thermostats in buildings across the European Union by 2 Celsius would save 20 billion cubic metres of gas, worth about $28 billion at current prices.
That's also about 13% of the 155 billion cubic metres the 27-nation bloc buys each year from Russia, which is in turn about 40% of the EU's total gas consumption.
The Dutch government followed Germany on Wednesday saying it would launch a campaign this weekend asking citizens and businesses to use less gas while France's regulator asked citizens to collectively try to reduce their consumption.
Simone Tagliapietra, senior fellow at think-tank Bruegel, said governments should have urged citizens to curb energy use months ago to help manage the supply crunch but politicians resisted because such a message ""smells of austerity"". 
""Each billion cubic metre of gas we don't consume, it's important. That gas is very expensive, and we need now to start filling up the storage ahead of next winter,"" he said.
IT'S YOUR CHOICE
Rather than calling on consumers to cut their energy use, governments have so far mostly been looking for ways to cap utility bills and find alternative sources of fuel. 
Sweden, France, Itay, Germany and Britain also announced measures to make petrol cheaper this month after crude hit its highest price since 2008, drawing criticism from campaigners who say the measures are fossil fuel subsidies.
But since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, Brussels has declared a mission to cut the EU's Russian gas imports by two-thirds this year and to end the use of Russian gas by 2027.
Cutting demand could reduce the impact of any supply crunch if Russia were to cut exports, which has become more of a worry since Moscow said last week that countries should start paying for gas in roubles.
A detailed EU plan to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels is due in May, but a blueprint published this month showed Brussels would boost non-Russian gas imports, expand renewable energy faster, swap millions of gas boilers for heat pumps and renovate buildings to use less energy. 
Those solutions will take time, however, and the European Commission has already suggested that consumers could help dent demand immediately.
""Your choices in how much energy you consume co-decide how strong we are in our reaction to Russia,"" EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said.
Temporarily cutting demand would also help countries build up gas storage for next winter and provide a stop-gap while governments secure lasting options to replace Russian fuel - such as building wind and solar farms, renovating buildings, or securing more non-Russian gas. 
""There are tracks for immediate energy savings measures that remain unexplored,"" said Adeline Rochet, policy expert at climate think-tank E3G.
If they stick, energy-saving habits such as turning off lights and appliances or using less air conditioning where convenient, could also help bring down carbon dioxide emissions. 
MOVE TO THE SLOW LANE
Christina Demski, an expert on consumer energy behaviour at Cardiff University's School of Psychology, said soaring energy bills and a desire to show solidarity with Ukraine may mean Europeans are receptive to such messages.
""People are more likely to make a behavioural change if you are asking to do something that reflects their values,"" she said, adding that requests to change behaviour should not target vulnerable households who lack the flexibility to adapt their consumption, or who are already struggling with bills.
Only a few countries have broached the idea of ways to reduce oil consumption, despite the fact Russia, which calls its action in Ukraine a special military operation, providing 27% of the EU's oil imports.
Denmark is looking at a proposal to temporarily reduce highway speed limits. Ireland's transport minister Eamon Ryan, who also the environment portfolio, suggested driving slower could save fuel when announcing a cut in petrol duty this month.
The IEA last week published options it said could lower oil demand in advanced economies by 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd) within four months, equivalent to the combined demand of every car in China.
Most options would require consumers to change their behaviour. 
Lowering speed limits by 10 km per hour in advanced economies could save 290,000 bpd from cars and 140,000 bpd from trucks. Working from home three days a week would cut 500,000 bpd while fuel-saving practices such as car-sharing could save 470,000 bpd, the IEA said.

Some governments are resistant. Britain, which is no longer an EU member, rejected the IEA's ideas. The country plans to replace the 8% of oil imports it gets from Russia with alternative supplies this year. 
""There is absolutely no need to apply this guidance in the UK,"" a government spokesperson said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy will grow at a slower pace than previously thought next quarter in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its inflationary effect on global commodity and energy prices, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Thursday.
The resulting pressure from high energy costs has driven a sharp fall in the yen, which is set to mark its worst month against the dollar since November 2016, losing almost 6%.
About 60% of poll respondents said the economy would only start to be affected by a decline in the yen if it fell past 130 to the dollar, a sign most don't rate the yen's recent weakness as particularly bad. The yen is currently trading around 122 to the dollar.
Since the start of Russia's war in Ukraine on Feb. 24, the economic outlook has become even more difficult to forecast as consumer price rises and supply bottlenecks threaten a solid recovery in domestic demand.
The world's third-largest economy was expected to expand an annualised 4.9% next quarter, below February's prediction of 5.6%, according to the median forecast of nearly 40 analysts in the March 22-30 poll.
A slower expansion still indicates the economy will rebound from a contraction this quarter, when it was expected to shrink an annualised 0.3%. That is a turnaround from a 0.4% expansion predicted for January-March last month.
While consumer activity is usually robust in the second quarter, higher prices are now hurting consumers' purchasing power, restraining the release of pent-up demand after COVID-19 curbs ended, said Hiroshi Namioka, chief strategist and fund manager at T&D Asset Management.
""While there's likely to be some extent of growth in the coming quarter compared to January-March, it's unlikely to be as strong as first thought given the situation in Ukraine,"" said Namioka.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has already ordered his cabinet to draw up another relief package by the end of April to reduce the economic blow from the surge in global energy and raw materials prices.
Earlier this month the government lifted remaining coronavirus curbs across Japan after Omicron infections subsided following an earlier record surge.
Economists surveyed have not been put off by the yen's weakness, which has traditionally given Japanese exports a tailwind.
Asked what yen level versus the U.S. dollar would hurt the economy, 16 of 27 economists said the damage would exceed the merits when the yen falls below 130 to the dollar.
Six chose a range of 125-130 yen to the dollar, while one picked 120-125, three opted for 115-120 and another one chose stronger than 110 yen per dollar.
The poll also found the economy would grow 2.6% in fiscal 2022, starting in April, after an expected 2.3% growth this fiscal year.
Both forecasts were slightly lower than what was expected in last month's poll, which was conducted mostly before Russia's action in Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"".
Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile fresh food prices, will rise 1.6% next fiscal year and 0.8% in fiscal 2023, after a small 0.1% increase this fiscal year, the poll showed.
While that showed price growth was expected to pick up in coming months, about 85% of analysts polled said the chance Japan's economy slips into recession over the next two years was unlikely or very unlikely.

The remaining 15% said that was likely to happen, while none answered it was very likely.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's pledges to shore up its embattled property industry have done little to boost prospects for the sector, according to developers, with access to funding still challenging and many local government authorities reluctant to ease rules more effectively.
The world's second-largest economy needs more decisive policy easing at the city level to stimulate demand from wary buyers and inject new credit to stop more property-related firms from defaulting, executives at top developers said.
Beijing has repeatedly signalled more government support for the sector after bond payment defaults by China Evergrande Group and others rattled global markets and weighed on the economy.
As part of those efforts, China's central bank has said financial institutions need to extend real estate loans steadily under prudent management to meet the ""reasonable"" funding needs of the sector.
But executives at five developers, all among China's top 50 by sales, told Reuters they have not been able to get new loans from banks.
The developers said they can now only use cash from sales, which has been diminishing, for building new projects.
Logan Group told investors earlier this month its bank credit has shrunk since January, with over 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) of approved bank loans yet to be released, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
The Shenzhen-based developer, which is negotiating payment extensions with creditors, did not respond to Reuters request for comment.
An executive of a state-owned bank said guidelines from headquarters was to accelerate the approval of mortgage loans, but stay cautious on private property developers.
""The negative news headlines of developers failing to meet payment obligations keeps ringing alarms ... so far we are mindful to focus on state-owned developers only.""
All the representatives of developers and banks declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter.
'LITTLE COHERENCE' 
Property investments in China bounced slightly over the first two months of 2022, rising 3.7%, while new construction starts measured by floor area fell 12.2%. 
Overall, home demand remained weak with property sales by floor area down 9.6% during the same period.
""Little coherence"" between central authorities and local governments on easing measures was also denting hopes of a quick revival, said the chief financial offer of a developer that has struggled to repay its offshore debt.
""Every city has different policies, different departments are trying to figure out how much they can implement, and the effectiveness is low,"" said the executive at the firm based in eastern China.
Beijing drafted a new nationwide policy this year for pre-sale funds developers need to keep in escrow accounts for project completion. The aim was to correct some local government's over-tightening of the fund withdrawal rules last year.
But decisions on how much developers need to keep in escrow accounts is still in the hands of city-level officials, many of whom remained cautious, said the property firm executives.
Logan said it had 18 billion yuan in the escrow accounts. Evergrande, whose $20 billion offshore debt is deemed in default, said in early February it had 50 billion yuan in the accounts.
China's stimulus measures have been mainly focused on boosting home demand, including cutting down-payments for first-time buyers, reducing mortgage rates, and subsidies.
Some provincial governments have refrained from rolling out more decisive measures as they struggle to gauge how far they can go without contradicting the central directive that ""houses are not for speculation"", analysts said.
Zhengzhou, a major second-tier city, however, relaxed purchase curbs on second homes on March 1, the first city in the country to do so. A couple more cities have followed that lead.

""Zhengzhou could be a turning point,"" Beike Research Institute senior analyst Tang Xuan said, anticipating a sales recovery by mid-year. ""We expect cities with high inventory will roll out more easing going forward, and Beijing will consent to that.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury officials are urging municipalities to divert part of their shares of $350 billion in state and local COVID-19 aid to help struggling renters stay in their homes as the Emergency Rental Assistance runs short of funds this summer.
The Treasury said on Wednesday the $46.6 billion program aimed at preventing evictions has disbursed or obligated over $30 billion to renters and landlords through the end of February, and is on pace to exhaust the ""vast majority"" of its funding by mid-year.
The program, launched in January 2021, struggled for the first few months to get up and running as communities did not previously have infrastructure to prevent evictions and counsel renters facing job loss. 
To avoid an abrupt cut-off of rental aid funding, the Treasury said some state, local and tribal governments have allocated some $3.75 billion from their allocations of State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds for rent, mortgage and utility assistance as well as other eviction and prevention services.
That separate, $350 billion COVID-19 aid program allows for broad spending discretion and is emerging as a significant social policy tool.
The rental assistance program, enacted in two tranches in December 2020 and in March 2021, has kept eviction rates during the pandemic well below historical averages, Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a statement.

""As these emergency funds run out, now is the time for state and local governments to leverage this infrastructure to provide services like right-to-counsel programs and housing counselors that will help families avoid economic scarring long after COVID-19 is in the rear-view mirror.""
The Emergency Rental Assistance Program reported about $1.93 billion spent on rent, utilities and arrears in February, compared to $1.94 billion for January and $2.45 billion in December 2021. It aided 462,552 households in February.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Qantas Airways Ltd plans to reduce carbon emissions by about 25% by 2030, in part by boosting sustainable aviation fuel to 10% of its fuel mix and increasing the fuel efficiency of flights by 1.5% a year.
Qantas, one of the first carriers in the world to pledge to slash carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, has been moving to align itself more closely with corporate customers looking for drastic cuts in emissions from business travel well before that date. 
""What we are seeing from our customer base is a lot of customers we already know would be willing to pay more to travel sustainably,"" Chief Executive Alan Joyce told reporters on Thursday. 
Several companies, such as HSBC, Zurich Insurance, Bain & Company and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), have already announced plans to quickly cut business travel emissions by as much as 70%.
""Hydrogen or electric powered aircraft are several decades away, particularly for the length of most flights, so our plan is focused on the technology that is within reach today,"" Joyce said.
The target of 10% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030 is in line with a goal set by the oneworld airline alliance, in which it is a member, in October 2021.
British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) has set a target of a 20% reduction in net emissions by 2030, while Finnair has a more ambitious aim for a 50% cut from 2019 emissions levels by 2025.
Qantas has begun purchasing SAF for its flights from London to help reduce carbon emissions on those journeys by around 10% and from 2025, it will use biofuels on flights from Los Angeles and San Francisco.
The airline will invest A$50 million ($37.54 million) to help develop a SAF industry in Australia, but more government support is also needed, Joyce said.
""It would be a shame if Qantas meets its 10% sustainable aviation fuel target in 2030 by buying offshore,"" he said.
The industry-wide target of net zero emissions by 2050 relies on boosting use of SAF from less than 0.1% today to 65% by 2050 as well as new engine technologies.
Qantas is nearing a major order for Airbus' latest generation narrowbody planes that would replace its fleet of older Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800s and 717s, allowing for fuel savings of 15-20%. A firm order is expected by mid-year, Qantas said on Thursday.
The airline also expects within a decade there could be hybrid-electric engines retrofitted on its turboprops, Chief Sustainability Officer Andrew Parker said.
Qantas said it would consider the cost of carbon in investment decisions and link climate change performance targets to executive pay from the financial year starting in July.

Qantas also plans to eliminate single-use plastics by 2027 as part of its broader environmental goals.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lankans faced 10-hour power cuts on Wednesday and warnings of longer blackouts on Thursday, as a deepening economic crisis roiled markets and the electricity regulator urged more than a million government employees to work from home to save fuel.
The island nation has been unable to pay for fuel shipments because of a foreign exchange shortage, and is poised to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
""We made a request to the government to allow the public sector, which is about 1.3 million employees, to work from home for the next two days so we can manage the fuel and power shortages better,"" Janaka Ratnayake, Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka, told Reuters.
Power cuts would be extended to 13 hours on Thursday, Sri Lanka's power regulator said in a statement.
Amid the country's worst economic crisis in decades, foreign exchange reserves have fallen by 70% in the past two years and were down to a paltry $2.31 billion as of February, leaving Sri Lanka struggling to import essentials, including food and fuel.
The drawn-out power cuts on Wednesday were partly caused by the government's inability to pay $52 million for a 37,000 tonne diesel shipment that was awaiting offloading, Ratnayake said.
""We have no forex to pay,"" he said, warning of more power cuts over the next two days. ""That is the reality.""
'CAN'T SEE END OF TUNNEL'
Sri Lankan shares closed 3.6% lower on Wednesday, after falling more than 7% during the day, prompting the Colombo Stock Exchange to halt trading twice.
Udeeshan Jonas, Chief Strategist at equity research firm CAL Research, said the market was responding to a deepening of a crisis set off by badly-timed tax cuts, the coronavirus pandemic and historically weak government finances.
""Investors can't see the end of the tunnel,"" he said.
To seek a way out of the crisis, Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa is set to visit Washington in April for talks with the IMF. The Fund's assessment published on Friday said Sri Lanka was experiencing a combined balance of payments and sovereign debt crisis, and would need a ""comprehensive strategy"" to make its debt sustainable.
If Sri Lanka secures an IMF programme it would be its 17th financial rescue package from the global lender.
Harpo Gooneratne, a restaurateur in Sri Lanka's main city of Colombo, said that even though some of his 10 restaurants had their own generators, the diesel shortage made it difficult to run his business during power cuts.
""Its crazy,"" he said.
The worsening electricity cuts will hit already struggling businesses, especially exporters that have locked in orders and limited capacity to absorb cost increases, said Dhananath Fernando, an analyst at Colombo's Advocata Institute think tank.
""This will further hurt Sri Lanka's growth and threaten foreign exchange earnings that are crucial to improve reserves, repay debt and pay for essential imports,"" Fernando said.

Gooneratne said there were 30% fewer customers at his restaurants and they were spending less.
""Even when people go out they are cautious about their spending,"" he said. ""The person who earlier had two beers will now only have one.""

(Reuters) - Global restrictions on exports to Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine have shut down a car maker, halted work on tanks and cut a Russian computer maker's access to circuits used in communications equipment, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.
""Thirty-three countries have joined together with one export controls strategy,"" said Thea Kendler, assistant secretary for export administration at the Commerce Department. 
""Necessity brought together this unprecedented collaboration on export controls and other measures that are having a meaningful impact on Putin's war.""
While only about 5% of Russia's imports came from the United States, Kendler said, adding the European Union and other coalition countries accounts for roughly 50 percent of Russia's imports.
Export controls were never expected to have immediate effects, she said, but noted the Ukrainian government reported that Russia's two major tank plants halted work over a lack of foreign components. Baikal Electronics, a Russian semiconductor company and computer manufacturer, was cut off from integrated circuits to support its surveillance, servers, and other domestic communications equipment, she added.
Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, exited the Russian market, cutting off the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies access to Elbrus chips, which are widely used in Russian intelligence and military systems, she said. Lada halted auto production as export controls deprived it of needed parts and supplies, she added. 
 Renault  (PA:RENA), which controls the company that produces the Lada, said it would suspend operations at its plant in Moscow while it assesses options on its majority stake in Avtovaz AVAZI_p.MM, the country's No. 1 carmaker.
Renault did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did TSMC. Baikal Electronics, the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies, and Russian tank maker UralVagonZavod could not immediately be reached for comment.

Kendler said she and other U.S. Treasury Department and Commerce officials traveled to London, Brussels, Paris and Berlin to bring the coalition together, and that extensive talks also are going on with Japan, South Korea, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
""I expect to be able to announce additional like-minded export controls countries soon,"" she said.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan met with 10 Australian chief executives and senior executives on Wednesday evening to discuss the investments and opportunities for further collaboration.
The investments include a pledge by financial services firm Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) to support 12 billion pounds of investment by 2030 in infrastructure projects including offshore wind, gigabit broadband and hydrogen hubs, the government said.
It said this would include Macquarie's Green Investment Group founding a new UK-headquartered global offshore wind development business Corio, and developing two new British offshore wind sites over the next decade. 
Other investments include 5.5 billion pounds from real estate and investment group Lendlease and its partners over the next five years to deliver new low carbon homes as part of major regeneration projects in London and Birmingham.
IFM Investors plan to deliver 3 billion in investment over five years to maintain existing assets such as Stansted and East Midlands airports, and create a new net zero fund to support large-scale infrastructure energy transition projects. 
The government also said pension fund AustralianSuper forecasted a further 8 billion pounds in investments across the UK over the next five years. 
Last month AustralianSuper's head of international investments told the Financial Times newspaper the fund expected to more than double its UK assets from 7 billion to more than 15 billion by 2026.
Britain and Australia signed a free trade deal in December projected to eventually boost bilateral trade by over 10 billion pounds.

Total goods and services trade between Britain and Australia was worth 14.5 billion pounds in the year to June 2021, with Australia ranked Britain's 21st-largest trade partner and accounting for 1.2% of total British trade.

(Reuters) - The closely watched two-year/10-year part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve briefly inverted on Tuesday, which in the past has indicated that a recession could start in one to two years.
Other parts of the yield curve, however, including one of the Federal Reserve’s favorite recession indicators - the gap between three-month and 10-year yields - have been steepening and remain a long way from inversion.
Here is a roundup of what some market participants think about the yield curve.
GOLDMAN SACHS STRATEGISTS, LED BY PRAVEEN KORAPATY 
“The nominal curve tends to invert more easily in a high inflation environment, and we could see earlier and/or deeper curve inversions this cycle. In such an environment, a deeper nominal curve inversion may be needed to produce the same recession odds in models as seen in more recent business cycles.”
ERIN BROWNE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, MULTI-ASSET STRATEGIES, PIMCO
""Historically in very high inflationary environments, like we are in today...looking at real yields and the real yield curve is a better indicator of growth risks. The real yield is still very steep.""
""The extraordinary amount of QE has lowered term premiums and worsened the flatness of the curve. As a result, this is a very different cycle.""
JPMORGAN STRATEGISTS, LED BY MARKO KOLANOVIC
“The flat/inverted yield curve was historically a good cycle signal because it would indicate that financing conditions have become highly restrictive, but we do not see this at present. Real rates averaged +200bp at the time of past curve inversions, vs current negative levels, while bank lending standards are still easing.”
BRUNO BRAIZINHA, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, BANK OF AMERICA
“The recent 2s10s curve dynamics reflect recession risks.”
“Inversions are a significant mile-marker for late-cycle transitions, with implications for expected returns and covariances across asset classes. Scope for a more hawkish Fed near term likely exacerbates medium-term risks to the outlook.”
JONATHAN COHN, RATES TRADING STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE
“2s10s...may not be as strong or worrisome of an indicator in the current environment as it has been historically given much of the “weight” on the long-end reflects compressed term premia as opposed to inherent “overtightening” expectations. Nevertheless… it is sensible to price a higher recession probability particularly now that the Fed has gestured toward its higher tolerance for economic weakness in exchange for price stability.”
JIM REID, HEAD OF THEMATIC RESEARCH, DEUTSCHE BANK
“The Fed have long preferred measures like the spread between the 18m forward 3m yield and the 3m yield….The biggest implication of this is perhaps that the Fed won’t see a 2s10s inversion as a reason to slow down rate hikes.”
“I still prefer 2s10s as a lead indicator since we can go back with a successful track record over far more cycles than the Fed’s preferred measure but it’s fair to say the record difference between the measures is now stark and worth debating.”
ANSHUL PRADHAN AND SAMUEL EARL, INTEREST RATE STRATEGISTS, BARCLAYS
“On the surface, a downward-sloping yield curve simply points to expectations of rate cuts by investors and does not indicate why. Investors might be worried about a recession and expect the Fed to cut rates. Alternatively, they could be expecting the Fed to cut rates in response to falling inflation. Both are plausible explanations, though history suggests the former is more likely.”
“Is this time different? We find the usual explanation of low term premium, due to factors such as the Fed's balance sheet, unsatisfactory...Investors are willing to accept a low term premium when they are worried about downside risks to growth, suggesting that the term premium also contains information about the outlook.”
WELLS FARGO MACRO STRATEGISTS, LED BY MIKE SCHUMACHER

“The link between curve shape and growth has been weak at best since 2009.""
“Why has the yield curve lost its mojo? Heavy bond buying by central banks has caused long-term yields to diverge from economic fundamentals.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday it has updated its guidance on capital flow restrictions to allow member countries to impose pre-emptive measures to reduce the risks of abrupt capital outflows causing financial crises or deep recessions.
The IMF's institutional view on capital controls was launched in 2012 in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis to allow for capital flow management measures and macroprudential measures in the event of capital surges.
Under the new guidance, countries would no longer have to wait until capital flow surges materialize under the new guidance. They could impose such measures to counter a gradual buildup of foreign-currency debt that is not backed by foreign currency reserves or hedges, the IMF said.
IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath said the changes were the result of analysis of recent capital controls practices by countries and research into current economic conditions and vulnerabilities.

""You want to be able to ensure that you are not building up further financial vulnerabilities - and you can take measures preemptively to prevent that from happening,"" Gopinath told reporters in introducing the new guidance.
""So that when the environment changes, for instance, like the current environment that we're in where interest rates could go up very sharply, that you're able to better insulate your economy,"" she added.

468,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 03:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Many McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) Corp. customers aren’t able or willing to pay an extra 5% to 20% for the bacon on their burgers if Carl Icahn succeeds in revamping the company’s supply chain.
That’s the estimated cost increase the fast-food company might face if it stops buying meat from producers who put pregnant sows in gestation crates, according to two industry experts. For customers, that means adding two half-strips of bacon to a burger could cost more than $2 in Chicago, where McDonald’s is based.
Icahn’s pitch to end what he and animal-welfare experts call the inhumane treatment of animals comes at a time when consumers are already grappling with soaring prices for gas and grocery items. The meat industry has been hit particularly hard during the pandemic due to a shortage of U.S. workers, and now the spike in fuel prices is driving higher shipping costs. President Joe Biden has urged Congress to assess whether meat processors are engaging in anticompetitive behavior.
“Prices are going up across quick-service restaurants pretty aggressively,” said Mike Halen, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “I don’t know how much more consumers are going to be willing to accept in terms of price increases right now, especially with prices going up for everything.”
McDonald’s raised menu prices about 6% last year in the U.S. More hikes may be on the table as the company expects higher food and paper inflation this year in the U.S., compared with 2021.
Billionaire Icahn has nominated two directors to the boards of McDonald’s and grocery giant Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co. as part of his campaign against gestation crates. Back in 2012, McDonald’s said it would require its U.S. pork producers to outline their plans to phase out the use of the stalls, which are too small for pigs to turn around in. The company’s current policy, however, allows for the confinement for about six weeks in early stages of pregnancy. Some members of the pork industry say the crates protect sows’ health.
Icahn has urged McDonald’s to require all of its U.S. suppliers to move to “crate-free” pork and to set a specific time frame for doing so. A spokesman for the company declined to comment beyond its statement from February, which said that “the current pork supply in the U.S. would make this type of commitment impossible.”
Eliminating the practice entirely would be a tough undertaking for the industry, and for Smithfield Foods Inc., the world’s biggest pork producer. 
“Any disruption to hog production would certainly have an impact on pork prices,” said Russell Barton, director at commodity researcher Urner Barry. “If you are restricted in the amount of hogs you can produce in a given facility, by giving them more space and things like that, then you are going to ultimately end up with tighter pork supply unless you make it up for it and build more facilities.”
At Coleman Natural Foods, which doesn’t use gestation crates at all, farmers are paid as much as 20% more than the commodity price depending on the market, according to Jim Wallace, a senior director in the company’s live-hog operations. Its farmers also don’t use antibiotics or synthetic hormones in raising its pigs.
Steve Meyer, a consulting economist for the National Pork Board and the National Pork Producers Council, expects prices could rise around 5% if gestation crates are eliminated. “You’ve got to cover all costs and it all depends on so many factors,” he said.
“But to some families, anything higher is important,” Meyer said. “We ought to think about them.”

LONDON/ZURICH/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yevgeny Chichvarkin, a telecoms tycoon who fled Russia in 2008 and became a high-profile London restaurateur, has long been a vocal supporter of Ukraine.
Together with partner Tatiana Fokina, the multimillionaire says he has sent four truckloads of medical and protective equipment to Poland to help Ukrainians since the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. 
Chichvarkin, a burly man with a waxed moustache, said he drove the first load himself.
But the 48-year-old entrepreneur, a long-time critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said he has just unexpectedly had one of his Swiss bank accounts frozen. He declined to say by which bank.
Chichvarkin is one of a growing number of Russians living abroad who are finding issues accessing their money, even when they are not the direct targets of Western sanctions.
Reuters interviews with nine Russians living overseas - as well as their wealth managers, lawyers, tax advisers, real estate and art brokers - suggest that Western sanctions meant to punish Putin's inner circle are also broadly ensnaring Russian passport holders.
Four Russians living overseas with dual citizenship described banks freezing their accounts or payments in London, Zurich and Paris. One wealthy émigré in London said he had switched to cash to make purchases and was keeping a low profile. 
Two wealth advisors and a lawyer described applications for bank accounts by Russian clients being rejected. Banks said they were taking extra precautions with Russian money. And three brokers said some real estate and art deals had stalled. 
A Canadian-American lawyer said his Russian clients were afraid to take international trips for fear of being stopped at customs as Western banks cast a wide blanket of suspicion on Russian money - even donations to charities. Dual passports no longer provide escape routes as they once did. 
""I am dealing with Russians who can't get out of hotels, students who have no money because credit cards are valueless,"" said Bob Amsterdam, a founding partner of Washington- and London-based law firm Amsterdam & Partners. 
""Banks ... are refusing Russians bank accounts: they are closing their doors to Russians on nationality,"" said Amsterdam, who is based in London. ""Leading law firms in the City have closed their doors to Russians in terms of nationality."" 
'YOU NEED TO BE VERY QUIET'
Several lawyers representing wealthy Russians in Europe spoke about a pervasive climate of distrust. One tax and wealth planning expert, who asked not to be named due to a climate that she said penalized association with Russia, said that Russians were being scrutinized regardless of their place of residence or wealth. 
""Currently, everything that is Russian is toxic, which means that everyone is trying to be extremely, extremely careful in terms of what to do with Russian clients,"" said the lawyer, a dual Russian and British citizen, who runs a law firm in Zurich. 
Journalist Elena Servettaz, a dual citizen who has lived in France since 2005, said French bank Crédit Mutuel rejected a transfer of less than 1,000 euros to her account -- money sent to her from London to support Ukrainian refugee aid efforts. 
When Servettaz called the bank, she was told the transaction had been flagged due to her Russian nationality. Servettaz received the money more than a week later.
""It's so unfair when you are part of the Russian opposition, you're helping Ukrainian refugees, and they're saying you're Russian so you can't have your money,"" Servettaz said. 
Crédit Mutuel said that European banks were obliged to apply ""the greatest prudence"" in scrutinising transactions that could be affected by E.U. sanctions, and that additional checks required to ensure compliance could lead to delays, though it was doing its best to limit the effects on customers.
A Crédit Mutuel spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the situation relating to Servetta ""was quickly resolved once the customer sent us the requested information."" 
Reuters reported this month that European Union regulators have told some banks to scrutinise transactions by all Russian and Belarusian clients, including EU residents.
Some wealth managers in Europe have sought to distance themselves from economic and political fallout. Switzerland's Julius Baer this month began blocking new business with Russian clients, two sources familiar with the operations said. UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said all Russian passport holders have effectively become semi-sanctioned.
Julius Baer said it was not accepting new Russian clients with a Russian domicile but continued to serve existing Russian clients ""in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations or sanctions.""
Russian writer Grigory Chkhartishvili, who lives in London and whose last name is Georgian, successfully transferred a sum of money through British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) to support his Ukrainian refugee assistance charity, True Russia. 
But his wife, whose last name is Russian, was blocked by Barclays when attempting to send money to the same charity, he said. The bank requested a face-to-face interview with her. 
""My sum was ten times bigger, but it was no problem,"" Chkhartishvili said. ""It shows the atmosphere.""
Chkhartishvili said his wife, who declined to be interviewed by Reuters and asked for her name not to be made public, had told him she was able to transfer the money the next day after she called the bank and explained that she was helping Ukrainian refugees. 
Barclays did not respond to a request for comment.
A wealthy Russian oil and banking magnate, who asked not to be identified so he could speak freely about his financial situation, said he felt he had become ""collateral damage"" from Russia's invasion - which Moscow calls a ""special operation"". 
Based in London for three decades, he said he still had businesses in Russia and was anxious about greater financial restrictions, despite not being on a sanctions list.
""I have some savings,"" he said, adding he was considering selling European assets. ""You need to live out of cash ... You need to be very quiet."" 
'RUSSOPHOBIA' 
In the basement of one of his newest ventures, The White Horse pub in London's upmarket Mayfair district, Chichvarkin says he is confident his lawyers will be able to unfreeze his Swiss bank account. 
It is the only account of his that has been frozen, he said. He believes that is because it is the only one he opened with a Russian passport. 
At the same time, Chichvarkin believes his and his partner's opposition to Putin and the war, as well as their vocal support for Ukraine, has helped protect their businesses from anti-Russian hostility by customers and the public, stirred by what Fokina calls ""Putin's war"".
Still, their Michelin-starred restaurant Hide - which they own alongside wine boutique Hedonism Wines, where a bottle can cost 124,000 pounds ($163,500) - received a one-star Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) review about two weeks into the war, Fokina's assistant said.
The rare poor review, among 1,767 others that give the restaurant an average 4.5-star rating, said simply: ""Russian owned"". It has since been removed.

""You read about people cancelling Tchaikovsky concerts, people vandalising Russian food shops,"" said Fokina. ""This is London 2022. How did we get here so quickly?""

471,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 02:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Financial markets are unprepared for Bitcoin-backed bonds, according to MicroStrategy Inc. founder Michael Saylor, the most vocal advocate of companies adding the cryptocurrency to their balance sheets. 
“I’d love to see a day where people eventually sell Bitcoin-backed bonds like mortgage-backed securities,” Saylor said in an interview Tuesday after the software maker announced that it was taking a loan to buy more of the digital asset. “The market is not quite ready for that right now. The next best idea was a term loan from a major bank.”
That may serve as a warning to El Salvador, which is planning to sell about $1 billion of so-called volcano bonds that will be backed by Bitcoin. While the proposed offering has been the talk of the crypto industry since it was first proposed last year, the nation’s Bitcoin advocating president, Nayib Bukele, has delayed offering the securities. 
“There’s a lot of talk about the El Salvador Bitcoin bond,” Saylor said. “That’s a hybrid sovereign debt instrument as opposed to a pure Bitcoin-treasury play. That has its own credit risk and has nothing to do with the Bitcoin risk itself entirely.” 
The $205 million loan, which will be backed by MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings, was the best possible course for shareholders after exploring a slew of financing options, Saylor said. They included issuing Bitcoin-backed bonds, tapping DeFi or decentralized finance tools and loaning out its stash of digital assets. 
“If it was JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and it was their balance sheet at 4% interest, I’d probably do that deal. But if a hedge fund or operation doesn’t have 100 times my balance-sheet, then there’s probably theoretical counterparty risk offsetting nominal yield,” Saylor said. 
Saylor has effectively turned MicroStrategy shares into a leveraged play on Bitcoin. It owns about $5.9 billion of the cryptocurrency, based on Wednesday’s price of around $47,500.
“At every scale anybody can readily use Bitcoin as their fulcrum and leverage is plentifully available to every corporation in the world right now. Municipalities could do it,” he said. “New York can issue $2 billion of debt and buy $2 billion worth of Bitcoin -- the Bitcoin is yielding 50% or more, the debt costs 2% or less.”

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - The first quarter was a scary ride for most investors but those who stuck to a conventional '60-40' portfolio of stocks and bonds escaped relatively unscathed. 
Having endured an energy price shock after Russia invaded Ukraine, rising interest rates and U.S. bond market plunge, and wild divergent swings in stocks and commodities, investors will be glad to see the back of the first quarter.
But the benchmark, long-term '60-40' equity/fixed income investment portfolio held up reasonably well. That's because most of the pain came on the smaller bond side of the portfolio, and because the remarkable rebound on the larger stocks side late in the quarter significantly reduced overall losses.
According to Barry Gilbert at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Boston, a simple portfolio weighted 60% the S&P 500 and 40% the Bloomberg aggregate U.S. bond index lost around 4% in the January-March period. 
That was 'only' the 19th worst performance out of 185 quarters going back to 1976, when the aggregate bond index was launched. There have been 47 'down' quarters in total, the worst of all in late 2008 when losses topped 11%.
The average decline of these 'down' quarters is around 4%, roughly where the portfolio will close the current quarter.
""The first quarter was a big shock for investors. But if you're looking at 60-40, it's not good, but it's not horrible,"" Gilbert said. ""We've been a little bit spoiled by the long bull market in bonds and sometimes people forget that bonds have risk too.""
Gilbert notes that the aggregate index comprising Treasuries, investment grade corporate and mortgage-backed bonds is down around 6%, on track for the third worst quarter since 1976. S&P 500 total returns are down around 2.5%
Other cuts of the U.S. bond market show the first quarter was equally bleak historically. The Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Treasuries index lost 6% and the corporate bond index lost 9%, both the worst in at least 25 years.
Q1 Stocks & Bonds Performance https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jnvwekjrnvw/Q1totals.png
Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Natixis, notes that an index of the two-year Treasury note as measured by its weekly total return compared with a year earlier had its biggest fall ever, even worse than the bond market routs of the early 1980s and 1994. 
Yields have shot up enough, and it may be time to buy.
""A person of courage would get long the long end. The market is pricing in a lot of Fed tightening, probably too much. The slope of the curve gives me confidence that the front end will rally at some point. Perhaps sooner rather than later,"" he said.
2-Year US Treasury History https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgpomyalopd/NatixisUST.jpg
SHAFTS OF LIGHT
If the 60-40 investor is feeling any relief right now it is thanks to the rebound in stocks. As recently as March 15 the S&P 500 was down 14% year-to-date and on March 14 the Nasdaq confirmed a bear market, down 20% from its November peak.
The S&P 500 is back to within 5% of the all-time high it struck on January 4.
It was a similar picture globally. The MSCI World will end the quarter down around 4%, its worst performance since the pandemic crash two years ago. But it was also down 14% two weeks ago, and of the 47 negative quarters since the late 1980s, there have been 21 larger declines.
Valuations have come down and are closer to - although still above - long-term averages, and history suggests that stocks typically rebound after the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield falls below the two-year yield, as briefly occurred on Tuesday.
Recession risks are undoubtedly rising and inverted curves across the rates and bond markets confirm that. But imminent contraction is not in the cards, giving investors scope to push equities higher.
""Overall we find too much negativity rather than too much complacency in markets, and stay with a pro risk stance in our model portfolio,"" JP Morgan strategists wrote on Wednesday. 
Analysts at UBS note that since 1965 the S&P 500 has returned an average of 8% in the 12 months following an inversion of the 2s/10s part of the U.S. yield curve. 
Strategists at Truist IAG (LON:ICAG) calculate that the average return is 11%, based on the previous seven inversions going back to 1978.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration will make available nearly $3.2 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law to help Americans lower home energy costs, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on Wednesday.
Low-income Americans spend up to 30% of their paychecks on energy. This investment will help them afford improvements to their homes such as switching to better insulation and ventilation, installing energy efficient heating and cooling systems and upgrading lighting and appliances, she said.
""The $3.2 billion we are mobilizing today is about 10 times what we spend on retrofitting homes every year,"" Granholm said. The efficiency improvements will have an immediate impact of helping families save hundreds to thousands of dollars per year in energy bills, she said.
The current government program upgrades 38,000 homes annually. The additional amount will push that to 450,000 homes, she said.
The $3.2 billion will be distributed by the Energy Department's Weatherization Assistance Program, which takes applications from states and tribes and territories for the funding to retrofit low-income homes.
In November, President Joe Biden signed into law a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that would create jobs across the country by disbursing billions of dollars to state and local governments to fix crumbling bridges and roads and by expanding broadband internet access to millions of Americans.
In 2021, the average nominal retail electricity price paid by U.S. residential electric customers rose at the fastest rate since 2008, increasing 4.3% from 2020 to 13.72 cents per kilowatt hour, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=51438 (EIA).
Prices for most types of energy commodities rose significantly in 2021, including the cost of power generation fuels, especially natural gas, which helped push electricity prices higher, the EIA analysis shows.
The United States accounted for about 17% of the world's primary energy consumption in 2019, the EIA said, but had about 4% of the world's population. 

Biden's public approval rating fell to a new low of 40%, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted March 21 and 22, a clear warning sign for his Democratic Party as it seeks to retain control of Congress in the Nov. 8 election.
The national poll found that 54% of Americans disapprove of his job performance as the country struggles with high inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed geopolitical concerns to the fore.

475,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 01:21PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - The brief inversion of the U.S. bond yield curve on Tuesday is a cautionary sign for the Federal Reserve that may need to be factored into coming debates on management of the central bank's balance sheet, Kansas City Fed President Esther George said on Wednesday.
George said she was less concerned about what the brief, negative spread between 10-year and two-year Treasury securities signaled about a possible recession, as about the implications for financial stability and the stress it could put on bank lending models.
As the Fed plans to hike short-term interest rates, she said, that could make an inversion even more likely unless the Fed also raises long-term rates by running down its balance sheet ""significantly.""
""The balance sheet will need to decline significantly,"" she said, citing the ""distortive effects"" the Fed's nearly $9 trillion in holdings are having on financial markets. She said those holdings may have depressed 10-year Treasury yields by as much as 1.5 percentage points. ""The interaction of higher policy rates with a large balance sheet will need to be considered,"" George said. ""Raising short-term rates while the balance sheet continues to depress longer-term yields will contribute to a flattening and inversion.""
The Fed is expected to announce its plans for balance sheet reduction as early as its May meeting, with some details possibly revealed in upcoming minutes of the March meeting. 
Regarding short-term interest rates George said they could be increased in a ""steady, deliberate"" manner in coming months as the Fed tries to control inflation that has soared beyond its 2% target. 

As rates rise, George said, the Fed will have to assess how the economy is reacting to tighter financial conditions, and also how global developments including the pandemic and the war in Ukraine are influencing both the supply of goods and economic growth and demand.
""Much of the economic fallout so far has been directed towards further disruptions to supply,"" that would add to inflation, she said. But ""both of these risks have implications for demand as well...Assessing the balance in real time will be difficult. Recognizing these risks is not an argument for stalling the removal of accommodation, but it does suggest a steady, deliberate approach for the path of policy could provide space to monitor developments as they unfold.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors had hoped 2022 would be the year when the market recovery from COVID-19 finally got cemented and life started to feel a little more normal. Boy were they wrong.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine combined with supercharged global inflation have ignited talk of new geopolitical and economic world orders, setting some staggering milestones in the process.
A $10 trillion wipeout in world stocks followed by a $9 trillion recovery; a rout in bond markets; what is shaping up to be the strongest commodities rally since World War I; and the fastest rise in global interest rates in decades.
Add to that the world's largest country being gouged out the global financial system, the biggest sovereign credit rating downgrade ever seen and pastings for Japan's yen and Chinese stocks and the full picture becomes clear.
""It has been one of the most extraordinary quarters I can remember,"" said Close Brothers Asset Management's Chief Investment Officer Robert Alster. ""...We all didn't believe that Russia was going to invade Ukraine.""
However, the shocks far earlier than that, he noted. Investors suddenly grasped that the new Omicron COVID strain wasn't going to shutter the global economy, and that the world's most influential central bank, the U.S. Federal Reserve, was now serious about jacking up interest rates. 
The main driver of global borrowing costs, the 10-year Treasury yield, leapt from under 1.5% to 1.8%, knocking 5% off MSCI's world stocks index in January alone.
Fast forward to now and that yield is at 2.4%, and two-year U.S. yields have seen their biggest quarterly surge since 1981. More than 200 basis points of Fed interest rate rises are also now expected this year which, if realised, would be the most in a calendar year since 1994.
The top global stock markets will end March higher, but they are all set to record their worst quarter since the coronavirus pandemic first wreaked havoc in 2020.
Those seismic shifts have come as oil and gas prices have raced up 40%. 
Added to the 57% surge in nickel and a 31% jump in wheat prices, which have both been driven higher by the Ukraine war, and BofA's analysts estimate commodities are on course for their best year since 1915.
That ""special military operation', as Moscow terms it, has seen Russia hit with unprecedented Western sanctions and led to some of the world's biggest investment funds talking about a new world order. 
Russian companies that had shares listed in London and New York have had them removed, the rouble can't be freely traded anymore and the country's government and corporate bonds have been all been ejected from the major investment indexes. 
President Vladimir Putin has retaliated by saying ""unfriendly"" places like Europe, where Germany gets more than half its gas from Russia, will have to start paying for the stuff in roubles. 
EM ROLLERCOASTER
A broader spillover has sent waves through emerging markets, ripping into vulnerable ones but boosting others.
Egypt, which proportionally imports more wheat than any other country, has been forced to devalue its currency 15% and ask the IMF for help, as have Tunisia and a long-resistant Sri Lanka. 
Emerging market debt is having the second worst quarter on record, down nearly 10% on a total return basis, with only the 13.3% COVID-induced plunge of the first quarter of 2020 registering worse. 
Commodities heavyweights such as Brazil and South Africa meanwhile have the best performing currencies in the world, up 17% and 10% respectively since the start of the year, and Australia's dollar is top out of the advanced economies.
""This is a tectonic shift from a geopolitical point of view,"" Amundi's Head of Multi-Asset strategies, Francesco Sandrini, said.
""No one could have imagined that an entire new world order of energy should have been considered."" he added. ""Perhaps we are talking about literally the unwinding of globalisation."" 
YIELD CURVE ALERT
This week has also seen a dreaded - albeit brief - ""inversion"" of a key bit of the U.S. bond yield curve that has been a precursor of economic recessions. 
It is the first time that has happened since 2019, while the broader rise in global yields means that the $18 trillion pile of negative-yielding bonds that existed a few years ago - where investors paid for the privilege of lending - is now almost gone.
There has also been a 9% drop in Japan's 'safe-haven' yen versus the dollar this month, the biggest plunge by a G10 currency since the pound's Brexit beating of 2016.
The yen's slightly smaller 6% quarterly fall and a 2% drop by the euro means the dollar will score its third straight quarterly rise against its major peers, although it is actually down against emerging market units despite the anxiety caused by events in Ukraine.

The rouble lost nearly half its value in the immediate aftermath of the Ukraine invasion, but tight capital controls and central bank interventions since have left it down a more manageable 15% for the year.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s veteran Head of Asia Macro Strategy, Min Dai, has been left dazed by it all. ""For someone who has been following EM for most of my career, what happened in the past month is beyond belief,"" he said.

BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Germany triggered an emergency plan to manage gas supplies on Wednesday that could see Europe's largest economy ration power if a standoff over a Russian demand to pay for fuel with roubles disrupts or halts supplies.
Moscow's insistence on rouble payments for the Russian gas that meets a third of Europe's annual energy needs has galvanised others in Europe: Greece called an emergency meeting of suppliers, the Dutch government said it would urge consumers to use less gas and the French energy regulator told consumers not to panic.
The demand for roubles, which has been rejected by Group of Seven nations, is in retaliation for crippling Western sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.
Moscow, which says it is conducting a ""special military operation"" there, calls Western measures an ""economic war"".
Russia's most senior lawmaker said on Wednesday Russia could demand rouble payments also for other commodities including oil, grain, fertilisers, coal and metals, raising the risk of recession in Europe and the United States.
Moscow is expected to make public its plans for rouble payments on Thursday, although it said it would not immediately demand that buyers pay for gas exports in the currency.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have agreed in a call that experts from their countries would discuss how payment for Russian gas exports could be made in roubles, the TASS news agency reported.
Separately, Putin outlined the rouble plan in a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, Draghi's office said.
Two Russian sources told Reuters as one of the options for the switch, Russia planned to keep contract prices for gas exported to ""unfriendly"" countries but demand the payment to be done in the rouble equivalent on a pre-agreed settlement day.
Western countries have said payment in roubles would breach contracts that can take months or more to renegotiate, a prospect that has driven commodity prices higher.
It would also blunt the impact of Western curbs on Moscow's access to its foreign exchange reserves and bolster its currency.
The European Union is preparing more sanctions against the Kremlin, EU sources told Reuters on Wednesday, with their scope depending on Moscow's stance on gas payments in roubles.
INDUSTRY FIRST IN LINE FOR CUTS
Berlin's unprecedented move is the clearest sign yet that the European Union is preparing for Moscow to cut gas supplies unless it gets payment in roubles. Italy and Latvia have already activated warnings.
German Economy Minister Robert Habeck implemented the ""early warning phase"" of an existing gas emergency plan, where a crisis team from the economics ministry, the regulator and the private sector will monitor imports and storage.
Habeck told reporters Germany's gas supplies were guaranteed for now but urged consumers and companies to reduce consumption, saying that ""every kilowatt hour counts"".
If supplies fall short, Germany's network regulator can ration gas, with industry first in line for cuts and preferential treatment for private households, hospitals and other critical institutions.
Even without the threat of gas shortages, Germany could face recession as climbing energy costs have already forced companies, including makers of steel and chemicals, to curtail production.
German industry association BDI on Wednesday asked for government support, including loans and state participations, to prevent firms from going bust, while government's economic advisers slashed this year's growth forecast because of the Ukraine crisis. {nL2N2VX1PL]
Half of Germany's 41.5 million households use natural gas for heating while industry account for roughly a third of national demand. Russia is Germany's top gas supplier, accounting for 40% of imports in the first quarter of 2022. Berlin has pledged to end its energy dependency on Moscow but it will not achieve that before mid-2024, according to Habeck.
Europe faced an energy crunch even before Russian troops entered Ukraine on Feb. 24, with European Union gas storage levels at about 26% of total capacity, below normal levels at this time of year.
The European Commission, which said on Wednesday it would work closely with member states to prepare for any gas shortages, has proposed legislation requiring countries to fill levels to at least 80% by November but that would be almost impossible without Russian supplies.
The 80% target would not apply if the European Commission declared an EU-wide or regional gas supply emergency - which it can do if at least two countries declare an emergency first.
'EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE'
Jean-François Carenco, head of the energy regulator in France, far less dependent on Russian gas than Germany, thanks to gas and liquefied natural gas sourced elsewhere and its reliance on nuclear power plants, r power generation, said the country should not encounter any supply issues.
""Everything will be fine, the gas storage facilities are well filled, we'll make it through the winter,"" he told BFM TV.
Greece was set to hold an emergency meeting of its energy regulator, gas transmission operator and its biggest gas and power suppliers on Wednesday to assess its supply security in case Russia stops supplies.
The Dutch government said it would launch a campaign to get consumers to use less gas.
Investors are watching to see how the dispute over Russia's insistence on rouble payments plays out as consumers in Europe grapple with energy prices that have forced governments to announce fiscal relief measures.
This month has been the most expensive month for power prices in European history, although markets are set to end the month at lower levels than at the start of March.
After Germany's announcement, German year-ahead wholesale electricity set a three-week high of 185 euros per megawatt hour, up 6.3%..

Kerstin Andreae, head of the Federal Association of the Energy and Water Industry (BDEW), said Germany should have clear plans for how the government would deal with a gas delivery stoppage that forced rationing.
""We must now take concrete measures to prepare for the emergency level, because in case of a stoppage things would have to move fast,"" Andreae said.

A third straight weekly decline in gasoline demand brought the rolling four-week average to 8.76 million barrels a day last week, down by more than 4% compared with the same time in 2019, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show. 
Pump prices have hovered above $4.20 a gallon since hitting a record high earlier this month after Russian’s invasion of Ukraine tightened global oil supplies. High fuel costs are a key component of surging inflation and have become a key political challenge to President Joe Biden.
The U.S. driving season typically begins in March with spring break and lasts through the summer. The drop in demand helped lift U.S. gasoline stockpiles above prior-year norms.

PALMERDALE, Ala. (Reuters) - North of Birmingham, a gravel road bed slices through a series of steep ridges, part of a stalled effort to carve a 52-mile freeway around the rural fringes of Alabama's largest city.
Construction stopped five years ago on the road, dubbed the Birmingham Northern Beltline, after federal funding ran out. Critics have labeled the project a ""dinosaur,"" a ""zombie"" and a ""black hole"". Barely a mile of it has been started, and Alabama officials haven't provided the billions it would take to finish it.
But the bulldozers could soon be moving again, thanks to U.S. taxpayers. At least $369 million in federal funding for the Beltline is headed Alabama's way from a massive infrastructure package approved by Congress in November. That $1 trillion deal - the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act - allowed Democratic President Joe Biden to fulfill a campaign promise to fix the nation's crumbling bridges, roads and airports.
It's also a big win for Alabama's senior U.S. senator, Richard Shelby, a Republican who has worked for decades to carve out Washington dollars for the Beltline. Shelby voted ""no"" on Biden's infrastructure package, arguing that it should have included military projects. The Beltline will get its funding all the same.
Shelby declined to comment for this story.
Other Beltline supporters portray the federal support as money still owed to Alabama from Democratic President Lyndon Johnson's 1960s War on Poverty, which promised to help impoverished residents of the Appalachian mountains. At the southern end of that range lie the blue-collar exurbs and rural hamlets north of Birmingham.
""This is the continuation of a promise made,"" said Ron Kitchens, chief executive officer of the Birmingham Business Alliance, an economic development group.
Opponents of the Beltline, meanwhile, are incensed that a gusher of cash is set to revive a dormant project that even local planning officials once ranked as a middling priority. Environmentalists say the Beltline would encourage sprawl and threaten wild areas - the antithesis of Biden's green agenda.
""It's a true dinosaur of a pork barrel project,"" said Nelson Brooke of Black Warrior Riverkeeper, a local environmental group. ""It's a perfect example of what shouldn't be happening with this new money.""
Biden's administration is writing the check, but it has little say over Alabama's project, which is funded through a special account for highways in the region. Nancy Singer, a spokesperson for the Federal Highway Administration, said states that receive that money control those projects as long as they comply with federal rules.
PHANTOM FREEWAY
The Beltline isn't the only controversial aspect of Biden's infrastructure deal. Many Democrats groused that it favors freeways over transit, while some Republicans derided it as a wasteful grab bag of Democratic priorities.
Alabama's phantom freeway might never have made it past the blueprint stage if not for Shelby, a Birmingham native who has served in Congress since 1979. His name adorns government facilities across Alabama, a testament to his skill at steering federal dollars to a state where household income ranks 46th of the 50 U.S. states.
Starting around the turn of the century, Shelby and other members of Alabama's congressional delegation secured money for the Beltline through ""earmarking,"" a budget process that ensured the highway got dedicated funding without having to compete with other projects.
But the real breakthrough came in 2003, when Shelby got the Beltline added to the Appalachian Development Highway System, a road network aimed at reducing isolation in the mountainous region stretching from northern Alabama to western New York. The system was largely complete at that point, so Shelby's move ensured Alabama would get a larger share of the dollars going to that network.
Then came a series of corruption scandals that spurred federal lawmakers to crack down on what many saw as wasteful spending nationwide. Congress banned earmarks in 2010. Two years later, it eliminated funding for the Appalachian highway system amid criticism by legislators such as Representative Jared Polis, a Democrat who now serves as governor of Colorado, who called the Beltline a ""zombie highway"" and the ""Alabama Porkway.""
With those two funding streams cut, the Beltline had to compete for money on its own merits. But the highway was not deemed particularly urgent by the Birmingham Metropolitan Planning Organization, a regional governmental body. In a 2010 report, it ranked the Beltline 36th out of 54 transportation proposals, concluding it would do little to ease traffic congestion.
Beltline proponents say the road could help the thinly populated northern exurbs draw the sorts of shopping malls and housing developments that have proliferated to the south of the city since the 1970s. But the Alabama Department of Transportation in 2012 estimated that, once completed, the Beltline would boost the population in nearby towns by just 1.5%.
Environmental groups in 2011 sued unsuccessfully to stop the project, saying the Beltline would harm wildlife like the vermilion darter fish, which is found nowhere else in the world. The highway would cross 125 streams and require construction teams to level more than 4,000 acres (1,619 hectares) of forest.
But business groups and dozens of local politicians continued to advocate for the road. By the time it broke ground in 2014, Federal Highway Administration figures indicated that, at a cost of $5.4 billion, it would be the priciest highway project in the country on a per-mile basis, though subsequent estimates have been lower. State officials estimated at the time it would take 40 years to complete.
Two years later, construction ground to a halt when federal money ran out. At that point, $162 million had been spent to produce a partially built, 1.3-mile (2 km) stretch of roadway.
Most U.S. highways are built with a mix of federal and state money. But Alabama chose not to tap state accounts for the Beltline, instead focusing on maintaining existing roads and expanding capacity elsewhere. No work has been done since.
""People are tired of dribbling money into a black hole,"" said Sarah Stokes, a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which opposes the project.
On a recent weekday afternoon, signs of decay were evident at the construction site near Palmerdale, a hamlet of 5,400 residents 17 miles (27 kilometers) northeast of Birmingham. Rainstorms had etched gullies into the gravel roadbed, and a 20-foot-tall (6 meters) chinaberry tree sprouted from a concrete retaining wall at the top of a ridge. Tire tracks, trash and a bullet-riddled tin can littered the site.
BACK ON TRACK
But patience - and seniority - pay off in Washington. Shelby got funding renewed for the Appalachian highway network in 2019, when he headed the powerful Senate committee that handles spending.
Then came the bipartisan infrastructure package. Lawmakers from Appalachian states, led by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, inserted $1.25 billion for the highway network into the deal. Alabama is due to get $369 million, the largest share.
Much more will be needed. The Appalachian Regional Commission, a government body, estimated last year that it would cost $3.1 billion to finish the Beltline, and the state said in 2019 that it would take until 2045 to complete just one-third of the road. Experts say such estimates can fluctuate widely due to changing labor costs, interest rates and other factors.
As before, Alabama does not plan to put its own money into the project. Budget experts say that is telling.
""It's not that critical of a project,"" said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington watchdog group. ""Otherwise the state and local interests would have found a way to fund this.""
Birmingham-area officials say they are negotiating for the state and local governments to chip in. Stan Hogeland, mayor of Gardendale, a city of 16,000 residents along the Beltline's path, believes the road could speed commute times and attract manufacturers serving the state's auto industry.
""I hope it hurries up and gets through,"" Hogeland said.
Others see it as yet another highway designed to steer investment away from Black-majority cities such as Birmingham.

Anna Brown, an activist who sits on an advisory board for the planning commission, said it would be better to send the money back to Washington.
""Everything free ain't always good for you,"" Brown said of the federal funds. ""Just because it's free doesn't mean it's going to be beneficial.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A second U.S. banking regulator has laid out how it thinks banks should guard themselves against risks emanating from climate change.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) published draft principles that would direct bank boards and senior management to develop robust frameworks to measure and guard against climate-related financial risk.
The proposal, which mirrors one published in December by another bank regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is the latest example of U.S. policymakers working to build protect the U.S. financial system from the impacts of climate change.
The potential effects of climate change - rising sea levels, worsening floods and fires, and government policies transitioning away from carbon-heavy industry - could destroy trillions of dollars of assets around the globe. 
""These climate-related financial risks pose a clear and significant risk to the U.S. financial system and, if improperly assessed and managed, may pose a threat to safe and sound banking and financial stability,"" said acting FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg in a statement. 

Like the OCC draft, the FDIC's principles envision a sweeping plan by banks to incorporate climate-related risk management into every part of their business. 
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is building out its own ""scenario analysis"" to measure potential climate-related losses at large banks. Reuters previously reported large banks expect such government-run analysis could begin as soon as 2023.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Kremlin indicated on Wednesday that all of Russia's energy and commodity exports could be priced in roubles, toughening President Vladimir Putin's attempt to make the West feel the pain of the sanctions it imposed for the invasion of Ukraine. 
With Russia's economy facing its gravest crisis since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, Putin on March 23 hit back at the West, ordering that Russian gas exports should be paid for in roubles.
That move forced Germany, Europe's biggest economy, to declare on Wednesday an ""early warning"" that it could be heading for a supply emergency. Germany imported 55% of its gas from Russia last year.
In the strongest signal yet that Russia could be preparing an even tougher response to the West's sanctions, Russia's top lawmaker suggested on Wednesday that almost Russia's entire energy and commodity exports could soon be priced in roubles. 
Asked about the comments by parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""This is an idea that should definitely be worked on.""
""It may well be worked out,"" Peskov said of the proposal.
Peskov said that the U.S. dollar's role as a global reserve currency had already taken a hit, and that a move to pricing Russia's biggest exports in roubles would be ""in our interests and the interests of our partners.""
Europe, which imports about 40% of its gas from Russia and pays mostly in euros, says Russia's state-controlled gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) is not entitled to redraw contracts.
""If you want gas, find roubles,"" Volodin said in a post on Telegram. ""Moreover, it would be right - where it is beneficial for our country - to widen the list of export products priced in roubles to include: fertiliser, grain, food oil, oil, coal, metals, timber etc.""
ROUBLE GAMBLE
Russia exports several hundred billion dollars worth of natural gas to Europe each year. Euros account for 58% of Gazprom exports, U.S. dollars 39% and sterling around 3%, according to the company.
Peskov said Russia will give buyers time to switch to roubles.
Still, the exact way in which payments could be made remained unclear as of Wednesday. Russia is trying to both bolster the rouble and, in the longer run, chip away at the dominance of the dollar in pricing global energy and commodities.
To have any hope of achieving that, Russia would need help from China, the world's second-largest economy.
""China is willing to work with Russia to take China-Russian ties to a higher level in a new era under the guidance of the consensus reached by the heads of state,"" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says that Russia's relations with China are at their strongest level ever.
SANCTIONS 'BOOMERANG' 
Russian officials have repeatedly said the West's attempt to isolate one of the world's biggest producers of natural resources is an irrational act of self harm that will lead to soaring prices for consumers and tip Europe and the United States into recession.
Russia says the sanctions - and in particular the freezing of about $300 billion in Russian central bank reserves - amount to a declaration of economic war. 
Former President Dmitry Medvedev said the sanctions had ""boomeranged"" back to undermine European and North America economies, driving up prices for fuel and heating and eroding confidence in the dollar and euro.
""The world is waking up: confidence in reserve currencies is melting like a morning fog,"" Medvedev said. ""Abandoning the dollar and the euro as the world's main reserves no longer looks like a fantasy.""
Medvedev said ""crazy politicians"" in the West had sacrificed the interests of their taxpayers on the altar of an unknown victory in Ukraine. ""The era of regional currencies is coming.""

Russia has long sought to reduce dependence on the U.S. currency, though its main exports - oil, gas and metals - are priced in dollars on global markets.
Globally, the dollar is by far the most traded currency, followed by the euro, yen and British pound.

Esquivel, so far the most dovish member of the Bank of Mexico's board, said the bank expected inflation would peak in the second quarter of this year, but would only converge towards its 3% target towards the first three months of 2024.
""It will be a long, slow process, slower than we would have liked,"" he said in the podcast.
The board member suggested interest rates in Mexico could in 2023 be a ""little bit higher"" than at present.
But he also noted that the fact the Bank of Mexico did not cut its interest rates to zero, or near zero, before the current tightening cycle, and had begun raising interest rates ahead of other central banks, could give it more room for maneuver.

""It may be that we have a little more space to not have to adopt a monetary stance that is as restrictive as perhaps other countries are going to have to,"" Esquivel said.
The central banker noted that inflationary pressures that had started mounting with the COVID-19 pandemic increased after Russia invaded Ukraine a month ago.

Russia's retail sector has been upended by Western economic sanctions and decisions by firms such as H&M, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) to curb their activity in Russia. 
Speaking at a televised government meeting, Mishustin said ""parallel imports"" were needed to ensure that certain goods could continue to be shipped to Russia.
""This approach will guarantee the shipment of goods to our country, ... in spite of the unfriendly actions of foreign politicians,"" he said.
Which goods can be imported to Russia in this way will be determined by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Mishustin added. 
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS), which had prepared draft regulations on parallel imports, said the measure ""will develop competition between brands through an increase in the number of businesses that import goods to Russia, which will lead to a decrease in retail prices for these goods"".
Russia, which faces its deepest economic crisis in more than two decades owing to an unprecedented barrage of Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict, has proposed a raft of support measures to buttress its economy. 

Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. 
Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance, and the West hopes the sanctions it has imposed will force Russia to withdraw.

Supermarkets had been calling for legal backing for such rationing, which was announced by the government has part of an emergency package to mitigate the economic fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and will be in place until June 30.
The move came after the war in Ukraine and a three-week truckers' strike led to sporadic shortages of staples such as eggs, milk, flour and sunflower oil, though shortages were often caused more by hoarding than by actual supply disruptions. 
""It provides legal backing so that they can limit the number of articles and thus avoid hoarding, but above all, so that there is fair access for all consumers,"" Trade Minister Reyes Maroto told reporters.
Some supermarkets in Greece and Italy have been restricting the quantities customers can buy of some staples after seeing demand rise due to worries the Ukraine conflict could disrupt supplies.
Spanish authorities and supermarket associations warned against panic purchases during a transport strike that started on March 14. Although one association has not called off the strike yet, it has lost momentum after the government granted a 1 billion euro ($1.10 billion) support package.
Two years ago, as European governments were preparing lockdowns to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, some Spanish supermarkets rationed some products in response to panic-buying of items such as toilet paper, but the government did not sanction it.
Earlier this month, consumer association Facua sued some Spanish supermarkets for breaking the law after they limited the purchase of sunflower oil to a few bottles per person. Ukrainian sunflower oil accounted for 40% of imports. 

""We are also responding to a need that the distribution sector has expressed to us and which has become clear with the recent transport strike,"" Maroto added.
Dairy farmers and industry association Inlac, which stopped production during the strike as milk could not be transported, said on Wednesday they hoped supplies would be back to normal in between three days and a week's time.

(Reuters) -Russian gold miners Polymetal and Petropavlovsk warned on Wednesday of increasing hurdles in doing business, including higher operating costs and continued challenges repaying loans to sanctioned banks.
Petropavlovsk said it was in early talks with its main lender, the sanctioned Russian bank Gazprombank, to restructure its debt after being unable to make repayments. It has also been unable to sell its gold.
The company, whose top investor is Russian billionaire Sergey Sudarikov, said any restructuring of its debt would have to be within the limitations of the sanctions.
A spokesman for Petropavlovsk said it was in talks with Gazprombank and its advisers and that it was too early to comment on the way forward.
Meanwhile, Polymetal said some gold projects were facing delays of between three months to a year. The company is also cutting some exploration budgets as it faces higher costs after being forced to change freight service providers.
But demand for gold in Russia has been boosted by local retail investment, it said in a statement. 
There has been a surge in interest in gold and buying physical gold over the past four weeks in Russia because of the sanctions. The removal of value-added tax this month on purchases of the yellow precious metal has further bolstered demand, a spokesperson added.
Western sanctions on Russian entities in response to its invasion of Ukraine have disrupted several businesses and livelihoods in Russia and pose a challenge to non-sanctioned Russian companies that are looking to circumvent the new regulations.
Shares in London-listed Polymetal and Petropavlovsk have fallen by more than 60% since Russia launched what it called a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine more than one month ago.
While the two miners were facing ""contrasting fortunes,"" Petropavlovsk appears to be facing an ""existential crisis,"" said A.J. Bell analyst Russ Mould in London.
""A gold producer which can't sell gold doesn't look a very sustainable proposition. ... Having (Sudarikov) as such a dominant shareholder probably doesn't help the company too much in the short term,"" Mould said of Petropavlovsk.
Sudarikov, through his REGION brand of businesses, disclosed a stake of just over 29% in the miner earlier this month, regulatory filings show. REGION is also a shareholder in the sanctioned Credit Bank of Moscow, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
Shares in Polymetal reversed early gains to fall 7% by 1320 GMT, while those in Petropavlosk tumbled 21%.
In a positive development for Polymetal, the company said it had resumed gold sales in Russia after shipments were initially hit after terminated agreements with logistics providers.

It added that sanctions have not had a material impact on business but did not rule out the possibility of sanctions on the company itself, which is partly owned by Russian businessman Alexander Nesis.
Polymetal maintains $500 million of undrawn credit lines from non-sanctioned Russian lenders.

""The economy will expand at rates below its potential in 2022 and 2023, with contractions in private consumption and investment,"" the central bank said in a statement.
It also predicated that annual inflation would reach 8.2% this year, above the central bank's tolerance range and up from a previous estimate of 4.5%.
The central bank said the rise in consumer prices was a response to the ""excessive increase in spending"" in recent quarters, which was supported by COVID-19 stimulus programs. 
On Tuesday, the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points to 7%, as it rapidly withdraws the monetary stimulus that followed the start of the pandemic in March 2020.
""The rise in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) has been fast and significant, but the risks of convergence and inflation persist,"" the central bank said. 
It predicted, however, that ""inflation will begin to converge to the target in the two-year horizon"" in the latter part of 2022. 

The report also estimated that private consumption and gross fixed capital formation will contract in the 2022-2023 period.

Earlier, Germany declared an ""early warning"" of a possible gas supply emergency which was designed to prepare for the risk of disruption or stoppage of flows from Russia. 
""Everything will be fine, the gas storage facilities are well filled, we'll make it through the winter,"" CRE head Jean-François Carenco told France's BFM TV.
Germany's announcement is the clearest sign yet that the European Union is preparing for supply disruptions after imposing sanction on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
The move comes as Moscow plans to introduce a new mechanism to switch payment for its gas to roubles and the European Commission has said it will work closely with EU countries to prepare for possible supply issues.
Laurence Poirier-Dietz, head of France's leading natural gas distribution operator GRDF, told Les Echos newspaper that the country was bracing for possible Russian-linked supply disruption next winter.
""In case there is a total or partial suspension of Russian gas imports, which would be unprecedented, GRDF is ready to take exceptional measures to reduce consumption (...), "" she was quoted as saying.
GRDF distributes natural gas to more than 11 million customers every day for heating, cooking, mobility and industrial processes.
Among those customers, only large industrial clients or shopping malls would be asked, if needed, to reduce their demand, Poirier-Dietz said. Individual customers, public services and the military would be exempted from such a move.

Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Europe 1 radio that France was preparing for ""all possible scenarios"", including Russia halting gas exports to Europe.
""We must work on emergency solutions in case this decision is taken, even if this is not the central scenario,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Germany's two-year bond yield hit its highest since 2014 on Wednesday, rising hard and fast into positive yield territory, as a fresh surge in German and Spanish inflation bolstered expectations the ECB may have to hike rates sooner rather than later to curb price pressures.
A day after rising above 0% for the first time since 2014, Germany's two-year bond yield was last up 10 basis points (bps) at 0.066% - a new high. 
Across the single currency bloc, benchmark 10-year bond yields too were 7-8 bps higher on the day, as inflation numbers raised rate-hike prospects.
Spanish consumer prices rose 9.8% year-on-year in March, their fastest pace since May 1985, while German annual inflation rose above 7% to its highest level in more than 40 years in March.
""We have huge numbers for inflation from Spain and parts of Germany, which is not something people would have forecast two or three months ago,"" said Ludovic Colin, a senior portfolio manager at Swiss asset manager Vontobel. 
""It's hard to forecast things in the short-term and that's why we have a panic in yields and it's hard to say where yields are going and when they will stop.""
Bond markets across major economies have had their worst sell off in years. Two-year German bond yields are up 56 bps in March and set for this biggest monthly jump since 2008. 
And while European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde on Wednesday said food and energy prices in the bloc should stop rising, others pushed the case for higher rates. 
ECB policymaker Peter Kazimir said the first rate hike could come this year, while it would be possible under the ECB's forward guidance for it to raise rates in September and December as long as it stops its bond purchases before then, fellow policymaker Robert Holzmann said.
Euro zone money markets price in almost 70 basis points of ECB tightening this year.
Chris Scicluna, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets, said the ECB was likely to hike in 25 bps instead of 10 bps increments as it has done in the past.
""We don't see the need to move in smaller increments this time around,"" he said, adding: ""I think there's a desire to get at least up to a zero deposit rate.""
The ECB's depo rate is at -0.5%, the ECB last hiked rates in 2011.
Germany's 10-year Bund yield was 7 bps higher on the day at 0.71%, near four-year highs hit on Tuesday. Italian yields also jumped 7 bps.

U.S. bond markets were also in focus a day after the closely watched U.S. 2-year/10-year Treasury yield curve briefly inverted for the first time since September 2019 in a sign that recession risks were rising. 
That spread was last at around 8 bps.

China will refrain from introducing measures not conducive to stabilise market expectations, and it will step up the issuance of the rest of the special government bonds.
The government has set this year's quota for local government special bond issuance at 3.65 trillion yuan ($574.73 billion), and 1.46 trillion yuan has already been issued in advance quota.

The issuance of the special government bonds will be first given to regions with strong debt repayment ability and large number of projects, according to remarks at the cabinet meeting. It will also encourage foreign capital to purchase government bonds.

Leveraged transactions (LT) have grown to a 500 billion-euro-pile on the books of the euro zone's 28 largest lenders from 300 billion euros in 2018 as record-low interest rates made banks seek returns in riskier parts of the market. 
In a letter to the chief executive offiers of the 115 banks on his watch, the ECB chief supervisor Andrea Enria said lenders should tighten their controls on this type of business and ease up on the riskiest deals, known as 'highly leveraged transactions' (HLT).
He also criticised banks' cavalier attitudes towards these loans, saying many had not even set a cap on HLTs, or if they did, it was too permissive.

This posed a risk to the sector at a time when the economy was slowing due to the war in Ukraine and interest rates were expected to rise to fight surprisingly high inflation. 
""High levels of LT exposure on banks’ balance sheets leave them vulnerable to renewed shocks, which could arise from unexpected and sharp economic slowdowns or higher than expected interest payments,"" Enria said in the letter https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/letterstobanks/shared/pdf/2022/ssm.2022_letter_on_leveraged_transactions.en.pdf?1dd5c0299bf7b93080e4b383bccb023c.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Europe's economy is increasingly strained by Russia's war in Ukraine as growth stalls, confidence plummets and inflation soars, data and warnings from policymakers made clear on Wednesday.
Sanctions on Russia following its invasion last month have pushed energy prices to record highs across the continent, sapping confidence and raising the risk of another recession, even before some states have recovered from a COVID-fuelled downturn.
Germany, the bloc's biggest economy and one of the most reliant on Russian energy, will be among the hardest hit and the government's council of economic advisers on Wednesday more than halved their growth forecast for this year, to 1.8%.
""The risk of a recession is substantial,"" Volker Wieland, one of the panel's members said, adding the economy would now take until the third quarter to return to its pre-pandemic size. 
The advisers, whose forecasts guide the government in setting fiscal policy, also predicted that German inflation would double to over 6%.
As the government triggered an emergency plan for possible gas rationing should supplies from Russia be disrupted or stopped, Wieland said Germany should work to end its dependence on Russian energy, possibly through a longer-than-anticipated nuclear energy programme.
This would push up inflation for now but improve the long-term security of the country and the economy's stability, he said.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde also warned that, as the conflict drags on, Europe's economy could suffer more than feared just a few weeks ago.
""The longer the war lasts, the higher the economic costs will be and the greater the likelihood we end up in more adverse scenarios,"" she said in a speech. 
In Vienna, Austria's central bank cut its growth forecast and sharply raised its inflation outlook for this year, saying its new predictions would worsen further if the war dragged on.
STAGFLATION DILEMMA
Lagarde said households were already becoming more pessimistic and businesses could soon be postponing investment. 
Her warning was underlined by a sentiment indicator that showed the war had sent consumer confidence in the euro zone plummeting and inflation expectations to record highs.
The European Commission's economic sentiment index dropped to 108.5 in March from a downwardly revised 113.9 in February, while consumer confidence plunged to -18.7 from -8.8. 
The biggest hit to confidence came from inflation, which is sapping consumer spending power, even as governments quickly roll out subsidies to ease some of the pain. 
In Spain, one of the bloc's biggest economies, inflation accelerated to 9.8% in March, the fastest pace since May 1985, from 7.6% in February.
German price growth meanwhile soared past expectations to hit 7.6%, a level not seen since the early 1980s, suggesting that the euro zone reading on Friday is almost certain to exceed economists' 6.6% forecast. 
""Those inflation numbers were absolute whoppers, big big upside surprise to the numbers,"" Chris Scicluna, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets, said. 
Stagnating growth coupled with high inflation - stagflation in economic jargon - leaves Lagarde's ECB in a dilemma.
While the central bank would normally tighten policy to fight inflation, such a move could exacerbate a recession, hurting consumers even more.
To mitigate the risk, Lagarde promised to move only by small increments, without making longer-term commitments. 
""Gradualism means that we will move carefully and adjust our policy as we receive feedback on our actions,"" she said.

This policy dilemma could in turn divide the ECB's rate setting Governing Council even more, as conservatives are already calling for a hike to combat high inflation. 
""Unless ... the war ...becomes a global conflict, then I think that the first rise (of rates) could come towards the end of this year,"" ECB policymaker Peter Kazimir said.

The advisers, whose forecasts guide the German government in setting fiscal policy, cut their 2022 economic growth forecast to 1.8% from 4.6%, adding output would not reach its pre-pandemic level before the third quarter of the year.
In 2023, Germany's gross domestic product should grow by 3.6%, the four advisers said.
""We haven't tried to calculate the exact probability of a recession,"" council member Volker Wieland told a news conference.
""For example, we don't know if there will be a supply freeze or whether the West can no longer avoid imposing an energy embargo. But these are possibilities. So, the risk is substantial,"" Wieland said.
He added that unlike the U.S. economy, Germany still had not fully recovered from the coronavirus pandemic.
The advisers said Germany was on track for further economic recovery before Russia invaded its neighbour on Feb. 24.
""The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine has now drastically worsened economic conditions,"" they said in a statement.
The war further frayed supply chains that had already been strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a surge in natural gas and crude oil prices hurt companies and private consumption, they said.
The council forecast inflation to reach 6.1% in 2022 before easing to 3.4% next year.
A potential escalation of the conflict and additional sanctions could have a significantly greater impact on the German and European economies, the experts warned.

""We have to change course and use all levers to become less dependent on Russian raw material supplies,"" Wieland told Reuters, adding he favoured extending the life of German nuclear power plants.
The country's three remaining nuclear power plants are scheduled to be shut down by the end of the year, and the government has so far vehemently opposed extending their life-span as a way of reducing its reliance on Russian gas.

Inflation in Spain hit 9.8% this month and it expected to have run above 7% in the bloc's largest economy Germany, setting up the euro zone for another record high when bloc-wide data is published on Friday.
Lagarde said the inflation outlook was ""fluid"" as an ongoing war in Ukraine forced economists to constantly revise their economic forecasts.
But she expected energy and food prices, which have scaled new highs since Russia's invasion, to stabilise, albeit at high levels.
""We know you will see higher inflation this year, there is no question about that,"" Lagarde said. ""But we are also seeing some of those factors that fuel inflation today, energy and food, that will stay high. But we don't forecast them - not predict - to continue to move higher and higher."" 
She acknowledged the euro zone was facing slower growth and higher inflation but still thought it could avoid ""stagflation"", which she defined as ""a recession of the economy on a sustainable basis and inflation high and continuing to rise"".

The ECB is winding back years of ultra-aggressive stimulus in the face of surprisingly high inflation but it has yet to raise interest rates - unlike many of its peers including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. 
The euro zone's central bank said its bond-buying programme, designed to pump cash into the financial system, would end in the summer and would be followed by its first rate hike more than a decade some time after that.

LONDON (Reuters) -Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said on Wednesday that policymakers should be clear about how they plan to react to changes in the economy, but he warned against types of guidance that risked being viewed as promises about the future.
The BoE wrong-footed many investors last year over its next moves on interest rates, prompting officials to take stock of their communication strategy.
Governor Andrew Bailey said in November he could imagine going back to the days of offering no forward guidance.
Broadbent, in a speech marking the 25th anniversary of the Monetary Policy Committee, said there was value in guidance which clearly explained how the BoE planned to react now to incoming news on the economy.
But he was sceptical about other forms of guidance. 
Attempts by a central bank to steer expectations about how it might react in future - such as by publishing a plan for future interest rates - risked being viewed as promise, with a cost to credibility when things pan out differently.
He said the BoE's first attempt at forward guidance in 2013 under former governor Mark Carney - which linked future interest rate moves to the unemployment rate - was too convoluted.
""Expectations of future interest rates affect current demand and policymakers clearly have an interest in their behaving appropriately as economic news comes in,"" Broadbent said in his speech at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a think tank.
There were many ways of doing this, whether in the form of speeches, simulations or even published interest rate paths.
""But whatever the medium, monetary authorities need always to think that the message – not least the point that future policy will depend on how the outlook for inflation evolves – is well understood,"" Broadbent said.
Answering questions after his speech, he said research showed people could understand even conditional communications over policy if they were rooted in the real world. 
""But the more abstract they are, they fail to come across and I think (the forward guidance in 2013) was one which was didn't pass muster,"" Broadbent said.
""And so I think that is that is a lesson that they really have to be clear.""
Broadbent also spoke briefly about the surge in inflation that might reach almost 9% - more than four times the BoE's 2% target - according to the government's fiscal forecasters, due mostly to the leap in global energy prices.

""As a big net importer of manufactures and commodities it's doubtful that the UK has ever experienced an external hit to real national income on this scale,"" he said. 
""From the narrow perspective of monetary policy it will result in the near term in the difficult combination of even higher inflation but weaker domestic demand and output growth.""

1. Peace hopes downplayed as shelling continues.
Ukraine’s President and western officials poured cold water on suggestions that Russia’s withdrawal of forces from around Kyiv signaled a quick end to hostilities.
The White House said that “no one should be fooled” by Russian claims of a de-escalation around Kyiv, which came after Ukrainian forces recaptured the satellite towns of Irpin and Makariv. President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, said that positive talk “doesn’t silence the explosions of Russian shells” in much of the rest of the country.
The Kremlin that it saw little sign of encouragement from the Ukrainian side except in as much as it was now prepared to put its demands on paper – something that Moscow itself has not yet done.
2. Germany takes steps toward gas rationing; inflation surges to new highs 
Europe’s largest economy took the first steps toward rationing natural gas supplies as it braced for a cut-off of Russian shipments from the start of April.
That’s the deadline that Russian President Vladimir Putin has set for European buyers to start paying for their gas in rubles rather than euros, something that would undermine sanctions on Russia’s central bank and state-controlled commercial banks. G7 ministers unanimously rejected that demand earlier in the week.
Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck said the government has activated the first “early warning” stage of a three-stage emergency plan, the final stage of which would lead to rationing and an immediate impact on German industry, given that household demand will be given priority.
The announcement came on the same day that sharp rises in energy prices drove German inflation to a new high in March. Data from the country’s largest federal states showed the annual CPI running at close to 8%. A preliminary estimate for German inflation is due later in the day. Elsewhere in Europe, inflation in Spain hit 9.8%, its highest in nearly 40 years.
3. Stocks set to open lower despite Micron, Lulu results; ADP data eyed
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower, giving up some but by no means all of the gains that they made on Tuesday in reaction to signs of progress toward a ceasefire in Ukraine.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 124 points, or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down by 0.5%. The three main cash indices had gained between 1% and 1.8% on Tuesday.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and athleisure wear group Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), both of which reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings after the close on Tuesday.
The data calendar is headed by the latest revisions to fourth-quarter GDP figures, which will be largely historical. Of more current importance will be the development in mortgage applications and rates, and the ADP private payrolls survey for March, which is due at 8:15 AM ET.
4. Crypto heist
Hackers have stolen over $600 million worth of cryptocurrency from the network behind the game Axie Infinity.
Ronin Network, a program through which players can transfer money into and out of Axie, said it had uncovered a security breach that took place nearly a week ago, in which 173,600 ether and $25 million of USD Coin had been taken from its system.
The heist is one of the biggest in the crypto space and will revive long-standing concerns about custody vulnerabilities in the asset class. It comes a couple of months after the Department of Justice brought charges against two people in connection with the Bitfinex heist, a development that appeared to reassure users that the transparency of blockchain networks was an effective defense against such thefts.
5. Oil rebounds after rout as U.S. inventories fall again  
Crude oil prices rebounded on the prospect of a worsening standoff between Europe and Russia on the issue of energy supplies.
That follows a sharp fall on Tuesday caused by hopes for peace in Ukraine and – more significantly – falling demand in China due to the Covid-19 lockdowns imposed by various local authorities -  including the city of Shanghai.
Prices had already found a short-term bottom on Tuesday after the American Petroleum Institute reported another 3 million-barrel drop in crude inventories last week, which may or may not be corroborated by the government’s data due at 10:30 AM ET.
By 6:25 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 1.8% at $106.11 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 1.7% at $109.55 a barrel.",,,,,

The investment bank lowered the price forecasts for 2022 and 2025 to a drop of 5% each year, from previous forecasts of flat for both years. For 2023 and 2024, it maintained its prediction of a 5% drop. 
Hong Kong, ranked by survey company Demographia as the world's most unaffordable housing market for the 12th consecutive year, posted a 2.9% decline in home prices so far this year, with prices dropping at a faster pace in February to their lowest since January 2021.
Home prices more than doubled over the last decade and reached an all-time high in September. They were largely resilient during the mass protests that convulsed the city in 2019 and through the pandemic over the last two years, supported by robust demand and lower interest rates.

Goldman Sachs said in a report dated on Monday it expected HIBOR, on which most mortgages in Hong Kong are based, to rise around 270 basis points through 2024, sending mortgage rates higher to around 3.8% from a low of around 1.46% in the fourth quarter of 2021, and property prices could decline as a result.
""Every 25bp rate hike would need c.5% rise in income or 5% decline to property price to maintain affordability at the pre-rate hike state,"" it said in the report.

499,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 06:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. trade chief Katherine Tai said it was time to forget about changing China’s behavior and instead take a more defensive posture toward the world’s second-biggest economy.
In remarks distributed before she testifies before a congressional committee Wednesday, Tai said talks last year with China on a so-called phase one trade agreement reached under President Donald Trump failed to produce results. 
“The United States has repeatedly sought and obtained commitments from China, only to find that follow-through or real change remains elusive,” Tai said in written testimony for the House Ways and Means Committee. 
“While we continue to keep the door open to conversations with China, including on its phase one commitments, we also need to acknowledge the agreement’s limitations, and turn the page on the old playbook with China, which focused on changing its behavior,” she added. 
Instead, Tai said the U.S. strategy must defend “our values and economic interests from the negative impacts of the PRC’s unfair economic policies and practices.”
The comments show the world’s biggest economies remain far apart on any discussions to improve trade ties after relations plummeted to new depths in the wake of Covid-19’s global spread in early 2020. Since then, both countries have put up new barriers for businesses on national security grounds, as concerns grow among some exporting countries like Singapore about a broader push toward decoupling. 
Tai noted the U.S.’s efforts to become more competitive in strategic industries and work with American allies to make supply chains more resilient. She also said her agency would do more to eliminate the use of forced labor, noting a new law designed to curb the imports of goods from China’s far west Xinjiang region over alleged genocide against ethnic Uyghur Muslims and other minority groups.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Wednesday at a regular press briefing in Beijing that his nation was “a staunch advocate for trade facilitation and liberalization,” and urged the U.S. to “stop resorting to hegemonism and unilateral bullying.” “Such practices contravene market principles and international trade rules, damage other countries’ interests, and undermine the supply and industrial chain stability,” he said. “It is to no one’s benefit.” 
In early 2020, the U.S. and China agreed to the so-called phase one deal, with the U.S. reducing some tariffs in exchange for Beijing pledging to address intellectual property theft and buy $200 billion in energy, farm and manufactured goods along with services through last December. Tai made no mention of a review of the first group of tariffs on more than $300 billion in Chinese imports needed to prevent their expiration. 
China has rejected U.S. criticism that it has failed to live up to the purchases, arguing it had done its best to implement the agreement despite the pandemic, global economic recession and supply chain disruptions. Beijing has repeatedly called on the U.S. to take steps to improve relations, including canceling punitive tariffs, lifting all sanctions, revoking visa bans and ending export restrictions of high-tech items.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at a record low on Wednesday despite rising inflation, and trimmed its 2022 growth forecast for the pandemic-stricken economy.
The Bank of Thailand (BOT) said it expected inflation to come in above target this year before returning to its 1-3% target range next year.
The BOT's monetary policy committee unanimously voted to hold the one-day repurchase rate at 0.50%, where it has been since May 2020, for a 15th straight meeting, as predicted by all 22 economists polled by Reuters.
""The Thai economic recovery will remain intact in 2022 and 2023, despite impacts from sanctions against Russia which led to higher energy and commodity prices and a slowdown in external demand,"" it said in a statement after its policy meeting.
While sanctions on Russia have increased the costs of goods, they will not derail the overall recovery path, it said, adding it would focus on supporting the recovery.
As supply-driven inflation is seen as temporary, policy adjustments should be discussed when the economy grows at its potential, which is expected at least late next year, MPC secretary Piti Disyatat told a news conference.
""The key rate is a blunt instrument, so we have to weigh that well before adjusting it,"" he said.
Economists say policy tightening is unlikely soon because the recovery remains fragile, with the vital tourism industry still struggling.
Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital markets research of Kasikornbank, said he expected the rate to stay on hold for the rest of the year until ""there are clear signs of a pickup in demand, especially from a recovery in tourism"".
The BOT lowered its 2022 economic growth forecast to 3.2% from the 3.4% predicted in December, but raised its headline inflation forecast to 4.9% from 1.7% seen previously. It now predicts inflation will slow to 1.7% in 2023.
The central bank lowered its economic growth forecast for 2023 to 4.4% from 4.7%. 
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy grew 1.6% last year, which was among the lowest growth rates in the region, after a 6.2% contraction in 2020.
On Monday, Finance Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith told Reuters interest rates should stay low to support the recovery.

The BOT maintained its forecast for foreign tourists at 5.6 million this year, after around 428,000 actual visits in 2021. That compared with 40 million foreign tourists in pre-pandemic 2019, when their spending accounted for 11% of GDP.
The BOT raised its 2022 forecast for export growth to 7.0% from 3.5% seen earlier. It predicted exports would rise 1.5% next year, with foreign tourists seen at 19 million.

501,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 06:17AM ET</span>","VIENNA (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led Austria's central bank to cut its growth forecast and sharply raise its inflation outlook for this year, it said on Wednesday, adding that the new figures assumed the war would end soon.
The Austrian National Bank (ONB) cut its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast to 3.5% from the 4.3% it predicted in its twice-yearly economic outlook issued in December. It raised its inflation forecast to 5.3% from 3.2%.
""Looking ahead, the economy will be heavily driven by this war and its impact, which has been a game-changer,"" ONB Governor Robert Holzmann said in an ONB statement.
The central bank also cut its growth forecast for next year, to 2.2% from 2.6%, adding that the new predictions were based on ""the assumption of a timely end of warfare"".
""Alternative scenarios – assuming protracted and escalating hostilities and enlarged sanctions and reflecting a reduction of gas supplies from Russia – yield much higher output and inflation effects,"" it added.

A slide shown during an ONB news conference outlined two such scenarios. In the worse-case one, inflation rose to 9% this year and growth shrivelled to 0.4%. In the less severe one, growth slowed to 1.9% and inflation accelerated to 7.6%.
In the headline scenario showing 3.5% growth this year, the war's impact accounted for about half the 0.8 percentage point cut to the growth forecast and roughly a quarter of the 2.1-point increase to the inflation forecast, the ONB said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's central bank stepped up efforts on Wednesday to keep a key bond yield below a red line, offering to buy more government debt, including through ad-hoc purchases, to hold down interest rates against a pull higher by global yields.
The intervention comes as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) seeks to keep monetary policy ultra-loose, even at the cost of fuelling further falls in the yen currency, which could push up import costs and hurt the economy.
The central bank increased purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGB) with maturities of three to 10 years, and offered to buy super-long bonds in unscheduled, emergency operations.
Combined, the BOJ offered to buy more than 2 trillion yen ($16.40 billion) worth of JGBs on Wednesday, in addition to separate offers for unlimited purchases of 10-year JGBs at a fixed rate of 0.25%.
""The BOJ is trying to strengthen its message to the market, that it's strongly committed to keeping financial conditions in Japan very accommodative and won't accept those kinds of higher long-term bond yields,"" said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Asset Management.
""We need to remember the official BOJ target is 0% for the 10-year JGB, not 25 basis points.""
The move bolsters the BOJ's intervention in the bond market unveiled on Monday, when it pledged to buy unlimited amounts of 10-year bonds at 0.25% until Thursday.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year JGBs retreated on Wednesday from a more than six-year peak hit earlier in the week, falling 3.0 basis points to 0.215%.
The BOJ's emergency offer to buy super-long bonds also drove down yields on longer-dated maturities. The 20-year JGB yield lost 8.5 basis points to 0.73% and the 30-year JGB yield was down 10 basis points at 0.970%.
""We decided to take the step because the entire yield curve was under strong upward pressure, heightening the risk of the 10-year yield exceeding our upper limit,"" a BOJ official told Reuters about Wednesday's move.
WEAK YEN DILEMMA
The super dovish BOJ is struggling against the tide of rising global interest rates as central banks elsewhere race to beat accelerating inflation, with the international spike in yields dragging Japan's yields higher.
Complicating that challenge for Tokyo policymakers are the rising costs of imports brought by a weakening currency and global fallout of the Ukraine war. 
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda appeared unfazed over the yen's fall, saying the move was driven partly by Japanese firms' dollar buying to pay energy bills.
""I don't think the BOJ's market operation is having a direct effect on currency moves,"" Kuroda told reporters after meeting Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. ""We didn't discuss anything in particular on currency moves.""
Despite increasing official jawboning over the yen's fall, Japanese authorities are unlikely to opt for direct yen-buying intervention or raise the BOJ's yield targets to strengthen the currency, said former top currency diplomat Naoyuki Shinohara.
""The BOJ's position appears to be that a weak yen is good for the economy,"" Shinohara told Reuters. ""It probably doesn't see the yen's current levels as dangerous.""
Markets will watch for the release of the BOJ's bond-buying schedule for the April-June quarter, set for 5 p.m. on Thursday (0800GMT), to seek any signs of additional purchases.
""The BOJ will increase the number of auction dates and the amount of outright JGB purchases as needed, taking account of market conditions,"" the bank said in announcing Wednesday's plan to ramp up bond buying.
Under yield curve control, the BOJ sets its short-term rate target at -0.1% and that for the 10-year JGB yield around 0%.

Its current guidance is to allow the 10-year yield to move flexibly, as long as it is below an implicit 0.25% ceiling set around the target.

504,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 03:25AM ET</span>",,,,,,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A closely monitored section of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted on Tuesday for the first time since September 2019, a reflection of market concerns that the Federal Reserve could tip the economy into recession as it battles soaring inflation.
For a brief moment, the yield on the two-year Treasury note was higher than that of the benchmark 10-year note. That part of the curve is viewed by many as a reliable signal that a recession could come in the next year or two.
The 2-year, 10-year spread briefly fell as low as minus 0.03 of a basis point, before bouncing back above zero to 5 basis points, according to data by Refinitiv.
While the brief inversion in August and early September 2019 was followed by a downturn in 2020, no one foresaw the closure of businesses and economic collapse due to the spread of COVID-19.
Investors are now concerned that the Federal Reserve will dent growth as it aggressively hikes rates to fight soaring inflation, with price pressures rising at the fastest pace in 40 years.
“The movements in the twos and the tens are a reflection that the market is growing nervous that the Fed may not be successful in fostering a soft landing,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
Western sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine has created new volatility in commodity prices, adding to already high inflation.
Fed funds futures traders expect the Fed's benchmark rate to rise to 2.60% by February, compared to 0.33% today. [FEDWATCH]
Some analysts say that the Treasury yield curve has been distorted by the Fed's massive bond purchases, which are holding down long-dated yields relative to shorter-dated ones.
Short and intermediate-dated yields have jumped as traders price in more and more rate hikes.
Another part of the yield curve that is also monitored by the Fed as a recession indicator remains far from inversion.
That is the three-month, 10-year part of the curve, which is currently at 184 basis points.
Either way, the lag from an inversion of the two-, 10-year part of the curve to a recession is typically relatively long, meaning that an economic downturn is not necessarily a concern right now.
""The time delay between an inversion and a recession tends to be, call it anywhere between 12 and 24 months. Six months have been the shortest and 24 months has been the longest so it’s really not something that is actionable for the average folks,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.

Meanwhile, analysts say that the U.S. central bank could use roll-offs from its massive $8.9 trillion bond holdings to help re-steepen the yield curve if it is concerned about the slope and its implications.
The Fed is expected to begin reducing its balance sheet in the coming months.

Investing.com -- Europe's largest economy braced for a cut-off of Russian gas supplies on Wednesday, activating the first phase of a national emergency plan.
The move comes two days ahead of a deadline set by Russia for 'unfriendly' states to start paying for deliveries of Russian energy in rubles, rather than in euros or dollars. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who chaired a G7 meeting of energy ministers on Monday which unanimously refused to go along with Russia's demands, said that the measures were a first, preliminary step which he called the ""Early Warning"" stage.
Two further stages, which could ultimately include the rationing of supplies to industry, are styled as ""Alarm"" and ""Emergency"".
The first stage of the plan foresees largely closer coordination of physical gas flows between pipeline operators, supply companies and the government. The final stage would include the rationing of supplies, with priority given to households over industry. According to official German statistics, households and industry represent the two biggest sources of demand, accounting for 31% and 36% of total use. Trade and commerce account for a further 13%, while demand from the power generation sector is largely concentrated in combined heat and power plants, which tend not to run in the spring and summer.
Any reduction of industrial gas supplies would have an immediate impact on Europe's largest economy. Michael Vassiliadis, a board member at Germany's largest chemicals company BASF (DE:BASFN), had said on Tuesday that even a 50% reduction in supplies would force it to stop production at Ludwigshafen, Europe's biggest chemicals complex. The country is particularly ill-positioned to deal with any supply interruption at present, given that its storage facilities are at their seasonal lowpoint for the year. Habeck told an ad hoc press conference that its storage facilities were only 25% full.
Russian officials have warned this week of an immediate reduction in supplies should Europe refuse to pay in rubles, illustrating the double-edged nature of the economic sanctions announced by the EU, U.K. and U.S. earlier at the start of the conflict.
The dependence of Europe – and of Germany in particular – on Russian energy has been a major factor inhibiting Europe’s response not only to the current crisis, but also to Russia’s first invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and its invasion of Georgia in 2008. It was Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s resistance that ensured that payments for energy supplies were exempted from the current sanctions. 
In a television interview at the weekend, Scholz again argued forcefully that the German economy cannot cope with a sudden stop of energy supplies from Russia. Over half of the gas that Germany consumed last year came from the country.
Scholz's claims have met with some skepticism and counter-claims that the three-party government is paying too much heed to business lobbying. An article penned by nine of the country's most prominent economists last week suggested that the economic costs of a Russian energy embargo would most likely be between 2% and 3% of gross domestic product.
""There is no doubt that these are substantial economic costs, but at the same time, they are clearly manageable in the sense that the German economy has weathered deeper slumps in recent years and recovered quickly,"" the authors said. ""Both after 2009 and 2020, the economy and the polity overcame larger GDP declines. Public fear-mongering about the catastrophic consequences of an energy embargo from lobby groups and affiliated think tanks does not hold up to academic standards.""  
European gas prices, which have eased in recent months after spiking at the start of the winter heating season, rose sharply again on Wednesday in response to the news. The benchmark Dutch TTF futures contract for April rose 11% to 120.74 euros a megawatt-hour by 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT).",,,,,

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The frequency and severity of climate-related disasters are rising faster in the Middle East and Central Asia than anywhere in the world, posing a ""major threat"" to growth and prosperity, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said.
A new International Monetary Fund paper showed that climate disasters in the region injured and displaced 7 million people in an average year, causing more than 2,600 deaths and $2 billion in physical damage.
""Droughts in North Africa, Somalia and Iran. Epidemics and locust infestations in the Horn of Africa. Severe floods in the Caucasus and Central Asia. The list of disasters is quickly getting longer,"" Georgieva said in remarks prepared for the World Government Summit in Dubai.
Analysis of data spanning the past century showed that temperatures in the region had risen by 1.5° C, twice the global increase of 0.7° C, and already sparse precipitation had become more erratic than in any other region, the IMF report said.
Georgieva said extreme weather events typically cut annual economic growth by 1–2 percentage points per capita.
In the Caucasus and Central Asia subregion, she said, such events had caused a permanent loss in the gross domestic product level of 5.5 percentage points.
She called on all countries to adapt their economies to climate challenges, including through adoption of a steadily rising carbon price, increased green investments and work to ensure a just transition across and within countries.
She lauded the United Arab Emirates, a major oil producer, for its pledge to invest more than $160 billion in renewable energy to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Egypt, meanwhile, was investing in modern irrigation techniques, education and health care.
Georgieva said it was also critical to ensure climate adaptation policies were included in national economic strategies, as investments in resilient infrastructure and better flood protection could avert economic losses.
In Morocco, for instance, simulations showed that beefing up water infrastructure improved resilience to droughts and cut GDP losses by almost 60%.

She said public infrastructure investment needs could amount to 3.3% of GDP per year for individual countries in the region over the next decade, more than twice the average for emerging market economies.
Given limited resources in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries would need a mix of domestic policy reforms, such as replacing fuel subsidies, and international support, including from the IMF, Georgieva said.

LONDON (Reuters) - If not now, when? Investors typically demand some added compensation for holding a security over many years to cover all the unknowables over long horizons - making the absence of such a premium in bond markets right now seem slightly bizarre.
Disappearance of the so-called ""term premium"" in 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds over the past 5 years has puzzled analysts and policymakers and been blamed variously on subdued inflation expectations or distortions related to central bank bond buying.
And yet it's rarely, if ever, been more difficult to fathom the decade ahead - at least in terms of inflation, interest rates or indeed quantitative easing or tightening.
Inflation is running at a 40-year high after the pandemic forced wild swings in economic activity and supply bottlenecks and was then compounded by an energy price spike due to war in Ukraine that may redraw the geopolitical map.
The U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks are scrambling to normalise super easy monetary policies to cope - not really knowing whether to focus on reining in runaway prices or tackle what Bank of England chief Andrew Bailey this week described as a ""historic shock"" to real household incomes.
Bond yields have surged, much like they did in the first quarter of last year. But this time bond funds have suffered one of their worst quarters in more than 20 years and some measures of Treasury price volatility are at their highest since banking crash of 2008. 
But the most-followed estimates of term premia embedded in bond markets remain deeply negative. And this matters a lot to a whole host of critical bond market signals, not least the unfolding inversion of the U.S. Treasury curve between short and long-term yields that has presaged recessions in the past.
""The 10-year term premium has barely budged even as inflation spiked to 8%, suggesting that long-dated yields are probably still capped by the Fed's record-high balance sheet,"" said Franklin Templeton's fixed income chief Sonal Desai. ""Or maybe investors think the Fed will blink and ease policy again once asset prices start a meaningful correction."" 
""In either case, I think markets are still underestimating the magnitude of the monetary policy tightening ahead,"" said Desai, adding that expectations of another more than 2 percentage points of Fed hikes this year still likely leaves real policy rates deeply negative by December even if inflation eases to 5%.

BUMP IN THE NIGHT
So what's the beef with the term premium?
In effect, the Treasury term premium is meant to measure the additional yield demanded by investors for buying and holding a 10-year bond to maturity as opposed to buying a one year bond and rolling it over for 10 years with a new coupon.
In theory it covers all the things that might go bump in the night over a decade hence - including the outside chance of credit or even political risk - but it mostly reflects uncertainty about future Fed rates and inflation expectations.
At zero, you'd assume investors are indifferent to holding the 10-year today as opposed to rolling 10 one-year notes.
But the New York Fed's measure of the 10-year term premium remains deeply negative to the tune of -32 basis points - ostensibly suggesting investors actually prefer holding the longer-duration asset. 
Although the premium popped back positive in the first half of last year, it's been stuck around zero or below since 2017 - oddly in the face of the Fed's last attempt to unwind its balance sheet.
And the persistent and puzzling erosion of the term premium to zero and below brings it back to the 1960s, not the much-vaunted inflation-ravaged 1970s that everyone seems to think we're back in.
It matters a lot now as the debate about the inversion of the 2-10 yield curve heats up and many argue that the signal sent by that inversion is less clear about a coming recession as it's distorted by the disappearance of the term premium.
In the absence of a term premium, the long-term yield curve is just a reflection of long-run policy rate expectations that will inevitably see some retreat if the Fed is successful in taming inflation over the next two years.
Fed Board economists Eric Engstrom and Steven Sharpe late last week also dismissed the market's obsession with a 2-10 year yield inversion signalling recession.
In a blog called '(Don't Fear) The Yield Curve' they said near term forward rate spreads out to 18 months were much more informative about the chance of a looming recession, just as accurate over time and - significantly - heading in the opposite direction right now.
The main reason they pushed back on the 2-10s was it contained a whole host of information about the world beyond two years that's simply less reliable as an economic signal and ""buffeted by other significant factors such as risk premiums on long-term bonds.""
But what could see the term premium return?
Presumably the Fed's planned balance sheet rundown, or quantitative tightening (QT), would be a prime candidate if indeed its long-term bond buying has distorted term premia.
But the last Fed attempt at QT in 2017-19 didn't do that and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) thinks it will be some time yet before just allowing short-term bonds on its balance sheet to roll off and mature gets replaced by outright sales of longer-term bonds.
""QT is not the opposite of QE; asset sales are.""
Of course, maybe the world just hasn't changed that much - in terms of ageing demographics, excess savings and pension fund demand, falling potential growth and negative real interest rates. Once this current storm has passed, investors seem to think that will dominate once more.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury yield curve, widely watched as a barometer of the economy's health, briefly ""inverted"" on Tuesday in a warning sign bond investors see a recession on the horizon.
While investors caution that the yield curve is just one indicator among many to look for when predicting recession, its changing shape can complicate how banks manage the margins between their cost of funds and the interest they earn on loans and securities, which is also known as their net interest income. Here is what the yield curve inversion may mean for U.S. lenders. 
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
Yields on the 2-year Treasury rose higher than those of the 10-year Treasury for the first time since 2019. 
That is unusual because investors typically expect more compensation for taking on the risk that rising inflation will lower the expected return from owning longer-dated bonds. That means a 10-year note typically yields more than a 2-year note. 
An inverted curve has in the past preceded recessions and can act as a warning sign for such an event. The U.S. Federal Reserve has started raising rates and is expected to continue aggressively hiking through 2022. 
IS THIS BAD FOR BANKS?
Sort of. In general, banks borrow short-term and lend long-term and make money on the different rates when the curve is sloped.
An inversion of the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yield means there is no spread to earn between borrowing for two years and collecting interest on 10-year Treasuries.
IN REALITY, IT IS NOT THAT BAD
In practice, though, banks borrow and lend at different points on the curve and tend to keep average maturities of loans and securities to less than about five years. 
They rarely borrow much at two years and lend at 10 years. They tend to borrow and lend more toward the front, or short-term, end of the yield curve, which is steep. For example, the spread between the 3-month and 5-year, as shown on the Treasury curve, was about 190 basis points on Tuesday.
For example, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) funds more than half of its balance sheet with low-cost deposits, the cost of which tends to move up very slowly. The average rate for all of JPMorgan's interest-bearing liabilities in the fourth quarter was only 0.22%. That is a long way from Tuesday's 2.4% yield on 2-year Treasuries.
Also, many commercial and industrial loans are floating-rate term loans, or revolving loan facilities with floating rates tied to short-term benchmarks, which have increased sharply this year in anticipation of Fed rate hikes.

Banks have been predicting that rate rises will boost their net interest income significantly this year.
The bigger threat to banks is the risk of recession, which could hurt consumer spending and hinder Americans' ability to repay loans.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) -Remember 'Japanification'?
After the financial crash of 2008, a consensus emerged that the United States and Europe would slide into the sort of multi-decade economic malaise Japan experienced after its property bust of the 1990s - where the effects of a rapidly ageing population saw waves of excess savings, slow growth and persistent deflationary pressures.
Termed 'Japanification', the diagnosis involved chronically low or negative interest rates and bond yields, with repeat bouts of bond-buying 'quantitative easing' and mounting debt piles. 
When COVID-19 hit, many doubled down on that view. 
And yet inflation in the United States and Europe has surged to its highest in four decades. 
Initially dismissed as transitory due to the bottlenecks and base effects of the post-pandemic reopening, price rises are proving more durable and pervasive than central banks had hoped and many are already lifting interest rates. 
An energy price shock since Russia's invasion of Ukraine compounds the problem. And U.S. Treasury bonds have had their worst quarter in at least 25 years. 
So is the 'Japanification' thesis now dead? 
Steve Major, head of global fixed income research at HSBC, says it's very much alive, and offers three broad reasons: the Fed's own recent 'dot plot' projections, current market pricing, and the long-term structural drivers that existed before 2008.
Federal Reserve policymakers this month raised their median projection of where they see rates peaking to 2.8% next year from 2.1% in 2024 as per their December forecast.
This is well into 'restrictive' territory - defined as rates above the Fed's assumption of long-term neutral rates - and increases the chance of a recession that will probably see rates and bond yields quickly come back down again. 
Several measures of yield and rates curves - nominal, real, and forward - back up this view. 
Crucially, Fed policymakers also lowered their longer-term neutral rate forecast to 2.4% from 2.5% where it had been since 2019. This is no rounding error, but a result of three policymakers lowering their long-term outlook. 
The Fed is essentially indicating that the long-term trend for the neutral rate of interest is still downward because the economy is not strong enough to withstand higher rates.
Ultimately, the deflationary pull exerted by huge and rising debt levels, ageing populations, high degrees of wealth inequality, and rapid technological advances is strong.
""These trends are very powerful and are things that the central bank has no control over. Can the central bank control how old people are?,"" Major says, adding: ""The 'lower for longer' hypothesis is intact. And the market at the moment supports it.""
R-STAR ZERO
The pandemic has cast some doubt over the long-held view that ageing and related worker shortages over time are as deflationary as Japan's experience suggests.
The most powerful of those arguments - outlined by economists Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan just before the pandemic - is that worker shortages will ultimately lift the bargaining power of labor and wages and help reflate prices more generally. 
But demographics are a double whammy for interest rates in the long term. Ageing populations and shrinking workforces cut potential growth rates over time while workers nearing retirement typically bank life savings into safer bonds. 
Bouts of inflation and rising bond yields are possible, as we are seeing now, but they are less likely to last. 
Curiously, one of the Fed's most hawkish rate-setters revealed that the Fed still agrees with the 'lower for longer' outlook. 
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard dissented against the Fed's 25-basis point rate hike to a 0.25%-0.50% range on March 16, and voted for a 50 bps increase. He has since called for rates to rise beyond 3%.
But he also sees the long-run equilibrium policy rate at 2%. Assuming the Fed brings inflation back down to its 2% target, that implies a real policy rate, known as 'R-star', of zero. 
Estimates of R-star vary and the Fed's median estimate is now 0.4%, so zero would not be a total surprise. The New York Fed stopped updating its estimates in 2020 due to the pandemic, but the long-term downtrend is clear.
Albert Edwards at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) has been a long-term bond bull for the all these structural reasons, correctly calling the decline in yields and interest rates as part of his 'Ice Age' view of the global economy and markets.
He thinks a thaw is eventually coming, and thinks inflationary pressures from soaring commodity and energy prices, fiscal largesse, and expanding deficits will overwhelm and crash the bond market.
But despite the scramble to re-price bonds amid the central bank hawkishness of recent months, this quake is still not the big one.
""This isn't the end of the bond bull market in the near term. This spike in commodities will ultimately be deflationary and will kill global demand,"" Edwards said, adding: ""The Fed is going to tighten until they put the economy back into recession, and that won't take very long.""

Edwards reckons the 10-year Treasury yield can revisit its record low from August 2020 around 0.5%, a level historically associated with Japanese yields.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted on Tuesday for the first time since 2019, as investors priced in an aggressive rate-hiking plan by the Federal Reserve as it attempts to bring inflation down from 40-year highs.
Here is a quick primer explaining what a steep, flat or inverted yield curve means and how it has in the past predicted recession, and what it might be signaling now.
WHAT SHOULD THE CURVE LOOK LIKE? 
The U.S. Treasury finances federal government budget obligations by issuing various forms of debt. The $23 trillion https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MVMTD027MNFRBDAL Treasury market includes Treasury bills with maturities from one month out to one year, notes from two years to 10 years, as well as 20- and 30-year bonds.
The yield curve plots the yield of all Treasury securities.
Typically, the curve slopes upwards because investors expect more compensation for taking on the risk that rising inflation will lower the expected return from owning longer-dated bonds. That means a 10-year note typically yields more than a two-year note because it has a longer duration. Yields move inversely to prices. 
A steepening curve typically signals expectations of stronger economic activity, higher inflation, and higher interest rates. A flattening curve can mean the opposite: investors expect rate hikes in the near term and have lost confidence in the economy's growth outlook.
WHAT DOES AN INVERTED CURVE MEAN?
Investors watch parts of the yield curve as recession indicators, primarily the spread between the yield on three-month Treasury bills and 10-year notes and the U.S. two-year to 10-year (2/10) curve. 
On Tuesday, the 2/10 part of the curve inverted, meaning yields on the 2-year Treasury were actually higher than the 10-year Treasury. That is a warning light to investors that a recession could follow. 
U.S. Treasury yield curve inverts https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BONDS/gdvzyjmorpw/chart.png
The U.S. curve has inverted before each recession since 1955, with a recession following between six and 24 months, according to a 2018 report https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2018/march/economic-forecasts-with-yield-curve by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. It offered a false signal just once in that time.
According to Anu Gaggar, Global Investment Strategist for Commonwealth Financial Network, who looked at the 2/10 part of the curve, there have been 28 instances since 1900 where the yield curve has inverted; in 22 of these episodes, a recession has followed. The lag between curve inversion and the start of a recession has averaged about 22 months but has ranged from 6 to 36 months for the last six recessions, she wrote. 
The last time the 2/10 part of the yield curve inverted was in 2019. The following year, the United States entered a recession - albeit one caused by the global pandemic.
Yield curve inversions and recessions https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/movanbqagpa/Pasted%20image%201648582702082.png 
WHY IS THE YIELD CURVE INVERTING NOW? 
Yields of short-term U.S. government debt have been rising quickly this year, reflecting expectations of a series of rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, while longer-dated government bond yields have moved at a slower pace amid concerns policy tightening may hurt the economy.
As a result, the shape of the Treasury yield curve has been generally flattening and in some cases inverting. 
Other parts of the yield curve have also inverted, including the spread between five- and 30-year U.S. Treasury yields, which this week moved below zero for the first time since February 2006, according to Refinitiv data. 
ARE WE GETTING MIXED SIGNALS? 
Still, another closely monitored part of the curve has been giving off a different signal: The spread between the yield on three-month Treasury bills and 10-year notes this month has been widening, causing some to doubt a recession is imminent.
Meanwhile, the two-year/10-year yield curve has technical issues, and not everyone is convinced the flattening curve is telling the true story. They say the Fed's bond buying program of the last two years has resulted in an undervalued U.S. 10-year yield that will rise when the central bank starts shrinking its balance sheet, steepening the curve.
Researchers at the Fed, meanwhile, put out a paper https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/dont-fear-the-yield-curve-reprise-20220325.htm on March 25 that suggested the predictive power of the spreads between 2 and 10-year Treasuries to signal a coming recession is ""probably spurious,"" and suggested a better herald of a coming economic slowdown is the spread of Treasuries with maturities of less than 2 years. 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE REAL WORLD? 
While rate increases can be a weapon against inflation, they can also slow economic growth by increasing the cost of borrowing for everything from mortgages to car loans.
Aside from signals it may flash on the economy, the shape of the yield curve has ramifications for consumers and business. 

When short-term rates increase, U.S. banks tend to raise their benchmark rates for a wide range of consumer and commercial loans, including small business loans and credit cards, making borrowing more expensive for consumers. Mortgage rates also rise.
When the yield curve steepens, banks are able to borrow money at lower interest rates and lend at higher interest rates. Conversely, when the curve is flatter they find their margins squeezed, which may deter lending.

(Reuters) - A favorite Wall Street harbinger of business-cycle downturns sent up a warning flare that a recession may be on the horizon on Tuesday, just hours after the latest data on the U.S. economy showed business demand for workers remained strong and consumers were still confident despite some worries about inflation.
It was a disjointed set of events - strong economic fundamentals against signs of anxiety in the bond market - that showed just how tight a path the Federal Reserve will need to walk as it tries to tame inflation with a steady series of interest rate increases.
For traders who briefly pushed rates on the 2-year Treasury note above that of the 10-year Treasury note, the biggest risk to the economy may now be a central bank that finds inflation has slipped its grasp and is forced to act more aggressively than expected, killing the current economic expansion in the process.
Former New York Fed President William Dudley, writing for Bloomberg, even called that outcome ""inevitable,"" the result of the Fed waiting until this month to raise interest rates even as inflation accelerated last year. 
After briefly dipping below zero, the spread between the 10-year and 2-year note yields had widened by mid-afternoon.
U.S. Treasury yield curve inverts https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BONDS/gdvzyjmorpw/chart.png
But the episode still adds a new complication to the debate at the Fed about how far and fast to raise rates, and may even be an indicator in itself of how much the central bank is out of synch with inflation running at triple its 2% target.
Yield curve inversions typically come late in Fed hiking cycles as bond investors sense the central bank may have gone too far in raising borrowing costs and begun to slow the economy.
In the current tightening cycle, the Fed is only getting started. Earlier this month it raised the target federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, the first hike since 2018. The funds rate was cut to the near-zero level to bolster the economy at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. 
Fed policymakers expect to raise rates steadily through this year and well into next to bring inflation back to their target - with little scope to worry about what that is doing to the yield curve.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker on Tuesday dismissed the flattening yield curve as only one signal that markets were sending in an economy that overall looked healthy and far from recession. 
""We are starting in such a strong position going in"" to the rate hike cycle, Harker said in an interview with CNBC.
In earlier remarks to the Center for Financial Stability in New York, Harker said: ""As a policymaker, I have to look at the combination of all those numbers and come up with a pragmatic path of policy and not base it upon any one.""
For now, the numbers that matter most to the Fed concern inflation, running at a multi-decade high, and a real economy that seems not just strong, but strong enough to weather the higher interest rates the central bank is planning.
Hard to find a job in America? Nope! https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/JOBS/akvezjoyopr/chart.png
American consumer confidence ticked up this month, according to the Conference Board, with a record percentage describing jobs as ""plentiful"" - data supported by government figures also out on Tuesday showing nearly two job openings for every unemployed worker last month.
The Labor Department is expected to report on Friday that the U.S. economy gained 490,000 jobs in March, according to a Reuters poll of economists, marking an unprecedented 11th straight month of gains above the 400,000 mark. The unemployment rate is forecast to drop to a pandemic-era low of 3.7% - just two-tenths of a point above where it was when COVID-19 struck.
Consumer spending has held up through repeated waves of the coronavirus over the past two years, with goods consumption the strongest in a generation. And, while inflation and rising interest rates may start denting the appeal of big-ticket purchases like cars, signs are emerging that Americans are shifting back toward pre-pandemic spending habits that favor services like travel and dining out.
The risks certainly are real, with the Fed staking its credibility on bringing inflation steadily down. If improvement isn't seen soon on the inflation front, policymakers have said they would favor hiking rates in larger increments and to higher levels until that happens. That's the very dynamic that can increase the risk of a recession, and drive short- and long-term bond yields to invert.
What it signals at this stage remains to be seen. 

Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other U.S. central bank officials say they do keep an eye on the yield curve, but won't necessarily react to it.
""We take it into account, along with many other financial conditions,"" Powell said in January when the spread between the 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes was still a healthy 0.75%, but ""I don't think of it as some kind of an iron law.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia has offered to buy back dollar bonds maturing next week in roubles in a move seen by analysts as helping local holders of the $2 billion sovereign issue receive payment, while also easing the country's hard-currency repayment burden.
The finance ministry offer on Eurobonds maturing on April 4, Russia's biggest debt payment this year, follows Western moves to tighten sanctions against the country over its invasion of Ukraine and to freeze Moscow out of international finance.
Moscow, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"", says Western measures amount to ""economic war"". In response, it has introduced countermeasures and has demanded foreign firms pay for Russian gas in roubles rather than dollars or euros.
The bonds - issued in 2012 - would be bought at a price equivalent to 100% of their nominal value, the ministry said its statement. Buying back bonds will reduce the overall size of the outstanding bond when it matures on April 4. 
However, it was not immediately clear if the amount the government would buy back was limited or what would happen to holdings of creditors that would not tender their bonds. 
The terms of the bond prescribe that repayment has to occur in dollars. Repaying at maturity in roubles might again raise the prospect of Russia's first external sovereign default in a century.
Analysts and investors said the move was likely designed to help Russian holders who now face restrictions in receiving dollar payments.
""This is a tender offer and not a final decision that these bonds will be paid in roubles. Perhaps, Russian authorities want to gauge investors’ willingness to accept payment in roubles?"" said Seaport Global credit analyst Himanshu Porwal.
Tim Ash of BlueBay Asset Management, which is not a bondholder, said the move was part of a fight back by Russia's central bank and finance ministry ""to fend off default and stabilise markets and the rouble"".
Ash said the United States' Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which enforces U.S. sanctions, ""should make clear"" it will not extend a deadline of May 25 for U.S. individuals or entities to receive payments on Russian sovereign bonds.
Russia's finance ministry said in its statement on Tuesday that bondholders should submit requests to sell their holdings to the National Settlement Depository between 1300 GMT on March 29 and 1400 GMT on March 30.
SECURING PAYMENT
A fund manager said the ministry's offer might be designed to help Russian investors secure payment because Euroclear, an international settlement system, had been blocking dollar payments to the Russian clearing system.
""Everybody wants dollars right now – in and outside Russia – so I would assume that only local holders and local banks that have issues with sanctions will make use of this operation,"" said Kaan Nazli, portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, which recently reduced its exposure to Russian sovereign debt.
Nazli, who said he had not previously seen a buyback that switched the repayment currency, added that foreign investors were unlikely to be interested given the rouble ""is no longer a convertible currency.""
The rouble initially crumbled after the West imposed sanctions, plunging as much as 40% in value against the dollar since the start of 2022. It has since recovered and was trading down about 10% in Moscow on Tuesday.
The finance ministry did not provide a breakdown of foreign and Russian holders of the Eurobond-2022. It did not respond to a request about how much of the outstanding $2 billion it wanted to buy back or what would happen if investors refused the offer.
The bond has a 30-day grace period and no provisions for payments in alternative currencies, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said.
According to Refinitiv database eMAXX, which analyses public filings, major asset managers such as Brandywine, Axa,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) were recently among the holders of the bond coming due on April 4.
The finance ministry had said earlier on Tuesday it had fully paid a $102 million coupon on Russia's Eurobond due in 2035, its third payout since Western sanctions called into question Moscow's ability to service its foreign currency debt.

Russian sovereign debt repayments have so far gone through, staving off a default, although sanctions have frozen a chunk of Moscow's huge foreign reserves. Russian officials have said any problem with payment that led to a formal declaration of default would be an artificial default.
Russia's next payment is on March 31 when a $447 million payment falls due. On April 4, it also should pay $84 million in coupon a 2042 sovereign dollar bond.

ACCRA (Reuters) -Ghana's parliament approved a new 1.5% tax on electronic payments, known as the ""e-levy,"" on Tuesday after the opposition walked out in protest.
Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta proposed the e-levy in November to widen the tax net and has presented it as a panacea for Ghana's raft of financial woes. Opposition was so fierce that it caused a brawl in parliament a month later.
Critics believe the e-levy will price lower-income people and small business owners out of the digital economy, while Ofori-Atta said it was a way to ensure Ghanaians ""contribute their fair share"" toward development.
Ruling members of parliament re-introduced the bill on Tuesday, when many opposition MPs were not present, a surprise move analysts had previously said would be one of the only ways for the tax to pass.
It was expected to be re-submitted next week, but parliament speaker Alban Bagbin said it should be treated as urgent business and fast-tracked it.
""The financial institutions of this country should not be subject to this punitive, insensitive tax. It would be a disincentive to the private sector of Ghana,"" minority leader Haruna Iddrisu said in a statement in parliament. 
After he spoke, opposition parties walked out, refusing to take part in the vote. 
The tax, which would cover mobile money payments, bank transfers, merchant payments, and inward remittances, could raise up to 6.9 billion Ghanaian cedi ($926 million) in 2022, according to government estimates.
Analysts have said that the passage of the e-levy could reassure investors and lenders of Ghana's ability to make tough choices to generate revenue, helping to narrow government bond spreads.
Markets reacted immediately after the tax passed. Prices on Ghanaian Eurobonds rose by as much as 2.77 cents on the dollar, reaching their highest value since the day before Russia invaded Ukraine.
But analysts say additional fiscal measures may prove necessary for Ghana to reverse its recent economic misfortunes.
Ghana, one of West Africa's largest economies, is facing rampant inflation, a depreciating currency and a heavy debt burden. Its credit ratings have been downgraded over concerns about the government's ability to pass legislation to raise revenues.
""Regaining market access will probably require a series of strong fiscal data over the course of the next several months,"" said Amaka Anku, consultancy Eurasia Group's Africa practice head. ""The e-levy will help but is not dispositive."" 

Consumer inflation reached 15.7% year on year in February, the highest since 2016. The cedi depreciated some 20% against the dollar this year, second only to the Russian rouble, and public debt hovers around 80% of gross domestic product.
The government announced sweeping spending cuts last week to tackle the deficit, blaming its economic hardships on the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury yield curve is flashing a warning sign to Wall Street, where many are worried that a recession could be in store after bond investors pushed up short-term rates to the point where yields on the two-year Treasury were actually higher than the 10-year Treasury.
Such a phenomenon, called a ""yield curve inversion,"" is a key metric that investors watch as bond yields impact other asset prices, feed through to banks' returns and have been an indicator of how the economy will fare. Aside from signals it may flash on the economy, the shape of the yield curve has ramifications for consumers and business.
On Tuesday, one of the most closely watched parts of the curve, the two-year to 10-year curve, briefly inverted, after weeks of sharp moves in the U.S. Treasury market, where investors have sold off Treasuries anticipating aggressive interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve which is fighting surging inflation. 
U.S. Treasury yield curve inverts https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BONDS/znpneqxayvl/chart_eikon.jpg
That has sent a warning sign for investors that a recession could follow. The last time it inverted was 2019 and the following year, the United States entered a recession - albeit one caused by the global pandemic.
""A lot of people focus on this and there could be a self-fulfilling expectation, they see the 10 year/2 year invert and believe there will be a recession and change behavior,"" said Campbell Harvey, professor of finance at the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, who pioneered using the yield curve as a predictive tool for recessions. ""So if you're a company you cut back capex and employment plans.""
Harvey, who focused his research on a different part of the yield curve, added that being prepared for a recession was ""not a bad thing... so when it occurs you survive."" 
Broker-dealer LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) said the 2/10 inversion is ""a powerful indicator"" pointing out that it predated all six recessions since 1978, with just one false positive.
According to Anu Gaggar, global investment strategist for Commonwealth Financial Network, the lag between curve inversion and the start of a recession has averaged about 22 months but has ranged from 6 to 36 months for the last six recessions. 
2/10 curve https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/movanbqagpa/Pasted%20image%201648582702082.png
Some investors caution that the yield curve is just one indicator among many to look for when predicting recession. Indeed, equity markets have shot higher in recent weeks, with the S&P 500 cutting its year-to-date loss to around 3% after confirming it was in a correction last month.
For many market participants, however, the curve has become a classically followed signal. 
“There is definitely a psychological element to it,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities. ""The yield curve has worked in the past because it has been a signal that the end of the cycle is coming.”
CLOSELY FOLLOWED 
Yields of short-term U.S. government debt have been rising quickly, reflecting expectations of a series of rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, while longer-dated government bond yields have moved at a slower pace amid concerns policy tightening may hurt the economy.
As a result, the shape of the Treasury yield curve has been generally flattening and in some cases inverting. 
Not everyone is convinced the curve is telling the whole story. Some say the Fed's bond buying program of the last two years has inflated the price of 10-year Treasuries, keeping the yield artificially low. They say the yield is bound to rise when the central bank starts shrinking its balance sheet, steepening the curve.
Clouding the picture further, different parts of the yield curve have been sending different signals.
While financial markets see the two-year yield as a good proxy for Fed policy and closely follow the 2/10 part of the curve, many academic papers favor the spread between the yield on three-month Treasury bills and 10-year notes. This yield curve has not indicated recession. 
Eric Winograd, senior economist, AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) said discussion of the yield curve inversion was ""overheated."" 
""I understand the narrative and I think from a risk-taking perspective there is good evidence that a flat or inverted yield curve is a challenge for broader risk assets but I am not going to worry more about a recession if the yield curve inverts by 5 basis points or doesn’t,"" Winograd said. 
Investors may be more dismissive of an inversion this time around, as the Fed remains very early in the hiking cycle, with time to ease off the brakes if the economy appears to be slipping into a downturn, TD's Goldberg said.
Researchers at the Fed, meanwhile, put out a paper https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/dont-fear-the-yield-curve-reprise-20220325.htm on March 25 that suggested the predictive power of the spread between two- and 10-year Treasuries to signal a coming recession is ""probably spurious,"" and suggested a better herald of a coming economic slowdown is the spread of Treasuries with maturities of less than two years. 

Still, for some, the trend is not to be ignored. 
“When things invert you are definitely much closer to a recession than a good outcome and that’s exactly where we are today,” said Edward Al Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle. “It’s clear we have arrived at a point of stress in markets.”

Freeland said the Liberal-led government is committed to growing Canada's economy, making life more affordable and continuing to build a society where no one is left behind.
""That is exactly what we are doing, and that is what we're going to continue to do in the budget that I will present to this house on April 7,"" Freeland said during question period in parliament. She added the budget would be introduced at 4 p.m. ET (2000 GMT).
Canada's Liberals were re-elected last year for a third term, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau failed to secure a majority. This month, he announced a support deal with the opposition New Democrats that will keep him in power until 2025.
In exchange, the Liberals will back a national dental-care program for low-income Canadians and to move forward on a national prescription drug plan - two costly initiatives. 
Economists said the agreement will likely lead to heftier deficits and threatens to upend government promises to rein in inflation. Canada's inflation rate hit 5.7% in February and is expected to go higher.
Canada has also pledged to spend more on defense following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, though it has not yet provided any details.
Earlier on Tuesday, Trudeau pledged affordable housing would be a major focus in the upcoming budget.

""I can assure you that investments in housing ... across the country will be a strong topic in the budget that we will be presenting,"" Trudeau said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, after talks at the White House, urged North Korea on Tuesday to halt its ballistic missile launches and return to negotiations over its weapons programs.
Speaking to reporters, the two leaders condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and stressed the importance of stability in the Indo-Pacific region and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea amid concerns about China exerting its influence there.
Biden and Lee also criticized the policies of Myanmar's military government, after a meeting in the Oval Office.
North Korea last week tested a powerful new type of intercontinental ballistic missile that marked an end to a self-imposed moratorium on long-range testing in place since 2017. 
Biden said he and Lee shared their concerns about the North Korean launches, which he said were in clear violation of various U.N. Security Council resolutions.
""We both urge North Korea to refrain from further provocations and return to the negotiating table for serious and sustained diplomacy,"" said Biden.
North Korea thus far has rejected U.S. appeals to hold direct talks over its nuclear and missile programs.
Biden said he was looking forward to hosting in Washington later this spring a special summit of the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. An ASEAN summit planned for this week was postponed because of scheduling issues.
Lee welcomed increased U.S. involvement in the Indo-Pacific, which he said would strengthen America's engagement and the evolving regional economic architecture.
He spoke against Russian aggression in Ukraine in particular and advocated for the territorial integrity of all nations in a broader context.
""The sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of all countries big and small, must be respected,"" Lee said. ""The unprovoked military invasion of a sovereign country under any pretext is unacceptable."" 
At the start of their talks, Biden told reporters the United States supports implementing its Indo-Pacific strategy despite the current focus on Europe during the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Ahead of the meeting, a senior administration official told reporters the United States was pleased with Singapore's decision to impose sanctions and export controls on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine last month. 

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
The Biden administration announced an Indo-Pacific strategy in February in which it vowed to commit more diplomatic and security resources to the region to counter what it sees as China's bid to create a regional sphere of influence.

LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States and its allies plan new sanctions on more sectors of Russia's economy that are critical to sustaining its invasion of Ukraine, including military supply chains, Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said on Tuesday.
Adeyemo, speaking in London on a European trip to consult with allies on strengthening and enforcing sanctions to punish Russia, said the broadening of those efforts was aimed at undermining ""the Kremlin's ability to operate its war machine.""
The Treasury last Thursday slapped new sanctions https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0677 on dozens of Russian defense companies, from makers of ammunition, missiles and helicopters used in the Ukraine invasion to radar and imaging systems firms. The sanctions freeze any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit American entities from any transactions with them. 
""In addition to sanctioning companies in sectors that enable the Kremlin's malign activities, we also plan to take actions to disrupt their critical supply chains,"" Adeyemo told an event at the think tank Chatham House.
""Our goal is to use an integrated approach that includes export controls which will bite over time and sanctions that will bite immediately,"" he said, adding they would also target alternative military suppliers used by Russia.
Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine.
Since the invasion began on Feb. 24, western allies have frozen Russia's central bank's foreign currency assets, banned key Russian banks and wealthy elites from hard currency transactions and put restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductors and other technology. 
The sanctions have stripped the Kremlin of resources and helped to cripple Russia's economy. Adeyemo said they would stay in place for as long as the invasion continued. 
He attributed the success of the sanctions to a strong multilateral effort and the strength of an international economic and financial system built by democratic countries at the end of World War Two, which created institutions including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the precursor to the World Trade Organization.
INTERNATIONAL NORMS
These institutions created international rules, norms and values that set the stage for decades of prosperity, but which have been rejected by Russia in its invasion, he said.
Adeyemo said he expected countries such as China and India to remain part of the global financial system rather than seeing the crisis in Ukraine as a moment to decouple from the West. 
""The system has adapted and moulded to members that have come along to create huge reductions in poverty, and not just western countries,"" he said. ""That is why, I think, ultimately they are going to remain part of the system because the benefits of the system far outweigh the risks.""
He said however that it was not open to those that failed to respect the core principles of territorial integrity and self-determination, including Russian oligarchs targeted by sanctions and those who may attempt to help them hide their assets. 
Adeyemo said that the international system that gave rise to the sanctions needed strengthening, including by addressing food insecurity resulting from the conflict, which has disrupted grain shipments from Ukraine.

He added that the use of economic sanctions must be refined to preserve their efficacy, including avoiding unilateral actions and ensuring that they are tied to clear policy objectives and can be easily reversed when these are met. 
He also said that the international community needed to finalize the global minimum corporate tax agreement and continue providing the resources needed to end the COVID-19 pandemic, with broader vaccine access.

An inversion of the two-year, 10-year part of the curve is viewed by many as a reliable signal that a recession is likely to follow in one to two years. The 2s/10s curve briefly showed minus 0.03 basis point.
COMMENTS
JACK JANASIEWICZ, LEAD PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST, NATIXIS INVESTMENT MANAGERS, BOSTON
“The yield curve thing is front and center, that's all I get questions about. My response to this is somewhat tongue in cheek, but if there was one indicator that really told us the direction of the economy and hence the direction of the equity markets, I probably would be retired on a beach sipping pina coladas. Bottom line, it's not that simple. All of them (yield curves) tell you something a little bit different.
“The twos versus 10s has a pretty good track record of calling recessions going out. Point being, there’s a lot of things that are very different today. You could point to quantitative easing may have suppressed the 10-year-and-out part of the curve. So maybe, because we're starting at an already depressed level, it makes it much easier to invert the curve.
“There's a lot of reasons technically speaking, maybe why the long end is depressed and that's making it much easier for the curve to invert. So we always say ‘listen, if the technicals might be polluting the yield curve at this point, is it a tell to us?
ELLIS PHIFER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, FIXED INCOME RESEARCH, RAYMOND JAMES, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE
“While I think the ultimate result of an aggressive Fed tightening cycle is a recession, I do not expect it to occur quickly. Historically speaking, all recessions are preceded by 2s10s inversions, but not all inversions result in recessions. There have been more inversions than recessions. Inversions that precede recessions do so about 13 months ahead of the recession and the recession typically does not begin until the Fed has completed its hiking cycle and the yield curve has begun to steepen once again.  If the timing is similar to history, the recession will begin roughly about this time next year.”
LOU BRIEN, MARKET STRATEGIST, DRW TRADING, CHICAGO
“The 2s/10s is interesting because I think you can look at the 10-year as an expression of what kind of economic growth is anticipated, and the two-year is more tied to Fed activity. So, for instance back in the 2004 - 2006 rate hike cycle, the fed funds went up from 1% to 5.25%, and during that time, the 425 basis point rise there and the commensurate rise in the two-year note yield, the 10-year essentially did nothing…. it was still a year and a half before the recession came, but it definitely indicates expectations of slower growth. And in part the slower growth is a function of that in the sense that a lending institution doesn’t necessarily want to loan for 5 or 10 years at a level that’s below what he’s borrowing at. So, it’s both an expression of and a function of slower growth.”
JOE MANIMBO, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, WESTERN UNION BUSINESS SOLUTIONS, WASHINGTON
“The movements in the twos and the tens are a reflection that the market is growing nervous that the Fed may not be successful in fostering a soft landing. For one, the Fed has signaled that they could raise rates aggressively and that’s coming against a backdrop of expectations for growth to moderate this year already.”
ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“The yield curve inverting and predicting a recession has had a lot of false positives. What is hysterical to me right now is people are legitimately saying it inverted back in 2019 and 'oh look we went into a recession in 2020,' as if it predicted a pandemic. The time delay between an inversion and a recession tends to be, call it anywhere between 12 and 24 months. Six months have been the shortest and 24 months has been the longest so it’s really not something that is actionable for the average folks. So it is something to talk about until we don’t. The folks that really care about it look at the 3-month, 10-year spread which is at about 185 basis points.”
RICK MECKLER, PARTNER, CHERRY LANE INVESTMENTS, A FAMILY INVESTMENT OFFICE, NEW VERNON, NEW JERSEY 
    ""The stock market view that we're not in for a recession is more likely to be true than the bond market view that we are. You're seeing the ability of the economy to adapt to higher prices. There still remains tremendous liquidity in the system.""
    ""The Russia, Ukraine situation is far from settled in any way. A lot depends on how energy ends up playing out.""
JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CRESSET CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO 

    “This is one more item that the bond market is concerned about that the equity market is shrugging off.”
    “The bond market is sending multiple warning signals that the stock market has essentially shrugged off.”

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's two biggest state banks have sold 303 billion Egyptian pounds ($16.57 billion) in special certificates of deposit (CDs) they introduced last week at a yield of 18%, the state Middle East News Agency (MENA) said on Tuesday. 
The one-year CDs sold by National Bank of Egypt and Banque Misr were designed in part to soak up excess liquidity in the economy and dampen inflation after the central bank allowed the Egyptian pound to slide by about 14% against the dollar on March 21, economists said. 
The currency had been mostly unchanged against the dollar since November 2020. 
Before the devaluation, Egypt had been supporting the currency in part by selling high-yield Egyptian pound treasury bills to foreign investors.
To encourage foreign demand for the bills, the central bank had increasingly been offering short-terms deposits to local banks through open market operations to dissuade them from competing for the T-bills, bankers said.
These operations had risen by 360 billion Egyptian pounds since early October to 985.35 billion pounds as of March 1. 
But concerns about an imminent hike in U.S. interest rates, then the Russian invasion of Ukraine, caused investors to pull billions of dollars out of Egyptian treasuries, bankers and economists said.
The central bank began reducing the size of the open market operations in recent weeks, a move that has poured around 250 billion pounds into the economy since March 1, according to central bank data. The new CDs have now all but soaked that up. 

But this has come at a steep price, bankers said. The 18% yield on the CDs compares to an average yield of 13.395% on one-year T-bills sold to banks at an auction on Thursday, according to central bank data.

The excess savings built up over the pandemic, and increases in wages, will cushion those costs, and allow spending to expand at a decent pace this year. But accelerated depletion of savings will increase the urgency for those staying on the sidelines to join the labor force, and the resulting increase in labor supply will likely dampen wage growth.

TUNIS (Reuters) -The European Union plans to lend Tunisia 450 million euros ($500 million) to support its budget and invest 4 billion euros in the coming years, as the North African country seeks international help to address a looming crisis in public finances.
Speaking after a meeting with Tunisian government officials in Tunis on Tuesday, the EU commissioner for enlargement, Olivier Varhelyi, said the loan would be sent by April and included 300 million euros allocated last year. 
Credit rating agency Fitch this month downgraded Tunisian sovereign debt to junk status and investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said it expected the government to default on loans. 
Tunisia's public finances were already stretched before the pandemic and political turmoil since President Kais Saied suspended parliament and moved to one-man rule last year has delayed efforts to seek additional help.
""We are ready to invest 4 billion euros in several projects, including renewable energy, technology and others in the coming years,"" Varhelyi said, without giving more details.
The Ukraine war has aggravated the government's problems, causing price rises in fuel and grains, which are both subsidised in Tunisia. 
The impact of those price rises on Tunisia's budget will be slightly less than 5 billion dinars ($1.7 billion) this year, the economy minister Samir Saied told Reuters. 

Varhelyi also said the EU had allocated 200 million euros to Maghreb countries - which also include Algeria and Morocco - to help alleviate the impact of grain shortages resulting from the Ukraine crisis.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -Argentina's central bank is likely to hike the benchmark interest rate between 150 and 350 basis points in April, analysts and traders said, after the country finalized a $44 billion debt program with the International Monetary Fund.
The South American country has pledged as part of the IMF deal to shift toward positive real interest rates above annual inflation now at over 52% and forecast to hit as high as 60% this year as the war in Ukraine heats global commodities prices.
Argentina's current interest rate is 44.5%, equivalent to some 54.9% on an effective annualized basis. Seven analysts and traders surveyed by Reuters forecast a rise to between 46% and 48% in April, effectively 57.1% to 60.1% on an annualized basis.
The median forecast from the analysts and traders Reuters spoke to was for the rate to rise to 46.5% in April. The average response was 47%.
Reuters this month, citing a central bank source, reported that it would raise rates again next month if March inflation was around 5%. The bank has increased the rate three times in 2022 after holding it steady for over a year. 
The IMF ""understands the rise in rates as an anti-inflationary policy, while the BCRA (central bank) understands positive returns as a reward for staying in pesos and discouraging dollarization,"" a bank source said.
A central bank spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment on plans for interest rate hikes in April.
Bringing down inflation and bolstering confidence in the local peso currency is key for the major grains exporter to right its embattled economy and build up foreign currency reserves it needs to avoid further defaults down the road.
Analysts said that recent hikes had pushed the benchmark interest rate toward positive real territory, though cautioned that with prices spiraling, the rate may still be too low.
""The renovated pressure stemming from higher commodity prices following the invasion of Ukraine are to drive headline inflation higher, what is not yet incorporated into the BCRA survey,"" J.P. Morgan said in a note.
""When deflating by our own forecast, the ex-ante real policy rate continues to print into negative territory.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The head of the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) was on Tuesday accused of ""very, very basic errors in litigation"" and hiding behind a review into the agency's failings in a tetchy grilling by lawmakers.
Lisa Osofsky said she was duty bound to wait for the recommendations of former High Court judge David Calvert-Smith before being drawn on how two convictions in the high-profile Unaoil bribery prosecution were quashed by the Court of Appeal.
Calvert-Smith was appointed by the Attorney General in February to launch a forensic review into SFO failings - and Osofsky said the agency wanted to cooperate fully, learn the lessons and improve.
""We want to learn, we want to learn to do better, we want to hear his recommendations and respond to them,"" she told the parliamentary committee. ""But at this point ... I am not in a position to answer anything further in regard to that case.""
Paul Bond and Ziad Akle, jailed in Britain over how oil contracts were secured in post-occupation Iraq, had their convictions overturned after senior judges ruled that disclosure failures had rendered their trials unfair.
The Court of Appeal ruled in December that the SFO had refused to hand documents to the defence that showed ""wholly inappropriate"" contact between senior SFO officers and David Tinsley, a U.S.-based fixer with vested interests.
Osofsky was asked to explain why she has said she only twice met Tinsley - who Akle's legal team said had put pressure on him to plead guilty although he did not represent him - when Tinsley had said he had met her nine times.

""I am going to gladly and willingly explain everything to Sir David,"" she said.
Calvert-Smith is expected to publish the findings of his review, which is due to run until the end of May.

524,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 01:21PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said on Tuesday he favors a ""methodical"" series of quarter-percentage-point interest rate increases, but is open to larger half-percentage-point hikes if inflation does not soon show signs of easing.
""I have penciled in seven ... 25-basis-point increases for this year,"" including the one just approved at the U.S. central bank's March 15-16 policy meeting, Harker said in comments to the Center for Financial Stability in New York. 
If there is no improvement in inflation data, ""I am open to sending a strong signal with a 50-basis-point increase at the next meeting,"" Harker said, adding that new coronavirus restrictions in China could throw a ""wrench"" into global supply chains and add inflation pressure beyond what's coming from the war in Ukraine and other factors.
Harker's comments put him among the five policymakers who see the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate rising to a range between 1.75% and 2% this year, which is also the median projection of all Fed policymakers as of the March meeting. 
What Harker sees as a ""deliberate, methodical"" move higher in that policy rate began on March 16 when the Fed lifted it by 25 basis points, moving away from the near-zero rate put in place to limit the economic damage from the pandemic. 
Since then, officials have struck an even more hawkish tone, with comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell and others pointing to a half-percentage-point increase at the Fed's May 3-4 meeting.
Harker said he felt the Fed should be cautious about moving too fast, and did not want to ""slam the brakes"" on the current economic expansion. 
But he also said that the Fed needed to lift rates ""as quickly as possible"" to a neutral level, which he estimated at around 2.5%, and tighten financial conditions even further by beginning to reduce the central bank's nearly $9 trillion balance sheet ""sooner than later.""
A plan to reduce the Fed's holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities could be announced as soon as the May 3-4 policy meeting, and Harker said steady monthly decreases could add the equivalent of two additional quarter-percentage-point rate increases.
Harker also set aside signals coming from some corners of the bond market that aggressive Fed hiking may lead to a recession.
The spread between 10-year and 2-year Treasury bonds on Tuesday was nearing zero. When it dips below zero, it indicates some loss of faith among investors in future economic growth.
Many Fed officials, and recent Fed research, have disputed the value of a bond market ""inversion"" as a recession warning, particularly in an era when all interest rates are low.

Harker said he viewed the current structure of bond spreads as only one market signal, and not necessarily the defining one.
""As a policymaker I have to look at the combination of all those numbers and come up with a pragmatic path of policy and not base it upon any one number,"" he said.

""There are still many uncertainties around the economy, now fuelled by the Ukraine crisis and therefore we must be vigilant about the evolution of the loans, even more so now that the grace periods of the loans guaranteed by the ICO will begin to be lifted"", Deputy Governor Margarita Delgado said.
In 2020, the government approved up to 140 billion euros ($155.39 billion) in so-called ICO liquidity lines, where Spain guaranteed up to 80% of the loans that were channelled through banks to small and mid-sized companies and the self-employed.
On Tuesday, the government approved a new line of 10 billion euros in soft loans, with a 12 month-freeze on repayments, or so-called grace periods, where companies are required to pay only interest and not the principal on a loan.
On existing COVID-19 loans, the government has extended on a general basis maturities by between eight to 10 years and automatically prolonged grace periods by six months.
Delgado said on Tuesday that she expected companies to start experiencing the financial burden of repaying loans in the second quarter.
Regarding bad loans, Delgado said that during 2021 the volume of non-performing assets followed the downward trend of recent years, ""although at a much slower pace from what had been occurring before the pandemic.""
As of January, non-performing loans at Spanish banks stood at 4.32%, still far from its 13.6% peak in December of 2013.

Delgado said however that growth of loans subject to special surveillance, or considered subject to heightened credit risk, had been moderate in the last half of last year, ""although it is still growing at double-digit rates.""

The 50-49 full Senate vote was needed after Republicans on the Banking Committee voted in unison against Cook, producing a 12-12 split. 
Even with Tuesday’s action on Cook, time is running short to confirm President Joe Biden’s slate of Fed picks before the Senate takes a two week recess in April. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer plans to spend next week on confirming Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson.
The other Fed nominees are Jerome Powell for a second term as Fed chair, Lael Brainard as vice chair and Philip Jefferson as a governor. Powell and Jefferson have broad bipartisan support, while Brainard won four GOP votes in committee.
Cook, who would be the first Black woman Fed governor, has been lauded by Democrats as an experienced economist who would bring a diverse perspective to the board. Republicans questioned her qualifications on monetary policy and her political activism.
Schumer criticized the GOP opposition before the vote. “For as much as Republicans talk about inflation, it’s bewildering and totally discrediting for them to reflexively oppose a qualified nominee like Ms. Cook,” he said.
Senator Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the Banking Committee, said on the Senate floor Tuesday he’s concerned Cook could further politicize the Federal Reserve. He cited what he called “extreme left-wing political advocacy and hostility to opposing viewpoints,” including blocking the Senate Banking GOP’s Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account.
And he said Cook struggled to have an opinion on what should be done with monetary policy in her hearing.
“Professor Cook’s claim—made at her nomination hearing just last month—that ‘we have to be patient with the data’ on rising consumer prices shows that she will continue to be tolerant of letting inflation ravage American consumers,” he said.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland has become more vulnerable to a shock from its inflated property sector, Swiss National Bank Vice Chairman Fritz Zurbruegg said on Tuesday, adding it is not the job of monetary policy to curb the risks.
The SNB estimates Swiss apartments to be overvalued by 10% to 35% at present, as ultra low interest rates and tight supply have driven up prices.
""In Switzerland, vulnerabilities in the residential real estate and mortgage markets have increased since the onset of the pandemic,"" Zurbruegg said in a speech in Geneva.
""Moreover, we have observed an increase in affordability risks over recent years.""
A sudden crash in housing prices could eventually lead to loan defaults, banking losses and tightening credit to the real economy, which could lead to an economic downturn, Zurbruegg said.
While the SNB has stuck with its low interest policy, other central banks are raising interest rates to fight inflation.
However, the global level of interest rates is likely to remain low, Zurbruegg said, dampened by demographics, inequality and a strong demand for safe assets.
""Monetary policy has no influence over these factors. Even more importantly, the focus of monetary policy is price stability and economic developments, and not curbing financial system vulnerabilities,"" he said.
Instead, tools like making banks hold more capital against property loans were better ways to improve the resilience of the financial sector, Zurbruegg said.

In January, Switzerland reactivated its counter cyclical capital buffer to build up the loss-absorbing capacity of lenders if property prices collapse.
""Going forward, this resilience must be preserved,"" Zurbruegg said.

“Our evidence points to abnormal U.S. housing market behavior for the first time since the boom of the early 2000s,” the Dallas Fed researchers wrote, citing data to measure “exuberance” on property markets that they’ve developed with scholars around the world as part of the International Housing Observatory. 
The measure suggests that “the U.S. housing market has been showing signs of exuberance for more than five consecutive quarters through third quarter 2021,” they wrote. The surge in home prices has continued since then. 
The Dallas Fed researchers’ index is based on economic variables such as disposable income per-capita, housing rents and long-term interest rates. Their main takeaway is that since the beginning of 2020, price-to-rent ratios have soared beyond what those “fundamentals” alone can explain, and moved into the “exuberance” stage.
They also found that the surge in disposable income due to pandemic-related fiscal and monetary stimulus, as well as reduced household consumption because of mobility restrictions, may have lessened its usefulness as a gauge -- suggesting that any bubble may be more advanced than those numbers suggest. 
“The price-to-income ratio measure alone may produce overly conservative results when identifying housing market bubbles,” the researchers wrote.
The housing boom may have also been fueled by a fear-of-missing-out wave of exuberance among buyers, and more aggressive speculation by investors, they wrote in the blog post. 
But the researchers said that stronger equity positions and household balance sheets suggest that any economic fallout from a home-price correction wouldn’t be on the scale of what the U.S. experienced in the 2007-2009 recession.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain has detained a Russian-owned $50 million superyacht hours before it was due to leave London where it had docked for a meeting of the superyacht awards, saying the move was part of its sanctions package aimed at punishing Moscow. 
The 58.5 metre Dutch-built yacht, named Phi, was detained in the Canary Wharf financial district of London under the government's Russian sanctions, the first time the regulations have been used to detain a ship. 
The government said Phi was owned by a Russian businessman that it did not name, but that ownership was ""deliberately"" hidden, with the company the ship is registered to based in St Kitts and Nevis, and the ship carrying Maltese flags.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the owner of the vessel had not been sanctioned in Britain but that under the law a ship owned, controlled, chartered or operated by persons connected with Russia could be subject to detention. 
The yacht, which features a fresh-water swimming pool and what it described as an ""infinite wine cellar"", was built by shipbuilders Royal Huisman.
""Today we’ve detained a 38 million pound superyacht and turned an icon of Russia’s power and wealth into a clear and stark warning to Putin and his cronies,"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in a statement.
""Detaining the Phi proves, yet again, that we can and will take the strongest possible action against those seeking to benefit from Russian connections.""
Britain has, along with international allies, introduced waves of sanctions on institutions, businesses and wealthy elites, seeking to cripple the Russian economy and punish those with links to the Kremlin for the invasion of Ukraine.
Phi was first identified as being potentially Russian owned on March 13, the government said, and a subsequent investigation by the NCA led to its detention. 
""Today's activity demonstrates the NCA's ability to react at pace,"" Andy Devine from the NCA said. 

The government said it was also looking at a number of other vessels.

Investing.com -- Progress toward a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine may be accelerating, but for world energy markets, just as for the devastated cities of Kharkiv and Mariupol, the point of no return has been emphatically passed.
The European Union last week finally bowed to years of various forms of U.S. pressure, saying it will replace at least a part of its natural gas imports from Russia, which arrive largely through pipelines with liquefied natural gas
It has taken a naked war of aggression – the biggest on the continent since 1939 – to make Europe realize that its dependency on Russian energy had left it, effectively, at the mercy of a neighbor that still cannot kick a centuries-old habit of imperialism, under the rule of a man who has never renounced either the methods or aims of the Soviet Union’s KGB. Finally, the penny appears to have dropped.
Under the terms of a deal outlined by the EU and U.S. last week, the U.S. will help source an extra 15 billion cubic meters of gas for European markets this year, rising to 50 bcm a year by the end of the decade. In the short run, Europe will have to scrap for whatever is available on the open market, but in the long run, it seems that the U.S. or U.S. companies’ operations around the world, will ultimately provide much of that gas. Even if that happens as planned, Russia will still be by far the region's biggest energy supplier (it supplied 24% of all gross available energy in the EU in 2020, according to Eurostat), but it will at least have partially redressed a glaringly imbalanced relationship.
As such, the Ukraine war marks a watershed moment in world energy markets: the moment when one of the biggest energy consuming blocs in the world consciously chose to pay up for the peace of mind that comes with security of supply.
The words “Russia is not a reliable energy provider” may not seem as dramatic on the page or to the ear as Joe Biden’s description of Vladimir Putin as a “war criminal” and a “murderer”, but they go straight to the heart of Russia's economic self-image and, as German Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck spoke them on Monday, they overturned 40 years of (German-led) European economic doctrine that sought to bury past enmities and secure long-term peace with Russia by building economic ties.
“Even during the culminating period of the Cold War, the Soviets never used the oil (sic) as a weapon against us,” Wolfgang Ischinger, the chairman of the Munich Security Conference, said on Monday. “We thought ‘this is gonna be like this forever’ and that they would never abuse this relationship.”
The continuity of such thinking – on all sides – is striking. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan desperately tried to persuade then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl not to sign the contracts that would bring the first Russian gas to West Germany. Kohl persisted, driven by the conviction common to his generation that Germany and Russia must never go to war again (he nonetheless made up to for it to Reagan by persuading a skeptical public to accept the stationing of nuclear-armed Pershing missiles).
Reagan meanwhile made exactly the same arguments about the dependency and vulnerability that have been repeated in recent years by the administrations of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden – administrations that have had little else in common.
Indeed, one measure of Putin’s recklessness and miscalculation is the extent to which he has broken with decades of Russian strategic thinking - including his own.   
By extension, it stands to reason that, once the furore over the current war dies down, the same trade-offs will again raise their heads in some recognizable form. The promise of cheaper Russian energy will always be there, nagging at European industry and governments that can scarcely afford to pass on yet more costs to their customers and voters. Piped gas from Russia will continue to be cheaper than the liquefied version from the U.S., Trinidad, or Qatar, even if Germany and Italy can miraculously build expensive new regasification facilities while at the same time trying to move beyond fossil fuels entirely to meet their climate change goals.
At some point, Europe will have to decide whether to take the cheaper and easier route of reviving the gas trade with Russia, or whether to double down and throw yet more money at its Energy Transition to reduce its overall demand for fossil fuels. But the calculation: “how far to trust Russia?” is a constant of European consciousness throughout the ages. The next time the question is raised, the full price of cheap Russian energy will at least be too clear to ignore.",,,,,

TORONTO (Reuters) - As Canada's inflation outlook worsens, investors are betting the country's central bank will begin hiking its key interest rate in half-percentage-point increments, with the first of the rarely used upsized moves possibly coming as soon as next month.
Money markets expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates by between 200 and 225 basis points in the six remaining interest rate announcements in 2022, up from about 140 basis points before a blockbuster employment report this month.
That bet implies that up to three of those meetings could result in hikes greater than the quarter-percentage-point increments usually favored by the central bank. The last time it pushed through a half-percentage-point hike was in May 2000. 
Canada's economy could be particularly sensitive to a faster pace of interest rate hikes after households ramped up borrowing to record levels during the COVID-19 pandemic to participate in a red-hot housing market.
""The Bank of Canada needs to aggressively tighten policy to keep inflation expectations for the consumer and also for businesses well anchored,"" said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis for Monex Europe and Monex Canada.
""It's a case of do it now because later it will come at a greater cost to economic growth.""
The central bank hiked borrowing costs earlier this month for the first time since October 2018, lifting its policy rate to 0.50%. 
Chances of a larger-sized move on April 13, when the central bank will make its next interest rate announcement, have climbed to 70% after BoC Deputy Governor Sharon Kozicki said on Friday that the pace and magnitude of interest rate increases would be actively discussed at that meeting. 
The Federal Reserve is also expected to hike its benchmark overnight interest rate by 50 basis points at its May 3-4 policy meeting.
The rush to price in more aggressive tightening comes as a commodities rally sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine threatens to push Canadian inflation higher for longer. It touched a 30-year high of 5.7% in February.
The historic link between the Canadian dollar and oil prices has weakened so that the BoC can no longer rely on a stronger currency to ease inflation pressures brought on by higher energy costs, while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's surprise political deal with the smaller left-leaning New Democrats could lead to an increase in spending that further fuels inflation.
NEUTRAL RATE OVERSHOOT
""Markets expect the Bank of Canada to overshoot its own neutral rate estimate as it attempts to bring inflation under control,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay. 
The neutral rate is the level that is expected to be in place when the economy is at full strength and inflation is on target. So it's a signpost of sorts for where interest rates could go.
The BoC is due to refresh its estimate of the neutral rate in the monetary policy report that accompanies next month's rate decision. With productivity growth weakening, economists doubt that the central bank will raise its estimate from the current level of 2.25%, but it could link it to a hawkish signal.

Rather than adjust its neutral estimate, the BoC ""may guide a possible need"" for the end-point in rates to exceed it, said Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank.
Investors see the BoC's policy rate peaking at about 3% next year.

534,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 11:18AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Ukraine will need fast help from other countries to get the fertilizer and seeds needed to restore its farming output and crucial exports to the rest of the world once Russia’s invasion is over, according to the head of the World Bank.
Ukraine would be helped by fertilizer from western Europe to replace imports of that key agricultural input from Belarus that have been cut off, David Malpass, president of the Washington-based development lender, said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Lisa Abramowicz, Jonathan Ferro (NYSE:FOE) and Tom Keene Tuesday.
At a time of food shortages in the developing world, governments in advanced economies also should reduce subsidies that keep prices artificially high -- such as those for ethanol in the U.S. and the Common Agricultural Policy in the European Union -- Malpass said. Countries should instead focus on targeting support to the poor, he said.
Ukraine and Russia account for more than a quarter of the world’s annual wheat sales. Russia on Tuesday said it was taking steps to “de-escalate” the conflict, pledging to cut back military operations and holding out the prospect of a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy to seal a possible peace deal.
“Cessation of the violence is the starting point,” Malpass said. “You have to stop the war, and then quickly provide them with enough funding for seeds and for the fertilizer.”
The World Bank provides about $17 billion annually in food support and has disbursed more than $500 million overall in assistance for Ukraine in recent weeks, Malpass said.

The factory will be part of APRIL's operations in Riau province and have the capacity to produce 1.2 million tonnes of folding box board annually that is fully recyclable and biodegradable.
The investment is aimed at fulfilling domestic and international demand for environmentally-friendly packaging products, amid a global focus on reducing the use of fossil fuel-based plastic packaging, the company said.
APRIL, one of Asia's largest pulp and paper firms, is among several plantation companies that have been criticised for rampant land clearing, which are often blamed for annual forest fires in Indonesia.
APRIL denies involvement in illegal land clearing and forest fires and says its sustainability policy includes no deforestation.
Construction of the new facility will be completed in the third quarter of 2023 and it will also be able to produce 1.06 million tonnes of kraft pulp and 600,000 tonnes of bleached chemi-thermo mechanical pulp , which are raw materials used to make paper, according to a statement by Indonesia's coordinating ministry for economic affairs. 

Additional supplies for the new production capacity will come entirely from the firm's existing supply chain, said APRIL, a company owned by Indonesian businessman Sukanto Tanoto, adding that it plans to continue to boost its fibre plantation productivity.

536,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 09:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- German two-year debt tumbled, pushing the yield above zero for the first time in eight years as investors prepared for the European Central Bank to scale back its ultra-loose monetary policy.
The yield on two-year notes, among the most sensitive to changes in short-term borrowing costs, surged as much as 16 basis points on Tuesday to 0.04%, a level last seen in August 2014. Money markets have been cranking up wagers that the ECB will raise its key rate to 0% as soon as year-end to tame surging inflation, putting an end to years of negative policy rates.
The selloff was exacerbated as investors fled haven assets amid optimism that progress was being made in striking a cease-fire in Ukraine. While the moves have knocked trillions of dollars off the value of global bond markets, it also means the entire German bond curve now yields more than zero, and may come as a relief for investors who’ve had to endure losses on bonds they held to maturity for years. 
“It’s remarkable to have the whole German curve back above zero,” said Rishi Mishra, an analyst at Futures First.
The ECB cut its deposit rate to record low of minus 0.5% in Sept. 2019 and held it there to help the economy weather the pandemic, a policy that until recently has put a cap on the region’s yields. It slashed borrowing costs below zero in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis in 2014.
The ECB is still trailing peers including the Federal Reserve and Bank of England in raising interest rates, but Chief Economist Philip Lane said this week that it could be appropriate to start normalizing policy this year. Officials have recently pointed to the need for tighter policy as the war in Ukraine drives up the price of key commodities including oil, a hawkish tilt that threatens to exacerbate the rout.
About $2.6 trillion has been wipe from from the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index since a peak in 2021. The aggregate of negative-yielding debt in the euro-area fell below one trillion euros for the first time since 2014 on Monday, a far cry from a peak of over eight trillion euros reached at the end of 2020.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Leftist Colombia presidential candidate Gustavo Petro's promises to halt new oil projects and redistribute pension funds could put the country's economic stability at risk, investors say, though doubts remain about his ability to implement them.
Petro, a senator and former M-19 guerrilla rebel, has tallied up to 37% of intended votes in recent polls, putting him 10 points ahead of the center-right Federico Gutierrez but unlikely to win in a first round.
His chances in a second vote, where a more centrist opponent would likely garner broader support, remain uncertain.
Still, some investors are spooked by Petro's promised ""democratization of the economy,"" which includes freezing new oil and gas exploration, comparing his rhetoric to that of socialist Venezuelan leaders who have presided over a collapse of that country's economy.
Oil accounts for nearly half of exports and close to 10% of national income, but Petro argues new projects should be barred for environmental reasons and to move Colombia away from its dependence on the industry.
Successive presidential administrations have sought to diversify the nation's commodity exports away from oil and coal, including by encouraging gold and copper projects, but community opposition, slow licensing and environmental rulings have kept change slow. 
State-run oil company Ecopetrol has played up its expansion into renewables, but is also set to launch a pilot project using hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a practice opposed by environmentalists.
Petro's proposed halt could send investment elsewhere at a time when Colombia is struggling with low credit ratings, a large trade deficit and national debt which has doubled to 72% of GDP over the last decade.
He also plans to redistribute money from private to public pension funds and make payments to 3 million people without pensions.
""How to democratize capital, land? By giving to millions of people, to Colombian society,"" Petro told newspaper La Republica.
The plans, which Petro says are aimed at righting profound income inequality, are leading investors to put deals on ice.
""I have seen a lot of fear on the part of local investors and business people,"" said Andres Abadia, head Latin American economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""Many of them have parked investment projects until elections take place.""
The worries are reflected in charges on five-year credit default swaps for Colombian debt, which stand at 203.9 basis points, their highest level in nearly six years and in line with those for Brazil, which has lower credit ratings.
Petro has also promised to increase taxes and royalties on extractive industries like mining and charge major landholders for unproductive land, raising some $5.2 billion. He also proposes to raise up to $3.9 billion by progressively taxing companies. 
In addition, he has said, without providing details, that he wants the central bank to lend to the government to boost subsidies for the poor and has said he would name ""people close to society"" to its board.
Each Colombian president generally names two of seven central bank board members during their term. 
Colombia's public pension system has a yearly funding gap of some $10.5 billion, according to the finance ministry. Private funds, which Petro suggests dipping into to shore up public coffers, administer about $92 billion.
Those without pensions would get about 500,000 pesos ($133) monthly - half a minimum wage and six times what they currently receive - though Petro has not said how many would be eligible.
THE PETRO CLAUSE
The anxiety about his policies is such that some oil and real estate investors are including a contractual clause which conditions deals on a Petro loss, according to a source at Bogota's Chamber of Commerce, two lawyers and a leading businessman, all of whom asked not to be named.
Reuters could not gain access to any contracts with such a stipulation.
""Those who leave are fools,"" Petro told local Caracol Radio when asked about the clauses. ""What there is going to be is more (economic) production."" 
Though Petro's most radical proposals would likely meet with little success in a divided congress, he could directly adopt other measures if he were to win.
""Colombia undoubtedly has strong institutions ... all of that is something which alleviates a little of investor concern, and the fact there is no re-election,"" said Ben Ramsey, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s director of economic research for Latin America.
""But what's more worrisome are things that could be viable, like increasing spending and the idea there could be a confidence shock that could reduce private investment and growth,"" Ramsey said.
A halt to new projects would sow doubt about Colombia's stability for the oil industry, said Nelson Castaneda, president of oil services guild Campetrol, adding Petro could simply bar approval of contracts. 
""Capital moves to where there are better guarantees,"" he said.

Even if Petro's plans are stymied, his election alone could put the brakes on investment, said Andres Pardo, head of Latin America macroeconomic strategy at XP (NASDAQ:XP) Investments.
""If Petro were to become president and could not carry out some of the reforms, what he could generate is a bit of paralysis in the pace of economic activity,"" he said. ""Both foreign and local investors would simply slow down their decisions significantly.""

538,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 09:10AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank should raise its key interest rate to zero by year-end or it will risk having to raise it even more abruptly next year to bring down inflation, ECB policymaker Robert Holzmann said in an interview published on Tuesday.
The Austrian governor was the first to explicitly back market expectations for the ECB to raise its deposit rate by 50 basis points by its December meeting in the face of prices growing at a record pace in the euro area. 
""An increase to the deposit rate to zero by the end of the year would be important for monetary policy because it increases optionality,"" Holzmann, the most hawkish member of the ECB's Governing Council, told Germany newspaper Boersen-Zeitung.
""If, towards the end of the year, we were to find that inflation will remain higher for longer, we would have to tighten monetary policy more and raise interest rates more significantly.""
He added the ECB's baseline forecasts for this year were outdated by the time they were published on March 10 as a result of the war in Ukraine and expected the economy to follow the central bank's adverse scenario, which puts GDP growth at 2.5% and inflation at 5.9% this year.

Holzmann said the ECB may still be underestimating inflation, as it has done in recent months, and that bringing it down remained policymakers' ""top priority"".
The Austrian governor said the ECB, which targets an inflation rate of 2% over the medium term, needed to bring its policy rate to between 1% and 1.5% just to normalise its policy after years with its foot on the accelerator.

The central bank has raised its two-week repo rate by 425 basis points since June, tightening aggressively to tackle inflation that hit a 24-year high of 11.1% in February. Price pressures are still building, spurred on by rising energy costs following the Ukraine conflict.
A Reuters poll showed most analysts expected the central bank to deliver one more big interest rate increase when it meets on Thursday, and only a few predicted borrowing costs would rise again later this year.
Nine out of the 12 analysts polled predicted an increase of 50 basis points this week and two expected a rise of 25 basis points. One expected no change.
Of the six respondents giving an outlook beyond March, three forecast the main rate would peak at 5.50% this year. In a January poll, only one forecast rates would rise above 5%.
The central bank will announce its decision at 2:30 p.m. (1230 GMT) on Thursday, followed by a news conference at 3:45 p.m. where Governor Jiri Rusnok will comment on the vote.
Prior to Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"", central bankers thought it unlikely rates would climb above 5%. But opinions have changed.
Board member Tomas Holub told Reuters last week that he expected to be in the camp favouring a larger rather than smaller move at Thursday's meeting, but also said he was open to debate about raising to 5.00% now and further in May.
Vice-Governor Marek Mora said that he saw rates going ""well above"" 5%.
The central bank may also debate using its large international reserves, which stood at about 64% of gross domestic product in February, to fight inflation and not just as a tool to stabilise exchange rate fluctuations.

The bank announced on March 4 it had intervened in markets after the crown had weakened sharply with other currencies in central Europe amid the fallout from the Ukraine conflict.
Holub said this month he would prefer to tighten monetary policy through rates rather than currency interventions.

NEW DELHI - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is set to fly to India this week, sources said, finding time to visit to one of the biggest buyers of Russian commodities since the international community began isolating Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.
There is little sign that buying will slow down any time soon, as more deals get signed. One source said the two countries could discuss smoothening trade payments disrupted by Western sanctions on Russian banks. Media have said he could hold talks in the Indian capital on Friday.
It will only be Lavrov's third visit overseas since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, after a trip to Turkey for talks with his Ukrainian counterpart earlier this month and a scheduled meeting in China on Thursday.
Russia is India's main supplier of defence hardware but overall annual trade is small, averaging about $9 billion in the past few years, mainly fertiliser and some oil. By comparison, India's bilateral trade with China is more than $100 billion a year.
But given sharp discounts on Russian crude oil since the attack on Ukraine, India has bought at least 13 million barrels, compared with nearly 16 million barrels imported from the country for the whole of last year. Many European countries have also continued to buy Russian energy despite publicly criticising Moscow.
New Delhi has called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine but has refused to explicitly condemn Moscow's actions. It has abstained from voting on multiple U.N. resolutions on the war.
India is now considering doubling its imports of Russian coking coal used in making steel, the Indian steel minister said on Sunday. Reuters reported on Tuesday that India recently contracted to buy 45,000 tonnes of Russian sunflower oil for April delivery after supplies from Ukraine stopped. Last year, India bought about 20,000 tonnes from Russia a month.
""India will import more items from Russia, especially if it is at a discount,"" one senior Indian government official said.
The government has been looking to establish a rupee-rouble trade system and discussions between Indian and Russian financial officials are ongoing, said the source. All the sources declined to be named as the talks were private.
The Indian government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
OTHER MECHANISMS
Besides the rupee-rouble trade window, several other options are on the cards, including settling all government and quasi-government payments directly through the central banks of the two countries, said the source.
""India has made up its mind to continue trading with Russia, one way or the other,"" said Happymon Jacob, a professor of international studies at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.
""During the Russian foreign minister's visit, the bureaucracy could definitely bring up the issue of how to continue looking for alternative mechanisms to smoothen trade relations between the two sides.""
Russia's embassy in New Delhi said it could not confirm the visit. India's foreign ministry said it had no information to share.
In a sign of sustained ties despite the Ukraine crisis, India is considering allowing Russia to use its funds lying with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to invest in Indian corporate bonds, said another Indian government source.
Russia has retained about 20 billion rupees ($263 million) of Indian payments for Russian defence equipment with the RBI.

But another Indian government official said New Delhi would have to diplomatically tackle pressure from the West to be able to maintain its ties with Russia.
U.S. President Joe Biden said this month India was ""somewhat shaky"" in acting against Russia. A U.S. diplomat said last week after meeting Indian officials in New Delhi that the United States had not asked partners like India to suddenly stop energy purchases from Russia.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy plans to confirm its 2022 budget deficit target at 5.6% of national output, two sources close to the matter told Reuters, despite coalition pressure to sharply hike borrowing as the growth outlook deteriorates.
Mario Draghi's government is preparing to slash its growth forecast for this year to 2.8% from a previous 4.7% goal made in September, the sources said, amid surging energy costs and turmoil linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
In confirming the 5.6% deficit goal, Draghi is helped by the fact that on current trends the deficit is on track for 5.3%, according to the sources, allowing potential leeway of 4 billion to 5 billion euros ($4.4 billion to $5.5 billion) of additional spending without increasing the current target. Last year's deficit came in at 7.2%.
The new figures will be published by the Treasury next week in its annual Economic and Financial Document (DEF).
Draghi has been facing pressure from his ruling coalition to approve a major new spending package to support growth in the euro zone's third largest economy, and some party chiefs may keep seeking to overcome his intransigence.
The figures are still subject to marginal changes as the Treasury awaits final data on public finances for the fourth quarter of 2021, to be published by national statistics bureau ISTAT on April 5, the sources said.
For 2023, Rome now sees GDP rising by around 2.5%, the sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The new forecast is down from an official goal of 2.8% made in September.
The growth forecasts are based on an unchanged policy scenario and so do not include the impact of new supportive measures to be funded through the budget leeway.
For this reason, the final GDP targets will be somewhat more ambitious.
Italy grew 6.6% last year following a record contraction of 9.0% in 2020 caused by extended coronavirus lockdowns.
This year did not begin well. Italian industrial output dived 3.4% in January from the month before, its steepest fall for more than a year, even before the headwinds generated by the Ukraine war. Consumer and business sentiment both slumped in March.
The Ukraine conflict has exacerbated already sky-high energy costs and triggered supply crunches for agriculture.
The government has so far has set aside more than 19 billion euros since last July to try to soften the increase in energy and fuel prices for firms and households.
Italy, whose top two banks have sizeable exposure to Russia and which relies heavily on Moscow for its energy needs, could see its growth outlook deteriorate further if the West ramps up its sanctions against Russia.

The Kremlin has warned that Rome could face ""irreversible consequences"" if it follows this path.

Investing.com -- Risk assets rise and havens fall as peace talks between Russia and Ukraine appear to get closer to a major breakthrough. European economic data remain alarmingly weak, however. U.S. house price figures and the Labor Department's monthly Job Openings survey are due, as are earnings from Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) and chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ:MU). Oil edges higher as OPEC and its allies prepare for another phantom production increase. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 29th March.
1. Peace talks make progress
Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine appeared to be on the verge of a breakthrough. Diplomatic negotiations between the two sides resumed in Istanbul earlier and an aide to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky promised a statement “in several hours.”
At the same time, Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that Russia had achieved its main objectives with what it calls a “special military operation,” namely the degrading of Ukraine’s military capability and the ‘liberation’ of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, part of which had seceded with Russia’s assistance eight years ago.
Western officials have expressed suspicion that Russia may only be using the peace talks to buy time to regroup, having suffered far higher casualties than expected over the last month. However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by newswires as saying that the fate of the talks could be decided “today or tomorrow.”
2. Europe makes strong gains on peace hopes
European assets responded strongly to the signs of progress toward a diplomatic settlement, while safe haven assets retreated.
By 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), the euro had gained 0.6% against the dollar to $1.1042, while European stock markets were up by as much as 2.3%. The Euro Stoxx 50 advanced 2.2%. Gold futures, by contrast, touched a two-week low of $1,906 an ounce before recovering slightly to trade at $1,913, down 1.4% on the day.
The biggest gainers included stocks that are directly dependent on supplies of Russian gas for their operations. German chemicals giant BASF (DE:BASFN), one of whose board members warned that it might have to shut its Ludwigshafen headquarters even if Russian gas supplies only fall by 50%, saw its stock rise by 3.8%. Russia has threatened to suspend deliveries if European buyers don’t agree to pay in rubles from the end of the month. G7 Energy Ministers roundly rejected the demand on Monday.
3. U.S. Stocks set to open higher; Lululemon, Micron eyed - as well as Fed speakers
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher later, supported by the more friendly global tone, but with one eye on the day’s round of speeches from Federal Reserve officials. New York Fed President John Williams and his Philadelphia counterpart Patrick Harker are both due to speak in the course of the day.
By 6:20 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 134 points, or 0.4%, while S&P 500 futures were also up 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.3%.

4. Europe still low on confidence as cost of living hits
Cost of living issues were unmistakably at work in data releases overnight, with sharp drops recorded in German and French consumer confidence in March. Food and energy prices have risen markedly in recent months, and consumers tend to attribute more importance to items that are bought frequently.
Elsewhere, the U.K. reported the biggest monthly rise in over five years in household borrowing, suggesting that consumers are rapidly running down their pandemic-era savings as inflation runs at the highest rate in 30 years. Mortgage approvals and mortgage lending both resumed their downward trends, too, falling well short of expectations.
British consumers at least had the entertaining spectacle of the Metropolitan Police handing out fixed penalty notices to Downing Street officials who had organized a series of lockdown-busting parties during the pandemic. The Met refused to name any individuals involved, although newspapers had reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was unlikely to receive a fine, despite attending at least two of the banned events. As such, he’s likely to avoid getting a criminal record.
5. Oil prices edge up as OPEC stands firm
Ministers from OPEC countries again refused to budge from their long-standing position of gradual increases in output to bring down crude prices that are still well above $100 a barrel.
OPEC and allies, including Russia, are due to meet later this week and are expected to stick with their plan for an increase of 400,000 barrels a day from May. However, they seem even less likely to achieve that than usual, given supply problems in both Russia and Kazakhstan. The Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which ships Kazakh oil to world markets via the Black Sea, will be shipping at reduced rates for at least the next three to four weeks due to storm damage to its export terminal.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude prices were up 1.4% at $107.39 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 1.4% at $110.98.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is ready to organise a scheme for millions of Ukrainian refugees to exchange their hryvnia currency into euros if the EU gives the ECB a guarantee that would cover the bank's risk, an ECB document showed.
Almost 4 million Ukrainians have fled the Russian invasion into the EU but they face problems with exchanging money because few banks want to buy the currency of a country engulfed by war.
Sources told Reuters earlier in the month that the ECB was working on a currency conversion facility, but the document spells out for the first time the options for how that might be achieved. 
""The preferred option would be that the ECB and Eurosystem National Central Banks act as fiscal agents for the Union,"" said the ECB paper, sent to the European Commission last week and seen by Reuters. 
Under this option, EU governments would mandate the ECB to carry out the scheme and, to adhere to the prohibition of monetary financing of governments by the bank, they would provide the bank with the money needed to fulfil that mandate.
""The alternative option is based on a mandate given to the ECB by the central bank of Ukraine,"" the ECB paper said. 
The ECB would sign a deal with the central bank of Ukraine to act as its agent and the EU, through its budget, would extend a guarantee to cover the risk that the Ukrainian central bank might not be able to honour the deal because of the war.
The deal would include the exchange rate for the exchange of hryvnias into euros, the maximum amount and the time during which the scheme would be operational.
While the ECB proposal is for euros, the bank said it could be extended to include EU countries that do not use the euro.
Most of the refugees have headed to Poland, which says it has welcomed 2.3 million people so far. Fellow EU members Romania, Slovakia and Hungary have also seen large numbers of arrivals. Of those, only Slovakia belongs to the single currency.
An EU official said there was broad support among EU countries for an EU wide guarantee proposed by the ECB because it would mean the risks of the scheme would be shared more equally among EU countries.

Now they affect mainly the national central banks in countries where the refugees are the most numerous.
The ECB proposal is separate from another plan now under consideration by EU governments under which each Ukrainian refugee could exchange up to 10,000 hryvnias (311 euros) into an EU currency for three months with each EU country handling on its own the financial risk of the exchange.

544,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 06:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials, rattled by persistent inflation and criticism that they’re behind the curve, have pivoted toward an even more aggressive plan of interest-rate hikes than they signaled earlier this month to ensure price increases cool.
In the days after the March 15-16 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues shifted from a long-standing preference for slow and gradual interest-rate increases to front-loading policy with a half-point hike on the table in May and more to come. 
The war in Ukraine initially made them cautious, with officials backing a quarter-point increase this month as they raised rates from near zero. But investors took the hike in stride and the Fed quickly became more concerned that the surge in food and energy prices caused by the war would entrench inflation -- and expectations -- at unacceptably high levels. 
In speech after speech since they raised rates, officials stress that they want the central bank’s lead role in cooling price pressures to occupy a much more prominent part in the national conversation.
“Inflation, inflation, inflation is the top of everyone’s mind,” San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told the Bloomberg Equality Summit on March 23, adding that “I have everything on the table right now,” including a half-point hike in May, to cool the hottest price pressures in 40 years. 
Daly’s comments followed those of Chair Jerome Powell who in a March 21 speech said the policy committee needed to move “expeditiously,” a more aggressive tone than his post-meeting press conference a few days earlier.
The suddenness of the shift -- the latest escalation from the Fed since it began signaling tighter policy toward the end of last year -- leaves the impression that officials are scrambling to catch up, said Derek Tang, an economist at LH Meyer in Washington.
“They bet their name on inflation coming down in the second half,” he said. But with Ukraine raising food and energy prices and China supply chains further crimped by virus lockdowns, “it looks less and less likely that is going to happen.”
That assessment seems to have pushed the center of gravity on the Federal Open Market Committee toward a half-point hike in May, with investors leaning into that bet in interest-rate futures markets and pricing around 2.1% percentage points of more tightening for the year as a whole -- the equivalent of about eight quarter-point hikes over six remaining meetings this year.
Some on Wall Street expect the Fed to go even faster: Citigroup Inc. economists have penciled in four straight half-point hikes, followed by two quarter-point moves.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“Fedspeak since the March FOMC meeting has confirmed one thing: The FOMC would have hiked interest rates by 50bps in March had Russia not invaded Ukraine. The war has immediately exacerbated inflation, but the dampening effect on U.S. growth or the labor market has yet to show.”
-- Anna Wong, Yelena Shulyatyeva, Andrew Husby and Eliza Winger (economists)

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, one of the last doves, penned a clarifying mea culpa on March 18 explaining how his views on both inflation and interest rates had evolved.
Loretta Mester, the Cleveland Fed President who is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year, suggested Feb. 24 that she would wait until mid-year to determine whether the rate path needed to speed up. A month later, she said she found it “appealing” to front-load some of the rate increases “earlier rather than later.”
“When things turn out different than you anticipated, you admit your forecast was wrong and adapt,” said former Fed Vice Chair Donald Kohn, who’s now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “You might argue that the forecast was unusually wrong and the adaptation has had to be unusually quick and large.”
In fairness to his former colleagues, Kohn also pointed out that there’s nothing in the experience of recent policy making or forecasting to compare with the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
In past cycles, Fed officials had reasonable confidence in their forecasts and that the economy would behave as it had done in the past. Now, they say they are beyond both their goals for maximum employment and stable prices. That’s put their forecast on trial: If the evidence makes a strong case that it is wrong, they must adjust policy.
Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said evidence of a mistake has been building up since last summer.
Officials expected the tight U.S. labor market to loosen as the virus faded and schools reopened in September, allowing millions to return to work and easing wage pressures. 
But the labor force participation rate, which measures people who have a job or are looking for one, didn’t rise that much. Durable goods prices also kept rising, as did gauges of underlying price pressures.
“The inflation, labor market and wage developments all kind of demolished their thinking prior to Labor Day,” Feroli said. 
One of the reasons that the Fed was slow to raise rates was a new policy framework they adopted in 2020 aimed at ensuring broad-based and inclusive full employment that ruled out preemptively raising rates to keep price pressures in check, which has been the Fed’s reflex since former Chair Paul Volcker defeated inflation in the 1980s.
Feroli is among many economists wondering if that new strategy, which saw it hold rates near zero until it reached full employment, unnecessarily tied their hands.
“That may be part of what got us here,” he said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's government is aiming to use billions in budget goodies to offset cost of living pressures for disgruntled voters ahead of an election in May, but the consumer mood may already be too dark for the ploy to gain much traction.
Releasing his 2022/23 Budget on Tuesday, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg surprised analysts by increasing a tax break for 10 million low and middle income earners that would hit bank accounts in July. 
Also offered were one-off cash payments for pensioners, a temporary cut in fuel taxes and the usual pre-election splurge on infrastructure projects.
""In this budget, we're delivering temporary, targeted and responsible cost-of-living relief for Australians now,"" Frydenberg told reporters ahead of the budget's release.
Some of this largesse has been funded by a tax windfall from surprisingly high prices for Australia's commodity exports, combined with an unexpectedly strong labour market.
Yet the government will still run a swollen budget deficit of A$79.8 billion ($59.75 billion) in the year to end June, with another A$78.0 billion needing to be borrowed in 2022/23.
The red ink reaches out to 2025/26, with all the past talk of surpluses jettisoned by the centre-right government.
Forecasts for economic growth were revised up, while unemployment was seen hitting 60-year lows of 3.75% later this year. Wage growth was also forecast to accelerate to a decade-high, though such projections are notoriously unreliable having overshot reality for years.
The Liberal National coalition of Prime Minister Scott Morrison is hoping all this good cheer will revive its standing in opinion polls, where it is running a distant second to the opposition Labor Party.
The bar is a high one, however, as ANZ Bank's latest survey of consumers showed sentiment on personal finances was the bleakest since the depths of the pandemic in May 2020.
""Consumer confidence is very weak given the strength of employment, which we think is directly linked to concerns over cost-of-living pressures,"" said ANZ's head of Australian economics David Plank.
""It will be interesting to see whether the measures in the Federal Budget provide a boost to confidence.""
Keeping consumers happy is vital for the economy given they have been the engine of recovery. Data out on Tuesday showed retail sales jumped a solid 1.8% in February, while spending on bank cards has held up well in March.
An added complication is that rising inflation has the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) contemplating a hike in record-low interest rates later this year, the first since 2010.
Analysts warned the Budget walked a fine line between providing too much near-term stimulus that could add to pressure for an earlier move by the RBA.

A lift in borrowing costs would certainly not be welcomed by Australian households whom, in aggregate, hold record amounts of mortgage debt.

The ministry said it had channelled $102 million for the coupon payout on the Eurobond to Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD). 
""The Russian finance ministry has fully executed its obligations to service sovereign securities of the Russian Federation in accordance with the Eurobond prospectus,"" the ministry said, without giving details on whether the payment had been sent to Euroclear or processed further to foreign Eurobond holders.

According to the Eurobond prospectus, settlement with investors occurs through the NSD and Euroclear, and ""if, for reasons beyond its control, the Russian Federation is unable to make payments... in U.S. dollars"", settlement may be in euros, pound sterling, Swiss francs or Russian roubles. 
Neither Euroclear nor NSD immediately responded to a request for comment. 

In mid-March, Russia paid $117 million in interest due on two sovereign eurobonds and last week another $66 million coupon due on another issue. Excluding this Monday's coupon, Russia has another $4.4 billion in external debt redemptions due for the remainder of the year. Some corporate borrowers have also faced payment delays.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan kept up its relentless quest to defend a key yield cap by offering to buy unlimited amounts of 10-year government bonds on Tuesday, underscoring its resolve to keep policy ultra-loose and putting downward pressure on the yen.
The BOJ's intervention raised the stakes for policymakers in the world's third-largest economy as Japan tries to navigate the rising cost of imports from a weakening currency and global fallout of the Ukraine war.
The bond market intervention is in line with an announcement the BOJ made on Monday to offer unlimited bond buying from Tuesday to Thursday to keep the 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield from rising above an implicit 0.25% cap it sets around its 0% target.
The BOJ made two offers on Tuesday, after the first in the morning failed to push down yields much. Combined, the offers drew bids worth 528.6 billion yen ($4.28 billion).
The 10-year JGB yield stood at 0.245% on Tuesday, hovering near the BOJ's implicit 0.25% cap despite the central bank's intervention.
Some analysts doubted if the central bank can sustain its bond-buying action for a prolonged period.
""Theoretically the BOJ can protect 25 basis-point upper bound through unlimited fixed-rate operations. But at the same time, I think this situation is not sustainable,"" said Kentaro Koyama, chief economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in Tokyo.
""In the short term, the BOJ can continue unlimited purchasing operations. But if the BOJ continues to be challenged by the market, I think it may be the trigger to adjust their yield curve control.""
Struggling to swim against the tide of rising interest rates globally, the BOJ staunchly defended its 0.25% yield cap on Monday with a rare step of offering to buy unlimited sum of 10-year JGBs at 0.25% twice in a single day.
The central bank then announced its plan for consecutive interventions that will last until Thursday.
Aside from the offer to buy unlimited amount of 10-year JGBs at 0.25%, the BOJ may also conduct unscheduled buying operation for super-long bonds if yields for the maturity spike, analysts say.
""With regard to the outright purchases of JGBs...the BOJ may change the schedule and amounts of the purchases as needed, taking account of market conditions,"" the BOJ said in Monday's statement announcing its plan for fixed-rate operations.
Underlining the selling pressure JGBs faced, the yield curve steepened at the longer end. The yields for 20-, 30- and 40-year notes all rose to their highest levels since 2016.
Under yield curve control, the BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1% and the 10-year JGB yield around 0%.
YEN CHALLENGE 
The BOJ's aggressive efforts to cap yields pushed the yen to six-year lows against the dollar, which could add to the strains facing households and retailers by inflating already soaring raw material import costs.
In a sign of the government's growing alarm over the yen's fall, Japan's top currency diplomat said Tokyo has discussed dollar-yen moves with Washington, and the two sides agreed to communicate closely on currencies.
The yen's decline likely won't discourage the BOJ from defending its yield cap, said Toru Suehiro, senior economist at Daiwa Securities.
""The BOJ's message to prevent interest rate rises is a very strong one with no consideration to the weak-yen effect its action could cause,"" said Suehiro.
Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiji Kihara, among the closest aides to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, said on Sunday the BOJ must maintain its massive stimulus as dealing with cost-push inflation with policy tightening is difficult.

In a sign fiscal policy will play a bigger role in cushioning the blow from rising raw material costs, Kishida ordered his cabinet on Tuesday to compile a fresh relief package.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday submitted a $5.79 trillion budget plan to Congress that calls for record peacetime military spending and further aid for Ukraine, while raising taxes for billionaires and companies and lowering government deficits.
The budget proposal for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, lays out Biden's priorities, including campaign promises to make the wealthy and companies pay more tax. It is merely a wish list as lawmakers on Capitol Hill make the final decisions on budget matters.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress looked forward to working on Biden's ""bold fiscal blueprint,"" even as some fellow Democrats chafed at Biden's pledge to boost military spending. Biden's plan drew immediate criticism from Republicans, who together with moderate Democrats, killed similar tax proposals in the 2022 budget.
""The budget I am releasing today sends a clear message to the American people (about) what we value: first, fiscal responsibility, second, safety and security, and thirdly ... the investments needed to build a better America,"" Biden told reporters at the White House.
The Democratic president said he was calling for higher defense spending to strengthen the U.S. military and ""forcefully respond to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s aggression against Ukraine"" with $1 billion in additional U.S. support for Ukraine’s economic, humanitarian, and security needs.
The document, based on economic projections locked in before the war in Ukraine, offers fresh insight into Biden's thinking as he prepares for a Nov. 8 midterm election that could see his Democratic Party lose control of Congress.
Biden told reporters his administration is ""making real headway cleaning up the fiscal mess I inherited"", and will reduce the federal deficit by more than $1.3 trillion this year with $1 trillion in further cuts planned over the next decade.
“For most Americans the last few years were very hard, stretching them to the breaking point. But billionaires and large corporations got richer than ever,"" he said, adding, ""That's not fair ... Just pay your fair share.""
The U.S. federal government, on the hook for rising healthcare and social spending, especially for older Americans, has spent more money than it has taken in for each of the last 20 years.
'CONTENTIOUS' PROCESS 
House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, a Democrat, predicted a ""contentious"" battle among Democrats over Biden's call for big hikes in the already mammoth U.S. military budget. Republicans said it didn't raise military spending enough.
With a razor-thin majority in the House, Yarmouth warned that Democrats could lose no more than three to five votes within the party and still pass a budget opposed by Republicans.
Yarmuth said the entire process could drag out again as it did last year, when Congress did not approve a budget until August, long after the House wrote its appropriations bills.
Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said Biden's tax hikes would harm U.S. workers and the overall economy, while increasing deficits.
Under Biden's policies, deficits would fall to 5.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) this year and stay below 5% over the next decade. That compares to 14.9% of GDP in 2020, the last year of the Trump administration, the White House said.
The focus on deficit reduction reflected the concerns of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, whose stated concerns over rising U.S. debt already thwarted passage of Biden's ""Build Back Better"" plan last year.
On the home front, Biden's plan boosts spending on policing, efforts to fight gun crime, and invests heavily in crime prevention, while adding some $50 billion to address the critical shortage of affordable housing.
The plan does not include line items for bolstering climate change, healthcare, education and manufacturing competitiveness that featured heavily in the ""Build Back Better"" bill. 
Instead, it has a deficit-neutral reserve fund to allow lawmakers to negotiate those items, Shalanda Young, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said. 
BILLIONAIRES' TAX
It introduces a new minimum tax requiring the very wealthy to pay at least 20% of their income in taxes, including on the gains on investments that have not been sold.
That tax would apply to 0.01% of American households - those worth over $100 million - with more than half of the new revenue coming from households worth more than $1 billion, the White House said. It would reduce the government deficit by $360 billion over the next decade. 
The budget also targets U.S. corporate buybacks, requiring company executives to hold on to company shares that they receive for several years after a stock buyback.
It would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% while making changes to the corporate tax code to reward job creation and investment.

It calls for $773 billion for the Department of Defense, plus $40 billion for defense-related programs at the FBI, Department of Energy and other agencies.
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has intensified concerns about European security, while the Biden administration continues to invest in research and development of hypersonic missiles and other modern capabilities.

(Reuters) - U.S. sanctions against Russia should hasten a move by some countries to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar, which could also soften demand for Treasuries just as the Federal Reserve, the largest holder of U.S. debt, looks to cut its bond holdings.
The United States and other Western nations have imposed widespread economic sanctions against Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, which have effectively cut off Russia's central bank, sovereign wealth fund, banks, and certain individuals from entering into U.S. dollar transactions. 
The dollar is the world's top reserve currency. Analysts say using it as a financial weapon is likely to accelerate a move already under way by many countries to diversify investments into alternative currencies.
“The more we use it, the more other countries are going to diversify due to geopolitical reasons,” said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a fellow for international political economy at the Council on Foreign Relations.
The dollar’s reserve status boosts demand for U.S. assets including Treasury bonds and allows the government to issue more debt at lower rates than it may otherwise be able to. Treasuries are also attractive to investors as the market is larger and more liquid than others.
If Treasuries are less appealing to some investors just as more supply hits the market, however, the result may be higher yields.
The Fed is expected to begin letting Treasuries mature without replacement off its $8.9 trillion balance sheet in the coming months, in addition to aggressively hiking interest rates as it tackles soaring inflation. Benchmark 10-year yields hit 2.56% on Monday, the highest since May 2019.
Though the dollar is unlikely to be replaced as the reserve currency anytime soon, any steady shift away from the greenback may lead to a more fragmented global economy where payments are more evenly split between currencies including the dollar, the euro and the yuan.
“US dollar debasement (is the) ultimate outcome as dollar weaponized in new era of sanctions,” Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts led by Michael Hartnett noted in a report released Thursday.
In a sign that shift is already gaining pace, The Wall Street Journal said this month that Saudi Arabia was in talks to price some crude it sells to China in yuan.
Russia has been gradually reducing its dollar holdings since the imposition of Western sanctions following Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In 2021 it said it would ditch all U.S. dollar assets in its National Wealth Fund and increase holdings in euros, Chinese yuan and gold.
Russia’s Treasury holdings fell to negligible levels in mid-2018, and are down from around $150 billion a decade ago, according to Treasury International Capital (TIC) data.
Other countries have also been reducing their bond holdings.
China held $1.1 trillion in Treasures in January, making it the second largest foreign owner after Japan, down from around $1.3 trillion in 2013. China has been buying a smaller share of U.S. debt held by the public, which has increased to $23 trillion from around $12 trillion over this time period.
Saudi Arabia held $119 billion in Treasuries as of January 2022, down from $185 billion in February 2020.
Demand for bonds by oil producers in the mid-2000s was seen as key to keeping down yields even as the Fed undertook a two-year hiking cycle.
This time around, oil producers are less likely to step in, even as they profit from soaring oil prices, said Thomas Mathews, a market economist at Capital Economics.
“The sanctions on Russia will be a bit alarming for many of the major oil exporters that hold large amounts of Treasuries (and US assets in general) and might hasten some diversification plans. That could mean that some of the support for Treasuries from foreign savings, such as we saw in the mid-2000s, could be absent during this tightening cycle,” Mathews said.
That said, even if these countries continue to reduce their purchases of Treasuries, they are not expected to launch large sales of the bonds. There also may be limits to how far countries can reduce their holdings because there are few alternatives in terms of safety and liquidity.

If yields continue to march higher, bonds may draw in alternative buyers.
“As rates go higher and the prospects of economic slowdown continue to mount there will be a diversification out of risk assets and into Treasuries, such that maybe yields actually kind of steady themselves,” said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies. “I think it’s more of a risk for risk assets in this environment than it is actually for Treasuries.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - For the past few years, Lee Adler kept track of the U.S. real estate market, and things just kept going up - and up.
So it seemed an optimal time to sell his stateside home after Adler moved abroad to Nice, France, shortly before the pandemic began. His single family house in West Palm Beach, Florida sold within a month. 
""I felt that I was in the driver's seat,"" says Adler, 71, who publishes websites like Liquidity Trader and the Wall Street Examiner. ""I got a cash offer with no contingencies at my asking price. The selling price was 40% higher than I could have gotten a year ago."" 
The sizzling housing market may not be great news for buyers, but it is terrific for sellers. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index recently reported national home-price gains of 18.8% for 2021, far outpacing even red-hot inflation numbers.
For owners who have been hemming and hawing about whether to sell, it might be time to strike. In fact, the Realtor.com website has a very specific suggestion about when to list: The week of April 10-16.
The current mix of eager buyers, scant listings, healthy prices and mortgage rates that are still relatively low (historically speaking) means a lot of factors are tipping the scales in sellers' favor.
""Mid-April will put sellers in the market just ahead of a big surge in listings in May,"" says Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. ""That way they will be able to capitalize on a large buyer audience who haven't been satisfied with the homes available for sale.""
Looking ahead, there are many reasons to believe the current market will cool off. Higher interest rates affect housing affordability. Average monthly mortgage payments are already much higher than they were just a couple of months ago, says Hale.
If regular buyers cannot afford as much per home, investors – who comprised a record 18.4% of the market in 2021's 4th quarter, according to real estate brokerage  Redfin  (NASDAQ:RDFN) – likely will not be quite as interested either. Current projections for 2022 home-price growth are a more modest 2.9%, says Hale.
""This year buyers came out early to get ahead of rising mortgage rates, so now is an excellent time to sell,"" says Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist.
Some thoughts about striking the right deal:
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SPRING RUSH
Spring is the busiest season for buyers and sellers: Parents do not like to move families after the school year gets underway in the fall, and many people – especially in colder climates – are not fans of moving in winter.
""Get started right away, because there are probably improvements you want to make to make sure your home is in its best light,"" advises Hale.
PRICE IT RIGHT
Your eyes may be big with dollar signs right now, given the huge real estate market gains of recent years. But if a home price is too high for the market, and it sits around for a while, then it becomes stale. Thus the ongoing rise in interest rates could come back to bite you.
A better strategy is to ""err on the side of caution and underprice it, because well-priced homes are getting multiple offers right now,"" Fairweather says. ""But if mortgage rates move higher next week, there is a real risk if you are overpriced and the market turns.""
USE YOUR LEVERAGE
All real estate is local, as the adage goes. If you are in an area where demand is high and inventory is low, that works in your favor when it comes to setting the deal's terms and conditions.
Around 15% of deals right now have waived contingencies for issues like inspections or financing, says Fairweather – a much higher level than before the pandemic. Deals are also closing quickly, about 17 days faster than the same period last year, says Hale.
THINK ABOUT NEXT STEPS
Even if you sell at a great price, the reality is you are still going to have to live somewhere. And rents have been rising sharply too, right along with housing prices.

As a result, a big move makes the most sense for those who are doing some real estate arbitrage: Perhaps an empty nester who is downsizing, or someone taking advantage of the work-from-home trend to lower the cost of living.
""The real winners in this housing market are those who are selling in an expensive area, and moving into more affordable homes,"" Fairweather says.

""The restrictions have been in place for roughly a month, a little bit over a month, and we certainly haven't seen any indication that there's non-compliance, in fact we've seen the reverse,"" Matthew Borman, U.S. Commerce Department Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration, told a teleconference when asked about Asia's response.
""I think there's also a fair amount of additional self-sanctioning, if you will, by multinational companies operating in Russia,"" he added. 
Major players know there is a significant risk to their business if they don't comply because of actions the United States could take, including fines or criminal penalties, Borman said.
""We know that Russia is quite dependent upon foreign supplies for some key inputs like semiconductors so I think it will be relatively readily apparent if there is non-compliance and the task will be to trace that back to its origin.""
In Asia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan have joined in the Western-led sanctions effort. 
China, the world's second-largest economy and a close friend of Russia's, has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions, calling them ineffective and insisting it will maintain normal economic and trade exchanges with the country.
Borman said the United States had held talks with Chinese government officials to explain the ""scope of the controls"" on Russia, and could take enforcement actions on any Chinese firms found to have breached the U.S. bans.
The United States has warned of significant consequences if Beijing offers material support to Russia for its war in Ukraine, or provides an economic lifeline to Moscow in the face of the sanctions.

U.S. President Joe Biden, who spoke with China's leader Xi Jinping earlier this month, has said that China understands its economic future is more closely tied to the West than to Russia.
""We're always willing to work with any government in Asia to explain in more detail our actions,"" Borman said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Tuesday ordered his cabinet to put together a fresh relief package by the end of April to cushion the economic blow from rising fuel and raw material prices.
The package will likely consist of an extension of a gasoline subsidy for oil distributors, as well as other steps to ease the pressure on companies and households hit by soaring raw material costs.
""We need to prevent rising fuel, raw material and food prices from inflicting a huge impact on people's livelihood and economic activity,"" Kishida told his cabinet ministers, underlining the policy dilemma facing Japan and the rest of the world as the Ukraine crisis fans global inflationary pressures.
For the time being, the government will tap special reserves set aside under the fiscal 2022 budget to fund the spending measures, Kishida said.
The 5.5-trillion yen ($44.4 billion) in special reserves is mainly set aside for emergency spending to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Kishida is under pressure, including from his party's ruling coalition partner Komeito, to compile an extra budget, instead of relying solely on the reserves, to inflate the size of spending for the relief package.
""The prime minister's order was to come up with ways to support not just companies but households,"" economy minister Daishiro Yamagiwa told reporters.
Rising fuel and raw material prices have put additional strain on Japan's economy, which has lagged other countries in making a sustained recovery from the impact of the pandemic. Resources-poor Japan is dependent on imports for its energy needs.
The fresh relief package could come in at 3 to 5 trillion yen, as policymakers were likely to argue that smaller spending would not have a substantial impact on the economy, said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
""People who received cash handouts still have money left unspent. Economic conditions would likely improve as long as the coronavirus is ended - regardless of whether there will be extra economic measures or not,"" Takeda said.

Political pressure for big fiscal spending is expected to heighten ahead of an upper house election in the summer, which Kishida must win to solidify his grip on power within his ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan policymakers stressed the need to keep monetary policy ultra-loose, even as some of them saw signs of growing inflationary pressure from the Ukraine crisis, a summary of opinions at their March meeting showed on Tuesday.
Japan's consumer inflation will clearly accelerate from April and may hover around 2% for some time due mainly to the boost from energy price rises, one member was quoted as saying.
""As wholesale prices rise at historical levels, upward pressure is gradually heightening for consumer inflation,"" another member said.
Other members, however, warned such cost-push inflation will prove short-lived due to weak domestic demand, the summary showed.
""Consumer inflation may move around 2% in the first half of fiscal 2022 due to rising raw material costs. But it could undershoot expectations in the latter half of the year if commodity prices turn down,"" one member said.
Most of the opinions called on the need for the BOJ to stick to ultra-loose monetary policy as the war in Ukraine heightened uncertainty over the global outlook.
""Unlike the United States or Britain, Japan isn't in a situation where inflation continuously exceeds 2%...It's therefore important to support the economy's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic by maintaining monetary easing,"" one member said.

At the March meeting, the BOJ maintained its massive stimulus and warned of heightening risks to a fragile economic recovery from the Ukraine crisis.
Japan's core consumer inflation hit 0.6% in February, well below the BOJ's 2% target, as weak consumer spending discourage firms from raising prices. But analysts expect inflation to approach 2% from April, due to soaring fuel costs and the dissipating effect of past cellphone fee cuts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate on Monday again approved a bill to provide $52 billion in U.S. subsidies for semiconductor chips manufacturing in a bid to reach a compromise after months of discussions.
The 68-28 procedural vote sends the legislation back to the House of Representatives in a cumbersome process to ultimately launch a formal process known as a ""conference"" where lawmakers from both chambers will seek agreement on a compromise version. 
A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some firms to scale back production, and there have been growing calls to decrease reliance on other countries for semiconductors.
The Senate first passed chips legislation in June that also authorized $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research to compete with China, while the House passed its version in early February.
The bills take different approaches to addressing U.S. competitiveness with China on a wide range of issues, as well on trade and some climate provisions.
Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said the vote was crucial to ""get us to real negotiations""
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the Senate vote was another step ""to strengthen our supply chains, make more in America, and outcompete China and the rest of the world for decades to come. We look forward to the House of Representatives moving quickly to start the formal conference process as well.""
A senior House Democratic aide said the chamber is set to take up the measure and send it back to the Senate as soon as later this week. The Senate will need to vote again to launch the conference. A final agreement might not be reached until summer.
Independent Senator Bernie Sanders criticized the $52 billion in subsidies, calling it ""corporate greed"" and said taxpayers should get warrants or equity from profitable chips firms in exchange for subsidies.
""The financial gains made by these companies must be shared with the American people, not just wealthy shareholders,"" Sanders said.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo noted that two decades ago, the United States produced nearly 40% of all chips while today it accounts for only 12% of global production. The Senate vote moved the United States ""one step closer toward revitalizing American semiconductor manufacturing, securing our critical supply chains and bringing home good-quality manufacturing jobs.""
On Friday, General Motors (NYSE:GM) said it would halt production at a pickup truck plant in Indiana for two weeks in April because of the chips shortage.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Treasury on Monday proposed a new mechanism to comply with and enforce a 15% global corporate minimum tax agreed to last year by 136 countries, partly by denying deductions for taxes paid in jurisdictions with lower rates.
The new Undertaxed Profits Rule proposed as part of President Joe Biden's fiscal 2023 budget plan would replace the current U.S. Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) with a new system that would act as a ""top-up tax"" to ensure that multinational corporations pay an effective tax rate of at least 15%, the Treasury said in budget documents released on Monday.
The global minimum tax deal negotiated through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is aimed at ending a downward competitive spiral of corporate rates and an erosion of government revenues while denying advantages to tax-haven countries.
A key feature of Treasury's proposed rule is that it would generate additional revenue by denying deductions to companies to the extent that they are paying a tax rate below 15%, a U.S. Treasury official told Reuters.
In the event that U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies use U.S. deductions and credits to lower their effective tax rates below 15%, the proposal includes a domestic tax to capture the difference in the United States, rather than cede it to foreign countries, matching mechanisms imposed by other countries. 
The official said Treasury was ready to work with Congress on enabling legislation to ensure that the benefits of U.S. tax credits and other incentives for American corporations are preserved.
The new plan, which applies to companies with global revenues over $850 million conforms to so-called ""model rules"" for the global minimum tax agreed to last December.
The proposal is the latest in a series of tax changes floated by the Treasury over the past year to negotiate and implement the sweeping global tax deal, which also includes a separate ""pillar"" that seeks to reallocate international taxing rights on large tech companies and other highly profitable multinationals.
The Biden administration had sought to include tax changes to implement the global minimum tax into a sweeping social and climate investment bill, but that legislation stalled in Congress at the end of 2021.
Biden's budget seeks to raise the U.S. corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and boost the current U.S. overseas minimum rate to 20% from 10.5%, along with higher taxes on wealthy individuals 
The legislative path forward to meet a 2023 deadline to implement the minimum tax is unclear.

By including the new plan in the Treasury ""green book"" of budget revenue proposals, the Biden administration is showing that it is ""still very, very committed to a global consensus on a global minimum tax,"" said Manal Corwin, head of KPMG's Washington national tax practice and a former U.S. Treasury tax official.
""From a messaging perspective it's important, because you see the Treasury at least building into their budget that they're following the global architecture,"" Corwin said.

LONDON (Reuters) - More than 7,000 finance jobs have moved from London to the European Union as a result of Brexit, down 400 from the total anticipated in December, consultants EY said on Tuesday.
While the total is well down on the 12,500 job moves forecast by firms in 2016, when Britain voted to leave the bloc, more could follow, EY said in its latest Brexit Tracker.
EY said that new local hires linked to Brexit total 2,900 across Europe, and 2,500 in Britain, where just over a million people work in the financial services sector.
Further relocations could result from European Central Bank checks on whether Brexit hubs in the EU opened by banks which used London as their European base have sufficient staff to justify their new licences, EY said.
The Bank of England is scrutinising these to avoid banks in London being left with too few senior staff.
""Staff and operational moves across European financial markets will continue as firms navigate ongoing geo-political uncertainty, post-pandemic dynamics and regulatory requirements,"" Omar Ali, EMEIA financial services leader at EY, said in a statement.
Dublin is the most popular destination for staff relocations and new hubs, followed by Luxembourg, Frankfurt and Paris.
EY said Paris scored highest in terms of attracting jobs from London, totalling 2,800, followed by Frankfurt at around 1,800, and Dublin with 1,200.
The transfer of assets from London to EU hubs remains around 1.3 trillion pounds ($1.7 trillion), EY said, adding that Brexit staff moves are by now part of a broader view of strategic business drivers and operating models.

Bankers have said privately that in the longer term, it may not make commercial sense to have big hubs in London and the EU.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Department budget released on Monday calls for an initial $100 million for a $12.3-billion project that aims to build a new railway tunnel between New York City and New Jersey and reconstruct an existing one.
The Biden administration is also calling for increasing U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak's funding on top of the $22 billion approved under the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill.
The administration wants $3 billion in annual funding for Amtrak for the 2023 budget year, up from $2.33 billion in prior annual funding.
Amtrak, which would get $7.4 billion in total for 2023 including the infrastructure bill funding, wants to expand dramatically across the United States and add up to 39 corridor routes and up to 166 cities by 2035.
The $100 million would mark the first-time federal support for the Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Tunnel project. The Biden administration is also proposing $400 million for the $6.9 billion Second Avenue Subway extension.
""Public transit creates jobs, reduces traffic and pollution, and lowers the cost of living for people in the community,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.
The Hudson tunnel project has been the subject of a decade-long debate in Washington since a more than century-old New York City-area rail tunnel was damaged in 2012 when a massive storm flooded parts of the city.
The tunnel project is one of a series of improvements known as ""Gateway"" to the New York City-area part of the northeast rail corridor, which runs from Washington, D.C., through New York to Boston.

The Hudson River tunnel project would double the number of tracks in the tunnel from two to four and permit closing the existing tunnels one at a time for critical repairs.
Former Republican President Donald Trump sparred with Democrats over the Hudson River tunnel project and he did not agree to fund it.

ASUNCION (Reuters) - Paraguay will end 2022 with inflation close to 6%, the country's central bank head told Reuters on Monday, right at the ceiling of the entity's tolerance range as it battles fast-rising prices propelled by global supply crunches of grains and energy.
The South American country's central bank president, José Cantero, added in an interview that the benchmark interest rate should end the year at a similar level to the current 6.25%.
The country has experienced a sharp rise in consumer prices, due to the global rise in fuel and food prices, sharpened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Year-on-year inflation in February was 9.3%, the highest in the last 11 years.
""We are seeing that levels are going to tend towards 6% by the end of the year and the expectation is that by the middle of next year will converge towards the 4% target,"" said Cantero.
Cantero said that in April the bank would revise downward its projection of economic growth for this year of 3.7% and would also revise downward last year's official figure of 5%, due to the impact of drought on agricultural production in the world's fourth-largest exporter of soybeans.
""Given the drought that has an impact on the 2021/2022 campaign, we are expecting that 2021 growth to be less than 5% and at the same time the projection we had made for 2022 ... the revision is going to be downward,"" he said.
Fast-rising prices in Paraguay have forced the country's central bank, like others in the region, into a series of interest rate hikes. The benchmark rate has risen a total of 550 basis points in the last eight monetary policy meetings.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) plans to establish ""dedicated units"" within its enforcement and supervision divisions to better detect repeat corporate offenders, the watchdog's director said on Monday.
In his first speech on enforcement policy since becoming CFPB director in October, Rohit Chopra said regulators have failed to hold large institutions and their executives to the same standards as their smaller counterparts.
The bureau is looking at ""structural remedies"" to hold big companies more accountable for repeated misconduct, such as limiting a company's leverage, revoking government-granted privileges and banning certain business practices, he said at a University of Pennsylvania law school event. 
Democrats have long argued that regulators lean too heavily on fines to punish corporate misconduct which large companies typically treat as a cost of doing business, a view Chopra echoed on Monday.
""While headline-driven penalties give the guise of deterrence, they do not work for dominant, powerful firms,"" Chopra said. 
Critics have also argued that while regulators are willing to crack down hard on small companies, sometimes shutting them down entirely, they have been reluctant to take on major corporations and their droves of highly-paid attorneys.
Tackling corporate recidivism has emerged as a key priority of President Joe Biden's administration, with the Justice Department last year rolling out a series of policy changes aimed at better deterring repeat misconduct.
Republicans have slammed the CFPB under the Biden administration and Chopra's leadership. Last year, Republican Senator Pat Toomey said the bureau has ""disregarded its jurisdictional limits"" and ""returned to regulating by enforcement actions rather than rules.""

Chopra added that the CFPB will boost collaboration with state licensing officials so that states can better ascertain whether a company's business licenses should be suspended or whether assets should be liquidated.
""Regulators in the U.S. have a history of being able to terminate charters and licenses,"" Chopra said. ""Today, this should be considered for all institutions when the facts and circumstances warrant it, not just when it happens to a small firm.""

On its economic outlook for emerging markets for the next quarter, S&P Global said its base assumption was that ""the conflict will have the most acute impact on commodity markets, supply chains, and investor and consumer confidence in the first and second quarters of 2022.""
The effects would lessening but linger in the rest of the year and beyond, it said.
S&P said countries in emerging Europe were the most exposed through trade, financing, and confidence channels, while many energy importers were also hit by the spike in prices.
S&P cut Poland's growth estimate by 1.4 percentage points to 3.6%, Turkey by 1.3 percentage points to 2.4% and South Africa by 0.5 percentage points to 1.9%. Russia's was cut to an 8.5% contraction was from a prior view of a 2.7% expansion.
""A combination of financial, trade, and technology sanctions has never been imposed on a large, globally integrated economy before, so we have little to go on to predict just how great the impact will be,"" S&P said in a report.
On Poland, S&P said that even if exports to Russia had shrunk to 3% of the total, down from more than 5% before Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, manufacturing would suffer from supply disruptions and weaker demand from Europe.
It raised the inflation forecast for Poland to 8.9% in 2022 from 5.4% previously, and now see the reference rate reaching 5% by the end of this year and 5.5% by end-2023.
The downgrade to Turkey stems from dimming trade prospects and already slowing retail sales.
""Rising food and energy prices and the weaker currency will worsen an already dire inflation outlook,"" S&P said, having estimated inflation at 55% this year.

Rising inflation risks pushed S&P to raise its forecast on the South African Reserve Bank key rate to 5% by year-end. 
""Terms of trade have improved thanks to higher metal prices, although rising oil prices offset some of the gains, and we expect this improvement to support the South African rand in an environment of Fed tightening and market volatility,"" S&P said.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg foreshadowed budget estimates showing the jobless rate falling in the third quarter to 3.75%, the lowest level since the early 1970s, and staying at “historically low levels” over the forecast horizon. He predicted wages growth would respond to the tight labor market by climbing at the fastest pace in a decade, after having ended last year at a tepid 2.3%.
The budget will be a key springboard for the government, which trails the opposition Labor party in opinion polls ahead of an election due by May 21, as it bids for a fourth term in office. It needs to soothe concerns of households and firms without dropping too much extra cash into an economy that’s already showing signs of running hot. 
“Treasurer Frydenberg has a tricky balancing act between politics and economics,” said Su-Lin Ong, head of Australian economic and fixed-income strategy at Royal Bank of Canada. “Key in the upcoming election is economic management and the 2022/23 budget will be another test on that front.”
Multiple newspaper leaks and early pre-budget announcements by the government suggest electoral sweeteners including: 
Economists including Ong caution against too much spending in the near-term given the economy is strong, the labor market is near-full employment, inflation is quickening and the central bank still has a dovish bent. 
 
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe has reiterated his patient policy stance, signaling he doesn’t intend to raise interest rates from a record-low 0.1% until inflation is “sustainably” within its 2-3% target. The RBA holds it monthly meeting a week from today.
The government’s budget deficit is expected to narrow in the coming fiscal year as stronger growth spurs hiring, which combined with soaring commodity prices will delivering additional revenue to the fiscal coffers.
Frydenberg has said he plans to use the windfall to drive down debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, while still offering assistance to households battling rising costs. 
“With more people in work and less people on welfare the budget bottom line is improving after providing unprecedented economic support to Australians,” he said. “But there is more to do and now is not the time to risk the gains.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Monday proposed imposing a minimum tax on the nation's richest people to challenge the ""indefensibly low tax rates"" the wealthy can engineer as Democrats take another swing at a so-called billionaire's tax.
In his fiscal 2023 budget proposal, U.S. President Joe Biden proposed a minimum 20% income tax on all households worth over $100 million, which would include unrealized gains on investments that have not yet been sold.
The proposal is an effort to tackle what the White House described as a ""glaring"" problem: that the current tax code's preferential tax rates for investments allow the nation's wealthiest to have a lower tax rate than middle-class Americans. 
The administration said the proposal would apply to the wealthiest 0.01% of U.S. households, with billionaires accounting for over half of the $360 billion it is projected to raise in revenue over the next decade.
The Biden budget is a wish list as final taxing and spending decisions ultimately fall to Congress where Democrats control the House and the Senate with just razor-thin margins, making it tough for the party to push through major pieces of legislation. 
Changes to the tax code are likely to be hotly debated, and previous attempts to impose major tax reforms have faltered amid Democratic divisions.

The White House proposal is similar to one unveiled by Senator Ron Wyden, who heads the tax writing Finance Committee, in October as part of Democrats' efforts to craft a sweeping social and climate-changing spending package. 
That plan similarly would have imposed a minimum tax on unsold, tradeable assets like stocks, but never came to fruition as the broader package faltered amid Democratic disagreement.

With the Russia-Ukraine conflict pushing up already high energy prices and putting British inflation on course to reach almost 9%, Sunak told lawmakers that his overall policy plan, including measures taken last year to help people on welfare benefits, were ""highly progressive"".
He also said borrowing more, on top of his huge spending to shield the British economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, would risk fuelling the inflation hit felt most by the lowest earners.
""I am comfortable that the choices I have made are the right ones for the country,"" he said.
Sunak rejected suggestions he should have targeted his latest tax cuts only at people on welfare. 
He said he would wait to see whether further support for households facing surging energy costs would be needed in October, when power bills are due for a twice-yearly reset.
In February, he announced a 9-billion-pound ($11.8 billion)package to spread some of the electricity and gas price pain. 
""Let's wait until we get there and then decide on the most appropriate course of action,"" Sunak said.
A recent fall in prices in energy markets would mean a lessening of the projected hit to household incomes this year if those lower prices continued in the coming months, he said.
Underscoring his limits for easing the cost-of-living crisis, Sunak said the headroom built into his tax and spending plans could easily be undone by weaker-than-expected growth or higher interest rates. 
""If you took the Bank of England's economic outlook as opposed to the OBR's (Office for Budget Responsibility), an equally credible institution, that would wipe out over half of it,"" Sunak told lawmakers.
A 1% increase in BoE interest rates or a 1% change in the tax-to-gross domestic product ratio would eliminate the headroom entirely, Sunak said. 
In a half-yearly budget update last week, he announced an immediate fuel duty cut and a softening of April's increase in social security contributions, as well as an income tax cut for 2024.

But his plans were widely criticised for not doing enough to help households on the lowest incomes.

ROME (Reuters) - Rome expects to return Monte dei Paschi di Siena into private hands only after the bailed-out lender completes restructuring steps it is currently discussing with European Union authorities, Italy's economy minister said on Monday.
Under new CEO Luigi Lovaglio, Monte dei Paschi (MPS) is revising a 2022-2026 strategic plan readied by previous management which needs approval by European authorities.
Economy Minister Daniele Franco told a parliamentary hearing the bank would know once the plan is ready how much money it needs to raise. For now the 2.5 billion euro capital raising envisaged by the existing plan appears adequate, he added.
A veteran UniCredit executive, Lovaglio is set to ready his strategy for MPS in June and complete the capital raising in October, based on an internal MPS document seen by Reuters.
The turnaround will then prepare the bank to be sold, Franco said, after Rome last year failed to clinch a deal with UniCredit.
""It is reasonable to expect that only after the capital increase and the restructuring steps envisaged in the new business plan, the best conditions will be there for the privatisation,"" Franco told lawmakers.
Italy is negotiating with European Union authorities a years-long extension of an end-2021 privatisation deadline for MPS, which Rome failed to meet because UniCredit in October walked away from a possible acquisition of the bailed-out rival.
""We think the Commission has no choice but to grant a reasonable extension ... we did try to sell the bank,"" Franco said.
Franco said the new plan would build on the existing one and take into account the latest developments. MPS has warned the Ukraine crisis could affect its cash needs.
While direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is very low, MPS could suffer due to the impact of the conflict on the Italian economy, which the government expects to grow by around 3% this year from previous 4.7% target set last autumn.
""We'll see what the number will be. For now, I think 2.5 billion euros can be considered as adequate,"" Franco said.

570,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 12:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden’s budget release on Monday is shaping up as a direct appeal to moderate Democrats, emphasizing deficit reduction and flexibility on social spending as the White House hopes to win support for new legislation before November’s midterm elections.
The request will show a $1 trillion reduction in deficit spending over the coming decade, generated in part by a new tax targeting the income and unrealized capital gains of billionaires. Federal spending will decline $1.3 trillion from last year alone, as pandemic assistance programs and emergency financing offered to state and local governments are eliminated.
The budget also sidesteps the particulars of Biden’s ambitious climate and social safety net proposals, in an explicit bid not to alienate lawmakers negotiating a pared-down version of the president’s Build Back Better agenda. National security spending -- which remains politically popular among moderate lawmakers - will top $813 billion, representing a 4% increase from spending approved for the current fiscal year.
The proposal will be vetted for how it incorporates the biggest consumer-price surge in four decades, and what Biden proposes spending on his so-called “Unity Agenda.” That package, unveiled in the State of the Union address and designed to garner support from both sides of the aisle, would see billions of dollars for veterans, mental health, cancer research and fighting the opioid epidemic.
Yet as a whole, the budget appears designed to win over the moderate Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia - who said in December he couldn’t support Build Back Better - and Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who have been impediments to Biden’s legislative aspirations.
Democrats are looking to jump-start work on the annual 2023 appropriations bills in the coming weeks to try to complete them before the midterm elections, which could result one or both chambers of Congress falling into Republican hands. 
“The window is closing on domestic policy making, as little new action is likely once we get to August of this election year,” Tobin Marcus, senior U.S. policy strategist at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note last week.
The budget’s goals include fiscal responsibility, one of the largest investments in national security in U.S. history and measures to increase spending on policing, according to a White House official.
Biden is seeking $32 billion in public safety spending, including for beat officers, crime prevention and research on gun violence, an official told Bloomberg News. 
The following are some key areas to look for in the lengthy -- last year’s was more than 1,700 pages -- release:
Economic Assumptions
The White House will likely try to walk a line between baking high inflation into projections for coming years -- risking an appearance of walking away from efforts to contain the escalating cost of living -- and lowballing its consumer-price assumptions, inviting criticism that the administration is ignoring reality.
The Office of Management and Budget may seek to sidestep the issue, saying the economic assumptions were completed before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine heightened prices for energy and agricultural products even further.
Nevertheless, using a particularly low inflation rate as the basis for spending requests could prompt tough questions from lawmakers about whether the administration is asking departments and agencies to swallow an effective cut in resources.
Forecasts for deficit reduction could help Biden win backing from Manchin -- if they’re viewed as credible.
Build Back Better
The president’s budget isn’t expected to specify the costs or revenues of the changes the White House has pursued as part of Build Back Better. That’s a gambit by White House staff not to disrupt ongoing congressional negotiations.
Instead, Biden will offer only a broad endorsement of the climate, social safety net and tax-code changes he’s long championed, while the budget tables themselves will feature only a placeholder. That means overall calculations won’t include the prices of proposals such as universal free pre-kindergarten, an expanded Child Tax Credit, and funding to combat climate change - or the deficit savings from policies such as prescription-drug reforms or tax increases on corporations and wealthy Americans.
The hope among White House officials is that doing so demonstrates Biden’s commitment to his agenda without alienating Manchin, who has said publicly he wants to start fresh on a pared-down version of Build Back Better. 
Keeping the fiscal impact of the agenda out of the budget tables, however, could bolster Republicans arguments that the budget doesn’t present an accurate accounting of Biden’s proposals.
Tax Policy
Lawmakers and lobbyists alike will be watching to see how closely Biden’s tax ideas adhere to his plans from last year, when he proposed a raft of hikes on corporations and wealthy Americans totaling $3.6 trillion over a decade.
While some of the tax changes Biden designated to pay for Build Back Better won’t be included, the president will roll out a new plan for a minimum 20% tax rate that would hit both the income and unrealized capital gains of American households worth more than $100 million.
The addition of this plan to Biden’s tax proposal addresses a key critique from progressive lawmakers that the code does little to tax the richest Americans, who can often use a complicated system of credits and deductions to avoid paying taxes all together.
But it’s still not clear if the idea will carry water with Manchin, who has called the proposal convoluted, or Sinema, whose opposition to bolster income tax rates left Democrats to craft a series of sometimes complicated measures, including a 15% minimum tax on corporate profits, higher levies on foreign business income and an increased emphasis on audits to capture more revenue.
Unity Agenda
The president has asked lawmakers to fund his so-called Unity Agenda -- items he’s argued should have support across political divides. That includes money to battle the opioid crisis -- a focus of former President Donald Trump -- and expanding the mental health workforce, in part to aid Americans destabilized by the pandemic, particularly children.
Biden has also called for significant new spending for veterans’ health, particularly to help those who developed respiratory cancer after exposure to burn pits. And he hopes to secure additional funding for his so-called Cancer Moonshot, including billions in research grants for an advanced experimental health research agency.
What’s Missing
Budget readers will also be looking for what the plan omits -- including, potentially, money for Ukraine. The White House began finalizing the budget before Russia’s invasion and the $13.6 billion in humanitarian and military aid approved by Congress earlier this month. The White House may be wary of cementing continuing expenses, given the years-long history of outlays for U.S. engagement in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The White House is also expected to sidestep funding for emergency pandemic assistance that would pay for testing, vaccines and treatments as the pandemic continues. It’s separately pursuing a $22.5 billion package to cover spending into the summer.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked a flurry of Western sanctions on Moscow, at least one oligarch and thousands of other Russians have arrived in Turkey, seen as a safe place to stay, invest and hold assets despite its NATO membership. 
Acting as a safe haven raises risks for Turkey's government, banks and businesses that could face tough decisions and penalties if the United States and others ramp up pressure on Moscow with broader ""secondary"" sanctions. 
Here is what is at stake: 
WHY IS TURKEY ATTRACTIVE TO RUSSIANS?
Turkey has said Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine is unacceptable but opposes the sanctions on principle and is not enforcing them. 
Turkey's economy, already battered by a currency crisis and soaring inflation, relies heavily on Russian oil, gas, trade and tourism. 
Some 14,000 Russians have reportedly arrived in Turkey since the war began on Feb. 24, many carrying wads of cash due to blocks on their U.S. credit cards and challenges in doing basic banking. Realtors say many are using cash and converted crypto currencies to buy property as a safe investment. 
Roman Abramovich, one of several Russian oligarchs blacklisted by the West, has also visited Turkey and two of his superyachts worth a combined $1.2 billion docked at Turkish resorts last week. Oligarchs could invest more, sources familiar with private talks have told Reuters. 
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Saturday Russian oligarchs and citizens were ""of course"" welcome and could do business in Turkey according to international law. 
CAN THE SAFE HAVEN LAST?
Western governments have already seized some oligarchs' assets, have frozen Russia's reserves and ousted it from the SWIFT banking system, and they could press Ankara to tighten loop holes. Analysts say they could impose secondary sanctions on those doing business with the main target, Russia.
""If the humanitarian tragedy persists and Putin has no intention of backing down, I think secondary sanctions are inevitable,"" said Hakan Akbas, founding partner of Istanbul-based Strategic Advisory Services, which deals with sanctions.
""The West will pay more attention to any potential loop-hole countries so they don't become safe havens,"" he said. ""Ankara's hands would be tied... and it would inevitably have to take a tougher stance against Russia."" 
This could send a chill through Turkish banks and companies dealing with Russian clients or doing business abroad. In 2020, the U.S. Treasury applied secondary sanctions on Turkey's Defence Industry Directorate, its chief and others over Ankara's purchase of Russian S-400 missiles.
Yet given Turkey's efforts to mediate between Moscow and Kyiv, it could avoid the sanctions crossfire. Another round of peace talks is due to take place in Istanbul this week.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has welcomed Ankara's diplomatic role, while adding ""we would very much like Turkey to implement all the sanctions"".
HOW ARE BANKS AND COMPANIES PREPARING?
Faced with a flood of new Russian customers, Turkish banks have resisted some deposit and transfer requests and ramped up compliance checks for fear of contravening sanctions. 
This has frustrated some Russians. But it reflects caution across the sector that seeks to avoid a repetition of the years-long U.S. prosecution of Turkish state lender Halkbank, which is accused of having helped Iran evade U.S. sanctions.
The BDDK bank regulator said it has given no instruction to limit citizens of any country. But a senior banking source said the sanctions were nonetheless ""perceived as a new risk"" and firms had met several times to discuss it since the war began. 
Akbas said big Turkish companies and conglomerates have more than $10 billion in assets in Russia, and Moscow is now pressing them to continue operations and pay workers or risk bankruptcy. 
Many of them do far more business in the West and may have to make a ""binary decision"" whether to leave Russia as several big U.S. and European brands have done, he said.

Any sanctions fallout could further bruise Turkey's reputation among foreign investors after years of unorthodox monetary policy and outflows. 
That reputation took another hit last year when an international watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force, downgraded Turkey to a so-called grey list for failing to head off money laundering and terrorist financing.

In 2016, Mozambique unveiled hefty state-backed borrowing it had previously failed to disclose, in a $2-billion corruption scandal that prompted donors to cut off aid and sparked a currency collapse and debt crisis. 
A statement from the Fund said final approval for the three-year Extended Credit Facility was expected to come from IMF management ""in the coming weeks"".
""In recent years the Mozambican economy has been hit by a series of severe shocks that risk intensifying vulnerabilities and worsening socioeconomic conditions,"" the IMF said in a statement.

It said the government's medium-term programme focused on economic growth, fiscal sustainability, and reforms in public financial management and governance.
One of the world's most impoverished countries, Mozambique is still grappling with its hefty debt burden, as well as an Islamist insurgency and the impact of COVID-19, which led to its first economic contraction in three decades last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House on Monday said it is proposing $15 billion over 10 years in election assistance to states and to support vote-by-mail efforts.
The 2023 budget proposal calls for $10 billion in new assistance to states for election equipment and personnel and to ""increase access and security."" 
President Joe Biden is also proposing $5 billion to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to expand delivery capacity in underserved areas ""and support for vote-by-mail, including making ballots postage free and reducing the cost of other election-related mail.""
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, voting by mail jumped dramatically, with 46% of votes cast by mail in the November 2020 presidential election, up from 21% in the 2016 election, the USPS Inspector General said.
In the 2020 election, the Postal Service delivered more than 135 million ballots.
In August 2020, then President Donald Trump sparked a firestorm when he said without additional funding from Congress ""they can’t have universal mail-in voting, they just can’t have it.""
That prompted U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to say Trump’s comments about election mail were “incorrect"" and said USPS had adequate funding to handle mailed ballots.
In December, USPS and the NAACP reached a settlement to resolve a 2020 lawsuit over election mail that the Justice Department said would ensure prioritizing delivering ballots in future elections.

USPS agreed for the 2022 mid-term congressional election to take the same extraordinary measures used to deliver ballots in the November 2020 election. The Postal Service also agreed for elections through 2028 to post guidance documents publicly reflecting its ""good faith efforts to prioritize monitoring and timely delivery of Election Mail.""
Several courts ordered USPS to take extraordinary measures to ensure ballot deliveries, especially since a record number of Americans opted to vote by mail during the pandemic.

ISTANBUL/DUBAI (Reuters) - Wealthy Russians are pouring money into real estate in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, seeking a financial haven in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and Western sanctions, according to many property companies.
""We sell seven to eight units to Russians every day,"" said Gul Gul, co-founder of the Golden Sign real estate company in Istanbul. ""They buy in cash, they open bank accounts in Turkey or they bring gold.""
In Dubai, Thiago Caldas, CEO of the Modern Living property firm, has hired three Russian-speaking agents to meet Russian interest, which he says has leapt tenfold.
Sanctions imposed since the Feb. 24 invasion include Russia's exclusion from the SWIFT banking system, and the targeting of individual such as oligarchs deemed to be close to President Vladimir Putin. 
While Turkey and the UAE have criticised the Russian offensive, Ankara opposes non-U.N. sanctions on Russia and both countries have relatively good ties with Moscow and still operate direct flights, potentially offering routes out for Russians and their cash.
""They are wealthy Russians but not oligarchs,"" said Gul of Golden Sign, one of a dozen real estate companies interviewed by Reuters. ""They are finding ways to bring their money to Turkey.""
""There are customers buying three to five flats,"" Gul added. 
Russians have been big buyers of Turkish property for years, behind Iranians and Iraqis, yet the real estate players said there had been a spike in demand in recent weeks.
Though it's still early days, industry figures bolster their accounts; In February, as troops massed on Ukraine's border before advancing, Russians bought 509 houses in Turkey, nearly double the number they snapped up last year, according to the country's statistics office.
That data was still before Western sanctions took hold, and real estate agents said they expected the numbers to grow further, driving up demand already primed by the world's emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Ibrahim Babacan, whose company in Istanbul builds and sells real estate mainly for foreign buyers in Turkey, said in the past many Russians had wanted to live in resorts such as the Mediterranean Antalya region. Now they were buying apartments in Istanbul to invest their money.
Reuters contacted some Russian homebuyers but they declined to give interviews due to the sensitivity of the situation. 
THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS
Both Turkey and the United Arab Emirates offer residency incentives for property buyers. In Turkey foreigners who pay $250,000 for a property and keep it for three years can get a Turkish passport. For a slightly smaller sum Dubai, a major Middle East business hub, offers a three-year residency visa.
Apartments worth 750,000 dirhams ($205,000) - the threshold for visa entitlement - have seen the bulk of the demand but more expensive property on artificial islands such as Dubai's glitzy Palm Jumeirah have been bought for up to 6 million dirhams, according to the real estate professionals.
""Investors are looking for both capital protection and the opportunity to receive a residential visa in the UAE for temporary relocation,"" said Elena Milishenkova of real estate brokerage Tranio, based in Moscow and Berlin, which has a focus on Russian clients buying property overseas.
Her company received almost three times more requests for apartments in Dubai in the first three months of 2022 compared to the same period last year, she said.
Some companies say demand is even higher. 
""Right at the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, we launched a campaign in the region and the number of people who contacted us was ... at least 10 times higher than usual,"" said Caldas of Dubai's Modern Living.
The CEO, who hired the Russian-speaking agents last week, said the really wealthy buyers appeared to have been making their preparations and shifted funds out of Russia even before the war broke out a month ago. 
CASH AND CRYPTOCURRENCY
For Russians who have bank accounts in Dubai, the process is relatively simple, said Elena Timchenko of broker Royal Home Real Estate, which is based in the emirate. 
Others have turned to friends or contacts for help, but for some, the challenge of getting the money together for a purchase has so far been too much, she added.
""The wish to buy in Dubai is one thing, the ability to do so is another,"" she said, referring to the difficulties of bringing funds to the Gulf state.
Some newly arrived Russians in Turkey have struggled to make deposits and transfers at banks that are wary of contravening sanctions. Extra layers of compliance and exclusion from Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) add to the difficulty. 
The UAE issued guidelines to banks last year to tighten procedures identifying suspicious transactions in an attempt to stem illicit financial flows. That did not stop the country, like Turkey, being added to a list of countries monitored by the FATF global financial crime watchdog.
A senior executive at an Emirati bank said the bank was making the same checks on customers as before, and had received no new guidance from the central bank. 
In Istanbul, meanwhile, real estate builder and seller Babacan said that so far those Russian customers he dealt with were paying via banks without problems.

Caldas and Alex Cihanoglu, a realtor also based in Turkey's largest city, said some Russians were using cash converted from cryptocurrency, now that sanctions had made financial transfers more complex. 
""I would say most of the transactions that we're seeing are in crypto,"" Caldas added. ""Crypto, especially for this market now, in the difficulties they're facing, is the channel that is being used.""

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain announced 16 billion euros ($17.5 billion) in direct aid and soft loans on Monday to help companies and households weather sky-high energy prices that are pushing up inflation and stoking social discontent. 
The government will approve on Tuesday the package to mitigate the fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said at a corporate event. 
""The war response shock plan will protect industries and citizens,"" he said.
The three-month plan will come into force on April 1.
Truck drivers have been on strike for two weeks over fuel prices, causing sporadic goods shortages around the country.
Around 6 billion euros will come as direct aid and tax cuts mostly extended from a previous package related to the COVID-19 pandemic, while the remaining 10 billion euros are subsidized loans. There will also be limits on house rent increases and caps on energy prices.
It will initially be approved by decree as the government's fragile parliamentary majority makes approval in Congress difficult.
Highly exposed to external shocks, Spain was among the worst hit European countries by the pandemic and responded with a mammoth 140 billion euro economic rescue plan. Now faced with protest at home over energy prices, which soared 60% in a year to February and pushed inflation close to 8%, Madrid is taking new steps to protect its economy.
Sanchez on Friday broke off negotiations at the European Council until he secured an ""Iberian exception"" for Spain and Portugal that would allow them to cap gas prices.
The government is now thrashing out the details of its plan pending final European approval. 
The cap on gas prices, cold be set at 30 euros per megawatt/hour, according to a minister from Unidas Podemos, a junior partner in Spain's ruling coalition.
The government will also extend a fuel subsidy for truckers and transportation companies to all citizens.
According to the plan, the government will pay for 15 cents per litre, while petrol companies will cover at least further 5 cents. 
Rent increases will be capped at 2% for three months - an unprecedented measure - and employers will not be allowed to dismiss workers for economic reasons related to the invasion, but furlough schemes will be available. 
Borrowers that are intensive energy users will be given a 12-month grace period, when the companies will be required to pay interest, but not the principal on a loan.

Consumer associations have criticized the package as insufficient and some truckers remain on strike, albeit causing less disruption than last week.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union should, like national governments, have a proper budget it could use to stabilise the bloc's economy if needed, a European Commission survey of academics, think-tanks and other bodies and individuals has suggested.
The 27-nation EU currently has a budget that focuses mainly on equalising living standards and some common spending policies based on figures that are set every seven years after painstaking debate.
""A majority of respondents support the establishment of a central EU fiscal capacity, in particular for macroeconomic stabilisation,"" a Commission report on the consultation that was published on Monday said.
The idea, espoused by economists as a necessary counterbalance to the single monetary policy of the European Central Bank, has failed to gain EU government support in the past.
Member states have up to now resisted change because it would mean transferring more national sovereignty to the EU, tighter fiscal cooperation and, most probably, regular joint EU borrowing and new EU revenue streams to repay the joint debt.
The Commission said the new views came after it posted a consultation online last year, asking for opinions on the EU's fiscal framework. 
Out of 225 valid responses, more than one fifth came from private citizens, it said. Another fifth came from academia and another fifth from trade unions. Non-governmental organisations, independent fiscal institutions and think tanks were also big contributors, data showed.
Respondents want the rules to be more supportive of economic growth, social issues and fighting climate change, while keeping public debt sustainable, the Commission said.
The people and organisations said ""green"" investment should get special attention in the rules because of climate challenge, and a large number of them called for the simplification, transparency and stronger national ownership of the rules.
The public consultation is not binding in any way. It is part of a debate on changes to the EU's fiscal rules, which are now under review.
Most of the views came from Italy, with Belgium in second place and France and Germany not far behind, the Commission said. 
The Commission is to present its suggestions as to how to modify the rules, which limit government borrowing to safeguard the value of the euro, by June.

Last year, the EU agreed to unprecedented joint borrowing of 800 billion euros to rebuild its economy after the pandemic through investment that would digitalise it and help eventually cut CO2 emissions to zero.
But the joint debt was clearly marked as a one-off. It came on top of the 1.1 trillion euro regular budget set for all 27 countries for the next seven years, financed from government contributions and tax income already assigned to the EU.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a challenge by steel companies to former President Donald Trump's 2018 decision to double tariffs on steel imports from Turkey on national security grounds - a policy move defended by President Joe Biden's administration.
The justices turned away an appeal by steel importers - including Transpacific Steel LLC and the Jordan International Company as well as Turkish steel producer Borusan Mannesmann and its U.S. subsidiary - of a lower court's ruling against their challenge.
Trump increased what had been a 25 percent tariff to 50 percent, which the steel companies have argued exceeded his authority. They had sought repayment from the U.S. government of the $54 million they paid collectively in duties.
At issue is a president's authority under a federal law called the Trade Expansion Act. That law lets a president set tariffs for the purpose of protecting national security.
The challengers pointed to a provision of the law that establishes a window of 90 days for a president to impose a tariff after receiving a report from the U.S. commerce secretary. In 2018, such a report was submitted in January and Trump announced the initial 25 percent tariff in March, within the 90-day window. But, the challengers said, his decision to increase the tariff to 50 percent in August 2018 fell outside that window and was unlawful.
Trump lowered the tariff back to 25 percent in May 2019.

The Biden administration, which took over the case and defended Trump's actions, had argued that the later decision was legal because the law allows for a president to modify a tariffs decision outside the 90-day period.
The challengers sued in January 2019, leading the U.S. Court of International Trade to rule in their favor the following year. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the trade court's decision in 2021, prompting the companies to appeal to the Supreme Court.

LONDON (Reuters) -Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said swings in commodity markets after Russia's invasion of Ukraine posed a risk to financial stability and the challenges facing the world economy are bigger than after the global financial crisis.
Prices in gas, oil, metals and agricultural markets have soared and have become so volatile that companies have had to cut trading volumes due to strained liquidity.
Bailey pointed to the commodity markets as the area of greatest fragility in terms of stresses on the financial system.
""We can't take resilience, in particular in that part of the market, for granted,"" Bailey told an event held by the Bruegel think tank in Brussels on Monday.
The hit to real incomes in Britain from rising energy prices this year now looked likely to be greater than in any single year during the 1970s, when an oil crisis contributed to the worst bout of inflation in British postwar history, Bailey added. 
Last week the European Central Bank said it would need to keep a close eye on the commodity derivatives market because price volatility had increased stress in the markets.
Earlier this month, a European energy trade body asked governments and financial institutions for emergency liquidity to help energy markets cope with the extreme volatility.
""I'm afraid the cost of doing business will reflect a huge change in risk and volatility in these markets,"" Bailey said.
""We have to watch very closely to ensure that the step change in the cost of risk doesn't cause a market failure."" 
Bailey said these markets had a ""very big"" connection to monetary policy as central banks grapple with soaring inflation caused by a surge in energy prices that has accelerated after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
He largely stuck to the tone of the debate from this month's interest rate announcement in which officials softened their language on the need for further rate hikes after they raised borrowing costs for the third time since December.
Bailey said the BoE had started to see evidence of an economic slowdown. ""We expect that this pressure on demand will weigh down on domestically generated inflation, other things equal at the moment,"" he said.
Asked about a possible rate hike by the BoE at its next scheduled meeting in May, Bailey said the situation was very volatile after Russia's invasion of Ukraine propelled energy prices higher. 
He also said the risks for inflation were two-sided, meaning it could slow or accelerate more than the BoE has forecast.

Asked about the risk of a fragmented world economy with less globalisation if China aligned itself with Russia, Bailey said the situation was even more challenging than after the 2007-09 financial crisis.
""I think it is very important that as authorities, as policymakers, governments, we make clear that we are not abandoning our commitment to an open world economy.""

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka has sought an additional credit line of $1.5 billion from India to import essentials, the island nation's central bank governor said on Monday, amid its worst economic crisis in decades.
The country of 22 million people is struggling to pay for essential imports after a 70% drop in foreign exchange reserves in two years led to a currency devaluation and efforts to seek help from global lenders.
Fuel is in short supply, food prices are rocketing and protests have broken out as Sri Lanka's government prepares for talks with the International Monetary Fund amid concerns over the country's ability to pay back foreign debt.
The new line is on top of the $1 billion support extended by India to help pay for critical imports when Sri Lankan Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa travelled to New Delhi earlier this month.
""There is a very close discussion continuing for an additional support of $1.5 billion (with India) by way of oil support as well as other essential goods support of credit terms,"" Ajith Nivard Cabraal told an online event.
Cabraal's comments followed a Reuters report that said the crisis-hit country was in talks with India for an additional credit line of $1 billion.
New Delhi has indicated it would meet the request for the new line, to be used for importing essential items such as rice, wheat flour, pulses, sugar and medicines, one source briefed on the matter told Reuters.
India's foreign ministry did not respond to a request seeking comment.
REGIONAL RIVALRY
India's support for the roiled Sri Lankan economy comes after previous administrations led by the powerful Rajapaksa family drew the island nation closer to China during the past decade, leading to unease in New Delhi. 
In Sri Lanka's main city of Colombo for talks, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar met the finance minister and his brother, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, on Monday.
""Reviewed various dimensions of our close neighbourly relationship,"" Jaishankar said in a tweet after meeting the president. ""Assured him of India's continued cooperation and understanding.""
In addition to the credit lines, India this year extended a $400-million currency swap and a $500-million credit line for fuel purchases to Sri Lanka.
""India will be an ally for Sri Lanka's future progress,"" Cabraal said.
Sri Lanka's imports stalled, causing shortages of many essential items, after foreign currency reserves fell to $2.31 billion by February.
The nation just off India's southern tip has to repay debt of about $4 billion in the rest of this year, including a $1-billion international sovereign bond that matures in July.
Faced with a swiftly deepening crisis, President Rajapaksa has also sought help from Beijing, including a request to restructure debt payments. 
His government is negotiating $2.5 billion in credit support from China, with a decision expected in the next few weeks.
Finance Minister Rajapaksa is set to fly to Washington, D.C. next month to start talks with the IMF for a rescue plan and also seek support from the World Bank.

""India is also very supportive of Sri Lanka's decision to seek an IMF programme and has given their fullest support,"" another source said.
Sri Lanka's government bonds fell on Monday after the IMF warned the country needed a ""comprehensive strategy"" to make its debt sustainable.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's economy could grow 3.0%-3.5% this year, less than an earlier forecast due to soaring oil prices driven by the Russia-Ukraine war, and the key interest rate should remain low to underpin recovery, the finance minister said on Monday.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy will, however, be supported by strong exports, which could grow 5%-6% this year, and by improved tourism as the government plans to ease more pandemic-related curbs, Arkhom Termpittayapaisith told Reuters in an interview.
""Growth of 3.0%-3.5% should be achievable this year, and 2023 should be better,"" as several government infrastructure projects will be completed, he said. 
In February, the state planning agency predicted the economy would grow 3.5%-4.5% this year, after expanding just 1.6% last year, among the lowest rates in the region.
The economy is also expected to grow in the first quarter both on the year and on the quarter, Arkhom said.
He expected 3 million foreign tourists this year, compared with 40 million in 2019, before the pandemic battered an industry that generally accounts for about 12% of gross domestic product.
Monetary policy should continue to support the recovery that is not yet in full recovery, while the government tries to manage higher inflation, which is expected to be 3%-4% on average this year, slightly above the central bank's 1%-3% target range, he said.
""On the monetary side, don't raise rates too soon,"" he said, referring to the central bank. The economy is expected to fully recover in 2023, he added.
The central bank has left its key interest rate at a record low of 0.50% since May 2020 to maintain support for the economy. It is expected to keep policy unchanged when it meets on Wednesday.
The current level of the baht is ""appropriate"" and supports exports, Arkhom said. 
""The baht may swing, but at 33 baht per dollar, everyone should be happy.""
The government has sufficient funds, with 75 billion baht available under the current borrowing plan, to help the economy and there was no need for further borrowing yet, he said.

The country's public debt to GDP ratio is expected at 62% at the end of the current fiscal year to September, and rise to 67% in fiscal year 2026, Arkhom said.
Last year, the government increased the public debt ceiling to 70% of GDP from 60% to provide room for borrowing if needed.

Putin’s demand represents a “one-sided and clear breach of contracts,” German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said Monday after chairing talks that also included European Union officials.
“That means that a payment in rubles is not acceptable and we urge the relevant companies not to comply with Putin’s demand,” Habeck told reporters in Berlin.
“Putin’s effort to drive a wedge between us is obvious but you can see that we won’t allow ourselves to be divided and the answer from the G-7 is clear: the contracts will be honored,” he added.
Germany currently holds the presidency of the G-7 club of developed economies and Habeck is also responsible for energy in Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s ruling coalition.

Net oil importer Indonesia has made state energy firm Pertamina keep prices of its most widely used fuels unchanged, despite surging global oil prices due to the Russia-Ukraine war. 
The country has also left unchanged electricity tariffs and liquefied petroleum gas prices for households.
The cost of keeping prices stable, however, has yet to be reflected in the latest budget report, which only covered the first two months of 2022 and showed a 19.7 trillion rupiah ($1.37 billion) budget surplus due to strong revenue collection.
That compared with a 63.3 trillion rupiah deficit in the same period last year.
""On the one side, our budget now is looking quite positive, but the budget will have to work much harder to protect the society from the shocks coming from commodity prices,"" Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said, adding that spending, especially on subsidies, will rise. 
Southeast Asia's largest economy has allotted 134 trillion rupiah for energy subsidies this year. It spent 21.7 trillion rupiah in January and February.
On top of subsidies, the government typically compensates Pertamina and state power utility PLN for losses from certain types of sales.
Sri Mulyani said the government still owes Pertamina and PLN 109 trillion rupiah in compensation from 2020 and 2021.
Separately, Pertamina's chief executive Nicke Widyawati told parliament on Monday demand for subsidised diesel fuel is expected to reach 16 million kilolitres this year, 14% above quota, due to improving economic activity and targeted subsidies amid widening price disparity. 

Pertamina is also considering buying Russian crude ""at a good price"", Nicke said.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel's Brain.Space, a four-year-old startup that studies data on brain activity, is set to put its gear to test on astronauts in space next week during a SpaceX shuttle flight to the International Space Station (ISS).
Three astronauts on the planned private space-flight firm Axiom Space's mission to the ISS will use a special electroencephalogram (EEG)-enabled helmet made by Brain.Space, the company said on Monday.
The 10-day mission, the first-ever private trip to the space station, will set off on April 3 with four astronauts.
""We actually know that the microgravity environment impacts the physiological indicators in the body. So, it will probably impact the brain and we would like to monitor that,"" Brain.Space Chief Executive Yair Levy told Reuters.
Data has continuously been collected on heart rate, skin resistance, muscle mass and others in space but not yet on brain activity, he said.
Brain.Space joins 30 experiments that will take part in the so-called Rakia Mission to the ISS. 
Three of the four astronauts -- including Israeli Eytan Stibbe -- will wear the helmet, which has 460 airbrushes that connect to the scalp, and perform a number of tasks for 20 minutes a day, during which data will be uploaded to a laptop on the space station. The tasks include a ""visual oddball"" one that the company says has been effective in detecting abnormal brain dynamics.
Similar studies using these tasks have been completed on Earth and after the mission, Brain.Space will compare the EEG data to see the differences in brain activity between Earth and space. 
It noted that such experiments are needed since long-term space exploration and ""off-world living are within grasp.""
Brain.Space, which also said it raised $8.5 million in a seed funding round, bills itself as a brain infrastructure company and is working with the cognitive and brain sciences department at Israel's Ben Gurion University to transform terabytes of data into usable insights.

Levy said he hoped the space mission would be a springboard for other institutions, researchers and software developers to use its brain data platform.
""Space is an accelerator. The idea is to revolutionise and make possible brain activity apps, products and services that's as easy as pulling data from an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch,"" Levy said, pointing to measuring ADHD as an example.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's prime minister will order the government on Tuesday to put together a fresh relief package by the end of April to cushion the economic blow from rising fuel and food costs, fanned by the Ukraine crisis.
The order will likely intensify debate within the government and the ruling coalition over the scale of spending and source of funding, with some lawmakers calling for a package of around 10 trillion yen ($80.61 billion).
""We must respond flexibly to counter the impact on corporate activity and people's livelihood"" from the Ukraine war-driven spike in raw material prices, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told parliament on Monday, announcing his plan to make the order.
Kishida is under pressure, including from his party's ruling coalition partner Komeito, to compile an extra budget, instead of relying solely on reserves set aside to cope with pandemic-related spending.
""We haven't told the prime minister the extra budget must pass through the current parliament session, though that is what we have in mind,"" Komeito executive Keiichi Ishii told reporters after a meeting with Kishida.
Kishida offered few clues on whether an extra budget would be considered, saying that the priority was to tap money from COVID-19 reserves.
Komeito presented Kishida with a proposal on the package that called for expanding subsidies to industries hit by rising fuel costs, cutting the gasoline tax as well as steps to mitigate the impact of rising grain prices.
Rising fuel and raw material prices have dealt an additional blow to Japan's economy, which has lagged other countries in making a sustained recovery from the impact of the pandemic.
While a weak yen has historically benefited the export-reliant economy, the Japanese currency's plunge to six-year lows against the dollar is now seen as a risk to recovery by inflating rising import costs.

Political pressure for big fiscal spending is expected to heighten ahead of an upper house election in the summer, which Kishida must win to solidify his grip of power within his ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Two measures of the U.S. Treasury yield curve that are widely watched for recession warnings have veered in opposite directions, raising questions as to what degree central bank bond buying and other technical factors may be distorting the signals on the economy's path.
The spread between the yield on 3-month Treasury bills and 10-year notes this month has been widening, which can be an indicator of an economic expansion. On Friday, that curve reached its steepest in more than five years at 196 basis points.
The U.S. 2-year to 10-year curve, on the other hand, has flattened dramatically this year and is close to inverting, where the longer maturity would yield less than the shorter.
Typically, yield curves slope upward as investors demand a higher return on longer-term debt as it carries greater risk because of the higher probability of inflation or default.
A steepening curve typically signals expectations of stronger economic activity, higher inflation, and higher interest rates. A flattening curve suggests investors have lost confidence in the economy's growth outlook.
Inversions are considered a harbinger of eventual recession. But the signal right now is not clear.
""There is a technical issue here,"" said Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors. ""The 3-month T-bill yield is still lower...because it doesn't reflect rate hikes in the future. But it will rise, as the Fed hikes rates."" 
U.S. two-year yields, on the other hand, are a really good indicator of where Federal Reserve policy is headed over the next two years, Emons added, and it's showing a much steeper path of rate hikes.
The 2s/10s spread was last at 20.10 basis points, having on Monday compressed to 11.4 basis points, its tightest since March 9, 2020, before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Fed raised short-term interest rates by 0.25 percentage point last week, the first hike since late 2018. U.S. rate futures on Friday priced in a roughly 75% chance of a half-percentage point tightening at its monetary policy meeting in May. For 2022, the futures market expects about 200 basis points of cumulative hikes by the Fed.
""If policy unfolds as the market expects, the 3-month/10-year curve will begin to flatten as more rate hikes become priced into the 3-month tenor,"" said Dan Belton, fixed income strategist, at BMO Capital.
""The divergence in 3-month and 2-yr Treasury rates suggests that the market is pricing in an increasingly hawkish Fed over the next two years.""
The last time the 3-month/10-year curve inverted was in February 2020. A month later, the Fed cut the benchmark overnight lending rate to near zero as the coronavirus pandemic wrought economic havoc around the world.
The 2s-10s inversions, on the other hand, preceded the last eight recessions, including 10 of the last 13, according to BoFA Securities in a research note. The last time this curve inverted was in 2019. The following year, the United States entered a recession, though one caused by the global pandemic. 
U.S. 2s/10s CURVE HAS QUESTIONS TOO
But the 2-year/10-year yield curve also has its technical issues, and not everyone is convinced it's telling the true story.
""Something like 2s/10s, or 5s/30s, will definitely tell you that we're a lot flatter than we've ever been at the start of a hiking cycle,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.
""Part of that is just the sheer amount of Treasuries that the Fed bought during their COVID QE (quantitative easing) program."" Analysts said the Fed's QE the last two years has resulted in an undervalued U.S. 10-year yield and could explain away the disparity in the two yield curves.
Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist, at Evercore ISI in New York cited research which suggests the 10-year yield would be around 3.60% without that stimulus. When the Fed starts shrinking its balance sheet via quantitative tightening, Shipley said the 10-year yield will rise to fair value.
The U.S. 10-year yield was last at 2.475% after hitting a peak of 2.5% on Friday, the highest since May 2019.
""Without QE/balance sheet expansion, the 10-year and 2-year spread would be around 140 basis points, which is hardly threatening and consistent with the 10-year and 3-month spread,"" Shipley said.
The Evercore analyst thinks the 10-year yield should approach fair value in the first half of 2024, or about 120 basis points higher than the current level.
The U.S. 2-year yield, on the other hand, is fairly priced and Shipley expects the 2s-10s curve to widen.
What does it mean for the U.S. economy?

""Some of the 2-10 shape is down to the fact this is a far more aggressively priced Fed cycle than usual, the notion of how quickly the Fed will move is very front-loaded,"" said Timothy Graf, head of EMEA macro strategy, at  State Street  (NYSE:STT).
""I suspect we will get a growth slowdown but will it lead to recession? It may be next year's story. Households will want to see the fuel prices coming down but generally household balance sheets are in pretty good shape.""

Investing.com -- The Kremlin digs in after President Joe Biden's gaffe calling for Vladimir Putin's removal from power. Bonds continue to sell off as the yield curve points to a growth slowdown. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is looking at a stock split while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly looking at cutting production of some products due to weakening demand. Bitcoin closes in on a new high for the year and oil falls as Shanghai locks down (in stages) for a week. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 28th March. 
1. Kremlin digs in after Biden comments; Zelensky talks peace conditions
Hopes for a quick peace in Ukraine took a blow at the weekend after U.S. President Joe Biden called for the removal of Russia’s Vladimir Putin from power. While his comments at the end of a speech in Poland pledging support for Ukraine’s independence were unscripted, they were clearly intentional.
The comments are likely to strengthen suspicions, both in Russia and elsewhere, of a secret U.S. agenda to pursue regime change, although the State Department and the White House both stated later that this is not the case. 
Separately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told independent Russian reporters that he would be willing to accept permanent neutrality as a basis for peace, as long as it was guaranteed by third parties. He also said he would be willing to have separate negotiations about the status of eastern Ukraine and Crimea, removing a further obstacle to peace talks. The Kremlin poured cold water on such suggestions, a spokesman saying that a meeting between the two presidents would be “counter-productive” although it noted that diplomats will resume their meetings in Istanbul on Tuesday.
2. Bond selloff continues, flattening curve further
Two-year U.S. bond yields hit their highest level in nearly three years overnight, as the repricing of Federal Reserve policy moves in response to rampant inflation continued.
The United States 2-Year Treasury yield touched 2.41% before easing to 2.37% by 6 AM ET (10:00 GMT), still up 7 basis points on the day. Ten-year yields however, were largely stable, rising only 1 basis point to 2.50%. As such, the spread between 2- and 10-year yields has narrowed to only 13 basis points, the least since the start of the pandemic. Flatter and/or inverted yield curves typically tend to indicate a growth slowdown in the future. However, their usefulness as a predictor of recessions is often disputed.
Analysts have been falling over themselves to revise their expectations for Fed rate hikes higher after a string of comments last week from Chair Jerome Powell and others warning of the possible need for half-point rises rather than the quarter-point ones previously suggested.
3. Stocks set to open mixed; Apple, Tesla news in focus
U.S. stock markets are poised to open mixed later, with concerns about the rapid selloff in bonds – which will raise capital costs for the economy at large - finally starting to weigh on equity markets that had defied gravity during the rout last week.
By 6:20 AM ET, Dow Jones futures, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were all effectively flat, after two straight weeks of solid gains. 
Heavyweights look likely to dominate proceedings later, with Apple stock down 1.8% on a report that it will cut production of Air Pods in response to weakening consumer demand, while Tesla stock was up 5% after the electric vehicle maker said it wants to carry out a stock split, which could make the stock more attractive to small investors.
Elsewhere, wholesale inventories data for February are due at 8:30 AM ET.
4. Bitcoin close to 2022 high as BoJ allows yen to weaken
Bitcoin closed in on a new high for 2022, as action from the Bank of Japan revived one of the classic arguments for holding crypto rather than fiat currencies. By 6:20 it was at $47,204, up 6% on the day.
The BoJ intervened heavily in Japanese bond markets overnight, saying it would buy unlimited amounts of bonds over the next four days to keep long-term yields at its policy target rate. As such, the BoJ strengthened suspicions that it prefers to devalue the yen rather than contain inflation. 
The yen hit a six-year low of 125.08 against the dollar as a result of the intervention. The BoJ’s action backs up a string of comments in the last week by BoJ officials that was conspicuously relaxed about the yen’s decline on the FX markets.  
5. Oil falls on Shanghai lockdown
Crude oil prices fell sharply on fears for the trajectory of Chinese demand, as the city of Shanghai announced rolling lockdowns for mass Covid-19 testing over the next week that will affect 25 million people.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 4.2% at $109.11 a barrel, while Brent Futures, the global benchmark, were around $113.03 a barrel, down 3.7%.
The measures will not close the city’s port, or indeed many of its factories (although Tesla’s factory in Shanghai is among those that will stay closed for now). However, the measures, which will be staggered across the city, will ban private car traffic where they are in place.",,,,,

TOKYO (Reuters) -Struggling to swim against the tide taking interest rates higher globally, the Bank of Japan staunchly defended its 0.25% yield cap on Monday by offering to buy an unlimited amount of government bonds for the first four days of this week.
The BOJ's defence of its ultra-loose policy pushed the yen to a six-year low of 124 to the dollar on Monday, adding to the problems Japan's economy is facing from already surging costs for fuel and raw material imports.
Under pressure from a steady rise in yields, the BOJ launched its defence by making two offers in a single day to purchase 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) in unlimited amounts at 0.25%.
The central bank then said it would make the same unlimited offer for the next three days, to make sure investors received the message loud and clear, but some economists believed the central bank's grip on yield curve control was at risk of slipping.
""The power of the BOJ's unlimited bond-buy offer is clearly waning,"" said Takahide Kiuchi, a former central bank board member who is now an economist at Nomura Research Institute.
""Markets may more forcefully test the BOJ's resolve to defend the 0.25% ceiling, which may prompt the bank to modify its approach and allow the 10-year yield to rise more.""
The BOJ's first offer for unlimited bond buying in the morning failed to prevent the 10-year JGB yield from hitting a six-year high of 0.250% on Monday - the level the bank has set as an implicit cap around its yield target.
The central bank made a second offer in the afternoon to buy unlimited amounts of JGBs with maturities of more than five years and up to 10 years.
While the first offer drew no bids, the BOJ accepted bids to buy 64.5 billion yen ($524 million) in JGBs in the second offer.
The two offers, which were the first since Feb. 10, underscored the BOJ's resolve to keep rates ultra-low in contrast to the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hike plans.
The BOJ then announced a plan to buy unlimited amounts of 10-year JGBs at 0.25% for three consecutive days from Tuesday, deploying the most powerful weapon in its armory to defend its yield target.
""Markets are putting the BOJ to test, so the central bank has no choice but to keep offering unlimited bond buying,"" said Takafumi Yamawaki, head of Japan fixed income research at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities.
""If yields are allowed to move above 0.25%, investors will think the BOJ has tolerated a rise above that level. That makes it harder for the BOJ to carry on with yield curve control.""
Under yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ pledges to guide the 10-year JGB yield around 0% as part of efforts to stimulate the economy by keeping borrowing costs low.
The BOJ's current guidance is that it will allow the 10-year yield to move flexibly around its 0% target as long as it stays below the 0.25% upper limit, though it will take into account not just the level but the speed of any rise in yields.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has repeatedly said the central bank would maintain interest rates at the current ultra-low levels, given the fragile economic recovery and as inflation remains well below its 2% target.
Growing complaints from politicians over the weak yen, which is inflating Japan's already rising import costs, may complicate the BOJ's efforts to keep yields ultra-low, analysts say.
The dollar has rallied over 7% against the yen so far in March, its biggest monthly gain in over five years.
The BOJ is caught in a dilemma. By capping rates at zero, it is fueling yen declines that may hurt the economy by pushing up the costs for households and companies.
""Making offers for unlimited bond buying too frequently may cast doubt over the feasibility of yield curve control,"" said Shotaro Kugo, an economist at Daiwa Institute of Research.

""It may also draw unwanted public attention over the weak yen, so the BOJ probably wants to avoid stepping in too often.""

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Hedge funds bet correctly on the U.S. yield curve flattening after the Fed kicked off its interest rate-raising cycle earlier this month, the first week in five that they have positioned for a shrinking gap between the two- and 10-year yields.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that he pays more attention to the shorter end of the curve for potential signals about the health of the economy. But many market participants focus flattening of the interest rate curve between two- and 10-year yields, which has preceded all six recessions in the past 45 years. 
Some of Wall Street's biggest banks are now predicting inversion later this year, but none are forecasting recession. Not yet, anyway.
Futures market data for the week through March 22 showed that funds reduced their net short position in 10-year Treasuries and more than doubled the size of their net short position in the two-year space.
The latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission report showed that funds increased their net short two-year Treasuries position by 27,015 contracts to 47,448, and cut their 10-year net short position by 57,163 contracts to 263,834.
A short position is essentially a bet that an asset's price will fall, and a long position is a bet it will rise. In bonds, yields rise when prices fall, and move lower when prices rise.
A deeper dive into the data shows some potentially significant moves under way in the medium- to longer-term parts of the curve. 
Funds have cut their net short position in five-year Treasury futures by more than a third in the last three weeks. In the 10-year space, they have reduced their net short position by almost a third in just two weeks.
This suggests a growing belief that longer-dated yields will soon peak, then fall. Funds' long 10-year bets rose by around 119,000 contracts in the week, the biggest rise in five years and fifth-largest since the contract was launched 35 years ago.

INVERSION - WHEN, NOT IF?
The curve between two- and 10-year yields flattened dramatically after the Fed's lift-off on March 16. It fell to just 14 basis points on March 22, crushed by a wave of tough, inflation-busting rhetoric from Fed officials that pushed the two-year yield sharply higher.
Several Wall Street big banks now expect 2s/10s inversion - from ""modest"" at Goldman to ""large"" at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Economists at BofA now expect a whopping 50 basis point inversion by the end of this year - a two-year yield of 3.00% and a 10-year yield of 2.50%. 
Graphic: Eurodollar 2023 'Terminal' Rate - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwpkrqeadvm/ED24.png 
Many of them are now penciling in multiple rate increases of 50 basis points. Citi is gunning for four consecutive 50 bps hikes this year and a peak Fed funds range of 3.50%-3.75% next year, well into restrictive territory.
""The 2s-10s curve is nearing inversion, and we think it will invert in the coming weeks (or days),""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists wrote at the weekend. Their base case scenario is a 40 bps inversion by the end of the year. 
These forecast changes are driven more by a projected higher path for the two-year yield than a lower path for the 10-year yield, as the Fed prepares to take the Fed funds rate beyond the neutral level estimated to be around 2.50%.
The so-called terminal rate implied by Eurodollar futures, the anticipated peak in interest rates before they start to come down again, is now above 3%, and will be reached around June-September 2023.
With more Fed policymakers coming out in favor of faster and more aggressive tightening if needed, CFTC data shows that funds expanded their net short three-month Eurodollar futures position to 2.657 million contracts, the largest since October 2018. 
The lower the price of these contracts goes, the higher the implied rate.

590,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 02:26AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -As a tumultuous quarter approaches its end, markets will watch U.S. and euro zone data to gauge just how aggressive central banks might get in their fight against inflation. 
Also in focus will be Europe's dilemma whether or not to sanction Russian energy exports, potentially causing further price surges and economic difficulty.
Here's your week ahead in markets from Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Alun John in Hong Kong, Sujata Rao, Tommy Wilkes and Dhara Ranasinghe in London. 
1/HAWKISH ENOUGH?
Is the Federal Reserve's aggressive trajectory for tightening monetary policy too hawkish, or not hawkish enough? Friday's March U.S. jobs report might show. 
Economists polled by Reuters expect 450,000 new jobs were created, versus 678,000 in February.
Hiring far above those estimates will strengthen the case for a 50 basis-point interest rate hike in May. After all, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has signalled readiness to make a big move if needed.
Despite that, the S&P 500 has managed to nearly halve its year-to-date losses. But watch the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which is getting close to inversion as investors fret about a Fed-induced recession. The bond market rarely gets it wrong. 
2/ HARD TO SAY NO 
Targeting Russian energy, as the United States and Britain have done, is one of the most powerful levers the European Union could pull to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. But it remains a divisive choice for the bloc which relies on Russia for 40% of its gas and reeling from a surge in fuel prices. 
But as pressure grows to announce a ban, there's been a new twist -- President Vladimir Putin's demand that ""unfriendly"" countries need to pay for gas in roubles is raising yet more concerns about Europe's energy crunch.
EU leaders could soon agree to buy gas jointly and secure additional U.S. gas supplies. But in the meantime, the debate is causing unease in all kinds of quarters. Oil producing group OPEC, for one, has warned the move could hurt consumers.
3/ UP AND AWAY 
When first estimates of March euro zone inflation emerge on Friday, they may test the European Central Bank's narrative that there's no rush to raise interest rates.
Inflation is already at a record high 5.9% and could hit 7% in the coming months. Given the ECB target of 2%, it's unsurprising that some officials are urging one or even two rate moves this year.
A strong inflation print will strengthen their case. But bond markets too suggest higher rates are coming, having priced five moves of 10 bps each by year-end. 
Germany's two-year bond yield is up 30 bps in March, set for its biggest monthly rise since 2011. Having spent years deep in negative yield territory amid ECB bond buying to boost inflation, it is fast approaching 0%. That's significant.
4/ THE  BEST  (NYSE:BEST) AND WORST
The first quarter of 2022 was one most investors would prefer to forget. Except of course those trading oil, metals or grains, who would have rejoiced in Brent crude soaring over 50%, and a 30% gain for the CRB commodities index. 
It was less rewarding on equities; with a 5% loss, the S&P 500 looks set to break a seven-quarter winning streak. Nasdaq euro zone stocks fared worse while Chinese markets had to cope with renewed COVID-linked lockdowns in many cities. 
Bond markets hit milestones unseen, in some cases, for decades. The 140 basis-point rise in two-year U.S. yields is the biggest since mid-1984; the German equivalent will post its largest quarterly rise since 2011.
Unsurprising, given central bankers' acknowledgement that inflation is not after all transitory and interest rates need to rise. Global inflation will hit 6.3% this quarter, the fastest rise in a quarter century, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimates. 
Finally, pity those who failed to exit Russia investments on time -- with the country being ejected from equity and bond indexes, they will need to mark their holdings to zero. 

5/STILL DIGGING China's pledge not to roll out a property tax offers only short-term relief to developers, struggling with debt restructuring and access to finance. Evergrande, the poster child for the sector's difficulties, has revealed new problems at a key subsidiary, and will not publish audited results by the March 31 deadline. Another embattled developer Kaisa said the same, though others such as China Vanke, Country Garden and Sunac China plan to publish annual results next week. 
Developers' shares and Chinese high yield bonds remain under pressure. The property sector woes will remain on investors' must-watch list until some real relief measures emerge.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will revise its foreign exchange law to prevent Russia from evading Western financial sanctions following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine through cryptocurrency assets, top government officials said on Monday.
The government will submit a revision of the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act to the current parliament session to strengthen protections against potential sanction-busting by Russia through digital assets, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said in a press conference.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also called for the law to be amended in a Monday parliament session, where he stressed the need for coordinated moves with Western allies after attending last week's Group of Seven summit in Belgium.
A finance ministry official told Reuters discussions were under way about the proposed amendment, saying he could not provide further details.
The revision ""presumably enables the government to apply the law to crypto-asset exchanges like banks and oblige them to scrutinise whether their clients are Russian sanction targets,"" said Saisuke Sakai, senior economist at Mizuho Research and Technologies.
Following the invasion of Ukraine, the Japanese government has slapped asset-freeze sanctions on more than 100 Russian officials, oligarchs, banks and other institutions. Japan has also banned high-tech exports and revoked the most-favoured nation trade status for Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"".

Earlier this month, Japan's financial regulatory body demanded about 30 crypto exchanges in the country not to conduct asset transactions with sanction targets.
A legislative revision is a stronger step to implement such regulations. According to economist Sakai, Kishida's government probably developed the legal revision plan given Western authorities' stricter rules on the subject, as well as high Japanese public support for sanctioning Russia.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's centre-right government is set to unpack a budget larded with cash give-aways, petrol tax cuts and infrastructure spending as it seeks to claw back votes for what is expected to be a tough election in May.
Tuesday's budget is still likely to see a reduction in the deficit, as sky-high prices for Australia's commodity exports have showered the tax man in cash, while a surprisingly strong labour market reduced expenses.
Having spent decades bemoaning deficits, the ruling Liberal National coalition has now decided that protecting economic growth is more important than slashing debt.
""There will be no policy pivot to austerity,"" said Gareth Aird, chief economist at CBA. ""The government will target a budget position that stabilises and then reduces gross debt as a share of the economy.""
That might be in part because Prime Minister Scott Morrison is trailing badly in opinion polls to the opposition Labour Party, which is currently favourite to win May's election after a decade out of power.
Extra billions have been earmarked to airports, railways, roads and hospitals, and more than A$5 billion ($3.76 billion) to build dams favoured by farmers in Queensland.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has also flagged a cash handout to pensioners and a temporary cut in petrol taxes to help with soaring bills and higher food costs. 
Also on the voter-friendly menu is an extension to a popular grant to first-home buyers aimed at soothing concerns about affordability after a long boom in prices.
Fortunately for the government, the huge windfall from high resource prices and low unemployment means this added spending can be accommodated without extra borrowing.
Prices for iron ore and coal in particular are far above forecasts and are huge export earners for Australia.
Analysts expect the deficit for the year to end-June 2022 to be projected at A$70-A$80 billion, down from A$99.2 billion as recently as December. The shortfall is expected to remain around there out to 2023/24, before falling much further.
The commodity boom has also fuelled a remarkable turnaround in Australia's current account position to surplus from deficit, safeguarding the country's triple-A credit rating.
Budget forecasts for unemployment are set to be trimmed given the jobless rate has already fallen faster than anyone expected to hit a 14-year trough of 4.0%.

The speed of the decline has led the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to flag a possible rise in interest rates from pandemic-lows of 0.1% later in the year.

BENGALURU - Thailand's central bank will not raise interest rates from a record low for more than a year in a bid to support an economy still struggling to recover from the pandemic despite a jump in inflation, a Reuters poll found.
While inflation in the tourism-dependent economy hit a 13-year high in February, driven mainly by higher energy prices, policymakers expect price pressures to be temporary.
But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has triggered a spike in global energy and food prices that will make it harder for the Bank of Thailand (BOT) to contain inflation, as found by other central banks who until recently said high inflation was transitory.
Still, the BOT was expected to keep its policy accommodative to revive growth which has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels due to a subdued tourism recovery and tighter mobility restrictions.
All 22 economists in a March 16-25 Reuters poll predicted the BOT would leave its one-day repurchase rate at a record low of 0.50% at its March 30 meeting. Median forecasts showed no change in rates until the second quarter of 2023.
""Under the hood of an unchanged policy rate, the MPC is likely to deliberate on rising inflationary pressures amid elevated commodity prices and supply shocks, against a backdrop of a fragile economy that is facing high uncertainties and downside risks from geopolitics and the pandemic,"" said Chua Han Teng, economist at DBS.
The BOT was predicted to raise rates to 0.75% in the second quarter of next year, making it the last Southeast Asian central bank to raise interest rates. 
However, there was a near split among economists with six of 13 expecting no change to rates in the second quarter of next year, indicating weak conviction about the central bank's policy direction.

Among the remaining seven, four were in line with the median view, two expected rates to reach 1.00% with a lone voice predicting 1.25%.
""The current situation makes it increasingly difficult for policymakers to strike a balance between managing risks to economic growth and price stability,"" said Somprawin Manprasert, chief economist at Bank of Ayudhya.

Investing.com -- The U.S. jobs report for March is coming up on Friday and will be closely watched, being the last monthly employment report ahead of the Federal Reserve’s next meeting in May. Ahead of that, there will be an update on inflation in what is set to be a busy week on the economic calendar. Developments in Ukraine and oil prices will also continue to shape market sentiment as the first quarter draws to a close. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for March could help markets get a sense of whether the Fed’s roadmap for rate hikes is too aggressive or not aggressive enough.
Economists are expecting the U.S. economy to have added 475,000 jobs, after 678,000 were created in February. Average hourly earnings are forecast to increase 5.5% on a year-over-year basis, while the unemployment rate is expected to tick down to 3.7%.
Indications of continued strength in the labor market would underline the case for a more aggressive pace of rate hikes as the Fed battles to curb soaring inflation.
The Fed hiked rates by a quarter percentage point on March 16 but since then Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that the central bank is prepared to raise rates in half-point increments if it is warranted, despite fears that this could trigger an economic downturn.
Ahead of the jobs report, the U.S. is set to release February figures on personal income and spending on Thursday. The report contains personal consumption expenditures data, a gauge of inflation closely watched by the Fed.
Economists are expecting the core PCE price index to rise 5.5% on an annual basis, staying well above the Fed’s 2% inflation target.
The economic calendar also features updates on consumer confidence, job openings, private sector hiring, jobless claims and the ISM manufacturing PMI.
In addition, New York Fed President John Williams, Philadelphia Fed head Patrick Harker, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin are to make appearances during the week.
Oil prices notched up their first weekly gain in three last week, with Brent up more than 11.5% and WTI gaining 8.8%.
Oil prices have spiked - rising 50% since the start of the year - amid sanctions on major supplier Russia in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine.
Rising oil prices have been fueling inflation expectations, burying the hopes of global central bankers that the inflation stoked by pandemic-era stimulus packages would be transitory.
Jerome Powell said last Monday that the U.S. economy is clearly better able to withstand an oil shock now than in the 1970s. The U.S. is the world’s largest oil producer. But this didn’t stop Powell from striking a tougher note on inflation (see above) than he had at the press conference after the Fed hiked rates just days earlier.
Wall Street's three main indices ended last week higher, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rising 2% and 1.8%, respectively, while the Dow managed a 0.3% uptick.
U.S. Treasury yields jumped on Friday, with the benchmark 10-year note surging to nearly three-year highs, as the market grappled with high inflation and a Federal Reserve that could easily spark a downturn as it aggressively tightens policy.
The equity market is pricing in a higher rate environment, Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta told Reuters.
That is causing bank stocks to outperform, while ""adding more pressure to the riskier elements of the market,"" such as growth shares, he said.
The Eurozone is to release inflation data on Friday with economists expecting CPI to hit a new record high of 6.5% amid soaring energy costs.
The European Central Bank has indicated that there’s no rush to raise interest rates but given its inflation target of 2%, it’s no surprise that some officials are calling for one or two rate hikes this year.
A strong inflation reading will bolster their argument. But bond markets too suggest higher rates are coming, having priced five moves of 10 basis points each by year-end.
Germany's two-year bond yield has risen 30 basis points so far in March, set for its biggest monthly rise since 2011. Having spent years deep in negative yield territory amid ECB bond buying to boost inflation, it is fast approaching 0%.

Finance minister Rishi Sunak announced a package of state-backed loans to energy providers and a rebate on local taxes in February to help soften the blow from a 54% hike in energy prices that comes into force in April.
For the average household, prices will rise to 1,971 pounds ($2,600) a year in April, the same month that taxes rise, but with global gas prices continuing to surge, analysts have said that the regulatory price cap could increase by another 30%.
The Sunday Times said the offices of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Sunak had signalled that the state would step in to cover up to half of any increase in energy costs. 
""We've already looked at this and concluded that council tax is the best way to do it,"" the Times quoted a source in the finance ministry as saying, referring to a local tax paid by households. ""You've got an existing mechanism. You don't need to set up a whole new system. It would make sense to do it like that again.""
The Sun on Sunday also said Sunak was seeking to do more. 
""I know people are deeply anxious about making ends meet,"" it quoted Sunak as saying. ""While we can't completely shield everyone from the global challenges we face, we can, and will, help you deal with these rising costs.""

Britain's education minister Nadhim Zahawi said on Sunday the government would continue to keep an eye on costs but noted that it had provided financial support throughout the pandemic.

The government has recently come under pressure to cut fuel excise as petrol prices hit an eight-year high, while Prime Minister Scott Morrison lags in the polls in the lead up to the election, due in May.
Asked by Nine Entertainment if the government would announce in Tuesday's budget a cut to the 44.2 cents a litre fuel excise, Frydenberg said he understood a key concern for Australians was petrol prices.
""What we will do on Tuesday night is provide relief for those families recognising that fuel costs are very high right now,"" he told the broadcaster.
Frydenberg would not be drawn on individual budget measures the government would take on petrol, but said it recognised bowser prices had lifted due to rising global oil prices.
As global oil prices soar due to the boarder impact of war in Ukraine, petrol recently hit A$2.20 a litre in several Australian cities.
""A barrel of oil is up by 50% since the start of the year. That's flowing through to the bowser here at home. We recognise that pressure,"" Frydenberg said.
He said Tuesday's budget would mark a very significant material improvement to the government's bottom line, but refused to project whether a budget surplus would be recorded in the next decade.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison echoed Frydenberg's comments, telling reporters in Western Australia the budget would deal with cost of living pressures being felt by Australians.
""Because of what we're seeing in Ukraine, the impacts on fuel prices, we know that this is biting,"" he said. 
Labor treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers said the federal opposition wanted cost of living relief in the budget that secured a better future for Australians, including on petrol.

""Petrol is a big part of the story as everybody knows,"" he told ABC television.
The government will hope the budget bolsters its support after the latest Newspoll showed Labor leading the coalition of Liberal and National parties.

Biden's ""Billionaire Minimum Income Tax"" would set a 20% minimum tax rate on households worth more than $100 million, in a plan that would mostly target the United States' more than 700 billionaires, according to a White House fact sheet released on Saturday.
The plan would require such households to pay the minimum tax of 20% on all of their income including unrealized investment income that is now untaxed, the fact sheet said.

The tax will help reduce the budget deficit by about $360 billion in the next decade, the fact sheet added.
Senate Democrats last autumn had proposed a billionaires tax to help pay for Biden's social and climate-change known as ""Build Back Better"" although the spending package did not move forward due to insufficient support in the Senate.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The African Development Bank (AfDB) is aiming to raise $1 billion to rapidly ramp up agricultural production in Africa and stave off a potential food crisis brought on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, its president told Reuters on Friday.
But the war, which has sent commodities prices soaring, is also an opportunity for the continent to position itself as a natural gas supplier for Europe and a refuge for investors fleeing Russia.
During the coronavirus pandemic, Africa has not seen infection rates and deaths on the same levels as many more developed regions. Its economies, however, have been battered and its rebound has proven sluggish. 
Like much of the world, African nations are staring at rapidly rising consumer prices, with the war in Ukraine endangering global wheat and corn supplies and sending fuel prices soaring.
""Already, coming out of COVID we have 24 million people that are falling further into extreme poverty, and that's going to worsen the situation,"" Akinwumi Adesina said in an interview.
To avoid a food crisis, he said the AfDB was planning to launch an emergency food production plan that would focus on rapidly boosting wheat, maize, rice and soybean output on the continent.
""The plan is to produce roughly 30 million metric tonnes of food and to get technology into the hands of 20 million farmers. So you're looking at big scale with small-holder farmers,"" he said.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had already voiced its support to help implement the plan, which will produce food staples worth $12 billion, Adesina said.
The bank plans to raise $1 billion needed to fund the initiative from various emergency support facilities, concessional financing and from the IMF's proposed $50 billion resilient sustainability fund.
""When COVID struck, we were not ready. But this time, we're fully ready,"" he said.
ALTERNATIVE TO RUSSIA
While Adesina decried the war's impact on Ukraine and its people, he recognised that the conflict and the geopolitical shifts it has sparked could play to Africa's favour in some areas.
""The biggest challenge Europe has is securing its energy supply,"" he said. ""Europe needs to look, and it's looking, for alternative supplies of gas. Africa can be that place.""
Africa boasts a host of major oil and gas producers, including Algeria, Nigeria and Angola. 
And new offshore gas discoveries - the viability of which had been questioned due to the global shift to renewables - could now become critical to Europe's energy security as it weans itself off Russian supplies. 
France's TotalEnergies along with US firm  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Portugal's Galp are currently developing projects to exploit Mozambique's estimated 100 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves and make it a major liquefied natural gas player.

Africa is meanwhile ready to welcome investors currently pulling out of Russia, Adesina said. 
""There are a lot of investors that are going to be diversifying out of Russia, of course ... That's a real opportunity, I think, for Africa at this point in time.""

""In view of the changed situation, I'm open to prioritising the available funds,"" Lindner told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.
The minister who leads the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) added that what is needed are ""investments in infrastructure, energy and competitiveness, but not more state consumption and postponed reforms"".
In an unprecedented move to prevent economic fragmentation due to the pandemic, EU countries agreed in 2020 to jointly borrow 800 billion euros ($878 billion) to spend on rebuilding their economies to be greener and more digitised.
The EU will discuss in a few weeks whether it needs to jointly borrow more money in response to the challenges created by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said on Tuesday. L5N2VP2ZB]

The trade balance - chronically negative in import-reliant Turkey - will get some relief from foreigners, including Russians buying real estate, the Wall Street bank said.
But ""these inflows will fall short of financing the growing current account deficit, and both (official foreign currency) reserves and the Turkish Lira will come under pressure,"" it said.
High commodity prices would make ""the adjustment of Turkey's current account more difficult rather than easier,"" it added. 
""We now forecast the Turkish current account deficit at 4.0% (previously 2.5%) of GDP in 2022,"" and it could be more ""should the authorities once again resist a slowdown in domestic demand and push for growth,"" Goldman said. 
Turkey imports virtually all its oil and gas needs and has seen costs soar as Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted sanctions that sent commodity prices soaring. It also relies heavily on Russia and Ukraine for grain imports. 
That has jeopardised the unorthodox economic programme adopted by President Tayyip Erdogan that is based on low interest rates, higher production and exports to achieve a current account surplus. 
Erdogan said this week it would be ambitious to expect a serious rise in tourism this year, in a nod to the impact of the war.

The central bank's rate cuts to 14% have left real rates deeply negative given that inflation has soared to 54%. Inflation is expected to hover above 60% for much of the year. 
""At this point, we do not expect them to hike the official policy rate,"" Goldman said. But the bank ""will eventually need to respond, and will possibly do so through new instruments, macroprudential measures, tightening through other channels or other heterodox measures.""

ACAPULCO, Mexico (Reuters) - The Bank of Mexico does not need to strictly track the U.S. Federal Reserve's expected interest rates hike path and can tighten monetary policy at its own pace as it seeks to curb inflation, the central bank governor told Reuters on Friday.
The five board members of Banxico, as the central bank is known, voted unanimously to raise the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 6.5% on Thursday, the seventh hike in a row. It was also the third straight 50-basis point increase.
""We are of course concerned first of all about the inflation we are observing,"" Victoria Rodriguez, who took the helm at Banxico in January, said in an interview on the sidelines of an annual banking conference in the beach resort of Acapulco.
She noted the Fed's policy trajectory was an ""important variable"" for Mexico but not the only one and that inflation has been rising for 15 straight months.
""It's not as if beforehand we have decided to match one by one"" the Fed's expected rate hikes, Rodriguez said.
Inflation hit 7.29% in the first half of March, slightly lower than the previous two-week period, but more than double Banxico's target rate of 3%. The bank has a one percentage point tolerance range above and below the target.
""We don't know yet if we're going to maintain this pace (of rate hikes) or another. It'll be what is necessary to comply with our mandate of a 3% inflation target,"" said Rodriguez.
Rodriguez expects inflation should peak during the first half of 2022 and then begin a downward trajectory towards target in the first quarter of 2024.

However, risks and uncertainty have risen following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which have fueled energy and grains price hikes.
""Regarding inflation there could be a significant impact...we will be paying attention to what happens and if we see an impact on inflation we will take the necessary measures,"" said Rodriguez.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Friday added Russia's AO Kaspersky Lab, China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) (Americas) Corp and China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) International USA to its list of communications equipment and service providers deemed threats to U.S. national security.
The regulator last year designated five Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies Co and ZTE Corp (HK:0763) as the first firms on the list, which was mandated under a 2019 law. Kaspersky is the first Russian company listed.
FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said the new designations ""will help secure our networks from threats posed by Chinese and Russian state-backed entities seeking to engage in espionage and otherwise harm America’s interests."" 
U.S. officials have long said that running Kaspersky software could open American networks to malign activity from Moscow and banned Kaspersky's flagship antivirus product from federal networks in 2017. Moscow-based Kaspersky has consistently denied being a tool of the Russian government, 
In naming Kaspersky, the FCC announcement did not cite Russia's invasion of Ukraine or recent warnings by President Joe Biden of potential cyberattacks by Russia in response to U.S. sanctions and support of Ukraine. 
Kaspersky said in a statement that it was disappointed in the FCC decision, arguing it was ""made on political grounds."" The move was “unsubstantiated and is a response to the geopolitical climate rather than a comprehensive evaluation of the integrity of Kaspersky’s products and services,"" the company said. 
The Chinese Embassy in Washington said Friday that the FCC ""abused state power and maliciously attacked Chinese telecom operators again without factual basis. The U.S. should immediately stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies.
""China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,"" it added.
The Chinese companies did not immediately comment.
In October, the FCC revoked the U.S. authorization for China Telecom (Americas), saying it ""is subject to exploitation, influence and control by the Chinese government."" [nL1N2RM1QE]
The FCC cited its prior decisions to deny or revoke the Chinese telecom companies' ability to operate in United States in its decision to add them to the threat list.
The FCC also revoked the U.S. authorizations of China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) and Pacific Networks and its wholly owned subsidiary ComNet.
In 2019, the FCC rejected China Mobile's bid to provide U.S. telecommunications services, citing national security risks.
Inclusion on the ""covered list"" means money from the FCC’s $8 billion annual Universal Service Fund may not be used to purchase or maintain products from the companies. The fund supports telecommunications for rural areas, low-income consumers, and facilities such as schools, libraries and hospitals.

The FCC last year also named Hytera Communications, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology and Dahua Technology as security threats.
FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said the agency worked closely with U.S. national security agencies to update the list and will add additional companies if warranted.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The board of the International Monetary Fund approved on Friday a new program with Argentina for about $44 billion, the IMF said, acknowledging that the plan comes with ""exceptionally high"" risks. 
The agreement, reached by consensus according to two sources, marks the 22nd IMF program for Argentina and comes after more than a year of negotiations. It replaces a failed $57 billion program from 2018, for which Argentina still owes over $40 billion.
About $9.66 billion will be disbursed immediately, the Fund said.
The approval comes after Argentina's Congress signed off on March 17 on the financing aspect of a staff-level agreement, but not on the policies expected to keep the economy on track and the debt sustainable.
""Risks to the program are exceptionally high and spillovers from the war in Ukraine are already materializing,"" Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF's Managing Director, said in a statement.
""In this context, early program recalibration, including the identification and adoption of appropriate measures, as needed, will be critical to achieve the program’s objectives.""
Russia's invasion of Ukraine late in February and sanctions that followed have pushed the price of many commodities, including energy and food, sharply higher and is expected to push inflation even higher than has been expected.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) this week revised its primary fiscal deficit forecast for this year in Argentina to 2.8% of GDP, above the program's target of 2.5%.
NO 'CONFIDENCE SHOCK'
The deal aims to strengthen public finances, start reducing inflation and build up the local currency debt market, among other goals.
Political cracks inside Argentina's ruling center-left coalition have widened over the deal and there are fears the economic strings attached will further strain people in the South American country fighting with inflation above 50%.
""It will very unlikely trigger the positive confidence shock, increase in private investment, and access to international capital markets that the country badly needs,"" said Alejo Czerwonko, emerging markets Americas CIO for UBS Global Wealth Management ahead of Friday's meeting.
Details of the agreement were made public after a staff-level agreement reached earlier this month.
Argentina's 2018 agreement was the largest in the IMF's history and the Fund risks reputational damage if the program doesn't succeed.
Some private holders of Argentina's debt, restructured in September 2020, criticized early on the negotiations as tainted by politics, allowing the government to carry on ""erratic"" economic policies.
""There's been a lot of criticism of this deal, that it's going to fall apart, that it’s an IMF-light deal, it's a Band-Aid… But it's an important Band-Aid,"" said Robert Koenigsberger, chief investment officer at Gramercy, in an interview before Friday's meeting.
""The only thing that would make this stuff worth less than 32 (cents), which is where it trades today, is if the wheels fall off the bus. What this IMF deal does is it tightens the lug nuts on the wheels, so to speak.""
The restructured U.S. dollar bonds have been trading in the low 30-cents on the dollar area for most of last year and ended down on the day, with the 2030 down 2.6 cents to 29.50.
The restructured bonds in euros ended the day flat to slightly higher.

607,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 05:40PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Fitch said on Friday it has withdrawn Russia's ratings to comply with European Union sanctions, after the rating agency downgraded the country's rating to ""junk"" territory earlier this month.
Aggressive sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have targeted several banks and businesses, crippling the country's economy and prompting the Russian rouble's free fall.

Investors and experts are also concerned Russia could be plunged into a debt default, as its economic institutions face unprecedented sanctions.
Earlier this week, Fitch also said it would withdraw ratings on all Russian entities and their subsidiaries before April 15, the deadline set by the EU.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York's public pension fund, one of the largest pension funds in the United States, will divest its holdings in Russian companies following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said on Friday.
The divestment by the $279.7 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund, which DiNapoli oversees, followed the comptroller's March 1 decision to end new investments in Russian companies.
DiNapoli estimated at the time that the fund had $110.8 million of public equity investments in Russian companies.
He said the investments would be sold in a ""prudent manner and timeframe,"" consistent with his fiduciary duty.
In a statement, DiNapoli said Russia's ""unconscionable and immoral invasion"" of Ukraine has made Russia an ""unacceptable investment risk,"" and that Russia's already weak economy is plunging toward an ""economic crisis.""
The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), the largest U.S. pension fund, on March 3 halted all transactions in Russian publicly traded equity and stopped the flow of new investments into the country.
It owned about $765 million of Russian public stocks and illiquid real estate assets at the time, out of approximately $469 billion of total assets.
New York's Common Retirement Fund invests on behalf of more than 1 million state and local government employees, retirees and their beneficiaries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is done ""sitting on its hands"" and will more actively pressure China, the world's second largest economy, to change trade practices that Washington believes distort the market, top U.S. trade negotiator Katherine Tai said.
Tai, a trade lawyer and former congressional staffer appointed by President Joe Biden, inherited difficult talks with Beijing over a ""Phase 1"" trade deal negotiated by former President Donald Trump.
In an interview with Reuters this week, Tai said the United States was preparing a new approach to China trade policy.
Without offering specifics, she said Washington needed new, more effective tools to defend its economic interests and better compete with China. New U.S. trade investigations, which could result in tariffs or even embargoes against China, may be next, sources familiar with the matter said.
""We're not going to stop pushing China and challenging China to reform and change. But we can't afford to keep sitting on our hands and waiting for China to make its decision,"" said Tai, the first Asian American in the job and a fluent Mandarin speaker.
""We are going to need to turn the page on the playbook,"" Tai said.
A March report https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2022%20Trade%20Policy%20Agenda%20and%202021%20Annual%20Report.pdf from her office said China had ""doubled down on its harmful trade and economic abuses."" Beijing has failed to buy a promised $200 billion in additional U.S. goods and services agreed in the deal. 
China now faces warnings from the United States, the world's largest economy, not to aid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
In the year since Tai became trade czar, some U.S. business executives say they have been frustrated by the slow progress in punishing China. Meanwhile, the U.S. goods trade deficit with China hit $355.3 billion in 2021, the largest recorded since 2018.
Tai acknowledged frustrations, but pointed to longstanding disputes that Washington has resolved with other countries in the past year, precisely, she said, to focus on the bigger threats China poses.
Washington settled a 17-year dispute over aircraft subsidies with the EU and Britain, and a four-year battle over U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs with the EU, Britain and Japan, she said.
ALLIES, TARIFFS, CONGRESS 
Tai in November revived a trilateral dialogue with the EU and Japan https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2021/november/joint-statement-trade-ministers-united-states-japan-and-european-union-after-trilateral-meeting begun by the Trump administration, seeking a joint approach to China's industrial subsidies and other ""non-market policies and practices,"" aimed at getting World Trade Organization support, a U.S. official said.
Washington is considering a new Section 301 investigation into Chinese industrial subsidies that could lead to a fresh round of tariffs or embargos, officials say. 
The Biden administration may also target China's violations of intellectual property protections under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, said William Reinsch at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
The U.S. Congress is also considering bipartisan legislation that would bolster protections against trade secret violations and expedite investigatory and exclusionary processes.
Tai, citing concerns about China's use of forced labor in its Xinjiang region, is also developing a first-ever USTR trade strategy on the topic. 
Jamieson Greer, a partner with King & Spalding and former senior U.S. trade official, said Beijing's response to the war in Ukraine had heightened Europe's growing unease with China, adding Western sanctions against Russia may provide a playbook for future actions against China.

Tai said a ""one size fits all"" approach would not work.
""These are two different countries, two different economies, two different situations. And we really conflate them at our peril,"" she said.

610,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 04:01PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russians have rushed to stock up on anti-depressants, sleeping pills and contraceptives among other products since the conflict in Ukraine began, data released on Thursday showed, with people buying a month's worth of medicine in just two weeks.
Although official opinion polls suggest most Russians support President Vladimir Putin's decision to send tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, social media, interviews and anecdotal data suggest many Russians have been distressed by the severity of the sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West to try to force it to withdraw its forces. 
Many foreign brands have announced they are suspending their operations or quitting Russia, the rouble's value against the dollar has slumped dramatically, and prices for many everyday products have soared since Feb. 24 when Putin announced what he called ""a special operation"" in Ukraine.
""I myself take L-thyroxine as I have issues with my thyroid gland so I'm taking it daily and I worry about it,"" Valentina, a Moscow resident, said. 
""That's why I bought a supply of it for a couple of months in advance as I'm worried if I will be able to find it in pharmacies later. People are asking for it everywhere.""
Sales data gathered by analytical company DSM Group for the daily Vedomosti newspaper showed on Thursday that Russians had bought 270.5 million medicinal items in pharmacies from Feb. 28 until March 13 for 98.6 billion roubles ($1.04 billion).
That was almost comparable to the sales data for the entire month of January when Russians bought 288 million items in pharmacies for 100 billion roubles. 
The latest data, which did not name specific brands, showed an upsurge in demand for foreign-produced pharmaceuticals with demand for Russian-made products growing too. 
In particular, it showed sharply increased demand for anti-depressants, sleeping pills, insulin, cancer and heart drugs, hormones and contraceptives. 
""It was fear,"" Sergei Shulyak, general director of DSM Group, the company that gathered the data, told Reuters. 
""The first fear was that everything could get more expensive and the second fear was that medicines they need won't be available in some time. Those fears moved people. They stood in lines at pharmacies and bought everything."" 
Shulyak, who said what he called ""hysteria"" had taken hold, said there was now a temporary shortage of some medicines, but said he expected the situation to stabilise in time with Russian manufacturers still able to produce generic drugs and many foreign producers continuing to supply Russia even if their products were now being sold at a higher price. 
He warned however that worsening ties with the West meant some Russian drug producers were having problems sourcing ingredients they needed to make their products. 
Some Russians said they were unfazed by the panic.

""There might be some (shortages) especially if the medicine is imported, but I think it will all come back because politics is politics, economics is economics,"" said Vladimir, a Moscow resident. ""They (the drug manufacturers) all need to sell, they all need to gain profit, so it’ll all be back.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Bank of Canada is prepared to act ""forcefully"" with rate hikes to return inflation to target, particularly as price pressures broaden amid tight labor markets and booming demand, a deputy governor said on Friday.
Sharon Kozicki, in her first speech since joining governing council last year, also said the pace and magnitude of interest rate increases, along with the start of quantitative tightening, would be actively discussed at the central bank's April meeting.
""Inflation in Canada is too high, labor markets are tight and there is considerable momentum in demand,"" Kozicki said, speaking via webcast to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. 
""It's important to be clear that returning inflation to the 2% target is our primary focus and unwavering commitment. We have taken action and will continue to do so to return inflation to target, and we are prepared to act forcefully,"" she said.
Kozicki's words echoed statements by Governor Tiff Macklem earlier this month, who said the bank could act aggressively to tackle spiking prices and did not rule out a 50 basis point hike.
The Bank of Canada lifted its policy rate to 0.5% earlier this month, up from 0.25% and its first increase in three years. Inflation, meanwhile, hit 5.7% in Canada in February and is expected to go higher.
Kozicki said that while high household indebtedness, particularly mortgage debt, is a key risk, Canadians appear to be in better financial shape than at the start of the BoC's last tightening campaign in 2017/18.
That suggests a more aggressive path this time around, said economists.
""That's the central bank's way of signaling that it thinks rates will need to rise higher this time around than the 1.75% peak policy rate seen during the previous cycle,"" said Royce Mendes, head of macro strategy at Desjardins Groups, in a note.
He said the repeated use of the word ""forcefully"" suggests a 50-basis-point move is being considered in April.
Money markets, for their part, are betting the Bank of Canada will raise rates by a further 200 basis points this year. [BOCWATCH]
Economists generally view that as too aggressive, considering Canada's highly indebted households and the sharp impact aggressive tightening could have on the country's frothy housing market. Kozicki said the central bank will ""watch developments with respect to households closely as we proceed.""

""High indebtedness could amplify the impact of rising interest rates, and it could also worsen the impact of a future shock,"" she said. 
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.4% higher at 1.2482 to the greenback, or 80.12 U.S. cents, its strongest level since Jan. 20.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's executive board on Friday approved a $45 billion program for Argentina after more than a year of negotiations, two sources with direct knowledge said, allowing the South American grains exporter to avoid a costly default with the Washington-based lender.
The agreement, which follows a staff-level agreement earlier in March, marks the 22nd IMF program for Argentina since it joined the Fund in 1956. It replaces a failed $57 billion program from 2018, the largest in the Fund's history, for which Argentina still owes over $40 billion.

614,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 01:36PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- While the pandemic disproportionately hurt women in the workforce more than men, the bigger divide was among education levels, according to a new paper by Harvard University economist Claudia Goldin.
When restaurants, retailers and other service providers closed, those without college degrees were more likely to lose their jobs. Meantime, many college-educated Americans could continue to work from home.
“The pandemic produced both a he- and a she-cession,” Goldin wrote in a report discussed at the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity conference Thursday. “Relative to previous recessions, women have been harder hit. But the largest differences in pandemic effects on employment are found between education groups rather than between genders within educational groups.”
“And that makes it more similar to previous recessions,” she wrote.
In May 2020, more than 60% of men and women with college degrees were working at home due to Covid-19, Goldin said. Among those with less education, only about 25% of employed women and roughly 14% of men were.
Goldin compares the percentage of people “at work” during the pandemic -- a measure that excludes those who said they had a job but were not actually working, like someone who was furloughed -- with the share in prior periods.
Among those ages 20-54, female college graduates at work fell by 2.7 percentage points from fall 2018 to fall 2020. That compared to 2.6 percentage points among male college graduates. For non-college graduates, those figures dropped by more than double.
Goldin also found that by and large, employed mothers didn’t leave the labor force, despite greatly increased time demands for their children amid school and day-care closures. However, the share “at work” fell more precipitously for Black and Hispanic women and those with young children.

The United States has warned of significant consequences if Beijing offers material support to Russia for its war in Ukraine, or provides an economic lifeline to Moscow in the face of large-scale Western sanctions. 
Mira Rapp-Hooper, director for the Indo-Pacific at the White House National Security Council, told an online panel discussion that driving a wedge between Russia and China would be easier said than done, but that Beijing would remain uncomfortable with Russian President Vladimir Putin's war. 
""We're unlikely, I think, to see a fully and publicly unified Moscow and Beijing in which China is totally comfortable being saddled with the burden of Vladimir Putin's brutal and ill-begotten war,"" Rapp-Hooper said.
""That is to say that we are likely to continue to see some amount of Chinese support for the Russian economy, but a dance that Beijing tries to do to keep up its economic ties to the European Union in particular, but also to the United States,"" she said. 
In February, China and Russia declared a ""no limits"" partnership, with a promise to collaborate more against the West.
But Western governments are shutting off Russia's economy from the global financial system, pushing international companies to halt sales, cut ties and dump tens of billions of dollars' worth of investments.
China has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions, calling them ineffective and insisting it will maintain normal economic and trade exchanges with Russia.

U.S. President Joe Biden, who spoke with China's leader Xi Jinping last week, said on Thursday that China understands its economic future is more closely tied to the West than to Russia

The decision means the export of goods and related services for the Russian energy sector is now prohibited, the government said https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-87747.html in a statement.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's central bank will raise its benchmark interest rate by the highest uptick in more than two decades when it meets next week, analysts said in a Reuters poll on Friday, as it seeks to control spiking inflation.
Thirteen of 16 analysts estimated the bank board will raise borrowing costs by 150 basis points to 5.50%, while two projected an increase of 125 basis points and one predicted a 100 point increase.
If the seven policymakers follow the majority projection, the uptick would be the largest since November 1999.
The market expects consumer price increases to continue to climb, above even the 8.01% 12-month figure reached in February, far from the bank's long-term target rate of 3%.
""In this context the central bank needs to take decisions...and continue to accelerate the rate,"" said Citibank economist Esteban Tamayo. ""I expect in next week's meeting it will be raised 150 basis points and in April there will be an increase of the same magnitude.""
February inflation data was a surprise for nearly everyone, bank board member Roberto Steiner said at the start of this month.
According to the median prediction in the survey, analysts expect the board to take the rate to 7.50% before the end of the year, well above the 5.75% estimated in the previous poll.

""Recent pressure of global and local inflation oblige the central bank to show more proactive management amid an inflation that will not stop rising,"" said Wilson Tovar, head economist at Acciones y Valores.
""Though growth must be protected, the harm of acting timidly is not only more dangerous for the economy, but also puts in danger the bank's credibility if it continues with a measured pace,"" Tovar said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said on Friday that ongoing monetary tightening will likely end with benchmark rates at 12.75% unless unpredicted market disruptions change the policymakers' flight plan, which he sees as improbable.
Speaking at the Central Reserve Bank of Peru Centenary Conference, Campos Neto took a more direct stance after noting on Thursday that a further interest rate hike in June was not the most likely scenario.
Earlier this month, the central bank raised interest rates by 100 basis points to 11.75%, indicating another increase of the same size in May to tame persistent double-digit inflation in Latin America's largest country. 
""We started the hiking process a long time ago, we think most likely we will end at 12.75%, which puts interest rates in a restrictive camp for Brazil,"" he said.
According to Campos Neto, the door was left open for an eventual rate adjustment in June on ""very high uncertainty"" about the extent of the crisis after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which prompted inflationary pressures with a surge on commodities prices.
But he stressed that a policy reassessment would only occur if the conflict escalated ""a lot"" or an unpredicted market disruption generated a new wave of uncertainty.
""At the present moment we don't think that is the most likely outcome,"" he added, stressing that a spike in inflation is already on the radar.

He said consumer prices' growth will peak in April, reaching 11% in the 12-month period by then.
Inflation in the 12 months to mid-March climbed to 10.79%, official figures showed on Friday, beating market expectations and leading some analysts to change their forecasts for the coming months.

(Reuters) -The U.S. central bank may need to raise interest rates more aggressively to tackle high inflation, New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Friday, becoming the latest policymaker to open the door to a bigger rate hike in May.
Asked if he would support a half-percentage-point rise in the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate at a May 3-4 policy meeting, Williams said the central bank will be guided by economic data between now and then.
""What the right decision is at any given movement will depend on the situation then, but the simple answer to your question is if it's appropriate to raise interest rates by 50 basis points at a meeting, then I think we should do that,"" Williams told a conference organized by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru and Bank for International Settlements.
""If it's appropriate to do 25, we should do that,"" he said.
Chief among what the New York Fed chief will be looking at is if there is any easing to supply chain and labor supply woes as the COVID-19 pandemic eases as well as the impact on the economic outlook from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""We have a number of questions we don't know the answer to yet ... we need to be nimble and adjust as we go along,"" Williams said. 
Several U.S. central bank officials, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, indicated earlier this week a renewed sense of urgency in battling a surge in prices that has pushed inflation to a 40-year high, even amid uncertainty about the economic impact of the war in Ukraine.
Williams also noted that low and stable inflation is critical for the success of the Fed's maximum employment and financial stability goals. Inflation, based on the Fed's preferred measure, is currently above 6%, more than three times its flexible average goal.
Such talk has led to the base-case view that the Fed will raise its policy rate by half a percentage point at the May meeting, and that it may also start reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.

Interest rate futures, which had been pricing in a year-end policy rate of 2.25%-2.5%, now are putting about even odds that rates will end the year even higher, at 2.5%-2.75%. To get there, the Fed would need to raise rates by half a percentage point at three of its next six meetings and by a quarter of a percentage point at the other three meetings.
The Fed's current forecast would raise its benchmark overnight interest rate to almost 2% this year with a view to it rising near to 3% next year, a level which would be designed to put the brakes on the economy and further cool down price pressures.

“If it’s appropriate to raise interest rates by 50 basis points at a meeting, then I would think that we should do that. If it’s appropriate to do 25, then we should do that,” Williams said Friday during a virtual panel hosted by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru and Bank for International Settlements. “I don’t see any reason not to do one or the other, it’s just we need to make the right decisions based on what we’re seeing in the economy.”
Williams comments come after Fed officials raised rates by a quarter point last week for the first time since 2018 and projected six more such hikes this year.
Investors have increased their bets on a half-percentage point hike at the Fed’s May 3-4 meeting after Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday the central bank was prepared to do so if needed to get inflation under control. 
Several central bankers have also voiced support for moving by a half point if needed, including St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, however, said he favors a less aggressive approach this year due to uncertainty following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, though he could be persuaded to go faster if needed.

LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts have slapped a sell, or 'underweight', recommendation on emerging market local currency sovereign debt due to the global fallout from the Russia-Ukraine crisis. 
Emerging market fixed income assets have lost 6-9% of their value since Russia invaded its neighbour a month ago, JPMorgan estimates, with nervousness about the war and its impact on global energy and food prices adding to existing pressures.
A number of top EM central banks are signalling interest rates will now need to rise faster than previously thought, feeding concerns about economically debilitating bouts of ""stagflation"" - where high inflation and interest rates hikes sap growth.
""A month of war has accelerated existing trends and surfaced vulnerabilities,"" JPMorgan's analysts said in a note published late on Thursday. 
With the U.S. Federal Reserve and emerging market central banks ramping up interest rates, JPMorgan also said it ""made sense to take advantage of the recent pull-back"" in local currency government bond yields versus U.S. Treasuries to enter an 'underweight' position in emerging market assets.
The U.S. investment bank said major metal exporting countries like South Africa, Chile and Peru could still do well but warned EM fixed-income assets more generally were now facing a more ""stagflationary"" trajectory.
What Moscow has termed a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine has also compounded the already-slow start to the year for emerging market sovereign bond sales.
Cumulative issuance year-to-date is one of the lowest on record and JPMorgan forecasts EM-wide bond issuance will now be significantly below previous years at just $142 billion in 2022.
""This risk-off environment has also increased the cost for those countries that are trying to issue bonds in hard currency,"" the bank's analysts added.
Some countries most vulnerable to higher energy and food prices are also having to deploy ""crisis-lite"" playbooks.

This has been seen this week with Egypt's 15% devaluation of its currency while asking the International Monetary fund about additional support. Sri Lanka has also overcome long-held resistance to IMF help and Tunisia is holding talks.
""The medium term investment outlook is looking more challenging for these countries as a result,"" JPMorgan said.

""Russia and Ukraine are our main trading partners,"" Irakli Kovzanadze told the TV channel TV Pirveli, according to Russia's TASS news agency. ""Russia is second, and Ukraine is fifth or sixth place.""

""I think Georgia's economy will lose $1-1.2 billion,"" Kovzanadze said.
Although growth was likely to fall short of 6%, he said there would be no problems implementing the state budget.
Georgia's gross domestic product expanded 10.6% in 2021 as it recovered from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic after a 6.2% drop in 2020, according to preliminary data.
The International Monetary Fund estimated Georgia's GDP at around $18 billion in 2021, in U.S. dollar terms.
Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.

Ukraine is a major global supplier of wheat and corn, and prices have surged since Russia invaded its Eastern European neighbor last month.
""We are seeing pressure on commodity prices because of the Russia-Ukraine situation. And it's importantly oil and natural gas, but also other commodities,"" Yellen said in an interview with CNBC.
""And I am concerned about spillovers to countries, for example, that are heavily dependent on wheat. Wheat prices have been soaring. And I think it will likely reduce the prospects for global growth over the next year.""
Yellen said gasoline prices could rise further and that the United States was working with allies to try to cushion the impact on consumers.
""It's conceivable that they could move higher, but we're doing everything that we can working with our partners to ensure adequate global supplies to make sure that Europe is well supplied with oil and natural gas, and to protect American consumers to the extent possible,"" she said.

Yellen also said the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine crisis have highlighted the need to secure resilient supply chains for companies.
""Maybe American businesses have focused on efficiency and organizing supply chains in ways that lower costs but impair resilience. And resilience of supply chains is a high priority for the administration. To an extent, that will lead to some reallocation,"" she said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. credit markets saw some respite after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates last week, but the relief is expected to be short-lived as uncertainty around the U.S. central bank's ability to engineer a soft landing for the economy continues to weigh on risk assets.
Corporate bonds have had a rough start to the year as worries that tighter monetary policies could dent companies' profits and raise borrowing costs made investors more cautious.
But after the Fed increased rates by a quarter percentage point last week, corporate credit has seen some buying activity, moving in line with a stocks rally which was partly driven by investors comforted by more clarity on rate hikes and the Fed's decisive action against surging inflation.
The yield spread on the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA U.S. High Yield Index, a commonly used benchmark for junk bond demand, had risen to 421 basis points as of March 15 - its highest since December 2020 - from 305 basis points at the start of the year, as investors pulled back from the market.
Those yields dropped by 25 basis points on March 16, when the Fed hiked rates for the first time in three years and set out an aggressive path for hikes for the remainder of the year. Yields have dropped further since, and stood at 367 basis points on Thursday.
Similarly, the yield indicated on the ICE BofA U.S. corporate index, which tracks dollar-denominated investment grade-rated corporate debt, dropped last week, from 152 basis points - which was its highest since July 2020 - to 146 basis points. It fell further to 132 basis points this week.
""Credit spreads have generally rallied in sympathy with risk assets more broadly post-Fed,"" said Lauren Wagandt, a U.S. investment grade fixed income portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. ""Post-Fed, we have seen yield-based buyers step in, as all in corporate yields have risen and volatility has come down.""
Spreads refer to the interest rate premium investors demand to hold corporate debt over safer U.S. Treasury bonds. They narrowed last year as government debt yields dropped, driving money into securities with lower credit ratings than Treasuries.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday the central bank must move quickly to counter soaring inflation and that it could use bigger-than-usual rate hikes if needed, causing a sharp sell-off in government bonds.
Despite the credit rally, investors say the uncertainty around the Fed's ability to reduce inflation without causing a recession is an underlying risk.
""We believe the rally was more of a relief rally and will end up being short-lived given the same risks remain in place,"" said Wagandt.
That is already starting to show. BlackRock’s iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF - an exchange-traded fund which tracks the U.S. junk-bond market – jumped 1.4% on March 16 to trade at $81.7 a share, but it has lost momentum this week.
Its investment-grade corporate bond equivalent has also lost some steam, dropping 1.3% from last week to trade at $120.22 a share on Thursday.

Neil Sutherland, portfolio manager at  Schroders  (LON:SDR), said corporate spreads had widened to a point that, absent a recession, could be a good buying opportunity, particularly for overseas investors.
""You may have a window where spreads do OK in the next couple of months ... the key thing is, can the U.S. economy avoid recession in the face of an aggressive Fed? I think the jury's still out on that,"" he said.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - A $5.35 billion spending spree by Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban ahead of an election next week has left a budget hole that may spell trouble for whoever wins, as the conflict in Ukraine adds to pressure on the public finances.
With polls projecting the tightest race since his 2010 landslide, Orban has dished out 1.8 trillion forints worth of tax rebates, tax cuts, pension and wage hikes to support his bid for a fourth successive term.
That helped push the deficit to 1.585 trillion forints in February, half the 2022 target, and with the war already dragging on growth, some economists say the government's fiscal plans look obsolete.
Rising interest rates, surging inflation and energy prices, and now the cost of helping refugees represent multiple budget pressures, exacerbated by Hungary's lack of access to EU pandemic recovery funds due to a row over democratic standards.
""Room for manoeuvre has diminished as the budget was spending through the nose at the start of the year,"" ING economist Peter Virovacz said. ""Whoever forms a government, the main priority must be to somehow get the budget into shape.""
Finance Minister Mihaly Varga has already raised the prospect of a budget overhaul after the April 3 vote.
While some economists say the European Union could turn a blind eye to high budget deficits within the bloc given the extraordinary circumstances, a risk for Hungary is how credit rating agencies would respond to a rise in the deficit.
Fitch said it would be ""challenging"" to meet this year's deficit target of 4.9% of gross domestic product, down from 7.3% in 2021 and 8% in 2020, when pandemic stimulus pushed it up.
""The sharply higher inflation now evident and near-certainty of lower growth in 2022 will likely be a net negative for the budget. There is hence a reasonable likelihood of the targeted budget deficit being missed,"" said Arvind Ramakrishnan, a director in Fitch Ratings' sovereign team.
With Hungary's public debt ratio having surged to the highest in Central Europe, based on Eurostat data, during the pandemic, any further rise would be negative for its ratings.
""Any potential impact of current developments on the credit rating will depend in part on the government's fiscal response and impact on headline debt, as well as the extent of adherence to domestic and EU fiscal rules from 2023,"" Ramakrishnan said.
In a note before Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, Standard & Poor's said its stable outlook on Hungary's credit rating reflected the expectation that growth would remain solid, supported by EU funds, some of which are currently on hold.
""We could lower the ratings should fiscal deficits remain elevated, leading to rising debt to GDP, or if Hungary's external position weakens beyond our current expectations,"" S&P said.
HEADWINDS
Central Europe has been hit hard by the war in its neighbour, with plunging currency and stock markets adding to obstacles such as snarled supply chains and labour shortages.
Hungary's is among central banks forced into big rate hikes. Raising its base rate by 100 basis points on Tuesday, it estimated additional spending because of the Ukraine crisis at 0.6% of GDP so far, which could rise to 1.6% of GDP if the conflict becomes entrenched.
Even higher energy and commodity prices would accelerate inflation further and stifle economic growth, the central bank warned. 
""If we called COVID-19 a major shock, which required unprecedented economic policy measures to handle, then this applies exponentially with regard to the war,"" said economist Zoltan Torok at Raiffeisen.
A regulatory price freeze to limit household utility bills, in place since 2015, could cost up to 1 trillion forints this year, some analysts say, and may become unsustainable.
""Barring a significant retreat in gas prices, that will mean an expenditure worth nearly 2% of GDP, plus there is the added fiscal risk of economic growth falling short of the baseline scenario,"" said one economist who did not want to be named.
They project a deficit of nearly 7% this year, although surging inflation could soften the blow via tax revenues.
After padding with budget with 500 billion forints in dividends during the pandemic, the central bank is now making losses on its cheap financing for companies as rates rise.
That and higher debt servicing costs could tear another 1 trillion forint hole compared with 2019 levels, Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy wrote in a January op-ed, saying the government will have to find new sources of revenue.
But with Orban promising to continue supporting middle-class families and pensioners, some analysts have flagged the risk of a return to the unorthodox fiscal stabilisation measures seen after 2010.

""The return of similar measures, sectoral taxes, and the like, cannot be ruled out, regardless of who wins the election,"" Raiffeisen's Torok said.

The five-year 'rhino bond' issued on Wednesday will pay investors returns based on the rate of growth of black rhino populations at South Africa's Addo Elephant National Park (AENP) and the Great Fish River Nature Reserve (GFRNR), the bank said.
After five years, investors would get a return of between 3.7% and 9.2% if the population increases. They would get no return if there is no change in the black rhino population, it added.
Black rhinos are two-horned species of the endangered rhino family and are found only in Africa. Between the 1970s and 1990s, their population fell by 96% to below 2,500 due to poaching to meet demand for their horns in China and the Middle East, according to Save The Rhino International, a London-based non-profit organisation.
Later, large scale conservation efforts were taken up which led to their increase to between 5,000 and 5,500, according to Save The Rhino's website. 

South Africa accounts for approximately half of the total black rhino population on the continent, World Wildlife Fund (WWF), a global non-governmental organisation says. 
""The pay-for-success financial structure protects an endangered species and strengthens South Africa's conservation efforts by leveraging the World Bank's infrastructure and track record in capital markets,"" World Bank Group President David Malpass said in the statement.

629,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 08:16AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Restrictions Russia's central bank imposed in the past month on capital flows out of the country were a tit-for-tat move in response to part of its reserves being frozen by Western countries, the regulator said on Friday.
Western sanctions imposed on Russia for what Moscow calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine have limited the central bank's ability to support the rouble currency with dollars and euros held in its foreign currency and gold reserves.
""In response to the freezing of part of Russia's reserves, Russia also introduced restrictions on the movement of funds that could be transferred to unfriendly countries by a comparable amount,"" the central bank said in its first detailed explanation of the reasoning behind its decisions.
These included capital flow restrictions, a ban on the sale of securities by foreign investors, a ban on withdrawal of their funds from the Russian financial system, and the need to obtain special state approval to make payments to debt holders from ""unfriendly countries"".
The sanctions froze around $300 billion of Russia's $640-billion gold and forex reserves, its finance ministry said earlier in March.
Russia holds part of the reserves in the Chinese yuan and gold - 73.9 million troy ounces of the precious metal worth $132 billion as of Feb. 1.
In recent years, the central bank has viewed both the yuan and gold as part of its reserves that would protect the economy in case of geopolitical crises and Western sanctions. 
Russia ""has therefore increased the share of gold and the Chinese yuan to almost half of its reserves in recent years,"" it said on Friday.

The United States, however, said on Thursday that gold-related transactions involving Russia could be sanctionable by U.S. authorities, effectively limiting the central bank's ability to use the gold reserves as well.
The central bank did not comment in detail about its ability to use its gold reserves, but said that they were currently on Russian territory.

The ECB, which is the EU's top banking watchdog, welcomed the European Commission's proposal to implement the Basel III rules but it objected to some ""deviations"" from the letter of the globally agreed standards.
Specifically, it said banks shouldn't be granted leeway in how they account for their exposures to residential real estate, derivatives and unrated companies when they calculate their minimum capital requirement, known as 'output floor'. 
""These deviations are not justified,"" the ECB said in slides accompanying a legal opinion. ""They should remain temporary, if kept at all.""
ECB opinions are not binding but often influence the legislative process, which is led by the Commission, EU Parliament and member states.
The Frankfurt-based central bank called for the output floor to be applied at the EU, rather than national, level and objected to allowing banks to disregard historical losses when calculating their capital needs. 
It also urged the Commission to stick to a timeline for implementing rules relating to market risk by 2025. 

ECB opinions are fed back to EU governments which then refine proposals that eventually go into a so called 'trialogue' with the Commission, Parliament and EU states before they are finalised. 
This can sometime take years. Basell III rules were finalised in December 2017.

LONDON (Reuters) - The hit to Europe from an economic war with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine pales against the blow to Moscow - but another recession may still be the price to pay.
After a month of war and retaliatory western sanctions against Russia's leaders, businesses and central bank, Moscow upped the ante again this week when President Vladimir Putin demanded 'unfriendly' nations pay for their gas in roubles rather than dollars or euros.
Most bankers and economists are still scratching their heads as to how this would even work or what the point of it would be for a country where energy exports are one of its last remaining sources of badly-needed foreign currency.
Some think it's just an artificial way of propping the rouble via forced foreign demand, indirectly channelling hard cash back to a sanctioned central bank - the ultimate provider of roubles - and hoping to avert an inflationary collapse that's already wiped off a third of the currency's value this year.
Others see it as contractual minefield and possibly just a ruse to complicate payments while pressuring to European gas importers most dependent on Russia - such as Germany, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia. It may also have been threat to forestall an EU oil embargo.
Yet many also fear it's simply a pretext to cutting off gas supplies altogether if European nations then refuse to pay in roubles - as leaders meeting in Brussels this week insisted they would not.
For  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Chief European Economist Silvia Ardagna, there's little doubt what would happen next in that case.
""If you say to me Russian gas supplies are cut completely tomorrow, then definitely there will be a recession - not only this year but well into next,"" she said.
Ardagna already cut her forecast for euro zone growth this year by 1.7 percentage points to 2.4% due to the Ukraine war and its fallout - seeing quarter-on-quarter growth almost stalling in the second quarter and picking up to about 0.5% by Q4. 
Unlike the futures markets, she doesn't see the European Central Bank raising interest rates this year as a result.
But to model the impact of a halt to Russian gas requires going back to drawing board again. And for that Ardagna said the best rule of thumb was an ECB bulletin last month that showed a 10% rationing of overall gas supplies to the bloc's industries would cut gross value added by about 0.7 percentage points over subsequent quarters.
And this hit doesn't even take account of the likely additional surge in gas and oil prices as a result - with European gas prices are already up more than 500% over the past year. 
However, it also doesn't take account the fiscal supports or the scramble underway to wean the EU off Russian gas altogether. 
The EU earlier this month outlined plans to cut its dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year and end its reliance on Russian fuel supplies well before 2030.
What's more, the variations in dependency vary widely. Unicredit (MI:CRDI) estimates Russian gas accounts for 8% of gross energy consumption in the EU and euro zone - but it's as high as 25% in Hungary, almost 15% in Germany and Italy, and only 2% in France.
And while second order effects on household or business confidence would amplify things, they are partly offset by the momentum behind pandemic reopenings and relatively healthy labour markets.
TROUBLES AHEAD
Painful roads ahead, no doubt. But there are potential long-term positives for Europe too, not least in its greater cohesiveness on energy security and defence, fiscal supports and more common borrowing for future investment.
""These will take time and are unlikely to change the 2022 economic outlook,"" Barclays reckoned. ""But the ongoing war at the borders of the EU, perhaps even more so than the European debt crisis and the pandemic, could well turn out to be a force of further European integration.""
And for Russia? Selling gas in roubles may be a poke in the eye for an international payments system dominated in dollars and euros, but cutting off gas exports would hardly do much to improve an already dire prognosis for its economy.
Benjamin Hilgenstock and Elina Ribakova at the Institute of International Finance expect the effect of war, sanctions and 'self sanctioning' of global businesses avoiding censure will see Russia's gross domestic product contract 15% in 2022 and a further 3% next year - wiping out almost 15 years of growth.
And they say the medium-term impact of a likely 'brain drain' of young educated emigrants from Russia and a lack of overseas investment there could be even more severe on Russia's growth potential for years to come.
If that were to pass and the rouble were to keep falling, Russia would plummet from the 11th biggest economy in the world last year to 19th by December - a country of 144 million people with GDP roughly on par with the 17 million population of the Netherlands.

Everyone loses in a war. But some much more than others.

632,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 07:41AM ET</span>","BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany has made significant progress towards reducing its exposure to imports of Russian gas, oil and coal since Russia invaded Ukraine, Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Friday.
Germany is trying to wean itself off Russian energy in the wake of the Ukraine crisis, but this is an uphill battle after decades of relying on Russia for energy supplies.
Habeck said imports of Russian oil now accounted for 25% of German imports, down from 35% before the invasion, and gas imports have been cut to 40% from 55%. Russian hard coal imports were down to 25% from 50% before the invasion.
""The first important milestones to free us from the grip of Russian imports have been achieved,"" he said.
By this summer, the share of Russian gas imports will fall to 24%, but he said it could take until the summer of 2024 for Europe's largest economy to no longer be reliant on Russian gas.
Habeck said achieving that goal would require enormous effort by the government, states, municipalities, companies and consumers. He said utilities were working hard to tackle decades of reliance on Russian pipelines.
The minister has been visiting gas producers such as Qatar and Norway in recent weeks to ask them to step up supplies for Germany.
Utilities Uniper and RWE are working on liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals to bring sea-borne gas into the country.
The European Union and United States are set to unveil a deal to supply Europe with more U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG), sources have told Reuters.
President Joe Biden, who attended the EU leaders summit in Brussels on Thursday, promised the United States would deliver at least 15 billion cubic metres (bcm) more LNG to Europe this year than planned before, sources familiar with the matter have said.
Germany has made the most progress in reducing its dependence on oil and coal shipments from Russia.
Habeck said German companies had been able to diversify quickly by cancelling contracts, letting them expire, or striking new ones with alternative parties.
Germany could halve its dependency on Russian oil by the summer and this could be cut entirely by year-end.

Power generation plants burning Russian coal could go without Russian supplies as early as the autumn of 2022.
Habeck said while it was too early for an immediate energy embargo, already ""every supply contract that is ended will damage Putin.""

(Reuters) - Nearly a year after COVID vaccines became freely available in the U.S., one fourth of American adults remain unvaccinated, and a picture of the economic cost of vaccine hesitancy is emerging. It points to financial risk for individuals, companies and publicly funded programs.
Vaccine hesitancy likely already accounts for tens of billions of dollars in preventable U.S. hospitalization costs and up to hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths, say public health experts.
For individuals forgoing vaccination, the risks can include layoffs and ineligibility to collect unemployment, higher insurance premiums, growing out-of-pocket medical costs or loss of academic scholarships.
For employers, vaccine hesitancy can contribute to short-staffed workplaces. For taxpayers, it could mean a financial drain on programs such as Medicare, which provides healthcare for seniors.
Some employers are looking to pass along a risk premium to unvaccinated workers, not unlike how smokers can be required to pay higher health premiums. One airline said it will charge unvaccinated workers $200 extra a month in insurance.
“When the vaccines emerged it seemed like everyone wanted one and the big question was how long it would take to meet the demand,” said Kosali Simon, a professor of health economics at Indiana University. “It didn’t occur to me that, a year later, we’d be studying the cost of people not wanting the vaccines.”
Alicia Royce, a 38-year-old special education teacher in Coachella, California, opted out of getting the COVID vaccine or having her two vaccine-eligible children get it. Royce’s parents got the shots, but she has been concerned by issues including reports of adverse reactions.
The decision puts Royce in a delicate spot. Her school, like others in California, began a vaccine mandate for staff last year. For now, Royce has a religious exemption and gets tested for COVID twice a week before entering the classroom. The situation has prompted her family to plan a move to Alabama, where schools have not imposed mandates, after the school year.
“I’ll get paid less,” said Royce, who expects to take a $40,000-a-year pay cut. “But I’m moving for my own personal freedom to choose.”
PREVENTABLE CARE, BILLIONS IN COSTS
As the pandemic enters its third year, the number of U.S. patients hospitalized with COVID is near a 17-month low. Most Americans are vaccinated, and the country is regaining a semblance of normalcy, even as authorities predict a coming uptick in infections from the BA.2 sub-variant.
Yet as millions return to offices, public transportation and other social settings, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention figures show nearly 25% of U.S. adults haven’t been fully vaccinated, and the latest data suggests many holdouts won’t be easily swayed: The number of people seeking a first COVID vaccine in the U.S. has fallen to 14-month lows.
Vaccines have proven to be a powerful tool against the virus. CDC figures from 2021’s Delta wave found that unvaccinated Americans had four times greater risk of being infected, and nearly 13 times higher risk of death from COVID. The disparities were even greater for those who received booster shots, who were 53 times less likely to die from COVID. Less than half of the country’s vaccinated population has so far received a booster.
In a December study, the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks U.S. health policy and outcomes, estimated that between June and November of 2021, unvaccinated American adults accounted for $13.8 billion in “preventable” COVID hospitalization costs nationwide.
Kaiser estimated that over that six-month period, which included the Delta wave, vaccinations could have averted 59% of COVID hospitalizations among U.S. adults. Kaiser tallied 690,000 vaccine-preventable hospitalizations, at an average cost of $20,000. And it estimated vaccinations could have prevented 163,000 U.S. deaths over the same period.
If vaccine hesitancy accounted for half of the more than 1 million new U.S. COVID hospitalizations since December, the added cost of preventable hospital stays could amount to another $10 billion, Reuters found.
One thing is clear: As U.S. insurance providers and hospital networks reckon with vaccine hesitancy, it’s likely that patients hospitalized for COVID will end up shouldering a bigger portion of the bill.
“These hospitalizations are not only devastating for patients and their families but could also put patients on the hook for thousands of dollars,” Krutika Amin, a Kaiser associate director and one of the December study’s co-authors, told Reuters. Unlike earlier in the pandemic, Amin said, most private health insurers have stopped waiving cost-sharing or deductibles for COVID patients who end up hospitalized.
For some insurance plans, the cost to a hospitalized COVID patient can exceed $8,000 just for “in-network” services, she added. The expenses could balloon for the uninsured and those turning to out-of-network care.
Now that Americans have the choice to protect themselves with vaccines, insurance companies are requiring patients to bear more of these costs, but “many people do not have enough money to pay,” Amin said.
More recent data – covering the Omicron wave – underscores the risk for the unvaccinated. During January in New York State, unvaccinated adults were more than 13 times as likely to be hospitalized with COVID than fully vaccinated adults, state health department figues show.
POLITICAL FLASHPOINT
The U.S. has spent billions to get vaccine shots into arms, including more than $19.3 billion to help develop vaccines, federal reports show.
Still, the United States has one of the largest COVID vaccine holdout rates among highly developed countries, as some question the need for getting the shots or bristle at government or workplace mandates.
“The subset of the population that is really anti-COVID vaccine, ready to quit jobs or test in order to go to work, is now pretty hardened,” said Julie Downs, a social psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University.
COVID vaccines have become a political flashpoint, and vaccination rates vary widely by region: In Vermont, public health data shows 84% of those 18 and up are fully vaccinated, while the rate is just above 60% in Alabama.
Nearly 76% of people in the United States have had at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, CDC data shows, but the fully vaccinated figure – across all age-groups – stands at 64%. The Food and Drug Administration hasn’t yet approved a COVID vaccine for children under 5.
Perhaps the biggest financial risk vaccine holdouts have faced is getting laid off from their jobs, said Kaiser’s Amin.
New York City, which requires city workers to be vaccinated, fired more than 1,400 of them last month who hadn’t received a vaccine shot by the city’s deadline, while around 9,000 other workers remained in the process of seeking exemptions to the requirement, city figures show. The vast majority of the city’s 370,000-person workforce is vaccinated.
A Kaiser Family Foundation nationwide survey in October found that about a quarter of workers said their employer required proof of vaccination. Only 1% of workers surveyed — and 5% of unvaccinated workers — reported having left a job due to a workplace vaccine mandate.
A tiny minority of healthcare workers across the country have been fired or placed on work leave because they chose to remain unvaccinated, but the dismissals still amount to thousands of layoffs, according to a report from Fierce Healthcare, which tracks the trend.
NO-VAX TAX
Giant employers including J.P. Morgan and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) have informed their U.S. employees they can expect to pay more – or receive fewer perks through company wellness programs – if they don’t provide proof of vaccination.
Other companies have extended an insurance premium surcharge for unvaccinated spouses or family members of employees if they want to be insured as a dependent under an employee’s health plan.
And after global life insurance providers were hit with a higher-than-expected $5.5 billion in claims during the first nine months of 2021, insurers will be looking to calibrate premiums more closely to COVID mortality risks going forward, Reuters reported.
Vaccination status and other health risks – such as obesity or smoking — are metrics life insurers can probe when customers seek coverage. Under the U.S. Affordable Care Act, individuals seeking health insurance can’t be denied for pre-existing conditions, including COVID, or charged more for not being vaccinated. But companies who cover some of employees’ health insurance costs can pass along higher costs to unvaccinated employees.
Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) said last year it would charge employees who didn’t vaccinate an extra $200 a month for health insurance. The airline said the extra charge reflected the higher risk of COVID hospitalization for those employees, and noted that employee hospitalizations for COVID had cost $50,000 each so far, on average.
University students also can face financial consequences for opting out. At least 500 U.S. colleges have vaccine mandates, some barring enrollment or in-person schooling for those who don’t comply, or requiring them to undergo frequent COVID testing.
Cait Corrigan said she enrolled in a master’s program in theology at Boston University this year and was offered an academic scholarship. Corrigan, who has led public-activism efforts against vaccine mandates, said she got a religious exemption to the school’s vaccine mandate, but the school required that she take regular nasal swab tests to attend. Corrigan said she declined to submit to nasal tests for “medical reasons.”

The university suspended her and withdrew funding, she said. “It was a big loss.” Boston University didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Now in New York, Corrigan says she is campaigning for a congressional seat as a Republican. Her platform: “medical freedom.”

1/HAWKISH ENOUGH?
Is the Federal Reserve's aggressive trajectory for tightening monetary policy too hawkish, or not hawkish enough? Friday's March U.S. jobs report might show. 
Economists polled by Reuters expect 450,000 new jobs were created, versus 678,000 in February.
Hiring far above those estimates will strengthen the case for an 50 basis-point interest rate hike in May. After all, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has signalled readiness to make a big move if needed.
Despite that, the S&P 500 has managed to nearly halve its year-to-date losses. But watch the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which is getting close to inversion as investors fret about a Fed-induced recession. The bond market rarely gets it wrong.

2/ HARD TO SAY NO 
Targeting Russian energy, as the United States and Britain have done, is one of the most powerful levers the European Union could pull to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. But it remains a divisive choice for the bloc which relies on Russia for 40% of its gas and reeling from a surge in fuel prices. 
But as pressure grows to announce a ban, there's been a new twist -- President Vladimir Putin's demand that ""unfriendly"" countries need to pay for gas in roubles is raising yet more concerns about Europe's energy crunch.
EU leaders could soon agree to buy gas jointly and secure additional U.S. gas supplies. But in the meantime, the debate is causing unease in all kinds of quarters. Oil producing group OPEC, for one, has warned the move could hurt consumers.

3/ UP AND AWAY 
When first estimates of March euro zone inflation emerge on Friday, they may test the European Central Bank's narrative that there's no rush to raise interest rates.
Inflation is already at a record high 5.9% and could hit 7% in the coming months. Given the ECB target of 2%, it's unsurprising that some officials are urging one or even two rate moves this year.
A strong inflation print will strengthen their case. But bond markets too suggest higher rates are coming, having priced five moves of 10 bps each by year-end. 
Germany's two-year bond yield is up 30 bps in March, set for its biggest monthly rise since 2011. Having spent years deep in negative yield territory amid ECB bond buying to boost inflation, it is fast approaching 0%. That's significant.

4/ THE  BEST  (NYSE:BEST) AND WORST
The first quarter of 2022 was one most investors would prefer to forget. Except of course those trading oil, metals or grains, who would have rejoiced in Brent crude soaring over 50%, and a 30% gain for the CRB commodities index. 
It was less rewarding on equities; with a 5% loss, the S&P 500 looks set to break a seven-quarter winning streak. Nasdaq euro zone stocks fared worse while Chinese markets had to cope with renewed COVID-linked lockdowns in many cities. 
Bond markets hit milestones unseen, in some cases, for decades. The 140 basis-point rise in two-year U.S. yields is the biggest since mid-1984; the German equivalent will post its largest quarterly rise since 2011.
Unsurprising, given central bankers' acknowledgement that inflation is not after all transitory and interest rates need to rise. Global inflation will hit 6.3% this quarter, the fastest rise in a quarter century, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimates. 
Finally, pity those who failed to exit Russia investments on time -- with the country being ejected from equity and bond indexes, they will need to mark their holdings to zero. 
5/STILL DIGGING China's pledge not to roll out a property tax offers only short-term relief to developers, struggling with debt restructuring and access to finance. Evergrande, the poster child for the sector's difficulties, has revealed new problems at a key subsidiary, and will not publish audited results by the March 31 deadline. Another embattled developer Kaisa said the same, though others such as China Vanke, Country Garden and Sunac China plan to publish annual results next week. 

Developers' shares and Chinese high yield bonds remain under pressure. The property sector woes will remain on investors' must-watch list until some real relief measures emerge.

Investing.com -- The U.S. and EU agree on a deal to increase supplies of liquefied natural gas, helping Europe to wean itself off Russian energy dependence. German and Italian business confidence collapse as the war takes its toll on the regional economy. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly looking at introducing subscription plans for its hardware, while the owners of the LA Dodgers and the Philadelphia 76ers face off in a battle to buy European soccer champions Chelsea from a sanctioned Russian oligarch. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 25th March.
1. U.S., Europe strike gas supply deal
The U.S. agreed to increase supplies of liquefied natural gas to Europe, in an effort to help the EU wean itself off Russian gas imports.
A factsheet from the White House spoke of an “at least 15 billion cubic meters in 2022, with expected increases going forward.” By 2030, the two sides will aim to increase LNG shipments by 50 billion cubic meters a year from current levels.
While that is a substantial amount, it’s still not enough to replace all of the EU’s gas imports from Russia, which typically run well over 100 billion cubic meters a year.
The news was announced at a two-day EU summit attended by U.S. President Joe Biden. So far there has been no clarity on the bloc’s response to Kremlin demands that European buyers pay Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) for their gas in rubles in future.
2. European business confidence collapses as war takes its toll; VW postpones new EV launch 
The effects of the war in Ukraine are starting to become evident in European economic data.
German business confidence cratered in March, the Ifo Business Climate index falling to a 14-month low of 90.8, while February’s index was also revised lower. Italy’s business confidence and consumer confidence indices also fell steeply.  At the company level, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said it will have to push back the launch of its ID.5 electric car by a month due to a shortage of components from Ukraine.
In the U.K. meanwhile, core retail sales fell surprisingly in February by an alarming 0.7%, in contrast to expectations for a gain of 0.5%. Sterling fell 0.1% to $1.3171 in response, but the euro edged up to $1.1006 by 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), supported by the news of the gas agreement with the U.S.
3. Stocks set to open mixed; Michigan Consumer Sentiment, Williams' speech eyed
U.S. stock markets are set to open mixed later, but are on course to end the week at their highest since early February, having completely erased the losses suffered due to the invasion of Ukraine and fears of faster hikes in interest rates.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 14 points, or less than 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures were up by a similar amount, but NASDAQ 100 Futures were inching lower.
The Michigan Consumer Sentiment index, due at 10 AM ET, will provide an instructive comparison with the relative impact of war on the European and U.S. economies. Pending home sales data for February are due at the same time, as is a speech by New York Federal Reserve President John Williams.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Big Tech platforms, after the EU unveiled new draft legislation aiming at curbing their market power. Apple particularly will be in focus after a Bloomberg report saying that it is looking at launching subscription plans for its hardware, including iPhones.
4. Dodgers, 76ers owners face off over Chelsea
The race to buy London soccer club Chelsea has boiled down to a face-off between the owners of the LA Dodgers and the Philadelphia 76ers, according to various reports.
The two preferred bids, according to the Financial Times are from an investor group led by Dodgers owner Todd Boehly, and another led by Apollo’s Josh Harris and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group’s David Blitzer, whose portfolio of sports teams already includes the NHL’s New Jersey Devils and minority stakes in soccer clubs in Germany and the Benelux countries.
Chelsea have been owned by the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich since 2003, whose relentless spending has transformed a once second-rate outfit into the current European and World club champions, without ever making it sustainably profitable. Various reports put the club’s value at around $4 billion. Abramovich’s assets have now been frozen by the U.K. government, making his ownership of the club untenable.  
5. Oil slips on gas deal, China Covid fears
Crude oil prices slipped as the EU-U.S. gas deal encouraged optimism about ironing out the disruptions to world energy markets more broadly stemming from the West’s sanctions on Russia. Growing fears about the impact of Covid shutdowns on Chinese demand also weighed on prices, amid reports that independent refiners in China are running at their lowest utilization rates in months.
However, some upward pressure from European buyers urgently seeking replacement supplies still seems likely. German vice-chancellor Robert Habeck said earlier that Europe’s largest economy will halve its imports of Russian oil by the summer, and be almost independent of Russian gas by 2024.
By 6:40 AM ET, U.S. crude prices were down 1.5% at $110.63 a barrel, while Brent crude was down 1.1% at $117.77 a barrel.
The Baker Hughes rig count is due later, a day after the Dallas Federal Reserve's latest survey suggested that crude prices only need to average a little over $50 a barrel. "

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Last month, not quite two years after the COVID-19 pandemic sent the U.S. and world economies into their steepest downturn in decades, Chris and Amy Hillyard renewed the lease on their downtown Oakland coffee spot, Farley's East.
The location had notched record sales in February 2020 and then, like all other ""non-essential"" local businesses, had to shut the following month as authorities moved to curb the spread of the new and deadly infection.
Two years on, most of the nearby office workers who used to pop in for lunch and lattes are still doing their jobs from home, and the cafe still doesn't bring in enough money to cover monthly expenses, Chris Hillyard said.
That's despite their landlord agreeing to a slightly lower rent for the new five-year term, he said. But Hillyard is undeterred.
""Two bad years isn’t going to kill us off,"" he said. ""We’ll get through it...We are betting on that happening.""
On the face of it, it's a good bet. COVID cases have dropped, schools have loosened rules, and more local businesses are bringing workers back to their offices. Last quarter, the vacancy rate for U.S. office space fell for the first time since mid-2019, figures from CBRE Econometric Advisors show.
There's still a long way to go. CBRE economists don't expect the vacancy rate to ease to its 30-year average of 15% until 2026.
A back-to-work barometer measuring keycard swipes and other building access data from security firm Kastle Systems registered just 40% of pre-pandemic levels across 10 major cities this week; the San Francisco metro area registered around
30%.
""This is about to jump considerably,"" said Phil Ryan, director of U.S. Office Research at JLL, citing announcements from large tech and financial tenants to have employees back in the office at least half time beginning in late March. ""Over the short-term, foot traffic is likely to rise.""
HIGH INFLATION, SCARCE LABOR
Still, Hillyard's optimism is challenged by inflation that's already the highest in 40 years and could rise even more.
Consumer prices were up 7.9% in February year over year, and look set to post an even bigger gain this month as Russia's invasion of Ukraine drives up the price of gas, wheat and other commodities.
The Hillyards are feeling the pinch. Each week brings a new notice from one supplier or another: a March 1 price hike from the bakery that supplies its pastries, a half-gallon of milk now $2.68 instead of $2.25, a 25% increase in the price of coffee beans.
To compensate, Farley's raised its own prices last month for the first time since the start of the pandemic, about 10% for most items. And though customers seemed to take it in stride, it's not something Hillyard says he will be able to soon repeat.
""Prices can't keep going up or the whole system will go down,"" Hillyard said.
Meanwhile, he said he can't hire enough workers, despite offering higher pay. The Oakland-area workforce - the pool of those working or in the market for a job - has been recovering but was about 33,000 people short of its prepandemic level in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's a deficit of about 2.3% from February 2020, 2 percentage points greater than the national average.
With only five employees on shifts that really need six, ""it's hard on the staff because they are asked to do more,"" he said.
Nonetheless, the Hillyards are hopeful. One reason is the success of their second, smaller operation in San Francisco's Potrero Hill neighborhood, where sales have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels thanks to plenty of foot traffic from work-from-homers and brisk sales of a new line of merchandise including T-shirts, totes and coffee mugs.
A second reason is the long-planned opening of two airport locations, one in San Francisco, where international travel is still sluggish, and a second one starting last month at Oakland airport, where Southwest Airline's domestic business is burgeoning.
Yes, local gas prices jumped about a dollar on the gallon in the weeks after Russia's invasion, and Hillyard says he's probably in for fuel surcharges ahead as delivery trucks try to recoup losses.

But after two rough years, ""I just can't worry about something so specific,"" he said.
""We're just looking to move forward and sell more coffee.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The Federal Reserve’s hawkish tilt has shaken up the bond market, with Treasuries recording their worst start to the year in history. 
Yields on the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury, which move inversely to bond price, reached a high of 2.417% earlier this week as investors factored in a more aggressive Fed, a 90 basis point gain since the beginning of the year and its highest level since May 2019. 
Many investors expect more turmoil in bonds, as soaring consumer prices push the Fed into full inflation-fighting mode. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Thursday raised its year-end forecast for the 10-year yield to 2.7% from an earlier projection of 2.25% and predicted a “modest” inversion of the Treasury yield curve, though the bank’s analyst said the phenomenon would not necessarily be indicative of an oncoming recession, as it has in the past.
Here is a quick look at the state of the Treasury market nearly three months into 2022. 
The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA Treasury Index is down 5.6% this year, its worst start in history, as investors reprice a Fed that is now expected to tighten monetary policy by a further 190 basis points this year and has said could raise rates by 50 basis points at one of its upcoming meetings if warranted. 
Investors worried that hawkish monetary policy could dent growth have been eyeing the shape of the Treasury yield curve, which has increasingly shown yields on some shorter-dated debt rising above yields on longer-dated debt.
An inverted yield curve is typically a sign that investors are worried about the economy and recessions have followed when yields on 2-year Treasuries have risen above those on 10-years. That part of the yield curve has so far not inverted, although the gap between yields has narrowed dramatically in recent weeks.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected that part of the yield curve to invert this year, though such a move would not necessarily signify a recession due to the current ""high inflation"" environment. 
""In such an environment, a deeper nominal curve inversion may be needed to produce the same recession odds in models as seen in more recent business cycles,"" Goldman’s analysts wrote in a recent report. 
Investors also have been watching so-called real yields, or the nominal yield of a bond minus the rate of inflation.
Negative real yields on Treasuries have burnished the attractiveness of stocks and other comparatively risky assets for more than two years, helping to underpin the S&P 500’s doubling from its March 2020 lows. Yet they have started to move higher in recent weeks, reflecting the Fed's increasingly hawkish stance. That may signal further trouble ahead for the S&P 500, which is down 5.2% this year. 

The selloff in bonds likely bruised investors who had recently piled into Treasuries, a popular safe haven, as geopolitical uncertainty soared after Russia invaded Ukraine last month. The TLT iShares 20+ year Treasury bond ETF – often used by investors to express views on the government bond market – saw net inflows for the last six weeks, the longest streak in three years. 
Other segments of the market appear to have been positioned for higher yields, however. CFTC data on Treasury futures, which captures positioning by hedge funds and other shorter-term market participants, shows investors have a net short position on 10-year Treasury futures since mid-October.

(Reuters) - Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD) on Friday said Clearstream, one of the world's biggest settlement systems, had informed it that it was blocking its account and waiting for a decision from regulatory authorities in Luxembourg, Interfax reported.
Clearstream and Euroclear are no longer accepting Russian assets, effectively shutting off an exit route for overseas investors.

639,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 04:12AM ET</span>",,,,,,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Tommy Wilkes. 
Even the arch-dove among central banks, the Bank of Japan appears to be getting comfortable with higher interest rates -- a stark sign of policymakers' acceptance that this month's dramatic bond market selloff will not be going into reverse. 
With Japan's long-term inflation expectations and wage growth still muted, the BoJ was always seen as the bank that would act to arrest a rise in yields. But on Friday, it refrained from stepping into the market, even as the 10-year government bond yield rose to a six-year high.
That's above the level at which it had offered to buy an unlimited amount of debt in February. 
Graphic: Japan govt bond yield: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbvgnmoerpq/japan%20yields.PNG 
Japanese borrowing costs are being pulled higher by yields worldwide, which have risen along with expectations for a more aggressive pace of rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks.
Granted, 10-year Japanese yields are only at 0.24%, but that is double the levels of early-March. The bond moves and the BOJ's failure to intervene also helped the yen bounce off six-year lows to the dollar, rising as much as 1% higher at one point
Yields in the U.S. and euro zone have calmed in recent days after soaring this month but remain at multi-year highs -- the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield is up 72 basis points, its biggest monthly rise since 2004.
Markets elsewhere appear set for a mixed day at the end of a week when investors mostly looked past a month of war in Ukraine and bid up share prices, which are back above levels before the war started. 
That's despite recession signals emanating from U.S. bond yield curves and a drumbeat of lacklustre economic data - Britsh February retail sales were worse than expected.
There is little in the way of other important economic data due on Friday and much attention was on the NATO summit in Brussels that aimed to show a united Western front against Russia's month-long invasion of its neighbour.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday: 
-German IFO
-New York President John Williams, Richmond President Thomas Barkin, Governor Christopher Waller speaks

-Norway Central Bank Governor Ida Wolden Bache speaks
-University of Michigan inflation expectations

640,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 03:50AM ET</span>",,,,,,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan needs to closely watch downside economic risks from rapid commodity inflation caused by the war in Ukraine and its disruption to the global energy supplies, the government said in a monthly report on Friday.
The world's third-largest economy has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels as COVID-19 outbreaks and curbs hinder a consumption-led recovery, even before the recent surge in prices.
""As uncertainties around the situation in Ukraine loom, downside risks such as rising raw material prices, fluctuations in financial markets and supply constraints require full attention,"" the government said in its monthly report.
The report kept its main assessment of the economy unchanged from last month, saying its recovery was in progress although some vulnerabilities remained.
One such weakness was the household sector, with the report repeating last month's assessment of private consumption as having stalled, due to prolonged COVID-19 curbs on face-to-face services.
Authorities also said consumer prices in Japan were ""moderately rising"", having described them as ""steady"" over the past seven months' reports.
""We changed the description to the one that simply acknowledges recent price hikes, especially among food items,"" a government official told a media briefing before Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's cabinet approved the report.
Japan's core inflation hit a two-year-high of 0.6% in February, as more companies started to pass on costs to households.
Analysts and policymakers expect core inflation to approach 2% in April on rising energy costs and the waning effect of previous cellphone fee cuts.
In the context of recent spring wage talks and private-sector price forecasts, the report warned of inflation's potential damage to consumers by squeezing their real income.
""The price increase is feared to outpace wage growth, and we must carefully monitor its impact on consumption,"" the official said.
Kishida, who has pledged to protect Japan's economy from soaring costs by pushing wages higher, is expected to instruct the cabinet to draft new economic relief measures next week.

In the March report, authorities raised the assessment of corporate profits on robust fourth-quarter earnings data but cut its view on business conditions given a bleak business survey result from late February.
The government made the first upgrade to its imports assessment in 13 months for an improvement seen in electronics shipments from Asian countries, led by China where production recently rebounded, the report showed. 
 
"
641,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 03:45AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) -Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 sparked sweeping sanctions that ripped the country out of the global financial fabric and sent its economy reeling.
A month on, Russia's currency has lost a large part of its value and its bonds and stocks have been ejected from indexes. Its people are experiencing economic pain that is likely to last for years to come.
Below are five charts showing how the past month has changed Russia's economy and its global standing: 
ECONOMIC PAIN
In 2020, Russia was the world's 11th-largest economy, according to the World Bank. But by the end of this year, it may rank no higher than No. 15, based on the end-February rouble exchange rate, according to Jim O'Neill, the former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist who coined the BRIC acronym to describe the four big emerging economies Brazil, Russia, India and China.
Recession looks inevitable. Economists polled by the central bank predicted an 8% contraction this year and for inflation to reach 20%.
Forecasts from economists outside Russia are even gloomier. The Institute of International Finance predicts a 15% contraction in 2022, followed by a 3% contraction in 2023.
""Altogether, our projections mean that current developments are set to wipe out the economic gains of roughly fifteen years,"" the IIF said in a note. 
INFLATION BUSTING TURNS TO DUST 
Since taking office in 2013, central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina's biggest triumph was curbing inflation from 17% in 2015 to just above 2% in early-2018. As price pressures rose in the post-pandemic months, she defied industrialists by raising interest rates eight months straight.
Nabiullina also resisted calls in 2014-2015 for capital controls to stem outflows following the annexation of Crimea. 
But those achievements have been torn to shreds in less than a month.
Annual price growth has accelerated to 14.5% and should surpass 20%, five times the target. Households' inflation expectations for the year ahead are above 18%, an 11-year high. 
While panic-buying accounts for some of this, rouble weakness may keep price pressures elevated.
With Russia's reserves warchest frozen overseas, Nabiullina was forced to more than double interest rates on Feb. 28 and introduce capital controls. The central bank now expects inflation back at target only in 2024.
INDEX ELIMINATION
Sanctions are forcing index providers to eject Russia from benchmarks used by investors to funnel billions of dollars into emerging markets.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and MSCI are among those that have announced they are removing Russia from their bond and stock indexes respectively.
Russia's standing in these indexes had already taken a hit following the first set of Western sanctions in 2014 and then in 2018, following the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain and investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections.
On March 31, Russia's weighting will be dialled to zero by nearly all major index providers. 
RATINGS RUPTURE
When Russian troops stormed into Ukraine, their country had a coveted ""investment grade"" credit rating with the three major agencies S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch.
That allowed it to borrow relatively cheaply and a sovereign debt default appeared a distant prospect.
In the past four weeks, Russia has suffered the largest cuts ever made to a sovereign credit score. It is now at the bottom of the ratings ladder, flagging an imminent risk of default.
ROUBLE TROUBLE 
A month ago, the rouble's one-year average exchange rate sat at 74 per dollar. Trading on different platforms showed the ample liquidity and tight bid/ask spreads expected for a major emerging market currency.

All that has changed. With the central bank bereft of a large portion of it hard currency reserves, the rouble plunged to record lows of more than 120 per dollar locally. In offshore trade it fell as low as 160 to the greenback.
As liquidity dried up and bid/ask spreads widened, pricing the rouble has become haphazard. The exchange rate is yet to find a balance on- and offshore.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Friday reiterated his view a weak yen benefits the economy as a whole, brushing aside concern the currency's slide to multi-year lows could do more harm than good to the resource-poor, import-reliant country.
Due to structural changes in Japan's economy, the benefit from a weak yen comes more through an increase in the value of profits companies earn overseas, rather than a rise in export volume, Kuroda said.
""There's no change now to my view a weak yen is generally positive for Japan's economy,"" he told parliament.
The yen was headed for its worst week in two years, pummelled by Japan's rising import costs and ultra-low low interest rates. It fell to a fresh multi-year low of 121.84 to the dollar on Friday.
Kuroda said the recent rise in import prices was driven mostly by global commodity inflation, rather than the weak yen.
While consumer prices may accelerate to around the BOJ's 2% target from April, the central bank is in no rush to withdraw stimulus as any increase in inflation must be accompanied by steady rises in wages, jobs and corporate profits, Kuroda said.
""Cost-push inflation that is not accompanied by wage hikes will hurt Japan's economy,"" by weighing on households' real income and profits of import-reliant firms, he said.
""As such, it won't lead to sustained achievement of our price target. That's why the BOJ will continue to maintain powerful monetary easing,"" Kuroda said.
Speaking at the same parliament session, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government will continue to keep a close eye on currency moves, including recent yen declines, and their impact on the economy.
""Exchange-rate stability is important, and sharp volatility is undesirable,"" Suzuki said, repeating his verbal warning against excessive yen declines.
Kuroda also said it was desirable for currency rates to move stably reflecting economic fundamentals.
Such warnings, however, will likely have little effect in reversing a weak-yen trend driven by a hawish Fed, analysts say.
""The more you do it, the less impact it tends to have,"" Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst of Asia Pacific at OANDA, said of the policymakers' jawboning.
Some market players see the yen's decline as a sign of the erosion of the currency's status as a safe-haven.
Recent data showed Japan recorded its second largest current account deficit on record in January as a jump in oil import costs offset gains in investment income, highlighting the economy's vulnerability to commodity swings.

""Up till now, Japan was able to stably issue huge amount of government bonds at low interest rates due to households' massive financial savings and the country's current account surplus,"" finance minister Suzuki said.
""There's no guarantee such market conditions will continue when we look at how energy price moves led to Japan running a current account deficit.""

When Dyson announced the global investment plan in 2020, it said the money would be divided between the company's global head office in Singapore, its two campuses in Wiltshire, southern England, and the Philippines.
On Friday, it launched its new global headquarters in a restored power station in the Southeast Asian city-state, where it plans to hire more than 250 additional engineers and scientists.
The positions will span robotics, machine learning, high-speed electric digital motors, energy storage and more. 
Singapore is a hub for Dyson's research and engineering teams, as well as commercial, advanced manufacturing and supply chain operations. It has more than 1,400 staff in the country, including 560 engineers and scientists. 
Singapore, a low-tax global business centre, has been ramping up efforts to lure technology and research firms.
""This is the future for technology companies - to go wherever talent is available and made welcome,"" its prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, said at the opening of the headquarters.
""It is also the future for Singapore - to welcome companies and talent, which can help make us a hub of new ideas and scientific progress.""
Founded by British entrepreneur James Dyson in the 1990s, the company became a household name from developing sleekly designed products ranging from hand driers and air purifiers to hair care tools and vacuums.
Dyson, a billionaire Brexit supporter, announced plans in 2019 to move his company's head office to Singapore to be closer to its fastest-growing markets, sparking a backlash at home.
The company has other sites in Singapore, including an engineering hub, a motor manufacturing facility and a new battery factory.
Southeast Asia is a major production base for Dyson with Malaysia counting as its second-biggest global hub. 

Last year, Dyson split with its supplier ATA IMS Bhd following an audit of the Malaysian company's labour practices and allegations by a whistleblower. 
ATA made parts for Dyson's vacuum cleaners and air purifiers.

644,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 01:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said stable inflation was needed to trigger policy change at the central bank not yen weakness, in remarks that appeared aimed at cooling speculation of possible stimulus tweaks driven by the sliding currency and signs of heating prices.
Speaking in parliament after the yen breached the 122 mark against the dollar for the first time in more than six years, Kuroda stuck to his view that a weak Japanese currency was positive for the economy overall and his stance that BOJ stimulus must continue.
“I think it’s appropriate for the BOJ to aim for stable, sustainable inflation and keep up current powerful easing tenaciously to prop up the economy recovering from the pandemic,” Kuroda said. 
The current cost-push inflation, driven by higher energy prices, won’t cement inflation above the BOJ’s target of 2% in a stable way, Kuroda said, warning that it could cut disposable household income and corporate earnings and harm the economy.
Data on Friday showed that while inflation in Tokyo increased 0.8% in March from a year ago, the biggest margin in more than two years, energy prices rose 26%, for the fastest gain in 41 years. Nationwide inflation is expected to accelerate toward 2% from April when the effect of cheaper mobile phone fees starts fading out. 
The remarks suggest the governor is continuing to hunker down on his view that the BOJ must keep up its easing measures and that the direct impact for households and the economy of costlier energy require help from elsewhere.
Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said earlier Friday that Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is likely to instruct his government to come up with a fresh economic package next week.

Kuroda’s remarks come as markets explore the policy implications of the yen’s sharp moves.
Economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) say the weaker yen may be a catalyst for the BOJ to tweak its yield curve control framework as the bank needs to respond to the changing environment. 
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA strategist Albert Edwards sees potential for the yen to weaken to around 150 per dollar. The yen was worth around 121.35 per dollar early in the afternoon in Tokyo. 
Back in 2015, the BOJ chief made comments interpreted as defending the yen around the 125 mark, a level that became known as the Kuroda line.

645,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 12:40AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Wall Street analysts and investors who believe the U.S. Fed Reserve has acted too slowly to combat high inflation are now forecasting even more aggressive rate hikes as the central bank catches up.
A source close to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Co CEO Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said he was now predicting 12 to 15 rate hikes - or a cumulative 300 to 375 basis points - in this hiking cycle. That is an increase from the six or seven rate hikes Dimon predicted on the bank's January earnings call. 
It is the latest recalibration among banks and investors since the U.S. central bank last week raised its key lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point and forecast an aggressive path of further increases to counter inflation. That was followed on Monday by Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying the bank must move expeditiously to cut inflation and that it could use bigger-than-usual interest rate hikes if needed.
A parade of Fed officials - including some counted now as policy doves - have come out in Powell's wake to echo the call for prompt, and if necessary, aggressive action on an inflation rate running three times above their target level of 2% annually.
""The Fed has seen the light on inflation ... and thus is essentially admitting to being behind the curve,"" analysts at NatWest said in a research note on Thursday, adding that investors will become ""increasingly concerned about the Fed inducing a recession, and soon.""
Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) moves in the U.S. Treasury market are increasingly pointing to the risk of such a recession scenario, as the markets doubt the Fed's ability to engineer a ""soft landing"" for the economy as it tightens monetary policies.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said on Thursday that it has raised its forecasts on U.S. Treasury yields for this year, citing more broad-based and persistent price pressures and a more hawkish pivot by the Federal Reserve.
The Fed is seen raising rates to 2.4% by February 2023, from 0.25-0.50% now, with the market pricing in a 76.8% probability that the Fed will hike by 50 basis points in May. [FEDWATCH]
""They're way behind,"" said Jeffrey Gundlach, the billionaire chief executive of investment firm DoubleLine Capital, in an interview with CNBC after the Fed hiked rates last week.
He was referring to indicators such as wage growth as well as the rise in yields of two-year Treasury notes, comparing them to the federal funds rate.
That was echoed by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which in a note this week said the Fed could hike rates at every meeting for the foreseeable future, with 50 basis-point hikes likely in the near term. ""The Fed is behind the curve, and will need to hike fast and far to get inflation under control,"" it said.
Capital Group Companies Inc, one of the world's largest investment management companies, weighed in with a note last week saying ""inflation will remain elevated"" and that monetary policy is behind the curve.

For Larry Fink, chief executive and chairman of the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), central banks are facing a dilemma they have not had to deal with for decades - and the Russia-Ukraine war complicates it further.
""Central banks must choose whether to live with higher inflation or slow economic activity and employment to lower inflation quickly,"" he said on Thursday.

The reinstated product exclusions will be effective retroactively from Oct. 12, 2021, and extend through Dec. 31, 2022, USTR said. They cover a wide range of the initially estimated $370 billion worth of Chinese imports that former president Donald Trump hit with punitive tariffs of 7.5% to 25%.
The list released by USTR includes industrial components such as pumps and electric motors, certain car parts and chemicals, backpacks, bicycles, vacuum cleaners and other consumer goods.
A spokeswoman at China's commerce ministry said on Thursday the U.S. decision was beneficial to normalizing the trade flow of those products, and hoped bilateral trade relations would get back on a normal track.
""Amid inflation spikes and challenges to the global economic recovery, we hope the U.S. could scrap all tariffs on Chinese products as soon as possible for the fundamental interests of consumers and producers in China and the U.S.,"" spokeswoman Shu Jueting told reporters.
The Trump administration initially granted more than 2,200 exclusions to the tariffs to provide relief to certain industries and retailers. Most were allowed to expire, but 549 were extended for a year, and these expired at the end of 2020.

U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai last October launched a review of whether to reinstate those 549 exclusions as part of her strategy to confront China on its trade practices.
A series of virtual meetings with her Chinese counterparts since then yielded little improvement in China's performance under Trump's ""Phase 1"" trade agreement with Beijing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Thursday convicted U.S. Congressman Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican from Nebraska, of lying to FBI investigators about illegal contributions to his 2016 re-election campaign.
Following a trial in Los Angeles federal court, the jury found Fortenberry guilty of scheming to falsify and conceal material facts, along with two counts of making false statements to federal investigators.
Prosecutors accused Fortenberry of lying to investigators during two interviews in 2019 about $30,000 in campaign contributions he received in 2016 from Nigerian billionaire Gilbert Chagoury.
Federal law prohibits foreign nationals from donating to federal election campaigns.
Fortenberry's lawyers said he did not mean to mislead FBI agents but was caught off-guard by their interview request and suffered from a faulty memory.
Prosecutors alleged that an associate who hosted a 2016 fundraiser for Fortenberry told him in a 2018 telephone call that the donations in question “probably did come from Gilbert Chagoury"" but were routed through intermediaries to avoid individual donor limits.
According to the U.S. Justice Department, when FBI agents quizzed Fortenberry about the campaign contributions he denied being aware of any illegal donations.
""If we want to expect anyone to follow the law, ultimately it starts with the law-makers,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Mack Jenkins told media outside the courthouse after the verdict was announced. 
""I think that's even more paramount when the investigation itself goes to election integrity.""

Fortenberry, 61, has served in Congress since 2005.
The three felony charges each carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 28 before U.S. District Judge Stanley Blumenfeld in Los Angeles.

650,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 09:31PM ET</span>",,,,,,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico's central bank on Thursday voted to raise its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 6.5%, a decision that was unexpectedly announced hours ahead of schedule by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in a breach of norms.
The president later apologized, saying he thought the decision had already been made public.
The unanimous decision by the Bank of Mexico's five-member board was in line with a Reuters poll of analysts which forecast the bank would set a rate of 6.5%, the seventh hike in a row.
The bank cited tightening global monetary and financial conditions, and the prevailing uncertainty and rising inflationary pressure linked to geopolitical conflict, an apparent reference to the war in Ukraine.
""The balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon has deteriorated and remains biased to the upside,"" the bank said in its policy statement.
Earlier, while speaking about inflation, Lopez Obrador noted the U.S. Federal Reserve had last week raised its key lending rate for the first time since 2018, then said Mexico's central bank had voted to hike its benchmark rate by 50 basis points.
""We're going to have an interest rate of 6.5 (percent),"" he said, speaking at a regular morning news conference. ""The Bank of Mexico took the decision yesterday unanimously, and we respect the Bank of Mexico's autonomy.""
The peso currency extended gains against the dollar after the president made his remarks, and closed on Thursday at its strongest level since late September.
Still, several analysts expressed shock and alarm that the president had revealed the decision early.
Gabriela Siller, an economist at Banco Base, said revealing the rate decision in advance was unprecedented and a ""scandal"" that raised questions about the bank's autonomy.
Galia Borja, one of the Bank of Mexico's board, denied that the president's move would compromise the bank's autonomy and said that it had made its decision completely independently.
Mexico is currently holding its annual banking convention in Acapulco, with top finance officials due to attend, including the new governor of the central bank, Victoria Rodriguez.
The central bank board's policymaking decision, which normally takes place on Wednesday evening, was moved forward a few hours to help with the arrangements for the convention, according to a person familiar with the matter.
While attending the convention on Thursday evening, Lopez Obrador said he thought the bank's decision had already been announced when he spoke in the morning.
""I want to apologize to the governor of the bank and the deputy governors because I received the information last night that they had taken the decision,"" he said.

Mexican policymakers face a delicate balancing act between taming high inflation while not choking off fragile economic growth, which stalled at the end of 2021. The economy ministry has forecast the economy will expand about 2.5% in 2022.
Inflation hit 7.29% in the first half of March, slightly lower than the previous two-week period, but more than double the central bank target rate of 3%. The bank has a one percentage point tolerance range above and below the target.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A sharp sell-off in U.S. Treasuries has increased concerns about low levels of liquidity in the $23.5 trillion market, potentially amplifying losses for investors which already had a dire start to the year.
U.S. government bond yields have spiked this year as the Federal Reserve has sounded more hawkish about how aggressively it will hike interest rates to cool the economy, hitting bond returns. The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA Treasury Index has recorded its worst start to the year in history, down 6%. (Graphic: Bonds bleed- https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-MARKETS/BONDS/klvykjgmovg/chart.png) 
While liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market has been an ongoing issue, traders and investors said there had been particular concerns during this sell-off. 
""People who buy longer-dated Treasuries, such as pensions, central banks and insurance companies, tend to stay away when you have this type of volatility,"" said Ed Al-Hussainy, senior rates and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, adding that liquidity ""is not good"" and that trading big blocks of Treasuries ""has become very difficult."" 
The market for Treasury securities is typically one of the most liquid in the world, and the global financial system uses the instruments as a benchmark for asset classes. But it has seen liquidity issues, such as in late February and early March 2020, when pandemic fears caused market ruptures and liquidity rapidly deteriorated to 2008 crisis levels, prompting the Fed to buy $1.6 trillion of Treasuries to increase stability.
Investors say liquidity concerns this year have not reached the point of threatening market functioning, but concerns have increased for several factors.
One is that the Fed has ceased buying U.S. Treasuries, after ending this month https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220316a1.htm a bond-buying programme aimed at supporting the economy during the coronavirus crisis.
""We are adjusting to that new world where the Fed is not a buyer,"" Al-Hussainy said. 
Some investors are also concerned that wild price swings in the commodities markets due to the Ukraine crisis and sanctions on Russia, a commodities export giant, could create pockets of illiquidity in the financial system.
""There's a lot of correlation risks that are out there that I think have reduced balance sheet availability for the system at large, so even Treasuries get impacted by that,"" said George Goncalves, head of U.S. Macro Strategy at MUFG.
""There's a reduction in balance sheet capacity because people are de-risking, and when you start to really delve into it, you start to think that there's knock-on effects that reduce not only risk appetite but also the ability to trade,"" he said.
Some measures of liquidity have shown stress. 
Bid-ask spreads -- a commonly used indicator of liquidity -- widened significantly in March on short-term Treasury notes, Refinitiv data showed.
Data from CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) showed order book liquidity for Treasuries has declined since Feb. 24, when Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, and volatility has increased. 
Cash contracts volume in terms of the daily average top of the book bid/ask quantity for five-year Treasuries declined to $10 million in March from about $25 million in February.
For the benchmark 10-year notes, order book liquidity went down to an average of $14 million in March from about $20 million in Feb. 
Relative volumes, however, remained unchanged on a month-on-month basis.
Steven Schweitzer, senior fixed income portfolio manager with the Swarthmore Group, said he had seen a ""pretty big disconnect"" on the short end of the U.S. Treasury curve earlier this month - in a reminder of the lack of liquidity seen in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
""Bonds and credit are the lubricant for the economy, and when you get the short end drying up, that's a very big warning sign for us,"" he said.
The weakness in bonds this week came after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday the U.S. central bank must move quickly to counter too-high inflation and that it could use bigger-than-usual interest rate hikes if needed.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields jumped to 2.296% on Monday from 2.153% on Friday, and two-year notes spiked to 2.117% from 1.942%, compressing the gap between the yields of those two maturities - a sign that the market is anticipating a sharp economic slowdown.
With a Fed sounding increasingly determined to fight inflation despite the risk that tighter monetary policy may slow growth, there is less support for buying Treasuries, therefore sell-offs find little counteraction to offset them, some investors said.
Expecting higher yields had become a consensus trade, investors said.

""People are probably on the right side of that trade now,"" said Matthew Nest, global head of active fixed income,  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. 
""The next pain trade is when and if yields go back down,"" he added. (This story corrects 10-year yield in paragraph 21 to 2.296%, not 2.969%)

The ECB said earlier this month its would end its bond-buying stimulus scheme this summer and raise interest rates for the first time in over a decade some time after that, as it comes to grips with a sudden rise in inflation.
Schnabel, the most hawkish of the six board members who run the ECB, said the central bank had ""left the door ajar"" in case events took a turn for the worse for the euro zone, which is highly dependent on Russian gas and other raw materials.
""If we now fall into a deep recession due to the Ukraine crisis, we'll have to rethink that,"" she told a German web show.
""Otherwise, we'll end the bond purchases in the third quarter and as soon as we've done that we can raise rates at any time depending on how inflation develops.""
Estonian central bank governor Madis Mueller, another hawk on the ECB's policy-making Governing Council, said in a Politico interview the ECB would only extend its Asset Purchase Programme if there was ""a dramatic shift"" in the inflation outlook.
His Portuguese peer Mario Centeno, a dove, cautioned the ""normalisation of the ECB's monetary policy will be carried out gradually and proportionally at the end of this year"".

The ECB has said it expects the euro zone's economy to expand by 3.7% this year and would still grow even if stricter sanctions were imposed on Russia or supply dried up and financial markets seized up.
The central bank for the 19 countries that share the euro sees inflation above or at its 2% target this year and the next under any scenario.

LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Police in Britain have arrested seven people following a series of hacks by the Lapsus$ hacking group which targeted major firms including Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) Inc and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), City of London Police said on Thursday.
San Francisco-based  Okta Inc , whose authentication services are used by some of the world's biggest companies to provide access to their networks, said on Tuesday it had been hit by hackers and some customers may have been affected.
""The City of London Police has been conducting an investigation with its partners into members of a hacking group,"" Detective Inspector Michael O'Sullivan said in an emailed statement in response to a question about the Lapsus$ hacking group.
The ransom-seeking gang had posted a series of screenshots of Okta's internal communications on their Telegram channel late on Monday.
""Seven people between the ages of 16 and 21 have been arrested in connection with this investigation and have all been released under investigation,"" O'Sullivan said.
News of the digital breach had knocked Okta shares down about 11 percent amid criticism of the digital authentication firm's slow response to the intrusion.
Shares of Okta were trading down 4.8% on Thursday.
City of London Police did not directly name Lapsus$ in its statement. A spokeswoman said none of the seven people arrested had been formally charged, pending investigation.
WHO ARE LAPSUS$?
Last month, Lapsus$ leaked proprietary information about U.S. chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp to the Web.
More recently the group has purported to have leaked source code from several big tech firms, including Microsoft, which on Tuesday confirmed that one of its accounts had been compromised.
Lapsus$ have not responded to repeated requests for comment on their Telegram channel and by email.
A teenager living near Oxford, England, is suspected of being behind some of the more notable attacks, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.
Reached by phone, the father of the teenager - who cannot be named because they are a minor - declined to comment. Reuters confirmed that cybersecurity researchers investigating Lapsus$ believe the teenager was involved in the group, according to three people familiar with the matter.
In a blog post on Thursday, Unit 42, a research team at Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), described Lapsus$ as an ""attack group"" motivated by notoriety rather than financial gain.
Unlike other groups, they do not rely on the deployment of ransomware - malicious software to encrypt their victims' networks, a hallmark of digital extortionists - and instead manually lay waste to their targets' networks.
Along with Unit 221b, a separate security consultancy, the Palo Alto researchers said they had identified the ""primary actor"" behind Lapsus$ in 2021 and had been ""assisting law enforcement in their efforts to prosecute this group"".

""The teenager we identified as being in control of Lapsus$ is particularly instrumental,"" Allison Nixon, chief research officer at Unit 221b, told Reuters.
""Not just for their leadership role, but for the vital intel they must possess on other members"".

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday said that China knows its economic future is tied to the West, after warning Chinese leader Xi Jinping that Beijing could regret siding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""I made no threats but I made it clear to him - made sure he understood the consequences of helping Russia,"" Biden told reporters of his call on Friday with Xi.
""I pointed out the number of American and foreign corporations that left Russia as a consequence of their barbaric behavior.""
The Biden administration has been pressuring China to refrain from supporting Russia including by helping it counter Western sanctions and providing military assistance.
China has not condemned Russia's action in Ukraine, though it has expressed deep concern about the war as well as about Western sanctions, which it regards as counter-productive and unilateral.
Biden's comments pointed to the economic interdependence of China and the United States, its largest trading partner. 
That is leverage Washington wants to use to nudge China away from Russia after the two countries touted a ""no limits"" strategic partnership in February. But any sanctions or other counter-measures against Beijing would have spillover effects for the U.S. economy, too, experts say.

Still, there are already signs that the Sino-Russian relationship may be hurting foreign investment in China, including significant capital flows from the country since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, according to the Institute of International Finance.
""China understands that its economic future is much more closely tied to the West than it is to Russia,"" Biden told a news conference on the sidelines of emergency meetings in Europe about the Ukraine war.

The investment bank now expects benchmark 10-year yields to rise to 2.7% by year-end, up from its previous forecast of 2.25%. It also expects two-year yields to rise to 2.9% and 3.15% at year-end 2022 and 2023, respectively.
For 30-year bonds, the bank expects a more gradual increase, with the yields likely to end 2022 at 2.75%.
Goldman also expects the yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes to invert modestly by year-end, but said that should not necessarily be taken as an indicator that a recession is likely to follow. 

“The nominal curve tends to invert more easily in a high inflation environment, and we could see earlier and/or deeper curve inversions this cycle. In such an environment, a deeper nominal curve inversion may be needed to produce the same recession odds in models as seen in more recent business cycles,” Goldman said.
Risks to Goldman's view include if the war in Ukraine deescalates or if inflation is more persistent, which could lead to even higher yields, while the opposite scenario could result in lower yields, the bank said.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -South Africa is close to reaching a five-year target for new investment, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Thursday as he sought to drum up further backing for the pandemic hobbled economy.
In 2018 soon after coming to power, Ramaphosa set a goal to raise 1.4 trillion rand - or around $100 billion at the exchange rate at the time - to revitalise Africa's most developed economy following repeated recessions and years of anaemic growth. 
The global pandemic, which temporarily shuttered swathes of the economy and helped push unemployment rates to record levels, has complicated those efforts. But speaking to an investment conference in Johannesburg, Ramaphosa said South Africa nonetheless remained an attractive investment destination.
""You see opportunities in this country. You see beyond the difficulties and the challenges,"" he told investors. ""Your investments are making a difference in our country and our local communities.""
The conference, which in part aims to sell foreign companies on South Africa's potential, brought in a total of 332 billion rand ($22.83 billion), bringing the total of new investment since 2018 to 1.14 trillion rand. 
""We've now reached 95% of the ambitious target we set ourselves four years ago,"" Ramaphosa said.
MANUFACTURING, MINING, VACCINES
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co has committed 16.4 billion rand that would enable it to produce its next generation Ranger pick-up in South Africa. 
Mining companies, which were benefiting from favourable market conditions even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent prices soaring, are also boosting their South African operations.
 Anglo American  (LON:AAL) plans to expand an existing 100 billion rand investment to put an additional 10 billion rand into the country this year. And Impala Platinum (OTC:IMPUY) pledged 11.8 billion rand to develop new mining and processing capacity.
With the pandemic, South Africa has sought to position itself as a vaccine manufacturing hub for the vastly underserved African continent, attracting investment from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and South Africa's Biovac Institute and Aspen Pharmacare (OTC:APNHY). 
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) meanwhile is investing 929 million rand for television and film production in South Africa's Gauteng and Western Cape provinces.
The African Development Bank (AfDB) is committing $2.8 billion over the next five years to support private sector investment in agriculture, renewable energy, transport, youth employment, health and vaccine manufacturing. 

The bank is already supporting South Africa's struggling state-owned companies, and is currently preparing a $400 million loan package to assist coal-dependent power utility Eskom's transition to renewable energy.

""With housing costs gaining an ever-larger weight in the inflation Americans experience, I will be looking even more closely at real estate to judge the appropriate stance of monetary policy,"" Waller said in prepared remarks for a webinar on housing organized by Tel Aviv University and Rutgers University.
He noted that real estate comprises a big share of key inflation gauges as well as making a sizeable contribution to gross domestic product. Measures of market rent have risen more than 6.5% over the past two years while house prices are up a cumulative 35% since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Zillow Home Value Index.
Waller also said he hoped some pandemic-specific factors pushing up home prices and rents would ease in the next year or so, but cautioned that overall rising costs in the ""red-hot"" housing market are due to demand far exceeding supply and are not fueled by excessive leverage or easy lending. 
The Fed's more aggressive posture towards inflation is already having a substantial effect on consumer borrowing costs, which could help to rein in some of the homebuying frenzy.
""We're just trying to eliminate some of the excess demand in housing,"" Waller said about the Fed's plans to raise its benchmark short-term interest rate to almost 2% this year.
Interest rates on the most popular U.S. home loan - the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage - shooting to a three-year high of 4.5% last week, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data.
Mortgage rates have climbed by 1.17 percentage points since the start of the year, their fastest increase since the summer of 2003.
Waller did not specifically address the general U.S. economic outlook or monetary policy in his speech. In an interview last week, Waller said economic data suggests the central bank should do a bigger interest rate hike in the next two policy meetings to begin to tame inflation, which at above 6% is more than three times the Fed's target.
Only economic uncertainty caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine prevented Waller from supporting the larger half-percentage-point increase he had been advocating for ahead of the Fed's last policy meeting.

Fed policymakers raised the benchmark overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point from the near-zero level on March 16 as they began to close the chapter on loose monetary policy measures put in place to bolster the economy through the pandemic. 
But since then, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and several other central bank policymakers have indicated an increasing willingness to raise rates by 50 basis points when they gather again on May 3-4, at which time they may also begin to reduce the Fed's nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.

(Reuters) -The Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates ""in a timely fashion"" this year and in 2023 to curb high inflation before it is embedded in U.S. psychology and becomes even harder to get rid of, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Thursday.
But Evans also said the U.S. central bank should tread carefully as it tightens monetary policy in the face of price pressures that have pushed inflation to a 40-year high. 
""I just think that we want to be careful"" not to raise interest rates too abruptly, and instead take the time to assess whether supply chains are improving and how the war in Ukraine is affecting the economy, he told the Detroit Regional Chamber. 
Evans spoke a few days after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there was nothing that would necessarily stop the Fed from raising interest rates by 50 basis points at its next meeting, after its first quarter-percentage-point rate hike last week, to get a better edge against inflation.
""My own view is that, given the pressures that I see, I will be comfortable with ... increasing by a quarter (of a percentage point)"" at each policy meeting this year, and through March of next year, Evans said. ""Maybe a 50 helps - I'm open-minded about that,"" he said, adding that the larger discussion will be around what to do once the Fed's policy rate reaches the neutral level at which it neither brakes nor stimulates the economy. 
The economy has momentum, labor markets are ""downright tight"" by some measures, and rapidly rising inflation sparked by pandemic-related factors is now showing up broadly across the economy, Evans said. 
""This is a signal of more general pressure from aggregate demand on today's impinged supply,"" Evans said. ""If monetary policy did not respond to these broader pressures, we would see higher inflation become embedded in inflation expectations, and we would have even harder work to do to rein it in.""
Data released earlier on Thursday showed just how tight the U.S. job market is, with the Labor Department reporting that new filings for unemployment benefits had fallen last week to the lowest level since September 1969. In the prior week, the total number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits after their initial claim was the lowest since January 1970, when the labor force was half the size it is today.
Fed policymakers as a group signaled last week they expect to raise the benchmark overnight interest rate by the equivalent of seven quarter-percentage-point rate hikes this year and three more times next year, a view Evans said on Thursday he shares. 
Those actions, along with reductions in the Fed's balance sheet, will help bring inflation down closer to the central bank's 2% target over coming years, he said. Inflation by the Fed's preferred measure is running at about 6%.

Much remains uncertain, Evans noted, particularly with the Ukraine crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic both posing unknown upsides risks to inflation and downside risks to economic growth. 
""Policymakers need to be cautious, humble, and nimble as we navigate the course ahead,"" Evans said. ""Monetary policy is not on a preset course"" but will be decided at each Fed meeting, taking economic data, financial conditions, and risks into account.

662,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 10:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden plans to request $813.3 billion in national security spending -- including $773 billion for the Pentagon -- in the federal budget he will send to Congress  on Monday, according to officials familiar with the plan.
It’s an increase of $31 billion, or 4%, from approved spending for the current fiscal year and about $43 billion more than the White House budget office had projected a year ago for fiscal 2023.
The full national security budget includes spending for the Defense Department, the Energy Department’s nuclear weapons and the FBI’s national security functions. The officials familiar with the budget plan asked not to be identified before its release.
The budget reflects the increasing military challenge from China and the development of costly new defense systems -- from upgrading the nation’s aging nuclear arsenal to development of new hypersonic weapons. It was completed with an expectation that Russia was likely to invade Ukraine and some defense spending was shifted accordingly. Support in Congress is likely to be buoyed by the added challenge of confronting Russia.
The request will include $130.1 billion for research and development --the Pentagon’s largest-ever request in that category -- that will be steered to categories such as accelerated research into hypersonics and artificial intelligence. That’s about $15.6 billion more than the budget office had projected last year.
A White House official who was granted anonymity to discuss the spending plan, said it marked one of the biggest national security investments in American history that would strengthen U.S. allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific and provide assistance to Ukraine.
The administration requested $145.9 billion for procurement, about $9.4 billion more than projected last year. Among items on the to-buy list:  61 F-35 jet fighters from  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT)., fewer than previously planned, as well as initial procurement of the B-21 bomber from  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC). and two Virginia-class submarines from General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD). and Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) Industries Corp. 
The budget request will also call for as much as $548 million in improvements to the nuclear submarine industrial base.
The national security request typically constitutes about half of the entire discretionary federal budget that’s approved by Congress. The White House has yet to release either its National Security Strategy or the Pentagon-generated National Defense Strategy that are supposed to outline the strategic rationale for the spending.
Biden signed into law $782 billion for national defense activities in the current year, a $32.5 billion increase over fiscal 2021 levels. Out of that the Pentagon’s discretionary spending slice is $728.5 billion. 
Inflation Concern
There’s continued willingness both among Republicans and some key Democrats to increase defense spending. 
“Congress almost certainly will further increase the Pentagon’s budget due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, concerns about China and the military balance in the Indo-Pacific, and inflation,” said Stacie Pettyjohn, senior fellow and director of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security. She said inflation will affect all of the defense budget, particularly personnel costs, “which are at a historic high despite the fact that the force has been shrinking.”
Republican members of the House and Senate Armed Services panels -- led by Representative Mike Rogers (NYSE:ROG) of Alabama and Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma--have been pressing Biden to request a national security budget for 2023 that would account for inflation plus an additional 5% over the $782 billion enacted for this year.
While inflation most immediately eats into fuel and military pay and benefits, it also affects weapons procurement contracts.
“While the higher number for defense this year over last year’s projections recognizes the problem of inflation, it still creates a problem for the Hill in that it is not enough,” said MacKenzie Eaglen, a defense budget expert with the American Enterprise Institute. “If the president’s defense budget for 2023 fails to keep pace with inflation and does not even grow at the levels seen in the recently passed omnibus spending bill for 2022,” Congress will insist on larger increases, she said in an email.

663,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 10:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans refrained from any signal that he wants to raise interest rates by half a percentage point, after some of his colleagues specified that readiness in recent days.
“My own viewpoint is in line with the median assessment” of Fed officials’ projections released earlier this month, Evans said in a prepared remarks Thursday to the Detroit Regional Chamber. He noted that the median call was for seven quarter-point moves for all of 2022, with the policy rate moving up to 2.75% to 3% by the end of next year.
Evans is not a voting member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year.
Investors have boosted bets on a half-point move at the FOMC’s May 3-4 meeting, after Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that the central bank was prepared to take such a step if necessary to control the hottest price pressures in four decades.
“Policymakers need to be cautious, humble, and nimble as we navigate the course ahead,” Evans said Thursday. “Monetary policy is not on a preset course.”
Not 1980s
Fed officials raised rates by a quarter point last week for the first increase since 2018, bringing the benchmark to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%.
Evans drew a distinction between the high inflation of the 1980s and that of today. While “overly accommodative monetary policy” in the 1960s and 1970s contributed to a buildup of long-term inflation expectations, the current surge in prices “largely reflects real supply shocks and weakened supply chains and logistics in the face of strong, outsized demand for goods and diminished labor force participation.”
“A shift in demand back toward services, an increase in supply in response to higher relative prices and wages, and adjustments in business models to adapt to the evolving environment will eventually alleviate many of the supply-side pressures we face today,” the Chicago Fed chief said.
Even so, the Fed needs to act, Evans said: “If monetary policy did not respond to these broader pressures, we would see higher inflation become embedded in inflation expectations, and we would have even harder work to do to rein it in.”

(Reuters) -Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari on Thursday said he has penciled in seven quarter-point interest rate hikes this year to help rein in high inflation, but warned against going too far.
""We need to adjust,"" Kashkari told the Fargo-Moorhead Chamber of Commerce's Midwest Economic Outlook Summit, because inflation is not proving as temporary as he had thought it would be. ""The data just keeps coming in in that direction, and we just have to respond.""
The Fed raised rates last week, pivoting from policy that boosted the economy to an inflation-fighting stance, and signaled a rate-hike path that would bring its benchmark overnight interest rate to 1.9% this year and higher next year. As recently as September, Kashkari thought the Fed would not need to raise rates at all this year.
He was, however, cool to the idea that the Fed should raise interest rates faster, as a few of his colleagues in recent days have said they want. 
""There's a danger to overdoing it,"" he said, if pandemic-snarled supply chains get fixed faster than expected, or workers return to the labor force in bigger numbers. ""We're going to get information."" 

In addition, he said, mortgage rates and other borrowing costs have already moved up quite a lot in anticipation of the Fed's rate hikes. 
Kashkari said he believes the neutral interest rate level -- where borrowing costs are neither braking nor bolstering growth -- is about 2%, lower than the 2.4% seen by most of his colleagues.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England on Thursday began sketching out Britain's first regulatory framework for cryptoassets, saying that although the sector remained small, its rapid growth could pose risks to financial stability in future if left unregulated.
Cryptoassets have come under the regulatory spotlight amid concerns they could be used to circumvent financial sanctions imposed on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine.
""While cryptoassets are unlikely to provide a feasible way to circumvent sanctions at scale currently, the possibility of such behaviour underscores the importance of ensuring innovation in cryptoassets is accompanied by effective public policy frameworks to... maintain broader trust and integrity in the financial system,"" the BoE's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) said in a statement https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-in-focus/2022/march-2022 on Thursday.
Cryptoassets, such as bitcoin and ether, are largely unregulated as they fall outside the regulatory 'perimeter' and a change of law would be needed to bring them under the full scope of UK securities rules, a step Britain's finance ministry is looking at.
""This would likely require the expansion of the role of existing macro and microprudential, conduct, and market integrity regulators, and close co-ordination amongst them,"" the FPC said.
The FPC said direct risks to financial stability from crypto were currently limited, but if the recent pace of growth is maintained, there would be risks in future.
The sector globally grew tenfold between early 2020 and November 2021, and now stands at $1.7 trillion or 0.4% of global financial assets, with over 17,000 different cryptoasset tokens in circulation.
Regulation for the sector should be based on ""equivalence"", meaning that crypto-related financial services that perform a similar function to existing financial services should be subject to the same laws, the FPC said.
Until cryptoassets are brought fully under the regulatory net, the BoE is focusing on ensuring that risks from crypto are controlled in the banking sector. The Financial Conduct Authority on Thursday told firms they must fully explain to consumers the risks from unregulated crypto.
Regulators across the world are also trying to grapple with cryptoassets and their offshoots. 
STABLECOIN CONDITIONS
BoE Deputy Governor Sam Woods wrote https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/letter/2022/march/existing-or-planned-exposure-to-cryptoassests to lenders on Thursday, noting increasing interest from banks and investment firms in the sector.
Risks from crypto should be ""considered fully"" by the boards of banks and they would likely need to adapt their existing risk management strategies and systems, Woods told them.
""We would also expect firms to discuss the proposed prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures with their supervisors,"" Woods said in reference to the amount of capital needed to cover any losses.
The BoE launched a survey of banks' existing exposures and future crypto plans, setting a June 3 deadline for responses.
Stablecoins, which are backed by assets or cash, that became systemically important would need to be backed by high-quality, liquid assets and loss-absorbing capital similar to that held by banks, the FPC said.

Using deposits with commercial banks to provide backing for stablecoins would pose significant financial stability risks if pursued at scale, the FPC said.
The BoE and the Financial Conduct Authority will carry out further work on rules for stablecoins and consult on a regulatory ""model"" for systemic stablecoins in 2023, the FPC said.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank will take ""all necessary measures"" to tackle higher prices in Switzerland, SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan said on Thursday, indicating a shift in tone at the central bank that for years has battled to tame the strong Swiss franc.
The SNB doubled its inflation forecast for this year, citing higher energy costs, production bottlenecks and the Ukraine war.
It now sees 2022 inflation at 2.1%, lower than in many countries but still exceeding its target for limiting annual price increases to 0-2%.
Unlike the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, the SNB held off hiking interest rates, sticking with the world's lowest interest rate of minus 0.75% as expected.
Certainly, Switzerland's relatively tame inflation rate gives the SNB some flexibility.
Still, Jordan said the central bank was determined to control inflation, indicating potential readiness to shift from the ultra-expansive monetary course pursued over the last seven years.
""We are not at all powerless, we look at these inflation forecasts and we will take all necessary measures in order to maintain price stability over the medium to long term,"" Jordan told journalists.
The SNB steers monetary conditions via the franc's exchange rate and interest rates, and would adjust tools if necessary, he added.
The franc strengthened versus the euro after the SNB's announcement, with the EUR/CHF exchange rate reaching 1.0213 at one point, its highest valuation since March 14.
""We are in the business of that for a very long time and if necessary we have to adjust those monetary conditions so inflation remains or returns to the range of price stability.
""We also have to look we do not fall into a situation where we have the opposite problem where inflation becomes too low.""
The franc strengthened as the market interpreted the SNB's comments to mean the bank could cope with the currency's current strength, indicating it may intervene less in future to weaken the currency.
Economists said the higher inflation forecasts and Jordan's comments indicated a more flexible approach at the SNB.
""Jordan's comments ... carry a hint of hawkishness and seems to me to be preparing the grounds for days when the SNB no longer maintains the status quo as a matter of course,"" said David Oxley at Capital Economics.
""The end of its prolonged period of policy stasis is drawing closer.""
With the SNB forecasting inflation of 0.9% in both 2023 and 2024, the central bank also had to prevent the country falling into deflation, said Karsten Junius, an economist at J.Safra Sarasin.
""The SNB has to monitor risks to its definition of price stability on both sides,"" Junius said. ""It therefore has to indicate that it stands ready to adjust its policy in both directions.""
While keeping policy unchanged, the SNB retained its description of the franc as ""highly valued"", despite the currency recently hitting its highest level against the euro in seven years.
Jordan said the SNB did not have a particular ""pain threshold"" for the franc's valuation, which was being driven by higher inflation abroad as well as the franc's safe-haven status.
The franc's strength also helps Switzerland overcome rising inflation by making imports cheaper, he said.

Many analysts expect the SNB to wait for the European Central Bank to raise rates before starting its own round of hikes, although Jordan stressed Switzerland's independence.
""We never wait for another central bank, we make monetary policy with the goal of maintaining price stability,"" he said.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Switzerland has frozen around 5.75 billion Swiss francs ($6.17 billion) worth of Russian assets covered by sanctions, and that amount is likely to rise, a government official said on Thursday.
""Today, for the first time, I can give you an indication of the amount of frozen funds. To date, SECO has been notified of funds and assets totalling around 5.750 billion Swiss francs,"" said Erwin Bollinger, a senior official at the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) agency overseeing sanctions.
That included a number of properties in cantons which served as tourism resorts, he told a news conference in Bern.
SECO had until now declined to estimate the extent of assets frozen or potentially subject to sanctions since the neutral country began adopting European Union sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
""The cited number of far over 5 billion francs relates to a snapshot in time,"" Bollinger noted. ""With further reports coming in and potential additions to EU sanctions lists, which Switzerland would also assume, it is likely this number will rise further.""
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has heaped pressure on Switzerland -- a popular destination for Moscow's elite and a holding place for Russian wealth -- to more quickly identify and freeze assets of hundreds of sanctioned Russians.
Its banks hold up to $213 billion of Russian wealth, Switzerland's bank lobby estimates.
However, actually finding assets to freeze is a bureaucratic headache. 
SECO has faced criticism for being underprepared and understaffed to handle the reports swamping the agency, even as journalists quiz officials over further assets likely slipping through the cracks.
""We can't just go on a fishing expedition and collect material from every government department,"" Bollinger said.
""It's the same as in road traffic: there are rules that have to be followed, even without a police officer standing at every traffic light.""
Regional officials have expressed confusion over implementing the sanctions, pointing to a lack of clear directives. Bollinger acknowledged improvements could be made.
Banks are combing through records to ensure no one under sanctions slips through the cracks.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), for instance, has sought permission to let 20 compliance staff work nights, weekends and holidays.
Bollinger cautioned against assuming that the hundreds of billions of Russian wealth parked in Switzerland was all subject to sanctions.

""Not every sanctioned individual or entity has assets in Switzerland,"" he said. ""And, on the other hand, not every Russian who holds assets in Switzerland is simultaneously on the sanctions lists.""

668,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 07:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will tighten banks' access to its liquidity from July by phasing out exceptionally easy collateral rules introduced at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the ECB said on Thursday.
The move marks another step towards ending the extraordinary support measures the bank deployed to cushion the economic impact of COVID-19. The ECB has already wound down a massive money-printing scheme and opened the door to its first interest rate hike in a decade.
In a sign of continued support for the euro zone's weakest members, however, the ECB will continue to let banks post Greek government bonds as collateral despite their junk-credit rating and said it reserved the right to do so whenever it sees fit.
Under the decision, the ECB will gradually remove measures that have allowed banks borrow more easily from the central bank, including at a time of high market stress in the spring of 2020, by mobilising additional collateral worth 240 billion.
It will start in July by no longer accepting ""fallen angels"", or bonds that have lost their investment-grade rating during the pandemic, and increasing certain ""haircuts"", or valuation discounts, on the loans that banks post as collateral.
The process will end in December 2024 when the last tranche of the ECB's latest multi-year loans, another plank of its pandemic-response, is repaid. 
""This gradual phasing out allows ample time for the Eurosystem’s counterparties to adapt,"" the ECB said in a statement.
The ECB also reaffirmed a waiver on Greek government bonds for as long as it keeps investing the proceeds from its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP).

In a hopeful sign for other countries with lower credit ratings, such as Cyprus, Portugal or Italy, the ECB added that it may disregard agencies' ratings again in the future.
""The ECB’s Governing Council reserves the right to deviate also in the future from credit rating agencies’ ratings if warranted,"" the ECB said.

""We had a very small amount of assets related to Russia. In the meantime, we could sell most of those assets so that the exposure to Russia-related assets is close to zero,"" Thomas Jordan told reporters on a call following the central bank's decision to keep rates on hold.
He also said he did not believe the Russian invasion of Ukraine was a problem for the stability of Switzerland's financial sector. 
""The exposure of the Swiss financial sector to Russia is rather limited so the war itself has only a limited impact on banks or financial institutions in Switzerland,"" Jordan said.
If the war changed the global economy completely, there could be a negative impact on Switzerland, but so far the impact was ""very small, very limited"".
Jordan said the SNB did not have a business relationship with the Russian central bank and did not hold rouble reserves.

""I assume that the commercial banks would mostly be responsible if the situation made it necessary to provide roubles to the economy, not the central bank,"" he said in answer to a question.

Investing.com -- A veritable orgy of diplomacy is taking place in Brussels, with the West trying to coordinate an increase in pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin through NATO, the G7 and the EU. U.S. President Joe Biden will attend all three meetings, pressing for a more complete break with Russian energy purchases. Germany joined Europe's other large economies in cutting fuel duties to support demand. Russia's stock market reopened with a dead-cat bounce after three weeks, thanks to buying by the sovereign wealth fund. The ruble also gained as Putin demanded that hostile states pay for their energy in rubles, rather than dollars. In the U.S., durable goods and jobless claims are due, along with more Fed-speak. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 24th March.
1. West seeks a path to more pressure on Putin 
Western leaders meet in an effort to raise the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine.
In three summits in Brussels in the course of the day, NATO leaders are expected to announce plans to double the alliance’s forces on its eastern flank, while the G7 will warn Putin against using chemical and biological weapons to make up for the shortcomings of his conventional forces, which NATO estimates have 40,000 soldiers killed, wounded, missing or taken prisoner in the month since the invasion.
The focus, however, will be on the last of the three meetings, an EU summit which will also be attended by U.S. President Joe Biden. Biden and most EU leaders will be pressing to close the loopholes that currently allow Europe to continue buying Russian energy. Doing so would immediately increase the economic pressure on Russia, but would also likely trigger a recession, according to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
2. Russia reopens and the ruble strengthens
Russia’s stock market reopened for business for the first time in nearly a month. Trading was restricted to just under three dozen stocks and was dominated by purchases by Russia’s sovereign wealth fund.
The ruble-based MOEX Russia index rose by 5.1% but is still down by over 50% since October 2021, when Putin started to ramp up his pressure on Ukraine.
At the same time, the official ruble rate strengthened to under 100 to the dollar, supported by Putin’s demand on Wednesday that ‘hostile’ countries should pay for their Russian oil and gas with rubles rather than dollars or euros.
The demand will have little effect on overall foreign demand for rubles, because Russian oil and gas exporters already use their export proceeds to buy rubles to pay taxes and wages. However, it would force European buyers to transact with the Central Bank, whose foreign reserves have been frozen by previous sanctions measures.
3. Stocks set to open higher, watching for summit outcomes; FactSet, Darden results due
U.S. stock markets are set to open a little higher later, although major moves seem unlikely before the outcome of the diplomatic meetings in Brussels is known.
By 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 97 points, or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.5%.  All three indices had succumbed to profit-taking on Wednesday, each falling around 1.3% after a week of strong gains.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Boeing (NYSE:BA), after the acquittal of a pilot who was on trial for misleading air safety regulators over the safety of the 737 MAX. Officials investigating the crash of China Eastern's (NYSE:CEA) MU5375 flight earlier this week, meanwhile, said that the recovered flight recorder was damaged, raising the prospect of a slow dribble of news about what caused the crash.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock will also draw attention, after Boston Consulting Group sued it in an attempt to recoup $30 million in allegedly unpaid fees.  Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) and FactSet report earnings before the open.
4. Durable goods, jobless claims - and more Fed-speak
The data calendar meanwhile is dominated by durable goods data for February and the weekly jobless claims numbers.
Growth in core durable goods purchases is expected to have slowed for a third straight month, while initial jobless claims are expected to inch down by a couple of thousand from last week’s 214,000.
There will also be plenty of speeches from Federal Reserve officials: St Louis’ James Bullard, Chicago’s Charles Evans and Governor Chris Waller are all due to speak in the course of the day, as increasing talk of the need to step up the pace of monetary tightening continues to hurt bond markets. The 10-Year benchmark Treasury yield is back at 2.38% after dipping as low as 2.29% overnight.
In Europe, meanwhile, regional purchasing manager indices – the first surveys to include reactions to the invasion of Ukraine - turned out better than expected, showing the Eurozone’s biggest economies continued on their post-pandemic recovery path in March. At a corporate level, however, French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) and U.K. retailer Next both fell after Ukraine-related profit warnings, while Nestle said it will stop selling most of its popular brands in Russia.
5. Oil edges higher as Germany falls into line on tax cuts
Crude oil prices edged higher, still in holding mode along with other risk assets as the day’s summit meetings come and go.
Prices eased a little overnight amid further signs that both China and India – two of the world’s biggest importers – are making progress in schemes to circumvent Western sanctions.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 0.1% at $115.09 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 0.2% at $121.88 a barrel.
In Europe, Germany followed the U.K., France and Italy in announcing big cuts to fuel duties in order to sustain demand, against a backdrop of record high prices for gasoline and diesel.",,,,,

LONDON (Reuters) - New York has extended its lead among the world's top financial centres, with runner up London losing ground to increasingly competitive rivals in the United States and Asia, the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) showed on Thursday.
The index from think tank Z/Yen Group in partnership with the China Development Institute showed the U.S. financial capital holding the top spot with 759 points, down 3 points from six months ago.
Rankings are based on surveys and 150 factors, with quantitative measures from the World Bank, The Economist Intelligence Unit, the OECD and United Nations.
London held on to second place despite shedding 14 points to 726. A similar fall next time would put it behind Hong Kong, Shanghai and Los Angeles, and on par with Singapore, based on their current performances (see table). 
London is now the only European centre in the top 10 after Shenzhen replaced Paris in 10th place.
GFCI said Russia's invasion of Ukraine would affect future rankings for Moscow and St Petersburg, which are likely to fall after coming in at 50th and 110th, respectively, this time.

London's ranking has become closely watched since Britain's departure from the European Union, which largely cut off the UK financial sector from the bloc.
In GFCI's index of fintech ratings, a sector Britain is prioritising in its push to keep London attractive, New York and Shanghai retained first and second positions respectively, while Beijing and San Francisco overtook London to take third and fourth places.
Brexit led to calls from banks for Britain to bolster the capital's competitiveness, with listing rules already eased. 

The UK finance ministry plans to give regulators a formal competitiveness remit, though keeping banks safe, consumers protected and markets orderly would remain their top priority.
""A primary objective to promote competitiveness is genuinely a bad idea,"" Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods said this week.

The measure was part of a slew of policies aimed at supporting small firms and easing their financial burdens amid recent COVID-19 outbreaks and a slowing economy. 
To shore up economic stability, China has pledged around 1.5 trillion yuan ($235.47 billion) of VAT rebates to cushion the financial pressure on small firms.
Xu Hongcai, vice minister of finance, told a press conference on Wednesday that all small firms can claim 100% VAT rebates this year compared with 60% previously.
In addition, a total of 1.2 trillion yuan of special transfer payments by the central government to regional governments have been arranged to support tax rebates and employment, the ministry said.

(Reuters) - If you need help filing for Social Security, Medicare or disability benefits, I have good news and bad news.
The good news: The sprawling network of more than 1,200 Social Security field offices around the United States will reopen to the public in early April after a two-year COVID-19 shutdown. During that time, nearly all public service has been available only online, and by phone and mail. Millions of Americans who need in-person help from the agency can now start to get it.
The bad news: The Social Security Administration (SSA) is bracing for a crush of office visitors. Along with the pent-up demand created by the long shutdown, the agency’s national toll-free number has been experiencing problems, with some callers getting busy signals or abrupt disconnections, which an SSA spokesman confirmed. The phone system problems are expected to increase demand further in the initial weeks of the reopening.
The return to office comes at a time when the SSA was working to replace staff lost during the pandemic. But hiring has been frozen due to a lower-than-expected operating budget signed into law last week as part of a $1.5 trillion U.S. government spending bill for 2022. The SSA budget rose by $411 million to a total of $13.3 billion - less than half of what the Biden administration had requested.
“Our 2022 funding level will complicate our efforts to improve services to the public, although we remain committed to doing so,” said Mark Hinkle, the agency’s press officer, via email.
The agency is recruiting retirees to come back on a temporary basis to help with crowd control at the offices. Due to pandemic concerns, there will be limits on the number of people allowed into the offices at any given time, and it also should be possible to make appointments - assuming the phone system is up and running.
The offices served more than 43 million Americans in 2019, according to SSA data. They help with retirement and Medicare claims, but also provide critical assistance with applications for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), the benefit program for low-income, disabled or older people. 
BUDGET CRUNCH AND BACKLOGS
Most retirement and Medicare claims have been processed normally during the shutdown, but the systems for SSDI and SSI claims have been clogged. At the end of January, 974,000 claims were pending at the level of initial filing and the first level of appeal, according to agency data.
Those statistics point to dire circumstances for a large number of low-income and disabled Americans, notes Stacy Cloyd, director of policy and administrative advocacy for the National Organization of Social Security Claimants’ Representatives, a specialized bar association for attorneys and advocates.
“People are dying waiting for decisions, going into debt, or they’re unable to access medical care” she said. 
Part of the problem is application processing delays at the state level. The SSA sends disability applications to state agencies, which make medical determinations of eligibility. The largest backlog is in Florida, which had 92,525 cases awaiting determination at the end of January; Texas, California, New York state and Georgia also had large backlogs, according to agency data. 
The SSA funds these state-level determinations, so the agency’s broader budget crunch has played a role in the backlogs, according to Cloyd.
Another concern is Social Security survivor benefits https:// Although many Americans are unaware of it, Social Security pays benefits to the children of deceased workers who had earned sufficient work credits to be insured. It also pays benefits https:// to widows and widowers aged 60 or older, and pays benefits under certain other circumstances. Survivor claims for children have not risen at a pace that reflects the number of deaths due to COVID-19 among parents; advocates worry this is due to the difficulty of getting help from the agency during the shutdown. 
(https:// The SSA and unions representing the agency’s nearly 60,000 workers have been negotiating terms of the reopening since last fall. Labor representatives charge that the agency lacks a detailed plan for handling the expected crush of visitors. “People have been waiting on the phone for hours trying to get through,” said Angela Digeronimo, regional vice president of Council 220 NY Region of the American Federation of Government Employees, one of three unions representing SSA workers. “Trading that for waiting three or four hours in an office waiting room or outside an office is no solution at all.” The unions have agreed to the office reopening timetable, but are continuing to press the agency to bargain over a number of issues related to health and safety for the workforce and the public. For now, the agency website remains the best option for routine business, Hinkle said. The national 800 number (1-800-772-1213) tends to be less busy in the early morning, early evening and later in the month, he added.  Advocates for beneficiaries fear the worst when the agency opens its doors. “I’m worried that instead of access being restored, we’re going to see a dumpster fire,” said Rebecca Vallas, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and an expert on disability.  How does the agency expect things will go? 
“Our employees are dedicated to serving the public and are up to the job at hand,” the SSA's Hinkle said. “Our message to the public is to first use our online services to conduct business with the agency, call us for help if they cannot complete their business online, and schedule appointments in advance.” The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Mineral exploration company KoBold Metals, backed by billionaires including Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, said on Thursday it would begin drilling in Greenland for critical materials used in electric vehicles.
KoBold, which uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to hunt for raw materials, last year secured a 51% stake in the Disko-Nuussuaq project on Greenland's west coast, which is operated by London-listed Bluejay Mining.
The joint venture will use drones to make a high-resolution magnetic survey of the area and plans to drill a total of 3,000 metres this year to depths of between 150 and 400 metres where the metals are located. 
""The objective is to target massive nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum group metals,"" Bluejay Mining Chief Executive Bo Steensgaard told Reuters.
Prices for nickel, used in stainless steel and electric vehicle batteries, more than doubled earlier this month in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which sparked Western sanctions against Moscow. Russia supplies about 10% of the world's nickel needs.
""The recent unfortunate geopolitical developments clearly show that the Western world needs new deposits of these critical metals,"" Steensgaard said.
KoBold is a privately-held company whose principal investors include Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a climate and technology fund backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, Bloomberg founder Michael Bloomberg, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos.
""Fully electrifying the global economy is our generation's greatest challenge,"" said KoBold CEO Kurt House.
""To accomplish that lofty goal we must accelerate our efforts to find the key materials for the electric vehicle revolution,"" he said.

Last month, KoBold raised $192.5 million that will be used to discover critical materials.
Other KoBold investors include Silicon Valley venture capital fund Andreessen Horowitz, Norwegian state-controlled energy company Equinor, and Ray Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's big manufacturers' business mood likely turned less optimistic in the first quarter, as firms struggled with supply disruptions and surging energy prices after Russia launched its war in Ukraine, a Reuters poll showed.
Other data next week is expected to show core consumer prices in Tokyo likely rose at the fastest year-on-year rate in over two years in March due to rising electricity and gas costs, analysts said in the poll.
The BOJ's closely-watched ""tankan"" survey is likely to show the headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment slipped to plus 12 in April from plus 18 in the previous three months, according to analysts polled by Reuters.
""Companies saw a rise in costs due to surging commodity prices and a weak yen, while a parts shortage caused car production cuts, pushing down business conditions,"" said analysts at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting.
The data would not bode well for the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which warned of risks to a fragile economic recovery from the Ukraine crisis at its March policy meeting, where it maintained its massive stimulus on Friday.
Confidence among big non-manufacturers also likely waned, but avoided slipping into net pessimism, coming in at plus 5, down from plus 9 in December, the poll showed.
Big manufacturers expected conditions to weaken further in three months, with the reading dropping to plus 10, in a sign of growing uncertainty in the corporate outlook, the poll showed, though large non-manufacturers expected an improvement to plus 8.
The tankan is also expected to show big firms will likely raise their capital spending plans by 4.0% for the current fiscal year, less than half than the 9.3% increase estimated in the previous survey, the poll showed.

The BOJ will announce the tankan quarterly survey results on April 1 at 8:50 a.m. local time (March 31 at 2350 GMT).
Separate data due out on March 24 is expected to show Tokyo core consumer prices, which exclude fresh food, would rise 0.7% in March from a year earlier, marking the fastest increase since January 2020, the poll found.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is considering requiring companies' annual reports to disclose average wages by gender and the ratio of female managers, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter, as it seeks to close the pay gap between men and women.
The mandatory rule could be implemented as early as the fiscal year beginning in April 2023, the people said.
The move would be part of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's push to narrow income disparities and achieve more equal distribution of wealth for a sustainable economic recovery.
The government is also considering having firms disclose the ratio of male workers on childcare leave, said the sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
""The wage gap between men and women is an economic and financial problem, and the premier has a sense of crisis about it,"" a third government official said.
""Other countries are moving at a tremendous speed. Japan has to go about three times as fast as before (to catch up)"", said the official.
A panel overseen by the watchdog Financial Services Agency, aims to draw up a report on the measures this spring.
""We are discussing the issues and nothing has been decided,"" an official at the agency said.
Japan lags major peers on pay equality. Its gender pay gap was the largest of the Group of Seven (G7) nations, according to a survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
It ranked 120 out of 156 countries in the World Economic Forum's 2021 Global Gender Gap Index, scoring poorly on women's economic participation and opportunity, as well as political empowerment.

The average salary for women who work full-time was 251,800 yen ($2,083) a month in 2020 - not quite 75% of the 338,800 yen earned by men, according to health ministry data.

COLOMBO/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Sri Lanka will seek World Bank assistance to stave off a severe economic crisis in addition to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue plan to be discussed next month, two sources said.
A 70% drop in foreign exchange reserves since January 2020 has left Sri Lanka struggling to pay for essential imports, including food and fuel, leading to growing unrest and even military deployments at gasoline stations.
Holding paltry reserves of $2.31 billion as of February, the country must repay about $4 billion in debt over the rest of this year, including a $1 billion international sovereign bond that matures in July.
To seek a way out of the crisis, Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa will fly to Washington DC next month to hold talks with the IMF and also officials from the World Bank, two sources with direct knowledge of the plans told Reuters.
""What we need is budgetary support,"" one of the sources said, referring to the financial assistance that the Sri Lankan government will ask the World Bank for.
The source was unable to provide the size of World Bank assistance that Sri Lanka could seek.
The World Bank typically extends support to boost exports, improve economic competitiveness and aid growth, analysts said.
In heavily indebted Argentina, for example, the World Bank is working on approving a $2 billion loan package for 2022 that includes support for infrastructure, health, social inclusion and environment projects.
Both sources, who declined to be named, since discussions were confidential, said such assistance would likely come after Sri Lanka entered into an IMF-supported loan programme.
In response to questions from Reuters, the World Bank said it was not currently in talks with Sri Lanka to provide budget support.
""We are engaging with the authorities to identify a comprehensive structural reform program needed to ensure sustainable growth, and around which such support may be possible in the future,"" the World Bank said. 
Sri Lanka's Finance Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
'DAMN TOUGH' 
The amount of funding would depend on the specific goals set by an IMF programme as well as Sri Lanka's trade and fiscal deficits, analysts said, estimating an annual requirement of up to $3 billion from several multilateral and bilateral sources.
""If they have a credible IMF programme then there will be a period, perhaps six months to a year, maybe two, when it will be damn tough,"" the second source said. 
""So how will people survive? That is where institutions like the World Bank will come in with budget support.""
An IMF programme will likely focus on external debt restructuring, greater exchange-rate flexibility and better targeted subsidies, which may hit the poor, analysts said.

Transparent energy pricing is also likely to drive up fuel and electricity costs.
The World Bank could promote direct subsidy transfer, push green energy and develop human capital through improvements in health, education, and social protection, the second source said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan may see consumer inflation creep up and stay near the central bank's 2% target for a prolonged period if the war in Ukraine continues to drive commodity prices higher, Bank of Japan policymaker Goushi Kataoka said on Thursday.
As such inflation will be driven by external factors rather than robust domestic demand, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has no reason to tighten monetary policy, he told a news conference.
""There's a chance inflation may exceed 1.5% due to technical factors, and stay around that level for a prolonged period,"" said Kataoka, who has been a sole proponent of bigger stimulus.
""But Japan lacks momentum for inflation to stably hit 2%. At this stage, I don't see the BOJ moving towards tightening.""
While supporting the economy remains a priority over the fight against inflation, BOJ policymakers were paying more attention to rising inflationary pressures even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
At their January gathering, bank board members agreed that consumer inflation may overshoot their expectations if companies pass on rising costs quicker than forecast, minutes of the meeting showed on Thursday.
""Many companies are feeling the limit of sticking to a business model that was effective during deflation. As they change their price-setting behaviour, inflationary pressure may heighten,"" one member was quoted as saying.
""We're seeing stock prices rise for companies that hike prices,"" another member said. ""Price hikes may broaden, and heighten medium- to long-term inflation expectations.""
Japan has lagged other advanced nations in recovering from the pandemic slump, with economic growth seen stalling in the current quarter due to weak consumption.
In a glimmer of hope, a survey released on Thursday showed Japan's manufacturing activity sped up in March as falling COVID-19 cases helped lift orders.
But soaring fuel and grain costs are adding pains to resource-poor Japan, casting doubt on the BOJ's view that the world's third-largest economy is headed for a moderate recovery.
Many analysts expect core consumer inflation, which hit 0.6% in February, to accelerate near 2% in coming months on rising fuel costs and the dissipating effect of cellphone fee cuts.
Under pressure to ramp up spending ahead of an upper house election, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will likely instruct his cabinet to compile a relief package on Tuesday to cushion the blow from rising raw material prices.

The BOJ's dovish stance is in contrast to the U.S. Federal Reserve's plan to embark on aggressive interest rate hikes. The gap has pushed the yen to a six-year low against the dollar, adding pain to households by inflating import prices.
Kataoka said a weak yen was ""good for the economy as a whole,"" adding that the demerits were small when taking into account factors like the boost given to exports by a weaker yen.

""Prices have gone up again. I will buy a little bit,"" said the 43-year-old driver, who works in Sri Lanka's commercial capital of Colombo, 40 kilometres away. ""We will have to eat half of what we ate before.""
Across Sri Lanka, families like Hadaragama's are feeling the growing pain of the country's worst economic crisis in years, which has driven up prices of essentials and triggered shortages of everything from food to fuel.
Historically weak government finances, badly timed tax cuts and the COVID-19 pandemic, which pummelled the tourism industry and foreign remittances, have wreaked havoc on the economy.
The country is left with foreign reserves of only around $2.31 billion as of February, even as it faces debt payments of about $4 billion through the rest of the year.
""The reason for the shortages is not a shortage of any commodity but the shortage of dollars,"" said Dhananath Fernando, chief operating officer of Colombo think-tank Advocata Institute.
Shedding months of resistance, Sri Lanka's government last week said it would begin talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a way out of the crisis.
The country of 22 million people has also sought assistance from India and China.
But for ordinary Sri Lankans, everyday chores have become an ordeal. To fill up his motorcycle, Hadaragama now must stand in long queues and pay more than double for a litre of petrol compared to three months ago.

SEOUL (Reuters) - At age 69, Kim Jung-mi holds three jobs: she spends three hours getting a two-year old home from kindergarten every weekday for $9 per hour, then washes vegetables at a store that sells kimchi. Occasionally, she walks her neighbour's dog. 
That kind of gig work among elderly people has helped South Korea to log a record-setting run of low unemployment through February, at 2.7%, with almost half of the job increases driven by people 60 and older.
Although the drift to low-paid, part-time work is a global phenomenon, it has put South Korea at the top of OECD's scale measuring the temporary employment rate for people 65 and older: 69% of that age group is working somewhere, far higher than 38.1% in Japan and 13.2% for the peer group average. 
The heavy concentration of job increases in the elderly population shows the fragile nature of the domestic economy, experts say.
""I know I'm underpaid compared to some of younger people in the area, but where else would I go if I don't take this opportunity?"" Kim said, adding that she is happy with her current jobs after other roles such as being a cleaner.
None of Kim's jobs comes with any social security benefits or the potential for meaningful wage increases. Such jobs do little to boost the country's private consumption, as many in Kim's age group are working to barely escape poverty. 
It also highlights a consistent problem in Asia's fourth-largest economy, where the United Nations estimates that the share of elderly people will become the largest of any country by 2050. 
The country's elderly face the highest risk of becoming suicidal, and the relative poverty rate for 65-year-olds and above in Korea is the highest in the OECD. About 45% of that age group is living on less than 50% of the median disposable income.
Wages are barely increasing. Nominal wage growth for South Korea's salaried workers was 1.7% last year after a 0.3% gain in 2020, data from Statistics Korea shows. 
Yoon Jee-ho, a Citi economist based in Seoul, says the high poverty rate exposes structural weakness. 
""Korea's people aged above 65 tend to have a higher income poverty rate compared to other major economies, partly due to insufficient coverage of the existing pension system as well as not enough private savings,"" Yoon said.
The demographic squeeze is not unique. 
In Japan, senior citizens have become an increasingly important part of the country's labour pool, as about 13% of the workforce are 65 or older, up from 9% in 2012. More than three-quarters are part-timers filling roles such as cleaners, taxi drivers and shop clerks. 
James Cho, CEO of Korean mobile platform ""Pleasehelp,"" which connects job seekers to errand work, says many people on the cusp of retirement are just as busy as those who are in their 20s and 30s it terms of job searching.
""There is no age boundary; as long as one can use a smart phone, the elderly can also make money,"" Cho said, adding that there were all sorts of gigs, including catching cockroaches, staging a fight, and delivery orders. 
Conservative President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol, who promised to deliver stable, private sector-led job growth, is inheriting an economy that expanded at the fastest pace in 11 years in 2021, with minimum wage at 42% higher that of five years ago.
The fast-rising proportion of the elderly population poses a growing threat to public finances, as more people need social welfare at a time when tax revenue is set to decline alongside a shrinking workforce. 

""Retirement? I'm not sure if I can ever do that; I will probably be working as long as I can,"" Kim said.

""Currently, we're looking into the situation with relevant ministries as we don't quite understand what is (Russia's) intention and how they would do this,"" Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said in a parliament session.

Russia has put Japan on its ""unfriendly"" nation list along with the United States, European Union member states and others.
Japan has revoked Russia's most-favoured nation trade status, banned exports of certain goods to the country and frozen assets of about a hundred Russian individuals, banks and other organisations after the invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Bank of Japan policymakers agreed that consumer inflation may overshoot their expectations if companies pass on rising costs quicker than forecast, minutes of the central bank's January meeting showed on Thursday.
One member said consumer inflation may temporarily hit 1.5%, while another projected a brief rise near the central bank's 2% target as companies pass on rising raw material costs to households, the minutes showed.
""Many companies are feeling the limit of sticking to a business model that was effective deflation. As they change their price-setting behaviour, inflationary pressure may heighten,"" one member was quoted as saying.
""We're seeing stock prices rise for companies that hike prices,"" another member said. ""Price hikes may broaden, and heighten medium- to long-term inflation expectations.""
The remarks underscore the increasing attention the BOJ policymakers was putting on rising inflationary pressures, even as they commit to keeping monetary policy ultra-loose to support a fragile economic recovery.
Many members said they were closely watching wages, as they make up a big component of service costs and determine to what extent households would swallow price hikes, the minutes showed.
""Nominal wage growth must exceed 2% for Japan to stably meet the BOJ's price target,"" one member was quoted as saying.
""To change corporate and household perception on future price moves, it's important to maintain our current powerful monetary easing,"" another member said.
At the Jan. 17-18 policy meeting, the BOJ raised its inflation forecasts but maintained its massive stimulus with price growth still distant from its 2% target.
Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.6% in February from a year earlier, marking the fastest pace in two years but still well below the BOJ's 2% target as weak household spending discourages firms from passing on soaring raw material costs.

While many analysts expect rising fuel costs to push up core consumer inflation near 2% in coming months, there is uncertainty on whether the increase will be sustained as slow wage growth weighs on consumption.
The BOJ has repeatedly stressed its resolve to maintain its massive stimulus for the time being, even as other major central banks eye an exit from crisis-mode policies.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia will seek payment in roubles for gas sold to ""unfriendly"" countries, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, and European gas prices soared on concerns the move would exacerbate the region's energy crunch.
European nations and the United States have imposed heavy sanctions on Russia since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. But Europe depends heavily on Russian gas for heating and power generation, and the European Union is split on whether to sanction Russia's energy sector. 
Putin's message was clear: If you want our gas, buy our currency. It remained unclear whether Russia has the power to unilaterally change existing contracts agreed upon in euros.
The rouble briefly leapt after the shock announcement to a three-week high past 95 against the dollar. It pared gains but stayed well below 100, closing at 97.7 against the dollar, down more than 22% since Feb. 24.
Some European wholesale gas prices up to 30% higher on Wednesday. British and Dutch wholesale gas prices jumped. [NG/EU] 
Russian gas accounts for some 40% of Europe's total consumption. EU gas imports from Russia this year have fluctuated between 200 million to 800 million euros ($880 million) a day. 
""Russia will continue, of course, to supply natural gas in accordance with volumes and prices ... fixed in previously concluded contracts,"" Putin said at a televised meeting with government ministers.
""The changes will only affect the currency of payment, which will be changed to Russian roubles,"" he said.
German Economy Minister Robert Habeck called Putin's demand a breach of contract and other buyers of Russian gas echoed the point. 
""This would constitute a breach to payment rules included in the current contracts,"" said a senior Polish government source, adding Poland has no intention of signing new contracts with Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) after their existing deal expires at the end of this year.
Major banks are reluctant to trade in Russian assets, further complicating Putin's demand.
A spokesperson for Dutch gas supplier Eneco, which buys 15% of its gas from Russian gas giant Gazprom's German subsidiary Wingas GmbH, said it had a long-term contract denominated in euros.
""I can't imagine we will agree to change the terms of that."" 
According to Gazprom, 58% of its sales of natural gas to Europe and other countries as of Jan. 27 were settled in euros. U.S. dollars accounted for about 39% of gross sales and sterling around 3%. Commodities traded worldwide are largely transacted in the U.S. dollar or the euro, which make up roughly 80% of worldwide currency reserves.
""There is no danger for the (gas) supply, we have checked, there is a financial counterparty in Bulgaria that can realize the transaction also in roubles,"" Energy Minister Alexander Nikolov told reporters in Sofia. ""We expect all kinds of actions on the verge of the unusual but this scenario has been discussed, so there is no risk for the payments under the existing contract.""
Several firms, including oil and gas majors Eni, Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP), RWE and Uniper - Germany's biggest importer of Russian gas - declined to comment. 
""It is unclear how easy it would be for European clients to switch their payments to roubles given the scale of these purchases,"" said Leon Izbicki, associate at consultancy Energy Aspects. He said, however, that Russia's central bank could provide additional liquidity to foreign exchange markets that would enable European clients and banks to source needed roubles.
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation."" Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext.
ONE WEEK DEADLINE
Putin said the government and central bank had one week to come up with a solution on moving operations into the Russian currency and that Gazprom would be ordered to make the corresponding changes to contracts.
In gas markets on Wednesday, eastbound gas flows via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Germany to Poland declined sharply, data from the Gascade pipeline operator showed.
""The measures taken by Russia may also be interpreted as provocative and may increase the possibility that Western nations tighten sanctions on Russian energy,"" said Liam Peach, emerging Europe economist at Capital Economics.
The European Commission has said it plans to cut EU dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year and end its reliance on Russian supplies ""well before 2030.""
But unlike the United States and Britain, EU states have not sanctioned Russia's energy sector. The Commission, the 27-country EU's executive, did not respond to a request for comment.
Habeck said he would discuss with European partners a possible answer to Moscow's announcement. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said more time was needed to clarify Russia's demand. 
""In their contracts it's usually specified in what currency it has to be paid, so it's not something you can change just like that,"" Rutte said during a debate with parliament.
Russia has drawn up a list of ""unfriendly"" countries corresponding to those that have imposed sanctions. Deals with companies and individuals from those countries must be approved by a government commission.
The countries include the United States, European Union member states, Britain, Japan, Canada, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland and Ukraine. Some, including the United States and Norway, do not purchase Russian gas.

The United States is consulting with allies on the issue and each country will make its own decision, a White House official told Reuters. The United States has already banned imports of Russian energy.

(Reuters) -Federal Reserve policymakers on Wednesday signaled they stand ready to take more aggressive action to bring down unacceptably high inflation, including a possible half-percentage-point interest rate hike at the next policy meeting in May.
""I have everything on the table right now. If we need to do 50 (basis points), 50 is what we'll do, "" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said at an event organized by Bloomberg. ""With the labor market so strong, inflation, inflation, inflation is top of everyone's mind.""
Daly has often been more cautious than her colleagues about policy tightening, and her openness to a bigger-than-usual rate hike at the May 3-4 meeting shows a rising sense of urgency that swift and concerted action is needed to stop inflation, running at three times the Fed's 2% target, from getting entrenched.
Accelerating inflation ""has necessitated, I think, all of us to think more about how fast they're going to have to go in order to keep inflation under control,"" St. Louis Fed President Bullard told the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America. ""We have to think bigger, maybe, than we thought about in the past.""
Bullard was the lone dissenter last week on the U.S. central bank's March 16 decision to raise the benchmark overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point from the near-zero level. Bullard said a half-percentage-point hike was appropriate to kick off the tightening cycle and he wants the policy rate to rise to 3% this year.
It's now clear Bullard is far from a lone voice in advocating for more aggressive action, especially given a growing sense that higher oil, wheat and other commodity prices stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine will only worsen the inflation picture, while doing little to dent economic growth. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell earlier this week said the central bank would move ""expeditiously"" to move interest rates up after last week's hike, and left the door wide open to a larger jump in borrowing costs at the May meeting. 
Fed policymaker forecasts released last week signaled most saw the policy rate rising to 1.9% or higher by the end of the year.
""I would like to front-load some of that,"" Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on Wednesday in a call with reporters when asked about the path of interest rate increases this year. ""That better positions us if we do it earlier rather than later for what happens in the second half of the year."" 
Mester wants the federal funds rate to increase to about 2.5% by the end of the year, the level she sees as neither braking nor boosting the economy, and which would require ""some"" 50-basis-point rate rises.
Markets have taken that view on board, with traders pricing in two half-percentage-point hikes in coming meetings, and a year-end policy rate range of 2.25%-2.5%. 
BALANCE SHEET REDUCTIONS
Powell, speaking to a National Association for Business Economics conference on Monday, also said May could mark the start of reductions in the central bank's nearly $9 trillion balance sheet, which ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic as policymakers strove to bolster the economy.
Trimming the Fed's portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities would put further downward pressure on inflation, providing what Daly said on Wednesday would be the equivalent of at least one quarter-percentage-point rate hike this year.
""I think the data will tell us whether 50 basis points, or 25 basis points with the balance sheet, is the right recipe; or 50 basis points with the balance sheet,"" she said. 
Daly said she thinks the federal funds rate will likely need to rise above 2.5%, but probably not until next year. Still, she said, ""we're prepared to do whatever it takes to ensure price stability, and in the wake of all of the other challenges that we have.""
Mester also told reporters there is nothing to stop the Fed from hiking rates and beginning to reduce its balance sheet at the same policy meeting.

""I think given the situation we're in and the communications that Chair Powell has already made about the balance sheet process, I don't have concerns that that would be destabilizing, and I think that we have to recognize inflation is very elevated,"" Mester said, noting that financial markets could handle such a move. ""We have to do what we can with both our policy tools to get inflation under control.""
Bullard on Wednesday repeated his preference for the Fed to immediately start paring its balance sheet, with asset sales possible later on if inflation remained high.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States will ""absolutely"" enforce export controls if Chinese companies send semiconductors to Russia that were made with U.S technology, a move that could ""essentially shut them down,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Wednesday.
Raimondo doubled down on U.S. threats to punish any company in any country that violated tough export controls that the United States has imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
Raimondo said all Chinese semiconductor companies relied on U.S. software to make their chips, which made them subject to controls. ""If we find that they are selling chips to Russia, then we can essentially shut them down by denying them use of that software, and we're absolutely prepared to do that,"" she told Reuters in an interview.
President Joe Biden plans to announce a fresh package of sanctions on Russian political figures and oligarchs during emergency talks this week in Brussels with European and NATO leaders, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Wednesday.
The United States and its allies are seeking to ratchet up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the war, which Russia calls a ""special military operation.""
They are particularly concerned about China's relationship with Russia, its failure to condemn the invasion, and U.S. reports that Beijing is willing to provide military assistance to Moscow - all issues on the agenda during Biden's meetings.
Beijing has described the sanctions imposed on Russia as increasingly outrageous, although it has expressed concern about the war.
Raimondo said the United States was monitoring for possible violations of its sweeping export controls on Russia ""hour by hour, minute by minute,"" and would crack down on any violations by any country as they occurred.
Asked whether Chinese firms were violating the controls so far, Raimondo said no, but noted that Commerce does not disclose investigations or enforcement actions before they are finalized.
The former venture capitalist and Rhode Island governor said Washington expected China to comply because the consequences would be severe and could hit any company, including Chinese semiconductor maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).
Raimondo said she mentioned SMIC in an interview with the New York Times earlier this month as an example of the companies that could be affected, and should have said ""XYZ company"" instead. But she denied that she was softening the threat.
""I'm not walking that back. I'm very consistent and clear,"" Raimondo said.

She said the unprecedented breadth of the concerted Western action against Russia could not be lost on Beijing, and noted recent U.S. agreements on steel and aluminum with the European Union, Britain and Japan that are squarely aimed at cracking down on Chinese overcapacity.
""What you're seeing now is really unprecedented levels of cooperation between the U.S. and our like-minded allies,"" Raimondo said. ""I'm sure that China takes notice that America is strong and that our relationship with our partners is stronger than it's been in a long time.""

Continued exchange rate flexibility would be essential to absorb external shocks, it said in a statement.
The IMF is working closely with Egyptian authorities to prepare for discussions with a view to supporting sustainable, job-rich and inclusive growth, it added.
The new programme could entail additional IMF funding, an Egyptian Cabinet spokesman said in a separate statement. 
Egypt is under new economic pressure following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which prompted foreign investors to flee emerging markets.
On Monday the government let the Egyptian pound depreciate by 14% after it had remained little changed since November 2020. On Wednesday, the currency appreciated slightly to 18.32 pounds to the dollar. 
Russia and Ukraine were the main exporters of wheat to Egypt - typically the world's top importer - and major sources of tourism. 
""The rapidly changing global environment and spillovers related to the war in Ukraine are posing important challenges for countries around the world, including Egypt,"" the IMF said. 
""Continued exchange rate flexibility will be essential to absorb external shocks and safeguard financial buffers during this uncertain time. Prudent fiscal and monetary policies will also be needed to preserve macroeconomic stability."" 
The government on Monday announced a 130 billion Egyptian pound ($7.05 billion) economic relief package, a move that analysts said seemed designed to win IMF support. 
In the statement, the IMF praised ""authorities' recent actions to expand targeted social protection.""

Egypt has turned to the IMF three times in the last few years. It borrowed $12 billion under an Extended Fund Facility in November 2016, $2.8 billion under a Rapid Financing Instrument in May 2020 and $5.2 billion under a Stand-by Arrangement in June 2020.
Egypt is eligible for a new version of any one of the three programmes, according to a person familiar with its discussions with the IMF. But because Egypt has exceeded its normal borrowing quota it would have to adhere to exceptional access criteria, making it subject to a greater level of scrutiny, the person said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden has few appealing policy options to get record high U.S. gasoline prices under control ahead of the critical summer driving season, when millions of Americans fill their tanks and hit the road for vacations.
""The President and our national security team and our economic team are working overtime right now to evaluate and examine a range of domestic options,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Tuesday.
Publicly, White House officials have said all options are on the table. They have not detailed all of them, but they include a gasoline tax holiday or gas cards that would provide rebates to consumers; possible relaxation of the Jones Act, a law requiring domestic cargo to be carried on American-made tankers using union labor; and lifting of sanctions on oil-producing nations.
Privately, officials say all these options are politically complicated and few of them may actually lower gas prices much, according to two sources familiar with the administration's thinking. 
“They are perusing the menu and can’t find anything they want to eat,” said Stephen Brown, a veteran oil lobbyist who consults energy companies. 
U.S. pump prices reached all-time highs last week following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Retail gasoline prices have eased from a record of $4.331 hit on Friday but remained at $4.237 per gallon on Wednesday, according to American Automobile Association data. 
While fuel prices are soaring around the world, Republicans in the U.S. Congress blamed Biden's energy policies. Many think the issue can boost their chances during midterm elections in November.
Biden ""is faced with an angry electorate who sees the price of the pump more frequently than the suffering of the Ukrainians,"" said Ed Hirs, an energy economist at the University of Houston.
Hirs said policy options can help lower gasoline prices modestly but will not do much about the real problem: soaring crude oil prices, which remained at around $120 a barrel even after retreating substantially from a high of roughly $139 a barrel on March 7. 
The administration has urged energy companies to boost U.S. crude output from its current 11.6 million barrels per day, but analysts say that will not be easy.
""The US public thinks increasing (oil) production in the U.S. is like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) overnight delivery, but it’s more like the stagecoach,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.
TAX HOLIDAY
A federal gas tax holiday would not reduce prices much, but would hurt financing for infrastructure projects that rely on the revenue. A motorist buying 10 gallons, costing over $40 at current prices, would save less than $2 if the federal gas tax were waived.
The federal gas tax is just over 18 cents a gallon; most states impose a higher one. The highest is Pennsylvania's at 57.6-cent-a-gallon followed by California's 53.3 cents. Several states, such as Florida and Maryland, are moving to suspend their gas taxes.
Lawmakers have asked U.S. refinery officials for input on the gas tax holiday, according to numerous interviews, and the answers were not encouraging.
""We are telling them that it will not have a large impact on gasoline prices. ... to lower gas prices, it starts with lowering oil prices,"" said a top official at a U.S. refiner. 
MORE ETHANOL?
A bipartisan group of Farm Belt lawmakers has been pushing the White House to lift the summertime ban on higher ethanol blends of gasoline, called E15, which is now cheaper than the standard E10 fuel. But E15 is prohibited in the summer due to smog concerns, and White House climate officials oppose lifting the prohibition. 
Also the refining industry bitterly opposes boosting ethanol consumption, and the step would increase demand for corn at a time when high food prices are adding to inflation.
Asked about E15 gasoline, Psaki responded only that it was ""in the menu of options.""
JONES ACT
Waiving the Jones Act could help move oil to refineries on the East and West Coasts, but could anger labor unions. Washington has temporarily taken the step during emergencies such as when hackers shut down the largest U.S. fuel pipeline. 
""There is no way the White House does this,"" said one refining source. ""There's a history of lifting this during supply concerns, that's not the problem.""
GAS CARDS
The White House considered giving Americans gas cards to help offset high prices, but ditched the plan for now due to opposition from lawmakers who questioned the effectiveness, according to a source familiar with the discussions. 
Some worried that issuing gas cards would be cumbersome for the Internal Revenue Service and could delay income tax returns. A senior administration official cited fraud concerns, noting that cards have been stolen out of mailboxes. 
“We are talking to Congress about all ideas, all have a good and a bad,” the official said. 
VENEZUELA, IRAN
This month, U.S. officials met Venezuela President Nicholas Maduro for the first bilateral talks in years, and the lifting of sanctions was discussed. 
But Venezuela's opposition leaders are pressing Washington to condition any easing of oil sanctions on political concessions.

Separately, the United States and Iran have made progress on a nuclear deal that could add more oil to the tight market.
Republicans and others have criticized negotiations with Venezuela and Iran, saying the White House is caving in to dictators.

Russia is a major global agriculture producer but the sanctions, imposed by Western countries over the Ukraine crisis, have caused supply disruptions and prompted some foreign suppliers to leave the market.
""As for dairy products and baby food, I would like to note the following: in order to maintain stability in this segment due to restrictions on imports of packaging and a number of ingredients for baby food production, we are working with the business community and the trade ministry to find opportunities to replace foreign suppliers of packaging,"" Patrushev told a government meeting.
Patrushev also said that the agriculture ministry had proposed that the government should set up export quotas for sunflower oil to ""maintain the stability of situation.""
Ukraine and Russia are the world's largest sunflower oil producers. India imports more than 90% of its sunflower oil from them, though sunflower oil accounts for 14% of its total edible oil imports.
Many Russians have rushed to buy sugar, buckwheat and salt after sanctions weakened the rouble and sent food prices higher in late February-March.
The authorities have repeatedly told people there is no need to stockpile food products.
""Russia is fully self-sufficient in the main foodstuffs. There are sufficient stocks in warehouses and distribution centres, which are constantly replenished,"" Patrushev said.
""In general, the Russian agriculture industry is coping with significantly increased demand for food products,"" he added.

MILAN (Reuters) - The European Central Bank can keep its accommodative policy stance if euro zone governments act to offset higher prices, including by supporting households in order to avoid wage increases, a top policymaker said.
ECB Governing Council member Ignazio Visco told Bloomberg's Italy Capital Markets Forum on Wednesday that there was no sign in Europe of ""second round"" price effects which are linked to wage increases or inflation expectations becoming unchained.
The situation is very different from the United States where households' disposable income has gone sharply up and ""monetary policy can only be restrictive.""
The Federal Reserve a week ago raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.
""There is no demand shock in Europe, there is a supply shock,"" Visco said. ""Inflation expectations are well anchored at around 2%,"" he added.
Visco rejected the idea that higher market interest rates reflected a mismatch between investors and the central bank.
He said higher borrowing costs for companies stemmed from the uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine, with investors trying to gauge the direct and indirect impact on firms, especially banks, of the conflict.
The ECB on its part had to avoid ""surprising (markets) too much"" and ""talking too much"", adding he was already making an exception to that rule.
Visco called for ongoing coordination between budget and monetary policies, as happened during the pandemic, to allow the ECB to only very gradually normalise its ultra-expansionary monetary policy.
""The world we need to move into is a world without negative real interest rates,"" he said.
However, there is no need for quick action at present.

""We don't know what the new normality will be ... we have to be careful, we have to remain open,"" Visco said.
""If there are second-round effects then it's the central bank's responsibility to stop those,"" he added.

LONDON (Reuters) -British finance minister Rishi Sunak cut fuel duty and softened some of a looming payroll tax increase on Wednesday as he sought to alleviate a severe cost-of-living squeeze against the backdrop of slowing economic growth.
But with inflation set to hit a 40-year high of nearly 9% later this year, government forecasters said Britons faced the biggest hit to their living standards since records began in the late 1950s - even after Sunak's measures.
In a half-yearly budget update overshadowed by the conflict in Ukraine, Sunak set out plans to inject about 17.6 billion pounds ($23.2 billion) into the economy in the coming financial year.
""The invasion of Ukraine presents a risk to our recovery – as it does to countries around the world,"" Sunak told parliament. 
New forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predict economic growth of 3.8% this year, much less than the 6.0% it had projected in October. 
But many of the factors behind the squeeze on living standards were in place before Russia invaded its neighbour on Feb. 24 in what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine but which Kyiv and the West say is an unprovoked war of aggression.
Data published earlier on Wednesday showed inflation had already hit a 30-year high of 6.2% in February before the war began to push energy and some food prices even higher. 
A sharp rise in social security contributions - originally designed to raise around 12 billion pounds a year - remains scheduled for April as Sunak seeks to fund more spending on health and social care after the COVID-19 pandemic.
But in an attempt to reduce that hit, he said he would increase the threshold at which workers start to pay the contributions by 2,700 pounds from July, bringing it into line with the income tax system.
""That's a 6 billion pound personal tax cut for 30 million people across the United Kingdom,"" Sunak said, adding it would save workers more than 330 pounds a year each and was the largest single personal tax cut in a decade.
Fuel duty will be cut by 5 pence a litre for the next 12 months at a one-off cost of 2.4 billion pounds, and the main rate of income tax will fall to 19% from 20% in 2024, when Britain is due to hold its next national election. This will reduce revenue by 6 billion pounds a year.
Sunak also launched a review of business taxation, with cuts planned at his next budget in the autumn.
Other European governments have responded to the latest surge in energy prices too. France, Italy, Spain and Sweden have moved to subsidise vehicle fuel costs. Germany is considering similar plans.
LITTLE HELP FOR POOREST BRITONS
The OBR, which produces the forecasts that underpin the government's planning, said Sunak was undoing only one sixth of the tax rises he had previously announced.
Sunak's measures also provide little help to Britons who are not in work and cannot afford a car, with just 500 million pounds added to a hardship fund administered by municipal authorities.
""This package does next to nothing for those getting hardest-hit by rising prices - those who are disabled and not working just got told they are on their own,"" said Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation think tank.
Only a third of the support announced on Wednesday would go to the poorest half of Britons, the think tank added.
The opposition Labour Party had called for the government to scrap entirely the planned national insurance rise.
""Today was the day that the chancellor could have put a windfall tax on oil and gas producers to provide real help for families. But he didn't,"" Labour finance spokesperson Rachel Reeves said.
The OBR's new budget forecasts show Britain on course to borrow 29 billion pounds less over the next four years than it expected in October, despite a much weaker growth outlook. 
Borrowing for the current financial year, which ends on March 31, is due to come in at 128 billion pounds, 55 billion pounds less than forecast before, largely because tax revenues have been higher than the OBR had anticipated.
British government bond prices rallied on the prospect of lower future debt issuance.
The forecasts showed inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, averaging 7.4% in 2022, up from October's forecast of 4.0%.
This will push up the cost of servicing government debt, around a quarter of which is inflation-linked, to 83 billion pounds in the coming financial year, a 25-year high as a share of tax revenues, before falling back to historically low levels.

The OBR said gross domestic product would grow by 1.8%, 2.1% and 1.8% in 2023, 2024 and 2025. In October, it forecast growth of 2.1%, 1.3% and 1.6% over the same three years.

MADRID (Reuters) - Furlough schemes may need to be introduced if a transport strike that is creating shortages of fresh produce continues, Spanish retail and food industry associations warned on Wednesday, cranking up pressure on the government to find a solution. 
The strike has spread since a loose group of drivers and small truck owners began blocking roads and ports last week in response to soaring fuel costs that have been exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Three major transport associations joined the walkout after the government proposed a 500 million euro ($550.45 million) aid package on Monday that drivers quickly dismissed as insufficient to offset soaring diesel prices. 
""As the strike lengthens it is clear that there will be no choice but to use this (furlough) tool,"" Jose Maria Bonmati, head of the AECOC business association, told a press conference.
Long columns of trucks crawled down Spanish highways on Wednesday and, in a sign of the unease spreading to other sectors, Barcelona taxi drivers joined the protest. 
""I have no idea if it's the war...Prices had already started to rise before,"" said Tito Alvarez, a spokesperson for the Elite taxi union. ""What cannot be (however) is that a taxi driver goes out into the streets and it costs him money to work.""
Most of Spain's fishing fleet also suspended operations ahead of a meeting with Fisheries Minister Luis Planas later on Wednesday.
""We need 24,000 euros per week for fuel, and if the boat is making around 30 or 34,000, it's not worth it as there is insurance and other things to pay,"" said Ramon Alonso Maneiro, a fisherman in the Basque port of Ondarroa. 
Spain's main business association, CEOE, urged the government to clarify its plans to tackle rising energy costs and end the blockades, which have forced some companies to partially halt production and led to shortages of some products.
""It is difficult to understand...why more forceful and swift action has not been adopted,"" it said, arguing that France, Italy and Portugal had already announced measures. 

Acknowledging some shortages, retailers said food supplies were guaranteed and urged consumers not to panic buy, while pressing authorities for a solution.
With tensions rising, the government has called a meeting with transport associations on Thursday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration on Wednesday announced new steps to crack down on U.S. real estate appraisers who perpetuate property inequalities by assigning lower home price estimates to Black and Latino owners.
Mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) found in 2021 that Black and Latino people were more likely to have their homes valued under the agreed sales price than white homesellers. 
Such an appraisal can limit the size of a mortgage that can be written on a property, forcing homeowners to sell at a lower price or cancel a sale altogether. It can also reduce the amount available during a refinancing.
""Bias in home valuations limits the ability of Black and brown families to enjoy the financial returns associated with homeownership, thereby contributing to the already sprawling racial wealth gap,"" the White House said in a statement accompanying its new plan. 
Senior administration officials said the aim is to bolster appraisal standards, increase the diversity of the workforce tasked with creating those estimates and make it easier to report discrimination that violates federal law. 
Federal Housing Finance Agency Acting Director Sandra Thompson praised the road map, saying her organization ""does not tolerate housing discrimination"" and would remain focused on ensuring fair lending practices.
""Because their homes are undervalued, Black and Latino people often have to pay more for their mortgage, receive less when they sell their home, and are less able to access home equity lines of credit,"" Vice President Kamala Harris said at a White House event to unveil the effort.

Federal officials say lower appraisals have contributed to wide gaps in wealth between Black and Latino Americans and their white peers. White applicants received appraisals lower than their contracted sales price 6.5% of the time, compared with 9.5% for Latino and 8.6% for Black applications, Freddie Mac found.
Last June, Joe Biden became the first sitting U.S. president to visit the Tulsa, Oklahoma, site where hundreds of Black Americans were massacred by a white mob in 1921, vowing in his speech to combat racial discrimination in housing and address biased home appraisals.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - The initial impact of the European Union's sanctions against Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine has led to a greater drop in trade between Finland and Russia than when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Finland's Customs said on Wednesday.
Finnish Customs recorded a roughly 60% drop in both imports from Russia and exports from Finland to Russia in the last two weeks compared with the previous two weeks before the EU began to impose sanctions, Director of Statistics at Finnish Customs Olli-Pekka Penttila told Reuters.
""In the 1990s there were no sanctions, payment transactions functioned and there were no reputational risks (for companies). Now all these three are reality and it means that the impact is certainly bigger than it was in the 1990s,"" Penttila said.
She said financial sanctions were having a greater impact than export sanctions, with the biggest impact resulting from reputational risks as Western companies withdraw voluntarily from Russia to avoid being reprimanded by clients for staying.
The greatest drops have been in goods under sanctions, such as machinery, equipment and electric appliances, but even trade in goods theoretically unaffected, including paper, cardboard and energy products, has also dwindled, the data showed.
The biggest impact on imports from Russia has resulted from voluntary decisions. Finnish refiner Neste for instance has replaced some of its crude imports from Russia with Norwegian oil.
Finnish forestry groups UPM and Stora Enso (OTC:SEOAY) have stopped buying Russian wood as international certifiers labelled it ""conflict timber"". 
Last year, the Finnish forest industry imported some 9 million cubic metres of wood or around 10% of its annual consumption from Russia, Finnish Natural Resources Institute data showed.

EU sanctions against iron and steel imports will also have an impact but took effect only last week, meaning their full extent had yet to show up in the data.
Traded volumes are likely to keep falling as Russian imports continuing under long-term contracts will end. In addition, the EU could add more sanctions if the war drags on.

Russia appreciates Indonesia not bowing to pressure to shift the G-20’s focus away from economic recovery, Ambassador Lyudmila Vorobieva said at a briefing Wednesday in Jakarta. 
Her announcement came a day after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for a discussion over whether Russia should be excluded from the grouping of major economies, as the West strives to turn Putin and his government into international pariahs in response to his invasion of Ukraine. However, China signaled it stands by Russia’s continued G-20 membership, saying the bloc needs to work together on issues from global economic growth to recovery from the pandemic.
“Russia is an important member” of the grouping, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Wednesday at a regular press briefing in Beijing. “No member has the right to remove other countries.”
Poland floated the idea of replacing Russia in the G-20 during meetings last week with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, according to Development Minister Piotr Nowak.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested Wednesday that the U.S. was behind pressure to exclude Russia from the organization. 
“The G-20 is a multilateral format, there are different points of view,” Peskov said on a conference call with reporters. “It is clear that the Americans will continue to put pressure on different countries, but, as we see, a number of states still prefer to adhere to their independent, sovereign point of view.”
Russia was suspended from the Group of Eight industrial countries in 2014 after Putin’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and withdrew from the inter-governmental organization permanently in 2017. The G-20 is a larger grouping that includes many developing economies.

In a joint statement issued by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the agencies said they would continue financing support for exports to Ukraine.
""This decision builds on the wide-ranging packages of sanctions and measures imposed on the Russian Federation and Belarus since the beginning of military operations, and we encourage any ECA that has not already done so, to join us in this step to impose financial pressure on the two countries,"" the export credit agencies said in the statement 
A U.S. EXIM spokesperson said the bank has not provided loans or guarantees to Russian entities since Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea under an administrative hold on processing Russian applications. The bank's board is due to vote next week on a permanent ban on Russian transactions.
But EXIM still has $428.8 million in prior credit exposure to Russia, primarily for aviation sector loan guarantees that were granted before the Crimea annexation.

Western sanctions imposed against Russian banks and prohibitions on Russian aircraft are complicating repayments of these loans.
""Per the recent sanctions, we are working expeditiously to resolve those transaction repayments,"" an EXIM spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's ruling coalition on Wednesday agreed to compile a fresh stimulus package to cushion the economic blow from surging fuel and grain prices caused by the war in Ukraine.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who heads the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said he will order the government to start compiling the package as early as next week.
""The government must carry out solid counter-measures for rising prices of oil, raw materials and (other) goods, to revive Japan's economy,"" he told reporters after meeting with Natsuo Yamaguchi, leader of the LDP's ruling coalition partner Komeito.
The Ukraine conflict and a weak yen have pushed up the cost of imported goods in a blow to Japan's fragile economy.
Kishida had been under pressure from politicians to ramp up spending ahead of an upper house election scheduled this summer, even before Tuesday's parliamentary approval of a record state budget for the 2022 fiscal year.
Additional spending will boost Japan's already huge public debt and keep it reliant on huge government support, even as many advanced nations wean their economies off stimulus measures deployed during the COVID-19 crisis.
Kishida will likely tap 5.5 trillion yen ($45.41 billion) in reserves set aside under the fiscal 2022 budget, instead of compiling an extra budget, the Nikkei paper said on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Yamaguchi told reporters on Wednesday Komeito wants the government to use not just the reserves but also additional funds through an extra budget.
""The stimulus package could come in two stages,"" with the first one to be funded by reserves and the second one by an extra budget that will pass parliament after the election, said Toru Suehiro, senior economist at Daiwa Securities.

""Combined, the total size of the package could near 20 trillion yen.""

(Reuters) -An increase in delinquencies last year among a smaller pool of U.S. student loans not covered by a forbearance program put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic signals likely problems ahead for almost 37 million loans when that program ends, a New York Federal Reserve analysis showed on Tuesday.
Borrowers covered under the forbearance program have not been required to make payments on their loans since March 2020, but the suspension of repayments is set to expire at the end of April.
Over the period, an estimated $195 billion worth of payments have been waived, the New York Fed said.
Borrowers in a separate smaller pool of about 10 million loans provided privately or through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) system and not covered by the forbearance program struggled with their debt payments over the past two years. In particular, from March last year delinquency rates for FFEL borrowers have been on the rise and returned to pre-pandemic levels by the end of December.

That bodes ill for those covered by the program who had higher debt balances, lower credit scores and were making less progress on repayments than FFEL borrowers before the pandemic began.
""As such, we believe that ... borrowers are likely to experience a meaningful rise in delinquencies, both for student loans and for other debt, once forbearance ends,"" New York Fed economists wrote in a blog post.

LONDON (Reuters) - ""The longer the war goes on, the greater the chance of an economic recession,"" the chief executive of commodity trader Vitol said on Tuesday at a business leaders' conference organised by the Financial Times.
Recession risks were already elevated before Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent surge in commodity prices and disruption of supply chains has worsened the adverse economic trends.
Recessions have proved notoriously difficult to predict, or identify when they first start, even for the most learned researchers of the business cycle.
For the most part, recessions are caused by a complex interaction of output, employment, prices, costs, productivity, interest rates and credit, among other variables, rather than a single external shock such as a spike in oil prices.
But a sudden rise in the price of oil, or some other shock, can act as the tipping point if the business cycle has already become susceptible to a downturn, as was probably the case at the start of 2022.
COST OF LIVING CRUNCH
Prior to Russia's invasion, the principal economic and financial indicators painted a mixed picture about the state of the U.S. business cycle (https://tmsnrt.rs/37U1EQs).
Production and employment indicators were strong, suggesting there was unlikely to be a recession for at least another six to 12 months, but prices and incomes indicators were more pessimistic.
U.S. manufacturing output had increased by almost 1.2% over the three months from November to February, according to the Federal Reserve, implying the economy had strong positive momentum.
Manufacturers reported a widespread improvement in business conditions, with the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) composite indicator at 58.6 in February.
The ISM index was well above the 50-point threshold signalling an expansion rather than a contraction, though it had already started to ease back from a peak in the summer of 2021.
The number of non-farm jobs had increased by more than 1.7 million between November and February as businesses reopened and rehired after the coronavirus recession and lockdowns.
But core consumer prices for items other than food and energy were rising at an annual rate of more than 6%, consistent with the onset of a recession in past business cycles.
The Treasury yield curve had flattened significantly and the spread between two-year and 10-year notes had narrowed to levels consistent in the past with the advent of a recession or at least a mid-cycle slowdown.
Real personal incomes less transfers (PILT) had fallen by 0.3% between October and January, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, as wages failed to keep up with the rise in prices.
PILT is one of a suite of indicators the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee uses to identify peaks and troughs in the business cycle.
The three-month fall in PILT put the indicator in just the 14th percentile for all months since 1990, which helps explain why consumer sentiment has tumbled even as job growth has continued.
PILT growth has fallen to rates that heralded the onset of a recessions in 1990, 2001, 2007 and 2020 and mid-cycle slowdowns in 1995, 2005, 2012 and 2015.
The contrast between strong manufacturing production and business surveys on the one hand and the weakness revealed by PILT on the other confirms the economy's main problem is a cost of living crunch.
Russia’s invasion and the sanctions imposed in response have intensified this problem by sending oil and gas prices surging and disrupting other manufacturing and food supply chains.
TURNING POINT PROBLEM
Recessions are difficult to forecast in real time because by definition the onset of the recession is also the peak of the previous expansion.
Slowdowns in the business cycle always start when business conditions and employment have been relatively good until recently.
Recent buoyancy encourages forecasters to be over-optimistic that positive conditions will persist and they under-estimate the probability the economy is at a turning point.
""The largest errors in forecasts ... are made in the vicinity of business cycle and growth cycle turning points, particularly peaks,"" economist Victor Zarnowitz wrote in his landmark study of business cycles.
""Many forecasts are overly influenced by the most recent events or developments; they rely on the persistence of local trends and are insufficiently cyclical,"" he said. (“Business cycles: theory, history, indicators and forecasting”, 1992).
Forecasters also have professional reputational reasons for maintaining an optimistic outlook and predicting a soft landing for the economy.
""A forecaster is understandably anxious to avoid predicting a downturn spuriously or prematurely ahead of others, which explains why some indicators warnings are not heeded,"" Zarnowitz wrote.
As a result, professional forecasters routinely fail to identify turning points until after they have happened, even when the data starts to become adverse.
SHOCKING THE SYSTEM
The critical question is whether the invasion and sanctions will worsen the adverse trends in the economy enough to push it into a significant slowdown or even a full-blown recession.
The economic shock caused by Russia's invasion is much smaller than the one created by the spread of the coronavirus epidemic around the world in the first quarter of 2020.
But it is at least as big as the shocks caused by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the Iranian revolution in 1979 and the Arab oil embargo in 1973, all of which were followed by recessions.
The current shock is also propagating through multiple channels simultaneously, including the energy system, the food system, manufacturing supply chains, the international freight network, and the global payments system.
Complicating the picture, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks are trying to reduce inflation, limiting their room to cut interest rates or ease credit conditions to offset any negative impact on business activity.
Recessions usually occur when, like now, there is a contradiction between policy objectives, forcing central banks and governments to make an uncomfortable choice, prioritising other goals at the expense of a temporary slowdown in output growth and employment.
The scale and complexity of the current shock makes the business-cycle impact particularly hard to forecast but in the context of an already severe inflation problem it is likely to be large and negative.
Even if the United States successfully avoids a recession, Europe is much more integrated with the Russian economy, and the probability of a recession is therefore very much higher.
The more the conflict and sanctions escalate, and the longer they persist, the larger disturbance to the economy and the greater the probability of a recession ensuing.

Euro-zone governments’ extra spending caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will cumulatively total 2% of annual output by the end of next year, according to economists at UBS Group).
That comprises supplementary expenditure of 1.5% of gross domestic product in 2022 and another 0.5% in the following 12 months, Felix Huefner, Reinhard Cluse, Anna Titareva and Jennifer Aslin said in a report this week.
While the initial focus of budgetary expansion will be on mitigating higher energy bills, further costs incurred will include handling the refugee influx, and raising spending on defense and energy security, the economists said. 
The UBS calculation provides one initial glimpse of the effect on public finances that had already been stretched by measures to cushion the economic impact of the pandemic. Brussels has signaled that rules capping deficits in the region that were suspended for the outbreak could remain so into next year. 
“We doubt any decision to that effect would be opposed by the more hawkish countries,” the UBS economists said. Even if the suspension were lifted, “we assume that the European Commission would provide sufficient leeway for countries with budget overruns, also by taking into account additional spending on refugees, defense and energy security.”

Investing.com -- Oil prices rise as Russia chokes off a Kazakh oil pipeline claiming it needs to repair storm damage, while U.S. inventories appear to have fallen again last week. The chorus of voices at the Fed calling for actively restrictive policy grows louder. Inflation in the U.K. hits a new 30-year high as the government tries to tackle a cost of living crisis. U.S. stocks are set for a breather at the opening, and China finds the black box from the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 that crashed earlier this week. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 23rd March.
1. Russia chokes off Kazakh oil pipeline as Europe ramps up debate on sanctions 
Oil prices rose again as Europe’s debate over sanctions on Russian energy exports ratcheted up a day ahead of a crucial summit meeting.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi told lawmakers that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not interested in serious peace talks, a conspicuously hawkish tone from a country that is highly dependent on Russian oil and gas. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, by contrast, reaffirmed his opposition to an immediate embargo, citing the economic costs.
Russia has unilaterally tightened the global oil market overnight by closing the Caspian Pipeline Consortium’s export terminal on the Black Sea, claiming that storm damage needs to be repaired. The 700,000 barrel-a-day link largely carries oil from Kazakhstan to world markets.  
U.S. crude prices rose 1.8% to $111.25 a barrel, while Brent rose 2.1% to $117.90 a barrel, ahead of U.S. government data on inventories at 10:30 AM ET. According to the API industry group, crude stockpiles fell by a surprisingly large 4.3 million barrels last week.
2. Dovish Daly adds to calls for faster rate hikes; Mortgage data, new home sales due 
San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly added her voice to those calling for the Fed to raise interest rates above what is seen as the neutral rate in order to bring inflation down.  
Daly’s comments follow similar ones from Chair Jerome Powell, governor Chris Waller and St. Louis’ James Bulllard this week, but are notable given that she has been at the dovish end of the spectrum as regards tightening policy in recent months. As such, her comments suggest that a clear majority may be in favor of a 50 basis point rate hike at the Fed’s next meeting.
U.S. bond yields have for now stopped their relentless rise, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling by 2 basis points overnight to 2.36%. Their rise will put a sharp focus on weekly data for mortgage applications and rates at 7 AM ET. New home sales data for February are also due later.
3. Stocks set to take a breather at opening 
U.S. stock markets are set to open a little lower on profit-taking after Tuesday’s solid gains.
By 6:20 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 83 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.4%. All three indices had risen on Tuesday, having digested the apparent hawkish shift in Fed policy. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.0%, taking its gains to 9% over the last week.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include GameStop (NYSE:GME), after some more buying by its chairman Ryan Cohen, as well as Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) and  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS), which report earnings. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock may also be volatile as employees in Florida step up protests against the state’s new bill on LGBTQ issues, while BuzzFeed (NASDAQ:BZFD) stock is still ticking up in the wake of its decision to close its loss-making newsdesk.
4. U.K. inflation hits 30-year high as cost of living crisis worsens
U.K. inflation hit a 30-year high of 6.2% in February, with continued rapid increases in producer prices stoking fears that the peak in consumer inflation may not come for another eight months.
The figures create a tense backdrop for the government’s spring budget statement, which is expected to contain some substantial giveaways on fuel taxes, following the lead of France, Italy and others. It isn’t clear whether the government will stick to its prior plans to raise national insurance contributions in order to close a budget deficit which has narrowed more sharply than expected in th last couple of months.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey is also scheduled to speak at 8 AM ET (as is Bundesbank head Joachim Nagel, coincidentally)
5. China finds 'Black Box' of crashed Boeing
Chinese officials have recovered one of the flight recorders from the Boeing 737-800 that crashed during an internal flight on Monday, according to local media reports.
The discovery should allow for a relatively quick clarification on the cause of the crash.
Elsewhere in China, internet giant Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) reported growth of only 8% in revenue in the last quarter, the slowest on record.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House will announce on Wednesday a funding opportunity of $2.9 billion earmarked by the Transportation Department for major infrastructure projects this year, as part of a $1-trillion law Congress approved in 2021.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu will unveil the plans at an event held at a major bridge linking the U.S. capital of Washington with Arlington, Virginia.
The grant funding offers ""a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix our outdated infrastructure and invest in major projects for the future of our economy,"" Buttigieg said. Applications are due by May 23.
The figure includes $1 billion for projects of national or regional significance that are too large or complex for traditional funding programs, which Buttigieg described as the ""cathedrals of our infrastructure.""
Such structures could be bridges or tunnels linking two states, new rail and transit lines or freight hubs integrating ship, train and truck traffic.
The department also plans to award $300 million for rural projects and $1.55 billion for other highway, multimodal freight and rail projects.
A potential funding recipient is a $12.3-billion project that aims to build a new tunnel between New York City and New Jersey and reconstruct an existing one.
Buttigieg said he expected the project to apply for funding but it would face review, like all the rest. On a visit to the existing tunnel, Buttigieg added, he saw a ""sense of urgency around those much needed upgrades.""
The Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Tunnel Project is a key component of the Gateway Program, a major project to overhaul much of the aging rail infrastructure in the New York City area. 

The New York City-area rail tunnel, which opened in 1910, was damaged in 2012 when Superstorm Sandy flooded parts of the city.
Congress approved $66 billion for rail as part of the massive infrastructure bill, with passenger railroad Amtrak receiving $22 billion. The bill also sets aside $36 billion for competitive grants.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Many Indians are cutting down on fried food and even vegetables as the Ukraine war inflates the prices of items from edible oils to fuel, threatening a sputtering recovery in the consumption-based economy after two years battling COVID-19.
Consumers in Asia's third-largest economy are feeling the bite as companies pass on a surge in costs since the invasion, battling the first hikes in five months this week in the prices of diesel and petrol, as well as more expensive vegetable oils.
""God only knows how we will manage this level of price rise,"" said Indrani Majumder, the sole earner in a family of four in the eastern city of Kolkata, adding that the past two years of the pandemic had brought a halving in salaries.
These days her family eats more boiled food to save on the cost of edible oil, she said. It is just one of almost a dozen homes were people said they were taking similar steps.
India's economy expanded at a pace slower than expected in the quarter from October to December, and economists forecast a further dent to growth in the current one, as high fuel prices bring a jump in inflation. 
Graphic: India's inflation above central bank's tolerance level: https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-INFLATION/INDIA/egvbklgkdpq/chart.png 
Private consumption contributes the largest share of gross domestic output, at nearly 60%.
But since the invasion late in February, which Russia calls a special operation, Indian firms have raised prices of milk, instant noodles, chicken and other key items by about 5% to 20%.
About 800 million of a population of nearly 1.4 billion received free government supplies of staple foods during the pandemic, and even small price rises now can mean a knock for their budgets.
Families' finances could stay anaemic for the third year in a row, warned Pronab Sen, formerly India's chief statistician.
""The process of rebuilding savings was only beginning post the pandemic,"" he added. ""Because of this latest shock, they will have to cut back on consumption.""
DARKENING PICTURE
Surging global prices of crude have prompted companies in the import-dependent nation to raise retail prices of petrol and diesel twice this week. India imports 85% of its crude oil, which has seen prices rise nearly 50% this year.
The South Asian nation is also the world's biggest importer of edible oil, shipping in nearly 60% of its needs.
But the price of palm, the country's most widely consumed edible oil, has jumped 45% this year. And supplies of sunflower oil, which Ukraine and Russia produce in large quantities, have been disrupted.
Some wholesalers said their sales of edible oil had fallen by a quarter in the past month as prices rose.
These factors helped keep India's retail inflation in February above the central bank's comfort level of 6% for the second month in a row, while the wholesale rate was more than 13%.
""The timing of input price inflation could not have been worse in the context of a slowing consumption trend,"" financial services firm Jefferies said in a note.
The central bank has said it is monitoring crude and commodity prices ahead of its next monetary policy meeting in early April. But markets do not expect the Reserve Bank of India to change key rates, as it looks to prioritise growth.
This stance compares with global central banks, which have either raised rates or are weighing whether to do so to curb inflation. For instance, policymakers of the U.S. Federal Reserve called this week for big rate hikes in May.
For consumers, there is little relief in sight.
The Confederation of All India Traders estimates input costs for makers of consumer durables and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) to rise another 10% to 15% this month as fuel prices rise, an expense destined to be passed on to the final consumer.
In Kolkata, vegetable vendor Debashis Dhara said higher transport costs would bump up vegetable prices by a further 5% this week. His sales have already halved since February.
India's Mother Dairy and Amul raised milk prices by nearly 5% this month, while FMCG companies such as Hindustan Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Nestle are charging more for items such as instant noodles, tea and coffee.
Broiler chicken prices have jumped nearly 45% in six months to a record 145 rupees ($1.90) a kg this week, as key feed ingredients corn and soymeal have become costlier after supplies from the Black Sea region were affected.
Fertiliser prices have shot up to a record $150 a tonne since Russia, one of the biggest producers, rolled tanks and soldiers into Ukraine.

""It has become very difficult to manage our monthly budget,"" said Archana Pawar, a housewife in the financial capital of Mumbai. ""This kind of price rise is forcing us to cut down consumption.""

Governor Lee Ju-yeol said in a speech wrapping up his eight-year term at the Bank of Korea that as high inflation was expected to continue ""for a considerable period"" and there was a need to reduce financial imbalances, ""it is necessary to continue reducing the degree of monetary policy easing"".
Lee, who has presided over 76 rate decision meetings in total, ends his term on March 31 and will pass on his duties to Rhee Chang-yong, a veteran technocrat at the International Monetary Fund.
The BOK held its base rate unchanged at 1.25% at its February meeting, after back-to-back hikes on surging coronavirus cases and escalating tensions in Ukraine.
Even then, Lee said expectations of more rate hikes by the bank to about 1.75% or 2.00% were ""reasonable"", adding that there was a stronger need to respond with policy actions to stabilise prices.
In February, the bank sharply raised its inflation forecasts to 3.1% from 2.0% for this year, while keeping its growth forecast unchanged at 3.0%.
Lee, however, said on Wednesday the BOK's February forecast did not include the Russian invasion of Ukraine and signalled a revision may be made later.
""Russia's invasion of Ukraine came soon after (our last meeting) and the economic conditions have worsened since then,"" Lee told reporters.

""We will still have to monitor the development of Russia-Ukraine conflicts and its impact ... but it is true that we are concerning that the Russia-Ukraine war will bring much higher inflationary pressure and add strains on growth,"" Lee added.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"".

Economists say while Rhee, 61, is likely to be less hawkish than Lee, affecting the make-up of the bank's seven-member board, he is not expected to significantly alter the BOK's current policy posture.
""Looking at his past comments and reports, he is more of a dove, although he won't reveal such a stance given current economic climate,"" said Kyobo Securities economist Paik Yoon-min. ""But I do think that the BOK's board might end up with more dovish colour.""
The BOK next reviews its policy rate on April 14 and analysts expect the board to take the base rate to 1.75% by end-2022 from 1.25% currently.
Kong Dong-rak at Daishin Securities also said Rhee would be less of a hawk than Governor Lee, although ""he won't blatantly make that clear until after a few hikes.""
The BOK has raised interest rates three times since August to hose down inflationary pressures and a build-up of financial imbalances, making it one of the world's more hawkish central banks.
Governor Lee on Wednesday reiterated the need for further policy tightening as the economy struggles with red-hot inflation.
TRANSITIONS
The change in bank governor comes amid a wider political transition in the country with conservative President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol set to take office in May, replacing outgoing leader Moon Jae-in.
Moon's office said on Monday the president had discussed the nomination with Yoon, although Yoon's transition committee released a separate statement saying the nomination had not been addressed in conversations.
Before commencing his four-year term, Rhee will be subject to questions from lawmakers about his economic expertise and ethical standards.
Members of the National Assembly often grill those tapped as top officials in parliamentary hearings, although Rhee's nomination does not formally require legislative approval.
Such hearings in the past have focused on a wide range of personal matters, including nominees' property transactions, tax histories and even the military service of relatives.
As a director at the IMF, Rhee currently oversees its lending operations and surveillance work across Asia-Pacific.

Before joining the IMF in 2014, Rhee served as chief economist at the Asian Development Bank and a Sherpa for the country's G-20 Presidential Committee when South Korea hosted the group's summit in 2010.
He has worked closely with finance ministry officials, including former vice finance minister Choi Sang-mok who is now a part of President-elect Yoon's transition committee.

LONDON (Reuters) - Tighten hard and fast now and you might just avoid triggering recession - it seems the Federal Reserve is tempted by its own playbook from almost 30 years ago.
In just 12 months from February 1994, the Fed doubled its main policy rate to 6% in seven rapid-fire hikes that included two 50 basis point moves and a swingeing 75bp rise for good measure.
Although it whacked the bond market - and some argue sowed the seeds of serial emerging market crises over the remainder of the decade - the Fed's short, sharp shock avoided an inversion of the 2-to-10 year Treasury yield curve, which is for many the most reliable harbinger of recession ahead.
True to the predictive power of the yield curve, a U.S. recession was averted and the Fed succeeded in achieving a rare 'soft landing' for the economy. 
Faced with distortions from a global pandemic and energy price shock due to war in Ukraine, history may not be a great guide to anything right now. Much has changed in the economy, bond markets and banking system over three decades. 
But it might still be useful in figuring out the Fed's reaction function. 
""Eat your heart out, 1994,"" reckoned  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists at the weekend.
The U.S. central bank began its latest tightening cycle last week with a quarter point rate rise from near zero pandemic settings. But facing 40-year high annual inflation rates close to 8%, its policymakers predicted rates may have to go well into so-called 'restrictive' territory above what it considers a 'neutral' 2.4% over the next two years.
Markets scrambled again to re-price the latest hawkish twist and then Fed chief Jerome Powell on Monday underlined this new-found 'whatever it takes' approach to taming inflation by insisting the Fed would consider 50bp rate rises ahead if it felt necessary.
So much so that futures markets now see the Fed adding 200bp more of tightening over its six remaining policy meetings of the year and pencil in a 'terminal', or peak, rate both higher and sooner than previously thought - near 3% by June of next year compared with a combination of 2.5% by September 2023 last week.
Fed watchers too have rushed to recalibrate the scale of forecast Fed hikes ahead. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economists now expect two 50 bp hikes at each at its May and June meetings.
So far, so 1994. But how about the yield curve?
Having been crushed by a whopping 140 bp over the past year - and even as other parts of the curve have tipped negative - the pivotal gap between 2 and 10 year Treasury bond yields remains just positive - even if it's now teetering less than 20 bps from a portentous inversion.
For the record, that gap got as low as 7bp in December 1994 - just after the mega 75bp Fed thunderbolt - but it never turned negative.
Crude comparisons would suggest that this time around we may be in for a long, nervy wait on the brink even if the alarm bells around world markets are to stay silent.

Graphic: The Squeeze Is On?: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdpzyjyanvw/Two.PNG 
NARROW 'SOFT LANDING' STRIP
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and others have spotlighted recently just how narrow the 'soft landing' strip ahead is for the Fed, showing how delicate the balancing act will be in touching down without crashing.
Both the Fed and the markets now agree that policy rates will have to move at least half a percentage point above the 2.4% estimate of 'neutral', deliberately cooling the economy to below long-term potential growth estimates of 1.8% and dragging inflation back down to its 2-percent target eventually. 
But, as Morgan Stanley's team point out, that involves effectively halving growth from here and then tapping and nudging the controls to stop momentum pushing it over the edge.
""Any such deceleration has to raise materially the probability of a recession, even if a recession is not the base case — which it is not for us,"" it told clients.
The U.S. bank expects the 2-10 yield curve to invert this time around - ending the year at a negative 35bp - but no recession to follow. 
Why? One of the things it cites is the disappearance over the past decade of the so-called 'term premia' on yields of longer-term bonds - additional compensation that used to be demanded by investors to cover the risk of things going bump in the night over many years holding the same bond. 
Reasons for the evaporation of this term premium vary - from the impact of years of Fed bond buying policies to almost a decade of sub-target inflation. 
But without these term premia today, a normal inversion of rate curve over the cycle that simply maps how the Fed will tighten, control inflation and then ease again risks inverting the Treasury curve as well. In other words, there's a possibility that inversion ain't what it used to be.
An alternative view, of course, is that the Fed is just talking tough and hoping the market scare by itself will be enough to ensure it won't have to follow through with the sort of aggressive moves seen in the 1990s.
Likening it to how she often tries in vain to deal with her unruly teenage kids, Invesco strategist Kristina Hooper thinks the Fed may be warning just for effect - ""speaking loudly but hoping that big actions don't become necessary.""

""Sometimes tough talk can do the trick.""

The warning was lifted at 1100 JST (0200 GMT), after the government issued an urgent call the previous day to save energy, to which businesses and households responded by dimming lights and turning down thermostats.
Although Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), which powers the capital and its surrounding areas, had warned that as many as 3 million households could lose power in the evening on Tuesday, Japan managed to avert any serious power outages.
With thermal power stations halted due to a quake that shook the northeastern coast of Japan last week and unseasonably cold weather hitting Tokyo, the government had called for saving electricity from early in the morning on Tuesday.
It renewed the plea in the afternoon, however, warning of potential power outages if consumers continued to use energy.
""We weren't achieving the (energy-saving) targets between 08:00 to 15:00 and we felt the situation was risky. That was why we asked for help from the trade ministry and asked for the minister to call on further energy-saving measures,"" a Tepco official said on Wednesday.

""We were able to achieve this level (of energy-saving) from 15:00 because everyone responded to the pleas to cut back on energy usage, and all we feel right now is gratitude,"" the official added. 
A similar warning had been issued for the northeastern areas powered by Tohoku Electric Power Co, but that warning was lifted late on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States and its Western allies are assessing whether Russia should remain within the Group of Twenty (G20) grouping of major economies following its invasion of Ukraine, sources involved in the discussions told Reuters on Tuesday.
The likelihood that any bid to exclude Russia outright would be vetoed by others in the club - which includes China, India, Saudi Arabia and others - raised the prospect of some countries instead skipping G20 meetings this year, the sources said.
The G20 along with the smaller Group of Seven - comprising just the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Britain - is a key international platform for coordinating everything from climate change action to cross-border debt.
Russia is facing an onslaught of international sanctions led by Western nations aiming to isolate it from the global economy, including notably shutting it out of the SWIFT global bank messaging system and restricting dealings by its central bank.
""There have been discussions about whether it’s appropriate for Russia to be part of the G20,"" said a senior G7 source. ""If Russia remains a member, it will become a less useful organization.""
Asked whether U.S. President Joe Biden would move to push Russia out of the G20 when he meets with allies in Brussels this week, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House Tuesday: ""We believe that it cannot be business as usual for Russia in international institutions and in the international community."" 
However, the United States plans to consult with its allies before any other pronouncements are made, he said. 
A European Union source separately confirmed the discussions about Russia's status at forthcoming meetings of the G20, whose rotating chair is currently held by Indonesia.
""It has been made very clear to Indonesia that Russia’s presence at forthcoming ministerial meetings would be highly problematic for European countries,"" said the source, adding there was however no clear process for excluding a country.
The G7 was expanded to a new ""G8"" format including Russia during a period of warmer ties in the early 2000s. But Moscow was indefinitely suspended from that club after its annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Earlier on Tuesday, Poland said it had suggested to U.S. commerce officials that it replace Russia within the G20 group and that the suggestion had received a ""positive response.""
A U.S. Commerce Department spokesperson said that a ""good meeting"" had been held last week between Polish Economic Development and Technology Minister Piotr Nowak and U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo but added:
""She (Raimondo) welcomed hearing Poland’s views on a number of topics, including the operation of the G20, but did not express a position on behalf of the U.S. Government with respect to the Polish G20 proposal.”
The G7 source said it was seen as unlikely that Indonesia, currently heading the G20, or members like India, Brazil, South Africa and China would agree to remove Russia from the group.
""It's impossible to remove Russia from G20"" unless Moscow makes such a decision on its own, said an official of a G20 member country in Asia. ""There's simply no procedure to deprive Russia of G20 membership.""
If G7 countries instead were to skip this year’s G20 meetings, that could be a powerful signal to India, the source said. It has drawn the ire of some Western nations over its failure to condemn the Russian invasion and support Western measures against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Indonesia's foreign ministry declined to comment on calls for Russia to be excluded.
Deputy central bank governor Dody Budi Waluyo on Monday said at a seminar Indonesia's position was always one of neutrality, but noting the risk of divisions over the issue said it would use its G20 leadership to try to resolve any problems. 
Russia had a ""strong commitment"" to attend G20 meetings and other members could not forbid them from attending, he added.
Russia's status at other multilateral agencies is also being questioned.
In Geneva, World Trade Organization officials said numerous delegations there were refusing to meet their Russian counterparts in various formats.

""Many governments have raised objections to what is happening there and these objections have manifested themselves in a lack of engagement with the member concerned,"" WTO spokesperson Keith Rockwell said.
One source from a Western country said those not engaging with Russia at the WTO included the European Union, the United States, Canada and Britain. No confirmation from those delegations was immediately available.

BALTIMORE, Md. (Reuters) -Top trade officials from the United States and Britain will meet in Scotland in April after two days of talks in the U.S. port city of Baltimore on forging deeper and more inclusive trade relations, and a surprise deal on cutting tariffs.
British trade minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan told reporters on Tuesday the meetings had energized efforts by the two historic allies to work together more closely and ""stay ahead of the game in a fast-changing global economy.""
Trevelyan and U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai met with industry executives and labor unions, toured the Baltimore port, and visited a minority-owned digital technology firm as part of wide-ranging dialogues aimed at finding new ways to expand trade and investment between the two countries.
""America is at its best when we are working closely with our allies,"" Tai told a news conference. ""Secretary Trevelyan and I want to preserve the historic nature of our special relationship while ensuring it properly addresses the urgent challenges of today's world.""
They both noted that close cooperation between Washington and London in their response to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine underscored the power of cooperation by democracies.
The two trade officials spoke shortly before Trevelyan met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and sealed an agreement that lifted U.S. tariffs on UK steel and aluminum, and retaliatory British tariffs on U.S. motorcycles, whiskey and other products.
In a joint statement on the trade dialogues, Tai and Trevelyan said they had identified areas for deeper cooperation, including protecting labor rights and the environment, promoting supply chain resilience, and supporting the low-carbon transition.
They said it was also vital to make it easier for small- and medium-sized businesses to take part in global trade, including through enhanced access to financing, and ensure that the benefits of trade were distributed across their countries.
Asked about resuming formal negotiations on a bilateral free trade agreement, Tai said such deals were ""very 20th century tools"" and it was important to look for creative, innovative solutions given new challenges.

While the United States and the European Union had set up a trade and technology council, Tai cautioned that ""one size does not fit all,"" and said the United States and Britain had their own particular shared values. 
Trevelyan said Britain stood ready to pull together a free trade agreement, but added that the purpose of the U.S.-UK current dialogue was ""to really be able to think about where we want to be going with our relationship.""

(Reuters) -Federal Reserve officials are helping shape market expectations for sharper interest-rate hikes to curb the surge in inflation, but have not managed to dispel fears the tightening cycle could blow a hole in the economy and labor market.
""The Fed needs to move aggressively to keep inflation under control,"" St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday, calling for the central bank to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate to 3% this year. 
Bullard dissented last week as the rest of his colleagues agreed to raise the federal funds rate by just a quarter of a percentage point from the near-zero level it had been since March 2020. 
""Faster is better,"" he said Tuesday, and that view now appears to be gaining traction.
On Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates. When asked what would prevent the central bank raising rates by half a percentage point at the May 3-4 policy meeting, he responded: ""Nothing."" 
Big rate hikes will probably be needed at ""some"" of the remaining six Fed meetings this year, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Tuesday, as noted the ongoing impact of snarled supply chains on prices and echoed Powell's concerns that Russia's Ukraine war will push up on already too-high inflation. 
""I find it appealing to front-load some of the needed increases earlier rather than later in the process because it puts policy in a better position to adjust if the economy evolves differently than expected,"" she said. 
By year end, Mester said, rates should be about 2.5%, and rates need to rise further next year to bring inflation down. 
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, among the more dovish of the U.S. central bank policymakers, was not asked about a possible half-point rate hike in a virtual event at the Brookings Institution earlier Tuesday. 
But she did say she wants to march rates higher, to a neutral level and perhaps above, to prevent high inflation from getting embedded
All said they believed higher borrowing costs could also cool super-hot demand for labor without biting into jobs growth.
The comments have prompted a flood of bets in futures markets on half-point interest rate increases in May and June. Traders now see the federal funds rate rising to the 2.25%-2.5% range by the end of the year - short of Bullard's view but higher than the 1.9% suggested by Fed forecasts last week. 
Powell argued the economy is strong enough to withstand higher borrowing costs without damaging the labor market and argued the best thing the Fed could do to ensure continued labor market strength is to get inflation under control. 
But traders are now also building bets that the Fed will start cutting interest rates by 2024, pricing of futures contracts shows. 
""The fixed income market squarely does not believe Powell's economic optimism: It is telling us that a soft landing, if the Fed goes down Powell's path, will not only be challenging - it will be impossible,"" wrote Roberto Perli, an economist at Piper Sandler. 
'HAWKISH PIVOT'
It's shaping up to be a rocky start for the Fed's first round of rate hikes in three years, and particularly for the way its policymakers are communicating it.
Ahead of last week's interest rate increase, Powell had said the Fed would proceed ""carefully"" due to high uncertainty about the impact on the U.S. economy of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
In his news conference following the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy statement and projections, Powell said the Fed must be ""nimble"" in responding to the evolving outlook.
And this week the Fed chief downplayed worries over the potential dent to economic growth and focused far more sharply on the likelihood the war in Ukraine could worsen U.S. inflation, which has hit a 40-year high and is about three times the central bank's 2% target. 
The changes, wrote NatWest economist Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), could reflect Powell's ongoing personal ""hawkish pivot"" that began in late 2021. 
""In the near-term, Powell's comments are obviously not the last word as for the size of the expected rate hike in May, especially since the May FOMC meeting is not for another six weeks and Fed actions will be driven by the data,"" Cummins wrote.
They may also reflect a broader sense inside the Fed that rates can rise quite far and not push the economy into a downturn, a feat the Fed achieved in the 1990s -- especially with labor markets as strong as they are now.

Job openings are at a near-record high, and employers are fighting so hard to hire employees, even from competitors, that Mester says one of her directors calls it the ""Great Poaching.""
Mester said she is ""very optimistic"" that the Fed can reduce excess demand for workers without reducing economic activity or jobs.

Reforming the current system, Pension Fund Administrators (AFP), was one of the biggest demands demonstrators had during the 2019 protests. One of the biggest complaints against the system is its low-paying pensions.
Leftist President Gabriel Boric proposed eliminating the private system in favor of a public one in his government plan, but Marcel refrained from specifics during a presentation before deputies. 
The finance minister pointed out that one of the problems of the current system is the low level of contributions from workers and companies compared to other countries. When it came to the reform, he said that the government was going to start a ""social dialogue"" to find governing principles for a new system.
""From there we are going to work on a reform project that can reach Congress during the next year,"" Marcel said.
""We don't want this consultation process to go beyond a couple of months, because we are aware that there is a lot of anxiety to finally see a proposal on the table.""

Congress has also approved three partial withdrawals of pension savings to help households during the pandemic, and a new withdrawal is currently under discussion.
Boric's government, which took power on March 11, has a complicated agenda filled with promises of social reforms while struggling with a sputtering economy after it registered historic growth last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Travel Association on Tuesday urged the White House to lift COVID-19 travel restrictions and repeal a mandate requiring masks on airplanes and in other transit modes by April 18, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
In a letter to Dr. Ashish Jha, the incoming White House COVID response coordinator, the group called for an immediate end to the pre-departure testing requirement for all fully vaccinated inbound international persons and ending the mask mandate by April 18 ""or announcing a plan and timeline to repeal the federal mask mandate within the subsequent 90 days.""
The White House did not immediately comment.
""It makes little sense to keep the pre-departure testing requirement in place for inbound air travelers when the U.S. government does not require negative tests at U.S-Canada and U.S.-Mexico land border points of entry,"" wrote U.S. Travel Chief Executive Roger Dow.
The travel industry also wants the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to end ""avoid travel"" advisories for all vaccinated individuals and urged the Biden administration to avoid the future ""use of travel bans from specific countries.""
In total, the CDC urges Americans to avoid travel to about 120 countries and territories.
It also calls by June 1 to ""develop benchmarks and timelines for a pathway to the new normal that repeals pandemic-focused travel restrictions"" including ending all remaining restrictions, including international vaccine and testing mandates.
Earlier this month, the Biden administration extended requirements for travelers to wear masks on airplanes, trains and in transit hubs through April 18 as public health authorities review when mask requirements should be dropped.

The mask requirements have resulted in significant friction on U.S. airplanes.
The CDC said last week that 99.5% of the U.S. population is in a location where COVID levels are low enough that people do not need to wear masks.

(Reuters) - Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester on Tuesday said she would like to raise interest rates to about 2.5% by year end, with bigger rate hikes in the first half, and further tightening next year to bring down high inflation and keep it from getting entrenched.
""I find it appealing to front-load some of the needed increases earlier rather than later in the process because it puts policy in a better position to adjust if the economy evolves differently than expected,"" Mester said in remarks prepared for delivery at John Carroll University. ""If by the middle of the year, inflation is not beginning to moderate, we could speed up our rate increases. But if inflation is moving down faster than expected, we could slow the pace of rate increases in the second half of the year compared to the first half."" 
The Fed raised rates last week by a quarter of a percentage point, to a target range of 0.25% to 0.5%, a move Mester said she strongly supported. Her remarks added to a rising chorus supporting a faster pace at coming Fed meetings. 

Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Monday said the Fed should raise rates ""expeditiously"" toward neutral and, if needed, above it. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine adds to upward pressure on inflation, Mester said, which is already running at a 40-year high and three times the Fed's 2% inflation target. ""With inflation already at very high levels and demand outstripping supply, there are rising risks that too-high inflation will become embedded in the economy and persist,"" she said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British government bond issuance will fall closer towards pre-pandemic norms in the coming financial year, when the market's biggest buyer over the last decade - the Bank of England - will move to the sidelines, according to a Reuters poll of primary dealers.
The Debt Management Office's 2022/23 gilt issuance remit is likely to show about 147 billion pounds ($193.8 billion) of bond sales, compared with 194.8 billion pounds in the current year, according to the median forecast in the poll.
The remit is due to be published on Wednesday, shortly after finance minister Rishi Sunak delivers his Spring Statement budget update to parliament.
British public borrowing with just one month left in the current financial year was less than half its level from a year earlier, official data showed on Tuesday, putting Sunak in a fairly comfortable spot as he prepares new forecasts.
Gilt issuance in the five financial years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic averaged about 125 billion pounds a year, before desperate measures to prevent the collapse of Britain's economy pushed bond sales to a record 485.8 billion pounds in 2020/21.
For the first time since 2009, the BoE will not be an active buyer via its quantitative easing (QE) programme, through which it ended up owning more than half the conventional gilts in issue in exchange for newly created central bank reserves.
The BoE has already started to reduce its 875 billion pound stock of gilts by allowing maturing bonds to roll off its balance sheet and has said it will consider active sales when the Bank Rate reaches 1%, from 0.75% presently.
A BoE survey of investors last week showed they expect active sales to start later this year.
""Despite the sequential decline in the gilt remit, the overall issuance to the private market - gross supply minus gross QE - is expected to show the largest such increase in the past decade,"" UBS strategist Rohan Khanna said, citing a figure of around 80 billion pounds.
Primary dealers, or banks appointed by the government to help create a market for its debt, stressed uncertainty in their predictions about the outlook for government finances.
Rampant inflation pressures, increases in both taxation and borrowing costs, and the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine on global commodity and energy prices make economic forecasting a tricky task right now.
The amount of overfunding - funds from debt sales that exceeded the government's financing need in 2021/22 - that will be carried over into 2022/23, and how much of that Sunak might on Wednesday use to help households facing the biggest squeeze in real incomes in at least 30 years, are additional uncertainties. 
Forecasts for the 2022/23 remit ranged between 108.0 billion pounds and 211.2 billion pounds. 

The poll suggested the DMO will plan to issue a similar mix of short, medium, long and index-linked gilts as in the current financial year.
The budget deficit in 2022/23 looks likely to fall to around 100 billion pounds from about 161 billion pounds forecast for the current financial year, the poll showed.

(Reuters) - San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said Tuesday she believes the ""main risk"" to the U.S. economy is from too-high inflation that could get worse as Russia's invasion of Ukraine boosts oil prices and China's crackdown on COVID-19 further disrupts supply chains.
""Even though we have these uncertainties around Ukraine, and we have the uncertainties around the pandemic, it's still time to tighten policy in the United States,"" Daly said at a virtual Brookings Institution event, ""marching"" rates up to the neutral level and perhaps even higher to a level that would restrict the economy to ensure inflation comes back down. 
""Inflation has persisted for long enough that people are starting to wonder how long it will persist,"" she said. ""I'm already focused on let's make sure this doesn't get embedded and we see those longer-term inflation expectations drift up.""
The Fed last week raised rates for the first time in three years, and signaled ongoing rate hikes ahead. Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Monday said the central bank needs to move rates ""expeditiously"" higher in remarks widely understood to signal more aggressive tightening at coming meetings. 
Daly on Tuesday said the labor market is tight enough to be unsustainable, pointing to worker churn including new hires who ""ghost"" their new employers by not showing up because they have other options. 

""In addition to pushing up wage inflation, which could ultimately push up price inflation, putting us in sort of a vicious cycle,"" she said, ""it's just not a very sustainable way to manage the economy."" 
She said she sought a ""smooth landing"" for the labor market as rate hikes help bring down inflation

725,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 02:09PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Two days after President Vladimir Putin sent his armed forces into Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti published an article that assumed imminent victory. It celebrated “a new era,” marked by the end of Western domination, the severing of bonds between the U.S. and continental Europe and the return of Russia to its rightful “space and place” in the world.
As the war rages on, heralding the arrival of a single Russian World to unite Ukraine with Belarus and Russia looks at best premature. RIA Novosti soon took the article down. But the author was right about one thing: Putin’s decision to invade does appear to be changing the international order, just not necessarily in the way he planned.
From Berlin to London and Baltic capitals like Tallinn, the metrics of defending Europe have been torn up. A large scale war is no longer unthinkable and nations are reconsidering what they spend, what they buy, and how they would need to fight.
Rather than split from the U.S., NATO’s European members have cleaved to it. Rather than shrink to its pre-expansion size of the 1990s — as Putin demanded before his invasion — the alliance is positioning more personnel on its frontiers. NATO has sent about an additional 3,000 troops to its eastern flank, as well as helicopters, tanks and fighter jets, to deter any potential Kremlin decision to expand the battlefield.
“No matter how this war turns out — and as cynical as it sounds now — historians will say that Putin’s attack on Ukraine gave Europe the time it needed to recover so it could confront Russia and, further down the road, China,” said General Richard Barrons, a former commander of the U.K.’s Joint Forces Command. “Ukraine is paying a high price to buy us time.”
The big question for Europe will be what it does with that time. Germany’s commitment to spend an additional 100 billion euros ($110 billion) is only the most obvious example of stepping up militarily, one that has implications for the balance of power within Europe, as well as with Russia.
Others are upping their defense budgets, too, including the three tiny Baltic States, which have long rung the alarm bell over Putin. They are also asking NATO for permanent bases, as well as long-range anti-aircraft systems, even if it’s less clear they’ll get them.
None of that suggests a return to stability in Europe, but a recognition of its loss. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine “is a post-imperial, post-colonial land grab,” Fiona Hill, the former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the U.S. National Security Council, said last week at the Metropolitan State University of Denver. “If we let this happen, we’re setting a precedent for the future.” 
Those extra billions can be spent effectively, or not. As the initial shock of the war and inspirational impact of the Ukrainian resistance inevitably fades, NATO’s unity and determination may do so too.
Putin may yet be able to achieve some of his goals and there’s every indication he may choose isolation for Russia — and permanent instability for Ukraine and Europe — over acknowledging his mistake. Defeat could call into question his political survival.
“It is still a race,” said David Shlapak, senior defense researcher at the Rand Corporation, a U.S. think tank. “It is a race where they have motivated us to start running, but it is still a competition that neither side is pre-ordained to win or lose. There are a lot of cards that still need to be played on the NATO side to figure that out.”
Shlapak was responsible for a war game Rand conducted after Russia’s annexation of Ukraine in 2014, to predict out what would happen if Russia were to invade the three Baltic states. The results made news headlines because they were sobering: Russian forces would reach the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian capitals in 60 hours.
In a “fait accompli,” they would also close the so-called Suwalki Gap — a land corridor that runs from the border of Belarus to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad — before other, larger NATO allies had time to respond.
It’s natural to be skeptical of such a lightning attack after the events in Ukraine over the past three weeks, but also too early to say what the war will change among the assumptions fed into Rand’s war game, said Shlapak. Russia’s leaders and commanders would surely go about an attack on NATO very differently. 
Still, the Russian military has been mauled and its stock of precision guided missiles depleted. Barring a catastrophic escalation of the current conflict, that should make a Russian war of choice with NATO less likely in future than it was before Feb. 24, according to Michael Mazarr, a former special assistant to the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
For sure, in three or five years, Putin’s generals will have learned lessons, regrouped and rearmed, he said, but they’ll be hobbled by sanctions that limit access to technologies and finance. NATO would be rearming too.
That, said Mazarr, is where the more worrying change to Europe’s security order comes in. Stability between great powers depends on reaching some mutual agreement to maintain the status quo, he said. That was achieved even with the Soviet Union after the 1960s, but never with Putin’s Russia. And, whatever the wisdom of NATO’s post-Cold War expansion, such a deal may now be impossible.
After Ukraine, “there is no treating the kind of regime that’s in the Kremlin as a geopolitical partner,” said Mazarr. “We are now locked into an indefinite confrontation with an increasingly humiliated, hyper-nationalistic and dangerous great power in decline.”
Concern in Washington has focused on whether China decides to help Russia evade sanctions and reequip, a move that would invite further U.S. sanctions and accelerate the world’s redivision into economic and geopolitical blocs. China has denied Moscow even asked for help and so far there are few concrete signs that it will.
In front-line NATO states, defense officials are less focused on Russian military snafus in Ukraine and more on the evidence that Putin can act on false assumptions.
“Russia wants to restore this Soviet type bloc of states in this part of the world,” said Brigadier General Riho Ühtegi, commander of the Estonian Defense League, a volunteer reserve of 19,000 adults and 6,000 cadets. “Maybe we are not next – there is Moldova and still Georgia, there’s a frozen conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and there’s Kazakhstan — there are many places Russia has to do something. But we have to be ready.”
Ühtegi said he’s received about 1,000 applications to join his force since the invasion of Ukraine began, half from women. He’s also planning to buy more of the anti-tank weapons and shoulder fired anti-aircraft missiles that the Ukrainians have deployed to such effect.
Most of all, though, Ühtegi is convinced that events have proved wrong Rand’s assumptions about how such a war would in fact play out in the Baltics. No doubt Russian forces would move quickly to the capitals, but the war would — as in Ukraine — be fought behind Russian lines and in cities. It would not be a done deal. “If NATO forces took a while to come they would not be coming to occupied territory,” said Ühtegi. “They would be coming to a war zone.”
The Baltics always believed Russia posed a military threat and were often seen as alarmist — if not paranoid — in capitals further west and south. However unlikely a Russian decision to take on NATO may still seem, Lithuania’s prime minister joined the country’s paramilitary force this month. But it isn’t so much in the Baltic States or Poland where the invasion of Ukraine is forcing a fundamental rethink on security.
In addition to Germany’s new fund, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz committed to increase annual defense spending to at least NATO’s 2% of GDP target, from 1.53% last year — an undershoot that’s been a source of tension with successive U.S. administrations. Based on current German GDP, that would represent an annual increase of $21 billion, about a third of Russia’s entire defense budget.
Putin’s invasion has had such an impact across Europe because everyone suddenly understood that distance offers less protection in an age of hypersonic weapons and cyber, information and economic warfare, according to Barrons, the retired British general, who is now co-chairman of Universal Defence & Security Solutions, a strategy consultancy. “It’s a 90 minute journey,” he said, “and there are cruise missiles over London.”

726,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 01:45PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Russia offered to pay compensation to owners of jets commandeered by the country, in a bid to smooth relations with leasing firms that stand to lose billions of dollars on rented aircraft they can’t get back.
Authorities in Moscow are seeking ways to legally get round sanctions that require international companies to recall their planes, Transport Minister Vitaly Savelyev said Tuesday. Options include payments or the outright purchase of the jets, he said.
Lessors have so far been unwilling to negotiate on the matter, according to Savelyev. That’s most likely because any financial accord with Russian airlines would appear to present a clear breach of the sanctions.
“We are not losing hope but we are not giving them back, because that would mean to leave oneself without aviation,” Savelyev said.
Leasing firms doing business in Russia have demanded the return of hundreds of Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. jetliners under economic sanctions imposed by European Union and U.S. authorities in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Under EU rules, the owners have until March 28 to cancel contracts, but have no way to repossess the planes after Russia moved to keep them within its borders. 
Russia, meanwhile, faces the prospect of an aviation market cut off from many international markets, leaving the country without access to foreign aircraft, spare parts or services provided by foreign firms.
Lessors caught in the middle stand to lose as much as $10 billion as the value of their fleet in Russia declines. The offer to purchase the planes would ease the impact and give Russian airlines a potential pathway for re-establishing business ties after the crisis passes. But moving forward would put foreign lessors at risk of being penalized by authorities in the U.S., EU or other jurisdictions.
Lost Planes 
Russia has moved almost 800 aircraft to the local register, according to Savlelyev. Bermuda and Ireland, where many of them have been registered, have suspended the airworthiness certificates of planes tied to Russia. The minister said 78 planes have been “lost” after being seized overseas. 
International flights that remain possible even after widespread airspace closures are being operated by Russian-owned aircraft, including almost 150 Sukhoi Superjet 100s and 44 Boeing and Airbus models, he said.
The minister warned that sourcing parts for the remaining planes will become an issue and said authorities are examining how Iran managed to maintain flights under years of restrictions. He said Russia had 1,367 aircraft in total.
Aviation consultancy Ishka said the transfer of the leased fleet to the Russia registry could be seen as a step toward the state-seizure of foreign-owned planes.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Red-hot inflation has Canadians opening their wallets wider at the grocery store and gas pump, but that's not stopping them from also spending on travel, new cars and home improvements as pent-up demand outweighs cost pressures, at least for now.
Household consumption was the top contributor to Canada's economic growth last year, according to official data, as consumers embarked on a historic spending spree. The Bank of Canada sees the binge continuing to drive the economy in 2022 even as it kicked off a tightening cycle this month.
But record mortgage debt and higher interest rates, coupled with the prices of everyday essentials rising at their fastest pace in three decades, risk putting a damper on all this spending, and that could curb economic growth.
Consumers, however, have shrugged off the spiraling prices so far and once again are ramping up their discretionary spending, according to interviews with retailers, car dealers, real estate agents and economists.
""Canadians have solid balance sheets, they've racked up ample savings and, for the most part, confidence is holding up,"" said Rannella Billy-Ochieng', an economist at RBC Economics.
RBC has pegged excess savings in Canada as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic at more than C$300 billion ($238.5 billion), enough to help consumers hedge against the rising cost of living, said Billy-Ochieng'. 
The Bank of Canada expects Canadians to draw down roughly C$40 billion of those excess savings through the end of 2023. Consumer spending intentions hit their highest level on record in the fourth quarter of 2021, the central bank said.
The result will be a tsunami of consumer activity unleashed on the Canadian economy, assuming inflation - currently running at 5.7% annually and set to go higher - is contained and geopolitical tensions do not broaden. 
CARS AND TRIPS
At Sean's Auto Sales in Ottawa, owner Sean Liu said consumers are clamoring for gently used cars despite record high fuel costs and hefty price increases. 
""Sometimes I have two or three people fighting over one car,"" Liu said. 
The car buying frenzy is fueled by pent-up demand after months of low inventory due to a global semi-conductor chip shortage, said Huw Williams of the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association. With car lots filling back up, Williams sees a surge in sales followed by more normal buying patterns.
Tourism has also benefited, with travel spending touching pre-pandemic levels for the first time in February, according to RBC's consumer spending tracker.
""People are seizing the moment to travel,"" said Susan Catto, head of publishing and production at Travelzoo Canada, adding that most of the would-be travelers are buying trips they can take right away.
Catto expects bookings to increase considerably as pandemic-related border restrictions ease.
Canadians took out record mortgage debt during the pandemic, sending house prices surging 52% in just two years. With interest rates now rising, some 73% of Canadians are concerned about the impact on their living expenses, according to an Angus Reid survey this month for accounting firm Grant Thornton.
Nearly half of respondents said they could not afford an extra C$100 of debt payments per month.
""Some people have absolutely no financial room to spare,"" said Freida Richer, a partner at Grant Thornton.
Established homeowners, however, have more breathing room. Higher property prices mean they are willing to spend a lot more on renovating their homes than in pre-pandemic times, said Tim Priddle, co-owner of the WoodSource, a lumber and millwork shop in Ottawa.
But Priddle expects demand for large home renovations to cool later this year as spending priorities shift again.

""A lot of people in 2023 will probably say 'let's go on a holiday to Europe' rather than renovate the backyard,"" he said.

According to the survey, 24 of 26 analysts expect the Bank of Mexico, also known as Banxico, to raise its key rate by 50 basis points to 6.50%. One participant projected the central bank would increase the rate by only 25 basis points and another projected a 75-point hike.

""The conditions for a new tightening are clear. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has had an adverse effect on inflation and financial conditions in a context of challenges on both fronts,"" Grupo Financiero Banorte said in an analyst note. Headline inflation in Mexico accelerated in February above expectations and again far exceeded the official target of 3%. 
Core inflation, which removes some volatile items from consideration, reached its highest level in 20 years. Last week, the Fed raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point and its chair, Jerome Powell, said on Monday that going forward the U.S. central bank could act more aggressively if necessary to combat the rise in inflation. Mexico's central bank, which in its last six meetings has increased the key rate by a total of 200 basis points to its current level of 6%, will publish its second monetary policy statement on Thursday at 1 p.m. local time (19:00 GMT).

(Reuters) -The European Union raised over 12 billion euros ($13.24 billion) in a debt sale on Tuesday, as investors wait to see if the bloc will unveil a new joint borrowing plan to tackle member states' funding needs following the invasion of Ukraine.
The bloc drew over 59 billion euros in demand for a new 10-year bond backing its coronavirus recovery fund, which raised 10 billion euros, the European Commission said in a statement. 
Though that is the lowest level of outright demand the EU has seen since it launched debt sales backing its recovery fund last summer, the bloc increased the size of the issue from an initial 8 billion euros announced earlier on Tuesday in a memo seen by Reuters. 
The EU also received 35 billion euros in demand for a 15-year bond backing its SURE unemployment scheme - the first jointly financed fund it launched early on in the pandemic - which raised 2.17 billion euros, the Commission said. 
It is the EU's first major bond sale since a Bloomberg report earlier in March suggested the bloc could soon unveil a new plan for further joint bond issuance to finance energy and defence spending in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
A new fund would add to the up-to 100 billion euro SURE unemployment scheme and up-to 800 billion euro recovery fund the EU launched during the pandemic in unprecedented acts of fiscal solidarity. 
France is leading calls for new EU debt, while Germany and other wealthier member states oppose further joint borrowing. 
European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said on Tuesday he sees a real discussion about new joint borrowing taking place in a few weeks, once the bloc has a clearer view of the economic impact of the crisis.
Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank, noted that the SURE bond, which is classified as a social bond, one type of ESG debt, received much higher demand relative to the amount on offer. 
""If you can put an ESG stamp on whatever fund you start to do, you will get really high demand for the bonds,"" he said, referring to the potential new borrowing. 
The 10-year bond priced for a yield of 1.02% and the 15-year bond for a yield of 1.199%, the European Commission said. 
News of a potential new borrowing plan helped lower the risk premiums on Italian and other southern European government bonds despite the Ukraine war and at a time when the European Central Bank plans to cut back the stimulus which is a key support plank for southern Europe. 

The news also boosted the single currency and euro zone stock markets.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo will travel to Europe next week to coordinate sanctions with allies over Russia's assault on Ukraine and discuss next steps with partners, including targeting critical sectors of the Russian economy, a Treasury Department spokesperson told Reuters.
Adeyemo will meet with counterparts responsible for sanctions in London, Brussels, Paris and Berlin between March 28 and April 1, the spokesperson said, as Washington looks to ramp up pressure on Russia over the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two.
The spokesperson said the visit would follow up on President Joe Biden's visits this week to Brussels and Poland to coordinate an international response to Russia's invasion - an assault that Moscow calls a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbor.
Adeyemo's trip will also pursue efforts to find and seize assets of Russian elites through a newly created Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force, the spokesperson said.
The United States, Australia, Canada, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom launched REPO last week to collect and share information to be used against the oligarchs, the Treasury said in a statement.
The United States and its allies have imposed several rounds of sanctions, including against major banks and Russian President Vladimir Putin, since the assault on Ukraine began nearly four weeks ago.
While the Treasury declined to specify which sectors might be targeted next, a debate is brewing in Europe about hitting Russia's energy sector https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-mull-russian-oil-embargo-with-biden-set-join-talks-2022-03-21, which Washington has warned it could target further.
Daleep Singh, deputy U.S. national security adviser for economics, has said Washington can still expand its sanctions to include more targets, banks and sectors that have yet to be touched.
""The commanding heights of the Russian economy. It's mostly about oil and gas, but there are other sectors too,"" Singh told the CBS television program ""60 Minutes"" in an interview broadcast on Sunday.
Washington has slapped sanctions on Russia's central bank, major lenders and Russian oligarchs, among others, and Biden this month imposed an immediate ban on Russian oil and other energy imports.

But the European Union's foreign ministers disagreed on Monday on whether and how to slap sanctions on Russia's lucrative energy sector, with Germany saying the bloc was too dependent on Russian oil to decide an embargo.
Targeting Russian energy exports, as the United States and Britain have done, is a divisive choice for the 27-nation EU, which relies on Russia for 40% of its gas.

Russia describes its military action as a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. The government in Kyiv and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for invasion.
The conflict presents a big economic shock for the global economic outlook, including Europe and Serbia, the IMF said in a statement after completing its review of a non-financial and an advisory deal with Belgrade.
""It is expected to weigh on Serbia's economic recovery through supply chain disruptions, higher global commodity prices, effects on global financial conditions, confidence, and lower growth of trading partners,"" it said. 
The lender said that Serbia's medium-term outlook, ""while uncertain, remains favourable, supported by the authorities' commitment to structural reforms"".
""Immediate policy priorities are to preserve macro-fiscal and financial stability,"" it said. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the Serbian economy contracted mildly in 2020 and rebounded by 7.4% in 2021. 
Driven by food and global energy prices, Serbia's inflation picked up to 8.8% in February. Core inflation remained at 4.4%. 
The IMF said that Serbia's fiscal performance in 2021 was stronger than expected, boosted by recovering tax revenues. 
The fiscal deficit last year narrowed to 4.1% of gross domestic product and public debt declined to 57.2 % of GDP. Serbia's economy is expected to grow around 4.5% in 2022. 

To ensure stability and growth, the government in Belgrade, which faces general elections on April 3, should ""preserve macro-fiscal and financial stability and mitigate the impact of the ongoing external shock,"" the IMF said. 
""Although the magnitude of the impact is difficult to forecast at this stage, (IMF) staff will revise growth projections down relative to the previous review, with risks tilted to the downside,"" it said.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The National Bank of Hungary raised its base rate by 100 basis points to 4.4% on Tuesday, the biggest hike in the rate since 2008, saying rising energy costs and the war in Ukraine had fuelled inflation risks.
The bank, which raised its inflation forecasts for both 2022 and 2023, said average inflation could rise to 7.5%-9.8% this year and inflation would come back to the bank's 3% target only in the first half of 2024.
Economic growth will likely be slower than expected this year with the war hitting growth directly through disruption to international supply chains and trade channels and through rising commodity prices, it added.
""The Russia-Ukraine war has posed a much higher risk than usual to the outlook for inflation. The increase in inflation risks warrants a further tightening of monetary conditions,"" the Monetary Council said in a statement.
The rate increase was bigger than analysts' median forecast for a 75 bps hike in both its base rate and the overnight deposit rate in a Reuters poll last week. The bank hiked all interest rates by 100 basis points.
The bank said strong domestic demand may partly offset the adverse effects of the Russia-Ukraine war on growth but exports are expected to make a smaller-than-expected contribution to GDP in 2022 because of supply chain disruptions.
""Depending on the duration of the war and the policy of sanctions, GDP is likely to expand at a slower rate than expected, by 2.5%-4.5% percent in 2022,"" the bank said.
Hungarian headline inflation continued its surge in February, hitting 8.3%, despite government-imposed price caps on some basic foods, fuel and energy. 
Strong price pressures across Central Europe have been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, which sent the region's currencies -- including the forint -- to record lows versus the euro earlier this month.
The forint firmed to 371.27 from 371.65 on the rate announcement. It has recovered from record lows of 400 this month, helped by the NBH's pledge that it would use all tools at its disposal to shore up the markets.
Analysts said the inflation risks clearly warranted further rate hikes.

""We think that the recent deterioration in the inflation outlook argues in favour of further large hikes,"" Liam Peach at Capital Economics said in a note.
""We expect the base rate to rise above 6% and short-term interest rates towards 8% in the coming months, but there’s a risk of rates rising more quickly if the forint suffers fresh large falls.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese turned off neon signs, dimmed their lights and dialled down thermostats on Tuesday after the government issued an urgent call to save energy to avoid blackouts after an earthquake last week caused a serious power shortage. 
Up to 3 million households faced the threat of blackouts on Tuesday night, as utility Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) warned of tight supply and surging demand as snow fell across Tokyo and the temperature dropped to 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 Fahrenheit).
But by later in evening, the country appeared likely to avoid blackouts, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said. Still, authorities were keeping a power-supply warning in place for Wednesday, public broadcaster NHK said, meaning the world's no.3 economy could still face blackouts.
A similar warning for the northeastern area was lifted, NHK said.
A magnitude 7.4 earthquake last week off the northeastern coast - the same region devastated by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011 - temporarily cut power to about 2 million households, including hundreds of thousands in Tokyo.
""At this rate, we are coming closer to a state where we will have to conduct power outages similar to those that took place after the quake,"" the trade minister, Koichi Hagiuda, said earlier on Tuesday. 
The quake hit six thermal plants, knocking them out of operation in areas served by Tepco and Tohoku Electric Power Co, and the damage could leave some of them idle for weeks or even months, Hagiuda said.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno earlier called on residents in eastern Japan affected by the power crisis to do their part, including by lowering thermostats to around 20C (68F) and switching off unnecessary lights.
Numerous users responded to the call.
National broadcaster NHK dimmed its studio lights while electronics retailer Bic Camera turned off about half of the televisions at dozens of its stores.
The 634-metre (693-yard) Tokyo Skytree tower turned off its lights for the whole day for the first time and operators of the city-centre Tokyo Tower lit up only its bottom half.
'RESTART NUCLEAR POWER'
Retail giant Seven & I Holdings said 8,500 7-Eleven stores set their thermostats to 20C - one degree cooler than usual - while its Ito-Yokado supermarkets were dimming their lights by 10%. 
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor said it was using an in-house power generator for 13 hours at its factory north of the capital.
Many individual consumers also did their bit.
""I use the heater a lot so I will try to do my part to save energy,"" said college student Shuntaro Ishinabe, 22.
Government spokesperson Matsuno said the request to save energy was unlikely to extend beyond Tuesday, given an expected rise in temperatures and the addition of more solar power generation as the weather improved.
Japan has faced a tough energy market since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami crippled Tepco's Fukushima Daiichi plant, causing the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl and leading to the suspension of operations at most of Japan's nuclear reactors.
With energy prices surging on tight global supply and the Ukraine crisis, Japan's biggest business lobby, Keidanren, has been calling for a swift restart of the nuclear plants.

""A sudden halt of energy causes a lot of problems, and I think (the general public) has really felt the importance of energy security given recent events,"" Keidanren Chairman Masakazu Tokura said.
""Given the larger trend to become carbon neutral and cut back on greenhouse gases, I believe there will be more difficulties unless we restart nuclear power plants swiftly.""

Investing.com -- What happens when an economic necessity becomes a luxury?
Europe is at its wits’ end trying to square the circle: to put pressure on Vladimir Putin to stop his assault on Ukraine, it needs to stop sending money in return for oil and gas imports. But if the oil and gas imports stop, then the European economy will collapse.
Governments all across Europe are scrambling to find ways to ease the pain for consumers who are facing record costs for motoring, and with good reason. High fuel prices can quickly bring social instability, as refinery blockades in the U.K. and the ‘Yellow Vests’ movement in France have proved within the last few years. Given the extreme emergency facing Europe right now, it cannot afford such distractions.
Last week, gasoline prices in Europe ranged from as little as 1.46 a liter in Poland to 2.26 a liter in Germany. That’s equivalent to a range of $7.36 to $11.38 a gallon. Any U.S. drivers feeling miffed at record high gas of $4.25 a gallon might want to bear in mind that, during the early stages of the pandemic when crude prices briefly fell below zero, German gas prices bottomed at $5.90 a gallon.
There’s a one-word explanation for the difference: tax. Taxes can account for anything up to 75% of what a European driver pays to fill up the tank, the result of years of policy-making that has tried to incentivize fuel efficiency and the use of public transport. That means that there is plenty of scope for government action to make a difference.
A raft of cuts in fuel duty are consequently coming down the line. France has said it will cut 15 euro cents a liter off duty on gasoline for the next four months. On Wednesday, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is widely expected to announce a similarly time-bound 5 pence per liter cut in duty, while Italy’s Prime Minister, the former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, intends to cut fuel duty by 25 cents a liter for one month.
The French and Italian cuts alone are bigger than the entire gasoline tax usually levied by the likes of Maryland and Georgia, two states which have suspended collecting the tax while prices are so high. It’s the same situation in other states such as New York and Illinois, which are also considering similar measures.
In Germany, Finance Minister Christian Lindner has proposed a rebate system which would see the government reimburse retailers for cutting pump prices. His coalition partners – the left-wing Social Democrats and Greens, who tend to drive fewer gas-guzzling SUVs – don’t like the idea, but have yet to come up with anything better.
Temporary tax cuts can make sense: fuel prices tend not to stay so painfully high because people cut back on consumption, causing prices to fall again. But these are also political timetables. The French cut will expire conveniently after the presidential election vote in April, while Sunak’s measures are made all the more necessary by the fact that other household energy tariffs as well as some income-related taxes are set to go up in April. Something has to give.
More worryingly, the risk – as ever – is that measures originally intended as temporary become permanent due to the difficulty of reversing them. Right now, with every day that passes, the notion that the war in Ukraine can be brought to a quick end, and that sanctions on key oil exporter Russia can be lifted, looks more and more fanciful.
Indeed, if anything, the reverse is happening: EU leaders are set to discuss tightening their sanctions on Russia at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday, with an increasing number wanting an outright ban on purchases of Russian oil, which ensures a steady flow of hard currency to the Kremlin (U.S. President Joe Biden will also be in town to stiffen their resolve, in the teeth of ongoing opposition from Germany and Hungary).
Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister and Energy Minister Alexander Novak tried to pre-empt such a move on Monday, saying it could drive crude prices as high as $300 a barrel. History, however, suggests that importers will run out of money to buy it long before then, triggering a sharp global slowdown and an equally sharp reversal in prices.
Bank of America’s commodities research head Francisco Blanch told Bloomberg on Monday that he sees prices peaking at only half that level but concedes that the war has added $25-$30 to all his forecast scenarios.
The pain is real. The only questions are – does the West think it is worth it, and how long can it take it?"

Russian destruction of Ukraine's main cities, infrastructure and industrial sites will require enormous funds to rebuild after the war, EU officials have said. 
""Bearing in mind the destruction and enormous losses brought upon Ukraine by Russia's military aggression, the European Union is committed to provide support to the Ukrainian Government for its immediate needs and, once the Russian onslaught has ceased, for the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine,"" the leaders will say following a summit on Mar. 24-25, according to a draft summit statement seen by Reuters.
""To that end, the European Council agrees to set up a Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund and calls for preparations to start without delay,"" it said, without naming its size. 
The task will be made more difficult by the fact that Ukraine is now effectively cut off from international financial markets and its hryvnia currency has collapsed.
Some EU politicians have called for the use of Russian assets frozen by the West, including some $300 billion of Russian central bank reserves, as reconstruction money for Ukraine once the aggression ends.

EU leaders will invite others to contribute to the fund, the draft showed.
""The European Council calls for an international conference to be organised in due time to raise funding under the Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund,"" the EU summit draft conclusions said.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank will likely hold fast to the world's lowest interest rate when it gives its latest monetary policy update on Thursday, resisting an upward trend at other global central banks, according to analysts polled by Reuters.
All 33 economists polled expected the SNB to keep its policy rate locked at minus 0.75%, with the earliest change from any respondent not expected until September.
Although the franc recently rose above parity against the euro, albeit briefly, no one expected the central bank to shift from its ultra-expansive stance employed for the last seven years.
""Parity is more of a buzzword for analysts and financial commentators than it is for a central bank, which looks more at fundamentals,"" said GianLuigi Mandruzzato, an economist at EFG Bank.
""Our model for fair value is one franc buying slightly more than 0.90 of a euro, because of the huge inflation differential over the last 12 to 18 months. So the current rise in the franc is not that big an issue for the SNB.""
SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan and his governing board are also expected to resist pressure to hike rates to combat Swiss inflation, which hit 2.2% in February - above the SNB's 0-2% target and its highest level since 2008.
The SNB's stance is aided by the fact that although Swiss prices have risen, it is not at the same level seen in the euro zone, Britain or the United States, which have recently seen inflation hitting 5.9%, 5.5% and 7.9%, respectively.
The U.S. Federal Reserve reacted last week by raising interest rates for the first time since 2018, while the Bank of England has also hiked.
Most analysts - 10 of 14 who answered the question - expected the SNB to wait for the European Central Bank to start raising interest rates before it followed suit. Currently, markets expect two rate hikes by the ECB this year.
""While Swiss inflation rose above 2% in February for the first time since October 2008, the fact it remains much lower than in the euro zone also means Swiss policymakers are less pressed to tighten policy,"" said David Oxley, at Capital Economics.

Most analysts still expect the SNB to keep its description of the franc as ""highly valued"" and perhaps increase its verbal interventions and foreign currency purchases in future.
""We forecast the SNB to keep interest rates on hold at -0.75% this year,"" said Oxley. ""However, we suspect the SNB will take the cover afforded by the more hawkish global backdrop and ECB to back away from its extreme policy footing next year, and policymakers will raise the policy rate to the heady heights of zero by the end of 2023.""

“The Fed needs to move aggressively to keep inflation under control,” Bullard said in an interview Tuesday on Bloomberg Television with Michael McKee. “We need to get to neutral at least so we’re not putting upward pressure on inflation during this period when we have much higher inflation than we’re used to in the U.S.”
The neutral rate is the level that neither spurs nor restrains inflation.
The Federal Open Market Committee last week voted 8-1 to raise rates by a quarter percentage point for the first time since 2018, with Bullard dissenting in favor of a half-point hike and commencing the roll-off of the central bank’s nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that he and his colleagues were prepared to raise rates by a half point at their May 3-4 meeting if needed as they try to contain the hottest inflation in 40 years.
Asked how quickly the Fed should move, Bullard said “faster is better,” adding that “the 1994 tightening cycle or removal of accommodation cycle is probably the best analogy here.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Two thirds of funds in Luxembourg with heavy Russian exposure have been suspended following the Ukraine invasion, the Grand Duchy's securities regulator said on Tuesday, adding that the sector's Russian exposure is limited to 0.3% of total assets under management.
Claude Marx, director general of the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), which regulates funds in Luxembourg, one of Europe's top fund centres, said total exposure to Russia was 18.2 billion euros ($20.02 billion), with two-thirds in equities and the rest in bonds.
Marx told a conference held by Luxembourg funds industry body ALFI that 61 funds have more than 10% of assets in Russian securities, and 41 are suspended, which means investors cannot take money out.
Western governments have introduced a welter of sanctions to cut ties with Russia. Trading in shares of companies listed in Moscow remain suspended.
Marx said the upheaval to the fund industry from the Ukraine war was less severe than when economies went into lockdown to fight COVID-19 two years ago.
""We haven't seen any other liquidity squeeze or liquidity situation as we have seen in March 2020,"" Marx said.
""That is not to say that it may not happen, if we have lots of corporates that run into treasury problems because of the oil and gas price and then need to create some liquidity by selling money market funds, but we haven't seen anything close to that,"" he said.
The CSSF, along with its British counterpart, the Financial Conduct Authority, is looking into the possible use of so-called ""side pockets"" as a way to segregate Russian and Belarusian assets from other investments.
QUOTAS NEEDED
Marx was also asked about boardroom diversity and he said he was disappointed with efforts by banks to increase the number of women on their boards and that quotas were the only answer.
Only one out of five board members of Luxembourg banks is a woman, and one third of all bank boards have no women at all, Marx said.

""It's quite a disaster from that point of view. We are certainly not in a good situation,"" Marx said.
""We are still in this self-preservation phase where typically old, white man dominates the world regardless of performance... It will not really change without coercive measures and unfortunately, we will need in our industry quotas.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will discuss in a few weeks whether it needs to jointly borrow more money in response to the challenges created by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said on Tuesday.
France and Italy have been pushing for the EU to jointly borrow more cash, on top of the 800 billion euros ($879.52 billion) already agreed for the post-pandemic recovery fund, to deal with a sharp rise in spending on defence and to cut Europe's heavy dependence on Russia for energy. 
""Proposals of this kind were tabled in recent weeks by some European leaders,"" Gentiloni said, speaking via video link at a seminar organised by Oxford University. 
Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and other countries oppose such new borrowing now, arguing that the economic impact of the war in Ukraine is still unclear and that out of the 800 billion recovery fund only 74 billion euros has been disbursed so far.
The 800 billion fund was set up last year to prevent sharp divergences in economic development between euro zone countries as a result of the pandemic, since governments already deep in debt would not be able to borrow as much to finance an economic recovery as those whose debt was low.
France argues that the Ukraine war, like the pandemic, is an exogenous shock that will affect EU countries differently, again creating the risk of exacerbating economic divergences.
""Will the concern about increasing differences among member states, especially in the euro area, bring again a decision on a common tool? It is too soon to be sure,"" Gentiloni said.
""I think the real discussion will take place in a few weeks from now when we will have a clearer view of the economic impact of this crisis. But I think that we can't take this off the table,"" he said.
The European Commission is due to present new economic forecasts for the 27-nation bloc in May that will provide a basis for such a discussion.
But Gentiloni said the sheer size of the new investment needs created by the war in Ukraine were likely to have an impact on the EU's fiscal rules - now under review - as well as the potential for new EU money for that purpose.
""Boosting our defence capabilities will require significant investments in our industrial and technological base,"" he said.

""Financing them will require a more supportive framework of fiscal rules and potentially new tools at the European level,"" Gentiloni said.

There are a number of sectors ""in which further economic activity is not only lawful but also legitimate"", said committee chairman Oliver Hermes on Tuesday.
""Russia, like Ukraine, supplies the world market with much-needed agricultural products such as grain,"" Hermes said. ""Sanctions in this area would lead to further shortages and price increases, and hit the poorest countries in particular.""
There's also the matter of German companies' responsibility for their 280,000 employees in Russia.
""A sale of production facilities is hardly possible at the present time and would play into the hands of market participants from countries that do not implement sanctions against Russia,"" said Hermes.
Western companies have come under pressure to leave Russia, but the healthcare sector, including Germany's Bayer (OTC:BAYRY), has not pulled out completely because medicine and medical devices and equipment are considered necessary for humanitarian reasons and are excluded from sanctions.

Hermes said there were also threats ranging from contractual penalties through to the complete loss of assets and legal consequences for senior employees.
""We therefore firmly reject blanket condemnation of companies that are still active on the Russian market,"" Hermes said.

The Southeast Asian nation has been a regional laggard in attracting foreign investors, in part due to caps on ownership of firms in key sectors and its reputation for red tape.
Consumer groups have complained the lack of foreign competition has resulted in poor services and prohibitively high prices in the Philippines, where a handful of tycoons dominate multiple sectors. 
The new law amends 1935 legislation to remove telecommunications, airlines, shipping, railways and irrigation from sectors in which foreign ownership of companies is restricted to 40%. 
However, the cap will remain in place in areas like power transmission and distribution, water pipelines and sewerage, seaports, petroleum pipelines, and public utility vehicles. 
The amendment was hailed as a positive step towards attracting new businesses. 
""The entry of foreign investors will foster strong competition that will benefit the consumers, create more jobs, expand our economy, and boost our recovery from the disruptions caused by COVID-19,"" the Management Association of the Philippines, a business group, said in a statement.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan stands ready to take further stimulus steps as economic and financial market uncertainty emerges over the Ukraine crisis, policymakers said on Tuesday, as parliament approved a record $900 billion state budget for the next fiscal year.
The passage of the $900 billion budget through parliament paved the way for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's administration to seek yet another spending package to support households facing rising food and fuel bills.
""We will flexibly respond to the needs of further measures, while examining changes in the circumstances,"" Kishida told reporters.
The government has proposed providing cash payouts to low income pensioners, while easing the pain of surging fuel prices through subsidies and tax incentives for consumers.
Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki also said he would respond as appropriate if additional measures were needed, although he said he was not considering compiling an extra stimulus budget now.
""We need to consider compiling an extra budget as well as tapping emergency budget reserves depending on the situation,"" said Natsuo Yamaguchi, head of Kishida's coalition partner. The annual budget lacked steps to cope with rising prices, he said.
Even before passage of the budget for the 12 months from April 1, Kishida has come under pressure from ruling and opposition lawmakers to compile a fresh stimulus.
""Targeted spending aimed at cushioning the impact from fuel and food price hikes could be positive for the economy,"" said Takuya Hoshino, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. 
""The question is how to ensure effective spending.""
Parliament approved the 107.6 trillion yen ($900 billion) package for fiscal 2022 at the fourth-fastest pace for an annual budget in post-war history. Lawmakers voiced few complaints about huge spending to help with the strain on the world's third-biggest economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Kishida said last week the government was ready to take further steps to cushion the blow from rising energy costs - a nod to the growing calls for another stimulus package.
Shortly before the budget was passed, his party's secretary-general, Toshimitsu Motegi, signalled the need for new stimulus, saying the party stood ready to take steps to cushion the blow from rising prices.
Opposition party head Yuichiro Tamaki has called for a new stimulus package worth 20 trillion yen on the assumption that Japan is already experiencing stagflation.
Additional spending will likely be financed by the issue of government bonds, Dai-ichi Life's Hoshino said, a move that would strain Japan's already tattered finances.
Economic growth likely ground to a near halt this quarter as coronavirus curbs and supply disruptions threaten to derail recovery, a recent Reuters poll of economists showed.

Japan's huge public debt - twice the size of its $5 trillion economy - constrains its ability to boost fiscal spending to support the economy.

""A development in the direction of stagflation would be a threat. People and the economy can rely on the government to apply its fiscal tools to avoid stagflation,"" he added in a speech to present his 2022 budget plans.
The government would deploy measures to provide broad economic relief for the German public and could use a variety of tools, Lindner said, adding that a supplementary budget would address spending areas impacted by the war in Ukraine.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan must maintain ultra-loose monetary policy as recent cost-push inflation could hurt the economy, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Tuesday, highlighting a widening gap with the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening plan.
The central bank's increasingly isolated dovish stance helped push the yen below 120 to the dollar on Tuesday for the first time since 2016, drawing a warning from the finance minister against rapid exchange-rate moves.
Kuroda said consumer inflation was expected to accelerate as some firms pass on rising energy and food costs to households.
""Instead of leading to higher wages and corporate profits, such cost-push inflation will weigh on the economy in the long run by hurting corporate profits and households' real income,"" Kuroda told parliament.
While nominal wages may increase ""quite significantly"", the rise in consumer inflation may sap households' purchasing power by pushing down price-adjusted real wages, he added.
""Given recent price developments, we need to patiently maintain our powerful monetary easing,"" Kuroda said.
Kuroda's remarks came in the wake of those by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who pledged on Monday to move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates to keep an upward price spiral from getting entrenched.
A weak yen has become a politically sensitive topic for Japan as it pushes up already rising import costs for energy and raw materials, adding pain to an economy only just emerging from the coronavirus pandemic's wounds.
Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki warned that while a weak yen helped boost exporters' profits, it added a burden to importers and households.
""A weak yen has both positive and negative effects on the economy,"" Suzuki told reporters.
""It's undesirable for currencies to swing sharply ... The government is closely watching how currency moves may affect the economy,"" he added.
As part of efforts to fire up inflation to its elusive 2% target, the BOJ caps long-term borrowing costs at around zero. While it has slowed purchases of government bonds and exchange-traded funds (ETF) in recent years, it continues to hold huge amounts of assets on its balance sheet.

In the event the BOJ decides to reduce its ETF holdings, it will do so in a way that minimises the central bank's losses and any disruption to financial markets, Kuroda said on Tuesday.
But it was premature now to debate an exit from easy policy, including how the BOJ could reduce its ETF holdings, with inflation yet to sustainably hit 2%, he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Companies with more women on their boards are more likely to be on track to meet global climate goals, analysis by investment research and asset manager Arabesque showed on Tuesday.
The study, the first to address the topic, found the most diverse 20% of the world's 1,000 biggest companies were more aligned with a goal of capping global warming at 1.5C (2.7 Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average by 2050.
Hitting that target is crucial to avoid irreversible damage to the planet, U.N. scientists say.
Across the group, including Britain's FTSE, Italy's MIB, the S&P 500, France's CAC, Japan's Nikkei, Germany's DAX and the Nordic OMX, 75% of the more diverse firms were in line with 1.5C.
Arabesque said it gave each company a diversity score by looking at data like board diversity and diversity targets, and a temperature score after checking if the company's climate plans were on course to support the goal.
Barbara Krumsiek, Arabesque board member and former chief executive at asset manager Calvert Investments, said the data showed a strong correlation and backed up academic studies on the issue.
""So far all the data I'm seeing reinforce the original premise that diversity and environmental performance are linked,"" Krumsiek said.
Conversely, 37% of the firms in the least-diverse 20% of companies were headed towards a worst-case 2.7C trajectory or above, and most did not disclose any meaningful data, the research showed.
""For investors, lack of disclosure should be a red flag,"" Krumsiek said. 
The data from companies underpinning the analysis was collated in the ESG Book, a digital source of sustainability data backed by some of the world's top investors, regulators and companies.
The data showed mixed progress on diversity between 2017 and 2021. Almost all companies analysed had committed to diversity policies but far fewer set concrete diversity targets, Arabesque said. 

In Britain, 54% of companies in the FTSE 100 now had diversity targets, an increase of just under a quarter from 2017, while the percentage of the biggest U.S. companies having concrete targets almost tripled over the period to 47%.
Italy's top companies had the lowest percentage of diversity targets, at 35% but rising by a fifth since 2017, while Germany went backwards, with 80% of firms having a target, against 83% in 2017.

Villeroy, who was speaking at a sustainability conference organised by The Economist magazine, said the ECB needed to normalise monetary policy to keep people's inflation expectations anchored.
""It is indeed time to take our foot off the accelerator, as decided during our last governing council. That said, we should not overreact to short-term volatility in energy prices, and instead focus more on underlying inflation and on the medium term,"" he said.
Driven by surging energy prices, euro zone inflation hit a record 5.9% last month. Underlying inflation, which strips out volatile items such as energy and food, is also climbing.
The crisis over Russia's invasion of Ukraine has clouded the inflation outlook further by adding to the pressure on energy and commodities prices.

Villeroy, who is also governor of the French central bank, said the energy transition could effect inflation positively and negatively, but its impact on energy costs was most likely to result in some inflationary pressure.
Climate transition policies were not to blame for the current energy price spike, however, he said, and increases in carbon prices on the European Union's Emissions Trading System explained only 7% of the power price increase in France last year.

Investing.com -- Bond yields continue to push higher after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell puts bigger, faster interest rate hikes in play. The European Central Bank tries to play down stagflation risks as Eurozone governments prepare a round of fuel subsidies.  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) earnings impressed late on Monday, while Carnival (NYSE:CCL)and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) are due to report later. Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) new German factory opens for business. China Evergrande has a shocking new disclosure and a more expensive dollar takes the edge off oil prices ahead of the API's weekly inventory data. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 22nd March. 
1. Powell puts the skids under bonds
U.S. bond yields continued their move higher overnight after one of their biggest one-day gains in a decade on Monday in response to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warning that bigger interest rate hikes may be necessary in the coming months.
Powell had turned markets on their head on Monday by warning that the labor market is “extremely tight” and inflation “much too high”. He said that the Fed “may well reach the conclusion that we need to move more quickly” than currently expected.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield had leaped as much as 17 basis points in response and gained another 3 basis points to trade at 2.35% by 6 AM ET (1000 GMT), its highest since May 2019. The five-year yield, more sensitive to short-term interest rates, is now above the 10-year at 2.38%, while the two-year yield is at 2.19%.
Look for further comment on the outlook from NY Fed chief John Williams, Cleveland’s Loretta Mester and San Francisco’s Mary Daly later.
2. ECB plays down stagflation fears as Eurozone prepares fuel subsidies
The European Central Bank’s vice-president Luis De Guindos downplayed suggestions that the Eurozone is headed for stagflation this year, saying the bank still expects growth of over 2%, even if inflation is now expected to stay higher for longer.
The comments stabilized the euro, which had fallen below $1.10 again in the wake of Powell’s comments, which in turn had come after data showing that German producer prices rose by nearly 26% on the year in February.
De Guindos also gave the green light to a range of energy subsidies being rolled out by Eurozone states in response to the surge in fuel prices. EU leaders are due to meet on Thursday to discuss such measures along with a tightening of sanctions on Russia. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the EU is moving closer to following the U.S. in banning Russian oil imports, although Germany and Hungary are still opposed.
3. Stocks set to open higher; Nike up after earnings; Adobe eyed
U.S. stocks are set to open slightly higher later, having ended in negative territory on Monday in response to Powell’s comments.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 114 points, or 0.4%, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were both up 0.2%.
There’ll be economic data from Redbook Research and the Richmond Fed, while cruise operator Carnival and – after the bell – software giant Adobe are due to report. Other stocks likely to be in focus later include Nike, whose earnings late on Monday beat expectations despite falling sales in China, and Tesla, whose new factory in Germany starts production Tuesday.
4. Evergrande's unpleasant discovery; Alibaba's pleasant buyback surprise
Property developer Evergrande sent shockwaves through Chinese markets again, after it discovered that over $2 billion of a subsidiary's cash had been pledged as collateral for loans, and could therefore be seized by creditor banks.
The announcement explained the abrupt suspension of Evergrande shares in Hong Kong on Monday and raises fresh questions over standards of corporate disclosure in China, a worrying development both for the local market and one that bodes ill for its ongoing struggle with U.S. regulators over the transparency of Chinese accounts.
There was brighter news, however, from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), which increased its buyback program by another $9 billion to $25 billion, days after vice-premier Liu He had signaled an easing up of the regulatory crackdown on the country’s biggest Internet companies. 
5. Oil slides on more expensive dollar; API inventories due
Crude oil prices eased off slightly but remained well bid amid fears that the EU, by expanding its sanctions package, will end up tightening the global market as it competes for more non-Russian supplies.
By 6:25 AM ET, U.S. crude prices were down 0.6% at $109.34 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 0.3% at $115.31.
Prices were hit by the dollar’s rise, which makes oil more expensive for non-dollar importers, notably in emerging markets. Ghana and Egypt were forced to raise interest rates sharply on Monday while Hungary is expected to raise again at its meeting today.
Of more importance to the physical market, Indian oil refiners hiked their benchmark prices, raising the prospect of demand destruction. That might also be evident closer to home, when the American Petroleum Institute releases its weekly inventories data at 4:30 PM ET."

The ECB has been accepting Greek government bonds as collateral and even bought them under its latest emergency stimulus scheme, providing vital support to one of the euro zone's weakest economies.
This so called waiver is due to expire in June but the ECB has already indicated it will keep buying Greek bonds as it invests proceeds from its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) and is expected to continue accepting them as collateral too. 
De Guindos said a decision would come ""shortly"".
""My personal opinion is that we have seen a lot of improvement in the Greek economy, both in terms of structural reforms, like fiscal consolidation, and this has been reflected in the decisions of the rating agencies,"" de Guindos said.

""I think this is something we should take into consideration...and bear in mind that the Greek economy has made a lot of progress; it’s much more resilient than it was only two or three years ago.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Philippines central bank will leave policy on hold at Thursday's meeting to support a nascent recovery, despite a recent U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike and surging commodity prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a Reuters poll found.
Governor Benjamin Diokno said last week monetary policy would remain accommodative and data-dependent so the central bank may not necessarily follow the Fed.
The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) also has room to wait as inflation in the Philippines is within the central bank's target range of 2% to 4%.
""BSP, in our view, believes economic output will return to its pre-COVID level later this year, setting the stage for the start of its hiking cycle in Q4,"" noted economists at Nomura.
All 17 economists in a March 15-21 poll expected the overnight reverse repurchase facility to stay at a record low 2.00% at the March 24 meeting. But it was predicted to move up 50 basis points in the last quarter of the year to 2.50%, matching predictions in a February poll.
However, rising commodity prices due to the Russia-Ukraine war are likely to drive up inflation in the Philippines, a net importer of crude oil, increasing the potential for an earlier rate hike. Indeed, a significant minority of economists, eight of 17, penciled in a hike in the third quarter.
""Rising commodity prices and their implications for the growth and inflation mix have put the BSP in a tight spot,"" said Debalika Sarkar, economist at ANZ.
""In its own assessment, annual inflation will overshoot the upper bound of the 2-4% target range this year if average oil prices settle north of $95/barrel.""
Expectations for a subsequent rate hike to 2.75% were brought forward to Q1 2023 from Q2 2023 in the last poll.

The Philippines peso, which has fallen around 3% since the start of the year, slipped on Friday after the central bank signaled it was in no hurry to raise interest rates. Some analysts say currency weakness may still trigger a rate rise. 
""BSP will need to adjust monetary policy to shore up the flagging currency, which in turn will help prevent the build up of imported inflation,"" said Nicholas Mapa, senior economist at ING. Mapa is expecting 100 basis points hike by year-end.

COLOMBO (Reuters) -Sri Lanka will hire a global law firm to provide technical assistance on debt restructuring ahead of talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the country's economic crisis, a top official said on Tuesday.
The island's currency reserves have slumped 70% in the last two years to $2.31 billion and it has to repay about $4 billion in debt in the remainder of this year.
The drain of its dollars has left Sri Lanka struggling to pay for critical imports, including food, fuel and medicine. The government ordered the military to post soldiers at hundreds of gas stations on Tuesday to help distribute fuel.
Sri Lanka's cabinet made the decision to appoint a technical adviser on Monday, spokesman Ramesh Pathirana told reporters.

He said the central bank governor, foreign and justice ministers would oversee the selection process. 
Sri Lanka's finance minister is due to head to Washington next month for the IMF talks.

The Fed must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep an upward price spiral from getting entrenched, Powell said on Monday. 
""Our best guess is that the shift in wording from 'steadily' in January to 'expeditiously' today is a signal that a 50bp rate hike is coming,"" the analysts wrote in a report published late on Monday. 

They anticipate four further 25 basis point rate hikes in 2022, one at each Fed meeting in the second half of this year, and three hikes in 2023. The analysts, however, left their forecast for the Fed's terminal rate unchanged at 3%-3.25%.

The government had projected gross domestic product to expand 3-5% in 2022. 
The forecast was provided before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Moscow calls its actions there a ""special operation"". 
""Our baseline assumption and projection is still that we are still able to continue growing as an economy this year,"" Lawrence Wong told a business forum.
""But you cannot rule out more adverse situations or scenarios where potentially we enter a recession, or we start to experience stagflation-like conditions,"" he said. 
""If things start to get worse in Ukraine and we see a huge impact on our economy or on inflation, we will certainly not hesitate to do more whether through fiscal or monetary policy to make sure that we keep the economy steady or stabilise prices..."" 
Over the past two years, the government has committed close to S$100 billion ($73.61 billion) to cushion its people, businesses and the economy from the impact of the pandemic.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When it comes to passing money smarts to children, many parents know where to start.
In the beginning, they introduce kids to the concept, giving them small amounts of money like allowances or tooth-fairy gifts to handle. The end goal is a fully-functioning financially responsible grownup – earning money, handling a budget, paying bills, saving for retirement.
The real challenge though is the in-between years. How exactly do you get them across the finish line?
That is the puzzle that was driving Bobbi Rebell nuts. The author, certified financial planner and former business news anchor for Reuters found herself frustrated trying to get her two then college-age stepkids to embrace ideas around financial literacy.
“Even though I spent decades writing business and personal-finance news, I was failing so miserably at it,"" says Rebell. “There are lots of amazing educational materials for little kids out there, but I couldn’t find anything for parents of people emerging into adulthood."" 
Presto: Her new book “Launching Financial Grownups”.
There are a few reasons why launching our kids into the real world is so challenging. Often adults do not have their own financial house in order, so we lack the knowledge or tools to teach the next generation.
In addition, the last thing any teenager wants to do is patiently listen to, and learn from, parents. 
And schools are not a big help, either. Money skills are now part of some curriculums, but the reality is personal finance often gets overlooked as a subject.
The result is that teenagers often absorb money lessons from elsewhere, if at all. According to one survey by banking giant  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), 35% of teens say they get information about handling money from social media.
Every family’s resources and financial journeys are different, but these core principles can serve as a compass to raise money-smart kids:
FIND THAT BALANCE
It is usually unrealistic to launch kids at 18 and expect them to handle all their financial affairs from day one. At some point, though, you need to set them free. 
Yet 74% of parents help their adult children out financially – and half say they are cutting into their own retirement savings to do so, according to surveys by the personal finance site Bankrate.
That is why where you need to find that delicate balance, Rebell says: Helping out in moments of crisis, making contributions if you can to major expenses like their first car or their college tuition, but not doing everything for them so that they have no skin in the game. 
“Just because you can subsidize them, doesn’t mean you should,"" Rebell says. ""You need to be strategic about it.”
USE THE COVID YEARS AS AN OPPORTUNITY
This unique pandemic era rewired family dynamics in a lot of ways. In many cases, young adults are living with parents for reasons like saving money, job loss, or colleges shutting down for in-person instruction.
If your kid is around more often than you anticipated, use the opportunity. Have money conversations, invite them into budgeting decisions and ask them to contribute to household expenses. They are learning more than you think just by watching what you do, so be transparent about how running a household means making difficult choices.
AVOID ‘CONCIERGE’ PARENTING
If you troubleshoot every financial issue that comes their way, then they are not doing much learning on their own. Resist the need to intervene in everything, and let them make some decisions, and deal with the consequences. That means letting them fail sometimes.
Think back to your own financial history: Probably the best money lessons you ever learned were from when you had very little and had to get creative. 
“A lot of parents are so well-intentioned, and they just don’t want their kids to suffer,” Rebell says. “But you have to let your kids come up short sometimes.”
DO NOT JUST TEACH – LISTEN

Helping your kids understand money is not just a one-way, teacher-student dynamic, of presenting a lesson plan and having them digest it. After all, they are not you: They are (or will be) independent, with their own ideas of what they want from life. As a result they will have their opinions about money and how they want to make, spend, save and give it —and that is okay.
“It’s a conversation, so let them talk more than you,” Rebell says. “Figure out what matters to them, and don’t assume their priorities are yours. Then you can help guide them.”

(Reuters) -Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Monday delivered his most muscular message to date on his battle with too-high inflation, saying the central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep an upward price spiral from getting entrenched.
In remarks that sent financial markets scrambling to recalibrate for a higher probability of the Fed lifting interest rates by a half-percentage point at one or more of its remaining meetings this year, Powell signaled an urgency to the central bank's inflation challenge that was less visible than just a week ago, when the Fed delivered its first rate hike in three years.
""The labor market is very strong, and inflation is much too high,"" Powell told a National Association for Business Economics conference. ""There is an obvious need to move expeditiously to return the stance of monetary policy to a more neutral level, and then to move to more restrictive levels if that is what is required to restore price stability.""
In particular, he added, ""if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so.""
AIG (NYSE:AIG)'s global head of strategy, Constance Hunter, called it Powell's ""the buck stops here"" speech. 
U.S. stocks fell, and traders -- already betting on at least a quarter-point interest rate increase at each of the year's remaining six Fed meetings -- moved to price in a better-than even chance of half-point interest rate increases at each of the Fed's next two meetings in May and June. 
That would lift the short-term policy rate - pinned for two years near zero - to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% by the end of the year, higher than the 1.9% that Fed policymakers just last week anticipated. 
Most Fed policymakers see the ""neutral"" level as somewhere between 2.25% and 2.5%.
Powell repeated on Monday that the Fed's reductions to its massive balance sheet could start by May, a process that could further tighten financial conditions.
""This is not just going to be a near-term tactical phenomenon,"" said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy at WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF) in New York. ""This is a more strategic type of messaging, I think, from the Fed.""
A consensus for more aggressive tightening - or at least an openness to it - appears to be growing.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who expects a slightly gentler path of rate increases than most of his colleagues, said earlier on Monday he is open to bigger-than-usual rate hikes ""if that's what the data suggests is appropriate.""
Speaking on Friday, Fed Governor Chris Waller said he would favor a series of half-percentage point rate increases to have a quicker impact on inflation.
TIGHT LABOR MARKET, INFLATION RISKS
The U.S. unemployment rate currently is at 3.8% and per-person job vacancies are at a record high, a combination that's pushing up wages faster than is sustainable. 
""There’s excess demand,"" Powell said, adding that ""in principle"" less accommodative monetary policy could reduce pressure in the labor market and help stabilize inflation without pushing up unemployment, generating a ""soft landing"" rather than a recession.
Inflation by the Fed's preferred gauge is three times the central bank's 2% goal, pushed upward by snarled supply chains that have taken longer to fix than most had expected and that could get worse as China responds to new COVID-19 surges with fresh lockdowns.
Adding to the pressure on prices, Russia's war in Ukraine is pushing up the cost of oil, threatening to move inflation even higher. The United States, now the world's biggest oil producer, is better able to withstand an oil shock now than in the 1970s, Powell noted. 
Although the Fed in normal times would not likely tighten monetary policy to address what in the end may be a temporary spike in commodity prices, Powell said, ""the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer-term expectations uncomfortably higher."" 
Last year, the Fed repeatedly forecast that supply chain pressures would ease and then was repeatedly disappointed. 
""As we set policy, we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near-term supply-side relief,"" Powell said on Monday. Policymakers began this year expecting inflation would peak this quarter and cool in the second half of the year. 
""That story has already fallen apart,"" Powell said. ""To the extent it continues to fall apart, my colleagues and I may well reach the conclusion we'll need to move more quickly and, if so, we'll do so.""
Fed policymakers hope to rein in inflation without stomping on growth or sending unemployment back up, and their forecasts released last week suggest they see a path for that, with the median view for inflation falling to 2.3% by 2024 but unemployment still at 3.6%. 
Powell said he expects inflation to fall to ""near 2%"" over the next three years, and that while a ""soft landing"" may not be straightforward, there is plenty of historical precedent. 
""The economy is very strong and is well-positioned to handle tighter monetary policy,"" he said, adding that he doesn't expect a recession this year.

It is a difficult trick to finesse, analysts said. 
Powell was ""reasonably forthcoming that there’s uncertainty,"" said Seth Carpenter, chief global economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). ""If you keep going until you see the outcome that you desire, chances are you’ve gone too far.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Russia's coupon payment on a sovereign bond maturing in 2029 was processed by correspondent bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), a source said on Monday, the second time in recent days the country appears to have averted default. 
Russia had been due to make a $66 million payment to bondholders on Monday on the bond.
Last week, it paid interest due on two sovereign bonds, easing doubts about its willingness and ability to honor external debt after harsh sanctions were imposed by Western nations following its invasion of Ukraine. 
Making the payment meant Russia avoided its first default, for now, since a 1998 financial crisis and its first on international bonds since the 1917 revolution.
JPMorgan worked on Monday with the U.S. Treasury Department on necessary approvals, the source familiar with the situation said. 
The payment had moved on to the next step before the money is handed over to bondholders, the source added. Reuters could not learn which bank was acting as the payment agent on the bond. 
Last week, JPMorgan processed the payment as correspondent bank and handed it to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), which as payment agent distributed the funds on to bondholders. 
Russia has 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion. Prior to the Ukraine crisis roughly $20 billion was held by investment funds and money managers outside Russia.
The country's next test is a $102 million payment on March 28 and after that on March 31 there is a $447 million payment that must be made in dollars. Its biggest payment of the year -- and its first full repayment of ""principal"", of $2 billion -- is due on April 4.
Even if Russia is willing to pay, there may be complications in the coming weeks and months, especially for bonds that must be serviced in dollars, after a temporary license issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control expires on May 25. Russia will still have almost $2 billion worth of external sovereign bond payments to make before the end of the year.

If Russia does not make any of its bond payments within their defined grace periods, or pays in roubles where dollars or euros are specified, it will be a default.
Russia's rouble on Monday steadied and OFZ treasury bonds returned to trading, although in a volatile fashion. Stocks and bonds last traded on the Moscow Exchange on Feb. 25 and the central bank has yet to say when trading in equities can resume. Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, calling it a ""special operation.""

BALTIMORE, Md. (Reuters) - U.S. and British officials kicked off two days of meetings to strengthen trade ties on Monday, underscoring transatlantic cooperation at a time when Western countries are ratcheting up pressure on Russia over its war in Ukraine.
The talks in the port city of Baltimore mark a broad effort to take stock of the $260 billion bilateral trade relationship, while specific disputes will be dealt with separately and formal talks on a free trade agreement remain on ice.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the two allies had resolved disputes over aircraft subsidies and digital services taxes over the past year, and were now working together closely to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine.
""In the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security, so it's never been more important for us to work to strengthen our economic ties with our closest allies, like the United Kingdom,"" Tai told a plenary attended by dozens of U.S. and British executives and trade officials. 
Tai said U.S. and British officials would work to identify mutual trade priorities and promote ""innovation and inclusive economic growth for citizens on both sides of the Atlantic.""
Key U.S. priorities include collaboration on expanding protection of labor rights and the environment, decarbonizing their economies, promoting racial and gender equity, building more resilient supply chains and tapping the ""democratizing"" benefits of the digital economy, U.S. officials said.
UK Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan told business and labor leaders later that the huge shocks of recent years and weeks, an apparent reference to the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, showed ""that resilience and a different way of doing business is required. Protectionism is not the solution.""
Trevelyan said Britain was seeking to ""forge even closer bonds of trade and investment between us, because we do more business together than any other two countries in the world.""
SANCTIONS AND TARIFFS
Close coordination on economic sanctions, export controls and trade measures against Russia have also brought the United States and Europe closer together as they address challenges posed by non-market economies like China, a U.S. official said.
Cathy Feingold, who leads the international department at the AFL-CIO labor union federation, welcomed efforts to give workers a voice in shaping trade policies and shifting away from free trade policies that resulted in ""brutal global competition,"" lower wages and lower standards of living in both countries.
""Our countries must be aligned in dealing with non-market economies like China and Russia and Belarus,"" she said. ""By building a unified approach, we can more effectively create global rules that create fair competition and higher worker and environmental standards.""
The two sides are ""making good progress"" in separate talks on resolving a dispute over U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs that helped clear the way for this week's broader talks, Trevelyan said. Those talks are ongoing, another UK official said.
Washington also remains concerned about UK food safety standards that prevent imports of U.S. chlorine-treated chicken, but will address that issue separately, a second official said.
This week's meetings do not mark a resumption of formal free trade talks held under the former Trump administration that were suspended once President Joe Biden took office, much to the chagrin of business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic.
Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, a transatlantic trade group that represents 450 companies, welcomed the meetings, adding, ""We'd much rather see a resumption of the actual free trade agreement discussions.""
Marjorie Chorlins, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, agreed, adding, ""We should have been able to restart the U.S.-UK negotiations. We were five rounds in and a lot of great work was done.""

Washington has hit the pause button on such agreements, which have historically been viewed skeptically by labor leaders, viewing them as ""just one tool at our disposal."" 
The two sides will meet again later this spring in Britain, but the location has not been finalized, officials said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Sharp moves in the U.S. Treasury market are increasingly pointing to the risk of an approaching recession, with ""bond vigilantes coming out of the woodwork"" and markets doubting the U.S. Federal Reserve's plan to engineer a ""soft landing"" for the economy as it hikes interest rates to fight inflation, market experts said.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday the U.S. central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to bring too-high inflation to heel and that it could use bigger-than-usual interest rate hikes if needed. Bond yields, which move inversely to prices, spiked while the U.S. Treasury yield curve continued its flattening trend. 
""The market seems to be challenging the soft-landing view for the U.S. economy that the Fed argued at the March FOMC meeting"", BofA strategists said.
The U.S. Treasury yield curve reflects ""recession risks, and not just through the curve's extreme flatness at the inception of the Fed tightening cycle,"" the strategists said.
The closely followed part of the yield curve measured between 10-year and two-year Treasuries has narrowed by about 60 basis points since the start of the year, with the longer-dated notes now yielding less than 20 basis points more than two-year debt.
Any inversion of that part of the curve, when shorter notes yield more than longer ones, is generally seen as presaging a recession by six to 24 months. 
""The yield curve does look ominous,"" wrote Christopher Murphy, Co-Head of Derivatives Strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group, although he said an inversion does not always guarantee a recession.
Melissa Brown, Global Head of Applied Research at Qontigo, said the yield curve is reflecting a shift in market views on the ability of the Fed to tighten monetary policy just enough to reduce inflation without throwing the economy into a recession.
""The market perhaps is assuming that they can't thread that needle ... it's going to be tough to not drive us into recession"", she said.
Still, Powell on Monday said he did not see an elevated likelihood of a recession in the next year and others are skeptical of such an event.
That prompted Federal funds rate futures on Monday to raise the chances of a half percentage-point tightening at the next policy meeting in May.
Analysts at NatWest said Powell was clearly ""warning of risks to 50bp hike(s) at the coming meetings,"" which they said sent Treasuries into ""free fall."" 
When asked on Monday about concerns on what the yield curve is saying, Powell said that he focused on the short end of the curve, meaning the first 18 months of maturities.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a research note on Sunday that an inversion of the yield curve was possible in the second quarter this year, but that an inversion does not necessarily anticipate a recession.
""However, it does support our view for sharply decelerating earnings growth"", it said.
For Tim Holland, chief investment adviser at Orion Advisor Solutions, a recession is not imminent, despite the flat curve.
Another part of the curve which compares three-month bills with 10-year notes has steepened this year, from 145 basis points on Dec. 31 to 181.54 basis points on Monday.
""If the past 30 years is any guide, both parts of the curve need to flatten and invert before we are at risk of recession"", he said.
Powell's speech on Monday at a National Association for Business Economics conference caught some market participants off guard as they seemed more hawkish than his remarks after the Fed last Wednesday raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.
Yields spiked on Monday with the 10-year benchmark note up to a yield of 2.298% from 2.153% on Friday - the highest since May 2019. Yields of two-year Treasuries, which more closely reflect monetary policy expectations, jumped to 2.111% from 1.942% on Friday.
""What you saw today is Powell basically throwing the towel, he said he's going to do whatever it takes, and it took the market a little bit back"", said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. 

Brenner described the bond market behaviour as that of bond vigilantes - when investors insist on high yields to compensate for the risk of inflation.
""Bond vigilantes have come out of the woodwork,"" Brenner said, adding he saw a large amount of selling in the futures market, particularly concentrated in five-year futures.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's warning of ""consequences"" for any aid China may give to Russia's Ukraine war effort aims to force Chinese President Xi Jinping to choose a longstanding lucrative trade relationship with the West over a growing strategic partnership with Moscow. 
Based on trade flows alone, both China and the United States have a lot at stake after Biden's nearly two-hour video call with Xi on Friday, with the White House confirming that sanctions on Beijing were an option. 
Despite growing trade ties to Southeast Asia and an economy that is less dependent on trade over the past decade, China's economic interests remain heavily skewed to Western democracies, trade data reviewed by Reuters showed.
Siding with political ally Russia would make little economic sense for China, according to analysts, as the United States and European Union still consume more than a third of China's exports. 
""On the pure economic question, if China were to have to make the choice - Russia versus everyone else - I mean, it's a no-brainer for China because it's so integrated with all of these Western economies,"" said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics think tank who tracks China trade closely.
China's ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, on Sunday emphasized China's close relationship with Russia. 
""China has normal trade, economic, financial, energy cooperations with Russia,"" Qin told the CBS program ""Face the Nation"" when asked if Beijing would provide financial support to Moscow. ""These are normal business between two sovereign countries, based on international laws, including WTO (World Trade Organization) rules.""
Targeting Beijing with the type of broad economic sanctions that have been imposed on Russia would have potentially serious consequences for the United States and globally, given that China is the world's second-largest economy and the largest exporter. As China's economy has ballooned to $16 trillion in the past 20 years, its dependence on trade with other countries for its economic well-being has diminished. 
Title: Trade's share of China's economy eases to 1990s levels Trade's share of China's economy,https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-TRADE/CHINA/zdvxokzqzpx/chart.png 
As Chinese citizens become wealthier, domestic consumption and services are playing a bigger share in China's economy. 
However, China is still more dependent on trade, at about 35% of GDP, than the United States at 23% or Japan at 31%.
The wealthy G7 countries that form the heart of an anti-Russia alliance following last month's invasion of Ukraine still consume more than a third of China's exports. That is a drop from almost half of China's exports nearly two decades ago, but a relatively steady share since 2014, when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region. 
Title: China exports still dominated by U.S. and Western allies, https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/TRADE-CHINA/jnvwebqbavw/chart.png 
The share of China's exports to Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, with which China recently has forged new trade agreements, has doubled to about 15%, eclipsing Japan in importance. But China's January-February 2022 trade data showed that exports to the European Union grew the most at 24%. 
OIL FOR CELLPHONES
Russia's overall trade with China has grown since the West first imposed sanctions on Moscow in response to its annexation of Crimea. 
But China's exports to Russia have remained between 1% and 2% for the past 20 years.
Russian imports from China track those of many other countries, with electronics and consumer goods including cellphones, computers, apparel, toys and footwear topping the list. 
Title: Russia's top imports from China: electronics, apparel Russia's top imports from China: electronics, apparel, https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/TRADE-CHINA/lgpdwarzavo/chart.png 
China exported 10 times as many cellphones, by value, to the United States alone, at $32.4 billion in 2020, based on UN Comtrade data. 
China's imports from Russia are dominated by oil. At $27 billion in 2020, crude oil and other petroleum dwarfs all other imports from Russia, mainly commodities including copper, softwood lumber, liquefied natural gas, coal, metals and ores.

""But an economic or a trade war with China would have tremendous impacts,"" Glick said, adding that it was important for the United States to reduce trade reliance on China.

763,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 04:50PM ET</span>",,,,,,"MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's government agreed to pay 500 million euros ($551.35 million) in direct aid to the transport sector on Monday, hoping to end a strike by some truck drivers over surging fuel costs but organisers said the strike will continue.
""We are going to introduce a subsidy on the price of professional diesel so that this measure has a real and effective impact,"" Transport Minister Raquel Sanchez said after meeting with the National Road Transport Committee.
She said the measure was in line with similar actions taken in France, Portugal and Italy and would take effect from April 1. The government will not reduce VAT - value added tax - on fuel. 
While the strike only involves a minority of drivers, it has caused huge traffic jams across Spain, leading some factories to halt production as they could not guarantee deliveries would be received on time. 
The strike organiser, a truck drivers and small truck owners group association known as the Platform for the Defence of Transport, was not present at the meeting and said the government's announcement was insufficient.
Faced with record diesel prices, drivers went on strike last Monday to demand lower taxes and lighter regulations, with some protests turning violent. 
""Until we negotiate the real problems faced by small truck drivers, there will be no suspension (of the strike),"" the Platform's president, Manuel Hernandez, told Reuters, adding that their key demand is to prevent drivers from incurring losses when transport costs are higher than revenues. 
Hernandez said the government proposals were ""Band-Aids"" that do not address what he argued is a deeper wound. 
Asked about the strike continuing on Tuesday, Spain's Finance minister Nadia Calvino told a press briefing: ""These are positive measures for truck drivers and those platforms that would not back (the measures) are clearly showing they do not defend the interests of this sector"".
The government plan follows a consultation by the European Commission on a draft proposal for a state aid temporary crisis framework to support the EU economy in the context of surging global inflation, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Such support could be granted in any form, including guarantees, subsidised loans and limited grants to partially compensate companies, particularly intensive energy users, for energy price increases, the EU said earlier in March.

Powell said on Monday the Fed must move ""expeditiously"" to bring too-high inflation to heel, and will, if needed, use bigger-than-usual interest rate hikes to do so.
In late afternoon trading, rate futures showed a 63% chance that the Fed will raise interest rates by 50 basis points in May to 0.75%-1.00%, less than a week after the Fed hiked by a quarter-point to 0.25%-0.50%.
""Fed Chair Powell was a more hawkish than we, and the market expected, emphasizing the need to attack inflation rather than take a cautious approach due to the various uncertainties over growth,"" said Action Economics in its latest blog.
""Is he setting the markets up for a 50 basis-point hike in May? It is also the case that balance sheet reduction is expected to be announced in May, with some insights before that to be seen in the minutes due on April 6.""
For the year, futures have priced in 184 basis points of policy tightening.
Futures had priced in a roughly 52% chance of a 50 basis- point hike at the May meeting just before the text of Powell's comments to a National Association of Business Economics conference was released.

Other metrics such as the CME FedWatch tool showed a 48.4% probability of a 50-basis-point hike in May.

ACCRA (Reuters) - Ghana's central bank announced its biggest ever interest rate hike on Monday as it seeks to slow rampant inflation that threatens to create a debt crisis in one of West Africa's largest economies.
The Bank of Ghana raised its main lending rate by 250 basis points to 17%, signalling an aggressive stance against the rocketing price of goods from flour to sugar to fuel, and against a depreciating local currency that has dented investor confidence. 
It is the largest increase in Ghana's history, according to government records, more than double the 100-basis-point rise predicted by a Reuters poll of 10 economists last week.
""The uncertainty surrounding price development and its impact on economic activity is weighing down business and consumer confidence,"" the bank's governor, Ernest Addison, told a news conference. ""The risks to inflation are on the upside.""
Ghana was long seen as a rising star among Africa's emerging market economies, but underwhelming oil revenues and supply chain disruptions amid the COVID-19 pandemic have dampened expectations.
Consumer inflation reached 15.7% year-on-year in February, the highest since 2016. Food, transportation and housing prices have seen the greatest spikes.

The war in Ukraine will likely make things worse. Ghana imports nearly a quarter of its wheat from Russia and around 60% of its iron ore from Ukraine, Addision said, though he expects inflation to return to its targeted band of 8% plus-or-minus 2% by the end of the year.
Meanwhile, Ghana's cedi has weakened by about 20% against the dollar this year, making it the second-weakest currency after the Russian rouble in a list of some 20 emerging market units tracked by Reuters.
Addison blamed that in part on recent downgrades by credit ratings agencies Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch, which he said shook investor confidence.
Ghana's total public debt stands at $50.8 billion (351.8 billion Ghanaian cedi), according to central bank figures, about 80% of the country's gross domestic product.
The central bank has made efforts to improve the situation. Monday's rate hike marks the first time it has increased the prime rate twice within one year since 2015, after a previous one in November.
Economists have warned the fiscal deficit may spark a full-on debt crisis if more money doesn't come in. 

Ghana's ruling party says the solution lies in a 1.75% tax on all electronic payments, locally known as the 'e-levy', a proposal so detested by the opposition that it caused a brawl in parliament last year.
Others have suggested a debt relief programme through the International Monetary Fund which Ghanaian authorities have so far resisted.

(Reuters) - Senior White House cybersecurity official Anne Neuberger said on Monday that important U.S. companies that provide critical infrastructure should improve their cyber defensive posture because of ongoing digital threats from Russia. 
Neuberger said the U.S. government has seen ""preparatory"" Russian hacking activity aimed at numerous U.S. companies, but it has ""no certainty"" such an attack will occur. 
The administration recently provided classified briefings to hundreds of U.S. companies that may be targeted by Russian hackers, Neuberger said. 

The White House also published a written statement on Monday from President Joe Biden where he warned that Moscow may lash out with cyberattacks because of the ""unprecedented economic costs we’ve imposed on Russia."" 
This warning, Neuberger said, is based on ""evolving threat intelligence.""

“This is not just going to be a near-term tactical phenomenon. This is a more strategic type of messaging, I think, from the Fed. 
“This is going to be an ongoing process. First removing emergency policy measures and then getting to restrictive territory, and that's what I was hearing today from Powell.
“They raised rates last week, we're starting at zero. We're not starting at 2% or 3% on the fed funds rate. There is runway before you get to restrictive territory, that monetary policy is no longer providing stimulus for the economy. But how quickly does the Fed close that gap? That's going to be something the market is going to be watching very, very carefully.”
SAMEER SAMANA, SENIOR GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE, ST. LOUIS
""He keeps saying the same thing over and over, that we've got to get inflation down and whatever it takes that's what we're going to do. The market unfortunately is hanging on to old norms, that they'll just do a quarter (of a percentage point) every time.""
    ""The Fed is kind of rewriting that playbook: We may have to go every meeting. We may have to do something more than 25 basis points, and we might have to do rate hikes and quantitative tightening at the same time.""
    ""In some ways, in some ways the Fed has been laying out these markers for months and the market is still struggling to get on the same page.  The Fed's been out for months saying it’s going to raise rates for some time. For Powell to say what the dot plot showed last week, how can that catch the market off guard?"" 
“When the dots were initially released it sold off and then it rebounded as the day rolled on. Powell soothed the market saying look we're still trying to engineer a soft landing. The base case isn't to engineer a recession to get inflation under control. He said something similar today.""
    ""It wouldn't surprise us if the knee jerk reaction was to sell and the end of the day we'd be higher.'
OLIVER PURSCHE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, WEALTHSPIRE ADVISORS, NEW YORK
“It’s Powell’s statement that inflation is ‘much too high.’ Three months ago, it was ‘transitory,’ a month a go it was ‘elevated’ and today it’s ‘much too high.’ That’s a hell of a progression. And the market is trying to figure it out, what those statements mean as it pertains to interest rate hikes and whether it increases the likelihood of a couple of 50 basis point hikes down the road.”
“Having said that, I think it’s incredibly important to remember that on Wednesday, Powell stressed the fact that (the Fed) will continue to course adjust based on economic data. So nothing is written in stone.”

""What I'm looking at here is just the market reacting to potential hawkish Fed but I don't think there's anything new here so far.""
“This is an oversold market and this quick reaction is based on the headline. Let's see if they can digest it a little bit more and see what he's really saying because with the headline the algorithms will move quickly and when one moves they all move and volatility spikes in the market. In other words, you get a quick reaction that is sometimes not warranted and my gut would say that this one is not warranted.”

The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), while noting the difficulties of measuring illegal borrowing, said its estimate was based on a poll of about 4,000 people and an analysis of evidence provided by 1,200 known victims.
The last official report on illegal lending from the government in 2010 estimated the number of people borrowing from illegal lenders at 310,000 across the United Kingdom. 
The CSJ said over a fifth of victims took more than five years to repay an illegal lender. 
""We can expect this to get worse. The emergent cost-of-living crisis casts a looming shadow of financial anxiety,"" it said in a report.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak is expected to address Britain's worsening cost-of-living squeeze in a budget update on Wednesday, with inflation on track to top 8% after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Britain's lowest-paid workers have seen the biggest squeeze on their pay over the past 12 months.

The CSJ said illegal lenders were increasingly operating online, using social media to lure new borrowers, and that the vast majority of lenders ensure payment through psychological manipulation, coercion and by pestering borrowers.
The report said a small but significant minority use intimidation and violence. In many cases, illegal lenders had demanded a borrower deliver drugs or refer new clients to them, it added. Some had even asked for sex in return for the money owed.

Sheremetyevo, one of the busiest airports in Europe before the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, had cast itself as a transit hub linking east and west.

(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has often pointed to the months before the pandemic as a heyday for the U.S. economy, and he is counting on an across-the-board return to economic conditions circa 2019 to help win a fight against high inflation without sparking higher unemployment.
It is a calculated gamble the world economy will emerge from the pandemic, a war in eastern Europe, and a potential reshuffling of global supply lines and still largely operate as it did before, without any permanent change in price and wage dynamics. 
When pressed on the seeming tension in the Fed's latest economic projections, in which inflation gradually falls even as the unemployment rate remains near historic lows, Powell dialed back the clock and noted it had happened before.
""In the economy we had before the pandemic, the connection between inflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight,"" Powell said, adding the Fed's shift to higher interest rates shouldn't raise joblessness, only curb what he said is an ""unhealthy"" level of demand for workers that is causing outsized wage increases.
""Across the economy we would like to slow demand so it is better aligned with supply,"" Powell said, but not so much that it raises the unemployment rate and triggers a recession.
The Fed at its meeting last Wednesday penciled in what would be the fastest set of interest rate increases in 20 years to address inflation that is running at a 40-year high. It lifted the target federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point from the near zero rate established at the start of the pandemic, and policymakers projected the equivalent of a quarter-point increase at each of their six remaining meetings this year.
Some officials want to move faster, and some analysts have noted that when rates move along the lines the Fed is already projecting it tends to end in recession - not the ""soft landing"" Powell intends.
Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who would like to ""front load"" several half-point rate hikes at coming meetings, pushed back on that as a risk. ""As far as recession I don't think that there should be a great concern on this,"" he said Friday on CNBC. ""We are talking about mainly getting to neutral or slightly above it by the end of the year, and that shouldn’t be any cause for concern for recession.""
TACTICAL GUIDANCE
Yet it was clear from the Fed's post-meeting statement and Powell's press conference following its release that much is left unresolved about the central bank's policy shift.
Major central banks in recent decades have put a premium on transparency and consider clear guidance about the path of policy as an important tool. Rate hike cycles have typically been described by words like ""measured"" or ""gradual"" that provide a clear steer on the pace of increases.
Fed policymaker projections pointed to hikes at each meeting, a more hawkish outlook than expected. But the projections have proved a poor predictor of actual policy decisions. The more binding policy statement - a consensus document voted on by the Federal Open Market Committee - referred only to ""ongoing increases,"" potentially leaving the door open for the Fed to speed or slow its pace as needed.
""The Fed would rather sound hawkish and have to back off, than sound dovish and have to play catch-up in the current environment,"" said Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) economist Steve Englander.
Providing direction alone may be a tactical move by the Fed but it may also be a product of the moment, and uncertainty about whether the economy emerging from the health crisis will indeed snap back to pre-pandemic form.
A lot will have to go right, including an improved global flow of goods, continued progress on the pandemic, shifts in consumer spending, and a jump in the number of people who want to work. Improved labor supply is one way the unemployment rate can stay low and job growth continue without adding to wage or price pressures. The war in Ukraine is perhaps the biggest risk, with the potential to drive higher inflation through, for example, higher commodity prices.
A PRE-PANDEMIC IDEAL
The outlook sketched by the Fed seemed ""more idealistic than realistic,"" said Nela Richardson, chief economist for payroll processor ADP. ""This is a different economy. Inflation is present. We have a world that has been dramatically transformed by the pandemic and is now grappling with a humanitarian crisis.""
Powell became chair in 2018 after several years as a Fed governor. The Fed was then already steadily lifting rates in anticipation that unexpectedly strong economic growth and government deficit spending would increase inflation.
What happened instead surprised policymakers, and created what Powell has described as a sort of golden moment of balance in the economy. 
The unemployment rate in 2019 remained below 4%, a low level that under the Fed's baseline view of the economy should have provoked inflation. Yet inflation remained at or below the Fed's 2% target. Wage growth, at just over 3% annually, let workers' pay keep pace with prices and then some - but stayed roughly in line with annual changes in employee productivity so companies were not pushed to either raise prices or cut profits. 
More people started looking for jobs, with some older people even leaving retirement because of the higher pay.
'WE WILL DEAL WITH WHAT COMES' 
The pandemic wrecked all that, and as the economy reopened that 2019 moment of balance gave way to an unpredictable mess. 
Using a statistic Powell often cites, the number of jobs for each unemployed worker was high in 2018 and 2019 at around 1.2; it exploded during the pandemic to 1.7 jobs per jobless individual. 
The unemployment rate is now 3.8% and the Fed thinks it will fall this year to 3.5% and remain around there through 2024. Inflation by a key measure is 6%, triple the Fed's target, outpacing wage increases for most people, and threatening to go higher. 
There is some logic to Powell's argument about the labor force, said Glassdoor Senior Economist Daniel Zhao. 
""Right now demand for workers exceeds supply by so much that you could have a slowdown in demand that wouldn't necessarily affect jobs growth,"" Zhao said. ""It might put a damper on wage growth; let's say a worker has three offers - that gives them more negotiating power than one. In both cases the worker will go to a new job.""

But Powell was careful not to over-promise.
""The reality is there are many many moving pieces and we don't know what will actually happen,"" Powell said. ""We will deal with what comes whether it is better or worse.""

LVIV (Reuters) - Ukraine faces a possible grain revenue loss of $6 billion as the blockade of its ports by Russian forces prevents it from selling millions of tonnes of wheat and corn that had been earmarked for export by June, a senior industry official said.
Countries that rely on imports of Ukrainian wheat - including Egypt, Turkey and Yemen - will need to find alternative supplies, aid agencies have warned.
Ukraine, a major producer of grain and oilseeds, exports 98% of its cereals through its ports and only a fraction by rail, where costs are higher.
The country was the world's fourth largest grain exporter in the 2020/21 season while Russia ranked third, International Grains Council data shows. The two countries combined accounted for 22% of global exports.
But with Russian warships off Ukraine's southern coast preventing cargo ships from leaving the ports, including the major hub of Odesa on the Black Sea, grain exports have all but ground to a halt since the start of the war on Feb. 24. 
Ukrainian maritime officials said fighting had left around 100 foreign-flagged vessels stranded in the country's ports.
""We are sitting on a potential loss of $6 billion,"" Mykola Gorbachev, chairman of the Ukrainian Grain Association, told Reuters.
He said the country had around 20 million tonnes of wheat and corn still to export from the 2021/22 season, which ends in June, at an average price of around $300 per tonne.
He said there was no way Ukraine could transport that kind of volume by train, as the railway had a throughput capacity of some 600,000 tonnes per month, a tenth of what ports handled before the war. 
Ukraine exported around $27 billion in agricultural products 
in 2021, making up about half of its total export income.
""Now we are just losing this sector,"" Gorbachev said.
The World Food Programme said on Friday that food supply chains in Ukraine were collapsing, with key infrastructure such as bridges and trains destroyed by bombs and many grocery stores and warehouses empty.
Russia, which has been hit by Western sanctions and has imposed export curbs, had been the world's top wheat exporter in 2020/21 but may lose that mantle to the European Union in the current 2021/22 season, according to IGC forecasts.
The Ukrainian crisis will add further fuel to already rampant food inflation following global supply chain problems attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The United Nations food agency reported this month that world food prices hit a record high in February, posting a 20.7% year-on-year rise.
While Ukrainians who are not trapped in besieged cities like Mariupol or Kharkiv in the east are not at an immediate risk of food shortages, the war could disrupt agriculture for a long time.
Gorbachev said Ukrainian farmers may also be thinking twice before sowing new crops out of fear for their safety but also because their grains could go unsold if the war continues.
Ukrainian farmers - who produced a record grain crop last year - say they are short of fertilizer for the dormant winter wheat planted last autumn, and they also lack sufficient fuel to power their equipment.
Meanwhile the new crops of corn and barley must be planted over the next month or it will be too late, Gorbachev said. 
At the weekend, presidential adviser Oleh Ustenko said Ukraine may not produce enough crops to export if the invasion disrupts this year's sowing campaigns.

""Ukraine has enough grain and food reserves to survive for a year, but if the war continues ... (it) will not be able to export grain to the world, and there will be problems,"" he said. 
The country has started sowing spring grain in some areas but no mass sowing campaign has yet started, deputy agriculture minister Taras Vysotskiy told Reuters last week.

He cited an unidentified ""financial report"" for his assertion, and he also predicted a boost in economic growth and employment.
Mexico's economy stagnated in the final quarter of 2021 and investment has been lackluster under Lopez Obrador, who has rattled businesses by calling contracts issued under previous governments into question, arguing they were tainted by graft.
""With this new economic crisis resulting from the war, Mexico becomes if not the first, then the second or third country with most investment opportunities in the world,"" Lopez Obrador told a regular morning news conference.
The United States, Britain and the European Union have imposed tough sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, causing the Russian currency to tumble and the departure of foreign businesses.
""With Russia and with what's happening in other countries that were considered emerging economies (and) very favorable for investment in the world, now there has been a shift and, fortunately, our country is in the top levels,"" Lopez Obrador said.
Lopez Obrador was speaking at the opening of a new airport built to replace an earlier, partly-completed one he scrapped, a move that shook business confidence in Mexico.

Levels of gross fixed investment in Mexico were at the end of 2021 15% lower than when Lopez Obrador was elected in July 2018, according to data from the national statistics agency.
Mexico's economy expanded about 5.0% in 2021 after shrinking 8.5% in 2020, its sharpest slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Mexican economy ministry has forecast growth of around 2.5% for 2022.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech central bank is likely to raise interest rates again on March 31 and may discuss more use of foreign exchange interventions, board member Tomas Holub said on Monday, adding he does not favour buying crowns to help bring down inflation. 
Since last spring, Czech policymakers have taken the main repo rate to 4.5% from 0.25%, tightening aggressively to tackle inflation that has soared to a 24-year high of 11.1% and is set to rise further due to the Ukraine crisis.
Holub said he would not exclude rates going above 5%, if not in March then perhaps in May.
Holub said he expected a wider mix of opinions in March than at previous meetings, with the impact of the war set to further raise inflation to an expected peak of around 13-14% in the summer while slowing economic growth.
The central bank could ""look through"" such a stagflationary shock if inflation was around the bank's 2% target, he said. But with current inflation so high, and unemployment is very low at 3.5%, further price shocks cannot be ignored.
""For me the inflation problem is now a monetary policy priority, so I will definitely vote for further growth in interest rates,"" he said. ""But I cannot say how much it (the March decision) will be, given the expected wider range of opinion.""
He said the central bank had considered raising the main rate to around 5% even before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"". 
""It would not make sense to me for them to go to a lower level than that. The question is whether and to what extent to go above,"" Holub said, adding: ""There is a second line of thinking ... which is to what extent to use foreign exchange interventions as a complementary tool"" to reduce inflation.
He said he expected to be in the camp favouring a larger rather than smaller move, but also that he was open to debate about raising to 5% now and further in May. 
The central bank started buying crowns on March 4 to smooth out volatility after the war hit central European currencies, using its large foreign exchange reserves of 157.46 billion euros, around two thirds of gross domestic product. 
Governor Jiri Rusnok said on Sunday a debate would be led about possibly widening the interventions from just reducing volatility to also bringing inflation down through a firmer currency. 
""I would personally rather prefer further tightening of monetary conditions through interest rates, with the expectation that the exchange rate will adjust by market forces, than direct utilisation of the exchange rate,"" said Holub.

It would be difficult to set mandate for such interventions, he said. Also, the foreign reserves are still finite and small relative to the size of global markets.
But if the board overall was cautious about more rate increases, Holub said he was open to debate and not dogmatically opposed to using the exchange rate more extensively.

The median 2022 forecast climbed from 12.75% a week earlier, after the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points to 11.75%, signaling another increase of the same size in May to curb the effects of supply shocks from the war in Ukraine.
Before the decision, more than 100 economists polled by the central bank's weekly ""Focus"" survey had expected interest rates to rise 75 basis points in May, followed by a final 25 basis point hike in June.
Now, they foresee a 1 point adjustment in May and a 0.25 point hike in June, ending a tightening cycle that took borrowing costs from an all-time low of 2% in March 2021. For 2023, the outlook is for year-end rates at 9%, from 8.75% previously.

The inflation forecast rose for the tenth straight week to 6.59% from 6.45% a week earlier, versus the policymakers' target of 3.5% inflation this year. Estimates for 2023 also rose to 3.75% from 3.70%, moving away from the 3.25% target. 
Survey figures were released with a delay of an hour and a half on Monday, which the central bank labor union attributed to a mobilization made by servants asking for salary increases. The central bank did not comment on the matter.

With Russia's war in Ukraine clouding the outlook, the ECB took only a small step in unwinding stimulus earlier this month and some policymakers are calling for an abundance of caution with future moves, even as inflation is running at a record high 5.9%, almost three times the ECB's target. 
Nagel, however, took a more conservative view, warning that high inflation was at risk of getting entrenched and if the ECB woke up too late, policy tightening would have to be so abrupt, it could choke off growth. 
""It is clear to me that if the inflation outlook requires it, we must continue to normalize monetary policy and also start raising our key interest rates,"" Nagel said in a speech.
""If net asset purchases end in the third quarter as currently planned, this opens up the possibility of raising the key interest rates this year, if necessary,"" he added.
The ECB earlier this month said that it will not be in a hurry to raise rates and it could even pause after winding down the bond buys.
But conservatives, including Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot, have argued that a rate hike, the first such move in over a decade, needs to remain on the table as inflation is not as temporary as the ECB once expected.
Indeed, Nagel argued that the longer the current bout of high inflation lasts, the more likely it is to raise inflation expectations, entrenching high price growth.
The risk has also increased as unemployment continues to fall and the bloc is now enjoying its tightest labour market, with growing labour shortages troubling firms, making the return of super low inflation unlikely.

""Inflation rates in the foreseeable future will not be as low as before the pandemic,"" Nagel said.
""The risk of acting too late has increased,"" Nagel added. ""We should not delay the exit from the very loose monetary policy... otherwise interest rates might have to rise faster or higher later on.""

Tough bank capital reforms were agreed at a global level after banks were bailed out by taxpayers in the crisis.
Lenders already hold far more capital under the initial elements of the ""Basel III accord,"" whose final elements had been due to come into force in January this year, but were delayed by a year to January 2023 due to COVID-19.
The European Union, however, decided to propose delaying implementation by a further two years to January 2025 to give banks more time to adjust, forcing Britain and other jurisdictions to decide whether to follow suit.
The Bank of England said it would publish a consultation paper in the fourth quarter on implementing the final rules of Basel III.
""In addition, taking into account the publicly-announced implementation timetables in other major jurisdictions, and the need to provide firms with sufficient time to implement the final policies, our current intention is to consult on a proposal that these changes will become effective on 1 January 2025,"" the BoE said in a statement on Monday.

UK Finance, which represents banks in Britain, said the BoE statement brought much needed clarity about the timing of new capital rules.
""Not only will this aid the planning of a complex, multi-faceted implementation project but it will ensure firms’ capital planning and stress testing, which looks five years into the future, is aligned with the prudential regulator’s expectations,"" said Simon Hills, UK Finance's director for prudential policy.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - A Sri Lanka government-appointed committee on Monday said the crisis-hit country's central bank and finance ministry must form a team to seek urgent international financial assistance as its economy reels under a foreign currency shortage.
The South Asian island of 22 million people last week said it would go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help solve its worst economic crisis in years. 
The country has struggled to pay for critical imports including fuel, food and medicines in recent weeks as its foreign exchange reserves dry up.
""The technical team should immediately come up with a reform programme to propose international financial assistance,"" the 16-member advisory committee said in a press release issued by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's office.
Sri Lanka has to repay about $4 billion worth of debt this year, including a $1 billion international sovereign bond maturing in July. But its reserves dipped to $2.31 billion as of end February, down around 70% from two years ago.
""The foreign exchange crisis is the main reason for this situation,"" said the committee, appointed this month to assist Rajapaksa's administration. 

It added that financial and legal advisors should also be immediately appointed, alongside an expert team to help the country's finance minister, who is headed to Washington DC next month to hold talks with the IMF.
A group of the largest holders of Sri Lanka's international bonds have hired law firm White & Case for advice, sources said last week, as markets prepare for an impending debt restructuring.

(Reuters) -Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic said Monday he has penciled in a total of six interest rate hikes this year and two for 2023, fewer than most of his colleagues as he worries about the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on the U.S. economy.
""Getting the high rates of inflation under control is the top concern for me for 2022,"" Bostic told the National Association for Business Economics, noting also that it is critical to address the significant imbalance between labor supply and demand. 
But, he added, ""the elevated levels of uncertainty are front forward in my mind and have tempered my confidence that an extremely aggressive rate path is appropriate today."" 
If data shows that more rate hikes, or in bigger increments, are in fact needed, he told reporters afterward, he would be comfortable supporting them, and he is ""uncommitted, not locked into anything.""
He does expect, however, that while inflation will still be at a too-high 4.1% at the end of this year, supply chains will get fixed and workers will return to the labor force as the pandemic eases, and ""we can find an equilibrium without us really having to really actively slow the economy with our policy.""
The Fed last week raised interest rates in its first rate increase since 2018, hiking them from near-zero in a bid to tame inflation that is currently running above 6%, three times the central bank's target. 
Most Fed policymakers see rates rising to at least 1.9% by the end of the year, a pace equivalent to a quarter point increase at each of the year's six remaining Fed meetings, with four more expected next year.
Bostic said he sees the Fed's neutral rate at 2.25% and cannot predict with much certainty if his own forecast on rate hikes this year will hold.
""It could go faster than that if developments occur in such a way that it seems that that’s warranted or it could go slower. I am truly observing and adapting in real time because it just seems there is so much going on,"" Bostic said. ""The world is continually surprising me."" 
Bostic said Monday the job market is tight, noting it is ""critical"" to restore balance to labor supply and demand. But he added that he believes current high wage growth, which overall is still below the rate of inflation, reflects employers trying to keep employees from falling behind on pay rather than a permanent feature of the labor market.
The Atlanta Fed chief said the conflict in Ukraine will put further upward pressure on prices for commodities like oil and wheat but also more broadly as businesses retool their supply chains. 
Both conditions will likely exacerbate already intense inflation pressure; on the other hand, the risks ""go both ways,"" with uncertainty fed by conflict likely to reduce economic activity, he said. 

""Should demand falter in the face of economic uncertainty or removal of monetary policy accommodation, then the appropriate path may be shallower than I currently project,"" Bostic said. ""But there are other developments, such as shifts in supply strategies, that could mean higher costs and thus motivate a steeper policy path than I expect.""
Bostic's remarks came at the start of a conference just hours before Fed Chair Jerome Powell is also expected to speak, and investors will be watching closely for fresh clues on the likely rate path ahead.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House invited executives from an array of U.S. industries and businesses, including energy, food, and banks, to a briefing Monday on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a White House official said.
The White House officials and Cabinet members will discuss supply chain issues surrounding Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and ways to lessen the economic shocks, a source familiar with the plan told Reuters.
The off-the-record briefing will be led by National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, the White House official said. 
The meeting will include representatives from Pattern Energy, Invenergy, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP),  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Land O'Lakes Inc, Cargill Inc, Dow Inc and U.S. Steel, the official said on condition of anonymity.
President Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats have been pushing the chief executives of major oil companies to increase production amid rising prices at the gas pumps. 
Biden has blamed the latest spike on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The United States has imposed several rafts of sanctions on Russia over its attack, including an immediate ban on Russian oil and other energy imports.

U.S. consumer prices, including for rent and food, have also surged, and inflation is poised to accelerate even further as Russia's war against Ukraine drives up the costs of crude oil and other commodities.
The conflict has added to the trade chaos that followed the global economy's emergence from COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. Asia-Europe routes have been worst hit by issues, including acute port congestion and cargo disruption, due to the closure of Russian airspace, a JPMorgan analysis showed.

In a State Council meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang, the cabinet called for adoption of monetary policy tools to sustain credit expansion at a stable pace. The authorities also promised to maintain policies that can support the economy, while pledging to avoid measures that can hurt market sentiment. 
The statement came as Chinese banks left borrowing costs unchanged early Monday, even as some market participants had expected a cut following a strong vow from Vice Premier Liu He last week to support growth. The one and five-year loan prime rates were kept unchanged at 3.7% and 4.6% respectively, according to the People’s Bank of China.

The cabinet also said it’s important to monitor how international developments can affect the domestic capital market. Some 1 trillion yuan ($157 billion) of tax refund for smaller firms was also announced. 
China’s economy has come under mounting pressure since late 2021, with a persistent housing market slump and the latest wave of Covid-19 outbreak hurting domestic demand. 
One monetary policy action expected by economists is a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio. The PBOC lowered the ratio in July and December for most banks last year, with both of the cuts first signaled by the premier or the cabinet days in advance. However, there was also an instance in 2020 where the central bank chose not to act in the end act even after the State Council mentioned the policy tool. The Monday statement didn’t have a specific reference to the RRR when mentioning monetary policy tools.

782,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said he favored six quarter-point interest-rate hikes in 2022, a less aggressive approach than most of his fellow officials, in light of increased uncertainty about the outlook following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“I penciled in six rate hikes for 2022 and two more for 2023,” Bostic said Monday in prepared remarks to a National Association for Business Economics conference in Washington. “I recognize that I am toward the bottom of the distribution relative to my colleagues, but the elevated levels of uncertainty are front forward in my mind and have tempered my confidence that an extremely aggressive rate path is appropriate today.”
Federal Open Market Committee policy makers led by Chair Jerome Powell voted 8-1 last week to raise interest rates by a quarter point for the first increase since 2018 as they confront the highest inflation in four decades. The move took the target range for their benchmark policy rate to 0.25% to 0.5%. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard’s dissent in favor of a half-point hike was the first vote against a decision since September 2020.
“Events are shifting rapidly, and we could see marked changes along key dimensions, such as aggregate demand, that could warrant quickly adjusting the trajectory of policy,” Bostic said.
The FOMC’s “dot plot” in its economic forecasts showed policy makers penciling in their expectation of rate hikes through each of the remaining six meetings in 2022, with the median projection for a quarter point every time. With almost half of policy makers seeking to go even faster, that would imply a half-point move at some time during the year.
“The risks go both ways,” Bostic said. “Should demand falter in the face of economic uncertainty or removal of monetary policy accommodation, then the appropriate path may be shallower than I currently project. But there are other developments, such as shifts in supply strategies, that could mean higher costs and thus motivate a steeper policy path than I expect.”
Bostic said he considered inflation as the top concern for policy makers this year and described the U.S. labor market as tight.

LONDON (Reuters) - The path to permanent joint bond sales by euro zone governments will be long and bumpy, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine may have helped clear the way.
The conflict has prompted European countries to pledge more investment in defence and developing renewable energy, expenditure many argue will be best met if the burden is shared. 
The European Union is already issuing joint bonds for an 800 billion euro ($879 bln) post-COVID recovery fund, but has not mentioned plans for more debt, let alone making the existing facility permanent.
Yet the notion of a permanent scheme has resurfaced in markets and its potential significance is not lost on investors; without considering it an immediate prospect, many are buying bonds from countries that would benefit the most, such as Italy.
Christian Odendahl, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform, sees the war, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"", as a turning point of sorts for Europe, even if the road remains unclear.
It would affect European ""integration as much or more as the COVID crisis helped propel a joint fiscal capacity and borrowing, which were both unthinkable when corona was still a beer,"" Odendahl said. 
Proponents argue that joint bonds would be a powerful signal of European cohesion. They would lift the euro's profile and expand the European pool of top-rated securities, allowing them to compete with U.S. Treasuries as global reserve assets.
With Germany alone pledging a 100 billion euro military upgrade, spending needs will be colossal. If all European NATO members commit to spending 2% of GDP on defence, overall expenditure will rise by a quarter, the biggest boost in three decades, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimates. 
According to BofA, that could require another 150-200 billion euros of combined euro area spending in 2022-23 alone.
Slashing Russian gas ties, as the European Commission plans, could add over 130 billion euros this year to the bloc's already red-hot energy bill, Reuters Breakingviews calculations show.
While more indebted EU states will be reluctant to shoulder those costs alone, the joint bond debate also speaks to shifts triggered by the COVID meltdown. It brought recognition -- even among more frugal nations -- of fiscal policy's key role during times of crisis.
The argument now goes that like COVID, the war is an exogenous shock affecting all EU states, making a joint response more effective than a series of uncoordinated national efforts.
The latest crisis matches COVID as a catalyst for deeper integration, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG)'s head of rates Christoph Rieger said, adding that ""a permanent joint EU debt capacity is becoming more likely longer-term"".
NORTH AND SOUTH
France is leading calls for new EU debt, while Germany and other richer bloc members oppose any move toward a fiscal union, with shared borrowing and spending.
They argue that the Next Generation EU (NGEU) -- the recovery fund, bonds sales for which started last year -- mostly remains unused, with just 74 billion euros disbursed so far.
As it stands, recovery fund borrowing ends in 2026 and the last bonds mature in 2058. 
But while the fund sets a precedent, it is not an ordinary tool, says Francesco Papadia, a former market operations director-general at the ECB and now a senior fellow at the Bruegel Institute. 
""(Joint bonds) will be possible only in exceptional circumstances, like the present ones ... when it will be seen as indispensable to effectively deal with the crisis,"" Papadia said, adding he does not believe this is yet clear of the war. 
ING analysts suggest lighter kinds of joint borrowing could be more acceptable to the ""frugal"" nations, for instance modelled on the EU's SURE unemployment scheme.
PRICING
Bond markets' recent behaviour demonstrates how the joint fund has boosted the bloc's resilience.
Bond spreads, the premia investors demand to hold debt from a weaker country like Italy or Spain, usually widen in times of trouble. But since the Feb. 24 invasion, 10-year Italian spreads have narrowed 26 basis points.
In other words, Italian premia have eased despite the war, and at a time when the European Central Bank plans to cut back the stimulus which is a key support plank for southern Europe.
The lesson from 2020 is that the ECB can halt spread widening -- but a real turnaround was down to the EU's response, Citi analysts noted.
The NGEU's creation pulled the Italian/German spread around 33 bps tighter than it otherwise would have been, BofA reckons.

Italian and Greek spreads snapped in 10 bps after recent media reports flagged the possibility of a new joint EU bond scheme. 
""The more the market understands that there is political capital for this to happen every time the EU is thrown a challenge, the more it will believe the EU ... will eventually get to fiscal union."" Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho, said.

785,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 07:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"PARIS (Reuters) - The world's two top central banks will move out of sync in the foreseeable future, as the war in Ukraine has vastly different effects on their economies, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Monday.
The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates last week and signalled a string of future moves, just days after the ECB said it was in no hurry to raise its record-low deposit rate, even while it continues to unwind exceptional stimulus. 
""Our two economies are in a different place in the economic cycle, even before the war in Ukraine,"" Lagarde told a financial conference. ""For geographical reasons, Europe is way more exposed (to the war) than the U.S..""
Soaring energy costs have already pushed euro zone inflation to a record-high 5.9% last month and the rate could hit 7% in the months ahead, well above the ECB's 2% target.
With food prices also expected to jump, the inflation surge will cut deep into households' purchasing power and the ECB has cut its growth projections, with some policymakers arguing that an even worse outcome is already more likely.
Lagarde said the U.S. economy is less reliant than Europe's on commodity imports and its trade will also be less affected, so that the two central banks will need to move out of sync. 
""Our monetary policies won't be running on exactly the same rhythm,"" she said. 
As a consequence of the war, Europe will need to speed up the greening of its economy to reduce its reliance on energy from Russia, its biggest supplier of natural gas.

This transition will be inflationary in the short- to medium-term, Lagarde warned, although the long-term impact of the transition will be to weigh on prices. 
""In the short, medium term, it will be of an inflationary nature. Whereas in the long term, forces on prices will be rather deflationary, she said.

The Danish economy was set for a rapid recovery after the pandemic this year but the boom will now be dented as the uncertainty stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine takes it toll. 
""Denmark's direct trade with Russia is limited. However, the Danish economy is also indirectly affected by countries such as Germany and Finland which trade more with Russia,"" the ministry said in a statement 
Denmark's economy this year is now seen as growing 2.2% in a mild scenario, 1.6% in a medium scenario and 0.0% in the toughest scenario, the ministry said, underlining that the projections are still uncertain. 
The ministry in December forecast economic growth of 2.8% this year. 

Inflation is expected to increase to 4.5% in the medium scenario up from the 2.2% seen in the December forecast.

It estimated the German economy likely stagnated in the first three months of the year and the rebound it had pencilled in for the second quarter would now be weaker than expected due to ""foreseeable impairments in foreign trade and increased uncertainty"".

Inflation, which hit its highest rate in almost 30 years at 5.1% last month even before the latest surge in fuel prices, was now set to rise further.

Investing.com -- Oil prices surge as the EU eyes expanding its sanctions on Russia to include energy. Hopes for peace fade as the Kremlin rules out a meeting between Presidents Putin and Zelenskyy. A Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 crashes in China - but it's not a 737 MAX. Aluminum and steel prices surge.  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) reports earnings and the emerging world's economic problems start to mount. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 21st March.
1. Oil surges as EU eyes expanding sanctions  
Crude oil prices surged again after the European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell said that the bloc is ready to discuss including energy in a new round of sanctions against Russia.
Energy purchases from Russia had been exempted from previous rounds of EU sanctions due to the lack of short-term alternatives, but the growing horror at Russia’s actions in Ukraine – Borrell accused Russia of “massive war crimes” – and the ease with which Russia avoided default last week appear to be pushing Europe to raise the pressure on the Kremlin, even if that increases the short-term damage to its economy. EU leaders are due to discuss other measures to avert an energy crisis at a two-day meeting that starts on Thursday.
Over the weekend, Germany’s vice-chancellor Robert Habeck signed a deal with Qatar to expedite shipments of liquefied natural gas (there were few further details available).
By 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), U.S. crude futures were up 4.3% at $107.56 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 4.1% at $112.31 a barrel.
2. Kremlin says not enough progress for peace talks; China still ambivalent
Sentiment toward risk assets globally soured after a Kremlin spokesman said that peace talks have not progressed enough for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents to take place.
The comments come as Russia claimed to have deployed new ‘hypersonic’ missiles in combat for the first time. Reports suggest that Russia has all but secured complete control of the port city of Mariupol, after two weeks of heavy bombardment.
The UN High Commission for Refugees now estimates that over 13 million people in Ukraine are in need of humanitarian assistance, with over 3 million having fled to other countries.  
Hopes that China may broker a peace, or at least not give Russia the support that it needs to sustain its offensive, live on after China said it will do “everything possible” to de-escalate the situation. Beijing still refuses to join international condemnation of the invasion, however.
3. U.S. stocks set to open lower; Boeing eyed after 737 crash
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower, as the weekend’s news flow failed to give enough reason to make further advances after the best week in several months for risk assets. The three main cash indices had gained by between 5.5% and 10.5% last week.
By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 142 points, or 0.4%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.4%.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Boeing, after a 737 airliner – not one of the 737 MAX range - operated by China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) crashed, killing 132 people. Boeing stock was down 6% in premarket.
After the closing bell, Nike will report earnings.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will address a conference of economists at 12 PM ET, while Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks at 8 AM ET.
4. Metals volatility continues
Aluminum prices rose another 3.6% after Australia said it will ban the export of alumina to smelters in Russia. The move threatens to curtail the output of a metal that is widely used in packaging and other industries. Smelting capacity is concentrated in Russia due to the relatively low cost of electricity there.
Other metals' prices, however, were in risk-off mode, with Nickel Futures again catching the eye as the London Metals Exchange was once more forced to suspend trading of its futures contract after it hit a 15% circuit breaker.
Platinum group metals also rose on fresh fears for Russian supplies to world markets and hot-rolled steel prices in Europe hit a record 1,400 euros ($1,550) a ton, but copper prices eased, reflecting concerns about global growth.
5. Emerging markets problems mount as Egyptian currency devalues, Sri Lanka seeks bailout
The strains of war and a global monetary tightening cycle are taking an increasing toll on emerging markets.
Egypt’s central bank allowed its currency to devalue by 13% against the dollar while raising interest rates by a full percentage point. The country of 105 million people faces a sharp deterioration in its terms of trade due to its dependence on foreign oil and wheat (it sources 80% of the latter from Russia and Ukraine).
Egypt was reported last week to be eyeing a fresh support package from the International Monetary Fund.
Also in trouble is Sri Lanka, which has asked the Chinese government for $2.5 billion in credit support, according to Chinese officials, in addition to seeking funds from India and the IMF.

The Malaysian Semiconductor Industry Association on Monday said it was deeply concerned with the raising of the monthly minimum wage to 1,500 ringgit ($356.89) from May 1 from the current 1,200 ringgit.
President Wong Siew Hai in a statement said the increase was ""too much too soon"" and companies had insufficient time to adjust wage structures and make productivity improvements to stay competitive.
Malaysia is a key manufacturer of chips, accounting for more than a tenth of a global trade worth over $20 billion.
The industry associations also warned the increase comes amid surging raw material and commodity prices, as well as labour shortages that were already adding to cost pressure.
They urged the government to consider a gradual wage increase over three years instead.
The Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM), which represents over 11,300 companies, said on Sunday the wage hike would affect manufacturers' payroll cost, business costs and potentially derail business and economic recovery.
""Such a steep increase would have an undesirable impact on their business recovery,"" FMM President Soh Thian Lai said in statement.
FMM said foreign workers would also have to be paid the new minimum wage.
Malaysia, a key manufacturing hub that relies heavily on migrant workers in factories and plantations, has seen its companies come under scrutiny from allegations of forced labour practices that include unpaid wages.

Officials have acknowledged excessive overtime hours, unpaid wages, lack of rest days and unhygienic dormitories which analysts and consultants have said needed to be addressed or the country risked losses in its export-reliant economy.

What kind of hit economic confidence is taking may be shown by Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMIs) for March, while central banks continue to take different paths - Norway is expected to tighten again, though China held the benchmark interest rate for corporate and household lending unchanged on Monday. 
Here's your week ahead in markets from Tom Westbrook in Singapore, Lewis Krauskopf in New York, and Sujata Rao and Dhara Ranasinghe in London.
1/TALKING SHOPS
As Russian jets pound Ukrainian cities, there have been no breakthroughs in peace talks between the two sides. But hectic diplomacy, on several fronts, continues.
Russia is engaging the support of China, India and others, not least to sell commodities in ways that bypass Western sanctions.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is lobbying foreign parliaments and NATO for a no-fly zone over his country. NATO remains wary of direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. It meets on Wednesday in what its chief Jens Stoltenberg calls ""a defining moment for our security"". 
President Joe Biden will join the meeting, and also a mid-week EU summit in Brussels, aiming to cement the new-found cohesiveness with European allies.
But the West risks rifts with China and India, which have not condemned Russian actions. India is buying more Russian oil, and studying a rupee-rouble payment mechanism. A call between Biden and China's Xi Jinping is unlikely to dent China's efforts to occupy the space vacated in Russia by Western firms.

2/LITMUS TEST 
It's flash PMI week. The forward-looking gauge of economic activity for March will be a litmus test of sorts of the impact from the war in Ukraine. 
Generally, PMIs have held above the 50-mark that divides contraction from expansion. But after the ZEW index showed a record slump in German investor morale in March, a recession in Europe's biggest economy cannot be ruled out.
The ZEW hardly registered with markets, more focused on central banks' efforts to stamp on inflation.
But as soaring energy costs squeeze real incomes and consumption, a seriously downbeat batch of PMIs might set the recession warning bells a-ringing.

3/S&P 500 THEN AND NOW
Two years ago on March 23 2020, the S&P 500 index troughed out from a COVID-related nosedive. Since then, it has rallied some 90%, thanks to massive government stimulus and unprecedented support from the Federal Reserve.
Now, markets face a new set of worries. Chief among them: whether the Fed, which lifted rates on Wednesday for the first time since 2018,– will be able to fight soaring inflation without driving the economy into recession.
Ten-year Treasury yields have risen nearly 70 basis points this year, while 2-year yields have jumped 120 bps. If the gap between the two segments, currently around 20 bps, turns negative, it could mean an economic recession is coming.
After the Fed laid out a steeper rate-hike trajectory than many expected, markets will watch upcoming data - besides PMIs, consumer sentiment, new home sales and durable goods are due. They may indicate whether the S&P 500 can claw back a year-to-date 8% loss.

4/ THE HAWK AND THE DOVE
Norway was the first developed nation out of the blocks with post-pandemic policy tightening, having raised interest rates in September and December. On March 24 it will hike again, taking rates to 0.75%. 
With inflation above the 2% target and predictions of 3.6% GDP expansion in 2022, banks expect as many as four rate rises this year. The upcoming meeting will be the first one chaired by new governor Ida Wolden Bache.
Expect no hawkishness from the Swiss National Bank, which meets the same day. It's expected to sit tight and is in no hurry to raise its -0.75% rate, the world's lowest. 
Although February's 2.2% inflation was the highest since 2008, tighter policy risks more Swiss franc appreciation, an important consideration for the export-heavy economy. The SNB made a rare verbal intervention recently and also stepped up foreign currency buying.

5/BOTTOMS UP? China's State Council assurances that policy easing really is on the way and authorities will be gentler on markets gave Chinese stocks their biggest bounce in more than a decade. The challenge now is to deliver meaningful support without spooking investors about the state of the economy. But on Monday, benchmark Loan Prime Rates were held unchanged . 

But many expect policy easing to come via a cut banks' reserve requirement ratios or by lowering medium-term rates that were left on hold this month Either way, investors will need to see something soon.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - China is considering offering a $1.5 billion credit facility to Sri Lanka and a decision is expected soon, a top Chinese official said on Monday, as part of efforts to help the island nation amid its worst economic crisis in decades.
Chinese ambassador to Sri Lanka Qi Zhenhong told reporters the two sides were also discussing a separate loan of up to $1 billion which the Sri Lankan government had requested.
He added that the South Asian nation was offered a loan of $500 million from the China Development Bank on March 18. 
Sri Lanka has to repay about $4 billion worth of debt this year, including a $1 billion international sovereign bond maturing in July. But its reserves dipped to $2.31 billion as of end February, down around 70% from two years ago.
The country is also struggling to make payments for imports of essentials such as fuel and medicines and enforcing nationwide power cuts due to a lack of fuel for power generation. 
""We believe our ultimate goal is to solve the problem but there may be different ways to do so,"" Qi said in response to questions on possible restructuring of the Chinese loans. 
China is Sri Lanka's fourth biggest lender, behind international financial markets, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japan. 
Over the last decade China has lent Sri Lanka more than $5 billion for the construction of highways, ports, an airport and a coal power plant. But critics say the funds were used for white elephant projects with low returns, which China has denied. 
President Gotabaya Rajapaksa asked China to help restructure debt repayments when he met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in January, but China is yet to respond to the request.
Repayments to China are estimated at about $400-$500 million, a finance ministry source told Reuters. 
Rajapaksa said last week Sri Lanka will work with the International Monetary Fund to help solve the country's economic crisis with official talks to begin in mid-April. 

Before the pandemic China was Sri Lanka's main source of tourists and the island imports more goods from China than from any other country.
Sri Lanka is a key part of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a long-term plan to fund and build infrastructure linking China to the rest of the world, but which others including the United States have labelled a ""debt trap"" for smaller nations.

There's arguably little central banks can do to tame surging energy and commodity prices other than try to limit second-round effects as they are being absorbed by the economy. 
With oil prices jumping over $3 this morning and Brent above $110 a barrel, investors will be keen to hear later on today from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde how monetary policy can adjust without rocking the boat of the recovery. 
Strategists are indeed keeping a close eye on the spread between yields between of U.S. two-year and 10-year notes, fearing an inversion of that part of the curve could signal an impending recession.
In Germany, producers prices (PPI) show another 1.4% rise on the month, though slightly less than expected, giving another update about how the euro zone's biggest economy is coping after investor sentiment suffered a record slide in March with collapsing expectations making a recession, a scenario that can no longer be totally dismissed. 
Fuelling the latest spike in crude prices is the European Union governments considering whether to impose an oil embargo on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
Such a decision, even with public opinion overwhelmingly on the side of Ukraine, could cost EU leaders dearly politically. 
Euro zone consumers are getting a taste of what two euros per litre of gasoline tastes and France's Emmanuel Macron, seeking reelection next month, knows only too well that the ""yellow vest"" street rebellion was born out of a backlash against higher fuel prices.
Wheat prices also are at levels seen during the 2007/2008 food crisis, widely regarded as a key factor in the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East. 
So far, the early monetary tightening cycle has been well received and the Fed's first hike saw U.S. and European stock markets experience their best week since November 2020, when the COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough lifted global markets.
European futures are broadly flat ahead of cash trading this morning after MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.7%. 
With markets already on hedge, traders will be keen to discover why shares of embattled property developer China Evergrande Group have been suspended pending an announcement by the company.
Meanwhile investors in Russia will closely watch domestic sovereign bonds resuming trading today after a month-long suspension in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Hedge funds went into the Fed's interest rate lift-off wagering on a stronger dollar and steeper U.S. yield curve, but have so far been wrong-footed as the dollar has since dipped slightly and the curve has flattened dramatically.
Futures market data for the week through March 15, the day before the first rise in U.S. interest rates since 2018, showed that speculators increased their net long dollar position by the largest amount this year.
The data also revealed the biggest shift in favor of two-year Treasuries futures in over a year, a reduction in net short positioning that was twice as aggressive as the scaling back of funds' net short position in 10-year bonds.
Put together, that was effectively a bet that the two-year yield will fall faster than the 10-year yield, thereby 'steepening' the curve. The opposite happened. 
The gap between two- and 10-year Treasury yields shrank by around 13 basis points to just 18 bps after the Fed's rate hike. Inversion of this part of the yield curve, which has preceded every recession in the past 45 years, is close. 
Funds had successfully bet on a flattening yield curve in the first two months of the year. But in recent weeks they have tried to position for a reversal that has yet to materialize. 
The latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed that funds slashed their net short two-year Treasuries position by 92,313 contracts, the biggest weekly move since February last year. They cut their 10-year Treasuries net short position by 56,723 contracts.

A short position is essentially a bet that an asset's price will fall, and a long position is a bet it will rise. In bonds, yields rise when prices fall, and move lower when prices rise.
The Federal Reserve's quarter-percentage point rate hike on March 16 was expected, but policymakers' punchy forecasts on how quickly and high rates will have to rise to quell inflation were not.
""The March FOMC meeting surprised with its hawkish tilt and now reflects a Fed that has caught up to the curve, recognizing the severity of the inflation/employment mismatch,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s U.S. rates strategists wrote on Friday.
This supports a higher terminal rate and overall level of interest rates, and a flatter curve, they added. 
KING DOLLAR'S CROWN SLIPS
The CFTC data also show that funds made a big bet on the dollar strengthening. They increased their bullish dollar bets against a broad range of currencies by almost $4 billion, the biggest weekly increase since November.
But the dollar has struggled post-Fed. It has fallen 0.5% against a basket of currencies and almost 1% against the euro, in part because foreign exchange traders now believe maximum hawkishness on the U.S. rate outlook is in the dollar's price. 
A deeper dive into the latest CFTC report shows that the surge in net long dollar positions was driven by a historic wave of euro selling. 
Net euro longs were slashed by over 40,000 contracts, the biggest weekly swing against the single currency since 2018 and the fourth largest ever. 
Drilling even deeper, that was wholly down to funds liquidating long positions rather than opening new short positions. Longs were slashed by 40,643 contracts, the second most since CFTC contracts were launched in 1999.

Even though the European Central Bank is talking tough on inflation and traders are pricing in rate rises later this year, the Russia-Ukraine war has darkened the euro zone's economic outlook and sentiment towards the euro. 
But could the dollar be poised to rebound? Analysts at MUFG note that the dollar tends to rise when the yield curve flattens from 50 bps to zero, as it did in March 1997 to January 2000, April 2005 to December 2005, and April 2018 to August 2019. 

""The history for the dollar is pretty good at this juncture for the 2s/10s curve spread. We wouldn't expect the same extent of gains ... but dollar strength looks likely,"" they wrote on Friday.

794,"<span>Mar 20, 2022 10:26PM ET</span>",,,,,,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China kept its benchmark interest rate for corporate and household lending unchanged on Monday, as expected, although analysts say the case for monetary stimulus is building amid mounting external risks to an already slowing economy.
The one-year loan prime rate (LPR) was held at 3.70% while the five-year LPR remained at 4.60%.
Just over half the traders and analysts surveyed in a snap Reuters poll last week expected China to keep both rates unchanged.
The pricing of the LPR is loosely pegged to the People's Bank of China (PBOC) medium-term lending facility (MLF) rate, which the central bank kept unchanged last week, dashing expectations for a cut. The LPR is set monthly by 18 banks, who submit quotations of their lending rates by adding a premium over the MLF rate.
Markets now widely expect policymakers to resume monetary easing soon to revive an economy hit by a domestic COVID-19 resurgence, weaker credit growth and a faltering property sector, while increasing global risks from the Ukraine conflict also add pressure.
Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, said more policy stimulus will be needed to meet the country's growth target of around 5.5% for this year.
""We see another round of rate cuts coming in early Q2,"" he said in a note earlier in the day.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who is responsible for broad economic policy in the country, last week urged the roll-out of market-friendly policies to support the slowing economy.
Liu's comments reinforced some market expectations for monetary easing in coming months and many expect the PBOC to cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks and other policy rates.
""There is no precedent of lowering LPR without a RRR or policy rate cut,"" Citi analysts said in a note.
However, some analysts argue lowering interest rates could prompt capital outflows as other major economies, including the United States, start tightening their monetary policy.
Widening policy divergence between the world's two largest economies could shrink China's current yield advantage over the United States, triggering investors to put their money elsewhere.

The yield gap between China's benchmark 10-year government bonds and the U.S. Treasury has shrunk to about 65 basis points, its narrowest in three years.
Most new and outstanding loans in China are based on the one-year LPR. The five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages.

LONDON (Reuters) - Securities settlement house Euroclear said on Monday it had joined a consortium of banks building a payment system for tokenised assets in the latest sign of established institutions teaming up with newcomers in crypto tech.
Belgium-headquartered Euroclear said it had bought a small stake in the three-year old consortium Fnality as it moves deeper into distributed ledger technology (DLT) or blockchain, the technology which underpins cryptoassets like bitcoin.
Euroclear which settles stock and bond trades, the final leg of a transaction where cash is swapped for legal ownership of an asset, said the aim was to settle tokenised assets, or digital securities, against digital cash on DLT in a faster and more efficient way.
Fnality, whose founding shareholders include more than a dozen global banks, said Euroclear's involvement would expand the consortium's footprint in market infrastructure, the financial system's basic plumbing, as it moves from testing to implementing its plan this year.
""This has obvious positive implications for the execution of our business,"" Fnality Chief Executive Rhomaios Ram said in a statement.
Fnality aims to replace some of the cumbersome processes and paperwork involved in transferring value between financial organisations by using digital versions of currencies.
The Bank of England gave the green light last year to a new type of account at the central bank to cater for a wider range of anticipated payments systems, including those based on blockchain.
Fnality submitted an application to the BoE to become an operator of such an account and is due to go live with its pound sterling payment system in October.
Euroclear, which settled the equivalent of 992 trillion euros ($1,095 trillion) in securities last year, is owned by a group of banks and exchanges, including Euronext and the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG).

Fnality's founding shareholders include  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN), BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), CIBC, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), ING, KBC Group (OTC:KBCSY), Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY), Mizuho Bank, MUFG Bank, Nasdaq,  State Street  Corporation (NYSE:STT), Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Banking Corporation and UBS.

Earlier this month, the ECB accelerated its exit from unconventional stimulus, and investors have been ramping up their bets on higher ECB rates.
De Guindos told Handelsblatt in an interview published on Sunday that second-round effects and de-anchoring of price expectations would be ""deciding factors"" for the central bank.
""If we see those, then we will act,"" he said.
Asked about risks to the European financial system due to the war in Ukraine, de Guindos said there were no liquidity bottlenecks, companies were issuing bonds, and that stocks were volatile but without ""dramatic developments"".

He noted the triggering of margin calls for commodities derivatives that have resulted in increased collateral to cover open positions.
""But according to our observations, those facing these margin calls have so far been able to meet them,"" he said.

797,"<span>Mar 20, 2022 10:01AM ET</span>","PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech central bank may discuss whether to use its large foreign exchange reserves to not only stabilise exchange rate fluctuations but also for fighting inflation, central bank Governor Jiri Rusnok said on Sunday.
The bank started buying crowns in the market on March 4 to halt a drop in the currency caused by investor flight after Russia's attack on Ukraine. 
It does not have any target rate nor volumes, and said its action was aimed at unjustified currency weakening. The currency has regained nearly all losses versus the euro since the start of the Russian invasion on February 24.
Rusnok, however, said on Sunday the bank may discuss further using its large reserves accumulated in 2013-2017 -- when the bank intervened to weaken the currency -- to help bring inflation under control.
""Now we have to talk further about further steps, whether we perhaps want to temporarily strengthen the crown not only for the reason of stability, but perhaps also to actively use the exchange rate as an anti-inflationary tool,"" he said.
""But it is necessary to lead a debate on that and it is quite a complicated issue. But I cannot exclude it for myself."" 
Rusnok also said inflation shocks together with the war in Ukraine may bring Czech economic growth to zero by the end of the year and a European recession cannot be excluded.

The central bank has been faster than most others in hiking interest rates since last year, taking the main repo rate to 4.5% and signalling further increase.
It held 157.46 billion euros in foreign exchange reserves as of the end of February, equal to about two thirds of the country's gross domestic product.

Investing.com -- With a long-awaited rate hike from the Federal Reserve out of the way investors will be looking to see whether stocks are set for a sustained recovery or if more turbulence awaits. The war in Ukraine will remain in focus, with markets continuing to monitor headlines. Oil markets are calmer but concerns over supply shortages remain to the fore. The economic calendar is light but there will be two appearances from Fed Chair Jerome Powell during the week, while the Eurozone and the U.K. are to release PMI data. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
U.S. stocks stormed back last week after the Fed delivered its first rate hike since 2018 along with an encouraging assessment of the U.S. economy.
Wall Street's three main indexes notched up their largest weekly percentage gains since early November 2020 with the Dow climbing 5.5%, the S&P 500 adding 6.2% and the Nasdaq rising 8.2%.
But investors must now wrestle with the question of whether the Fed will be able to fight soaring inflation without pushing the economy into recession.
Last week JPMorgan forecast the S&P 500 would end the year at 4,900, about 10% above Friday’s close, saying that markets “have now cleared the much-anticipated Fed liftoff with policy likely as hawkish as it gets.""
But concerns over stubbornly high inflation, sky-high commodity prices and few signs of an end to the war in Ukraine are continuing to cloud the outlook for investors.
Market watchers will continue to monitor the course of the war in Ukraine and headlines could continue to cause market turbulence in the upcoming week. Diplomacy efforts are ongoing even as Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities continue.
U.S. President Joe Biden is to join a NATO meeting on Wednesday and also a mid-week EU summit in Brussels, aiming to cement the new-found cohesiveness with European allies.
The West is risking rifts with China and India, which have not condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
On Friday, Biden warned his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, of ""consequences"" if Beijing gave material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
China has not condemned Russia's actions, though it has expressed concern about the war.
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said on Saturday that Western sanctions against Russia were ""outrageous.""
On Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is to speak about the economic outlook at the annual conference of the National Association for Business Economics, less than a week after the Fed kicked off what is expected to be an aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle.
On Wednesday, Powell is to participate in a virtual panel discussion at a summit hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.
Several other Fed officials are also due to make speeches during the week, including New York Fed President John Williams, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans.
The U.S. economic calendar is relatively light and will feature reports on durable goods orders, initial jobless claims, both new and pending home sales, as well as services and manufacturing PMI data.
Last week oil prices recorded a second consecutive weekly decline, with both Brent and U.S. crude ending the week down about 4%.
Oil prices have been on a roller coaster ride, hitting the highest levels in 14 years two weeks ago, boosted by the supply crunch from traders avoiding Russian barrels and dwindling oil stockpiles.
But prices were pressured by worries about demand after a surge in coronavirus cases in China, while faltering nuclear talks with Iran have been a wild card on the market.
The International Energy Agency has said oil markets could lose 3 million bpd of Russian oil from April. That loss would be far greater than an expected drop in demand resulting from higher fuel prices, the IEA said.
The Ukraine crisis has exacerbated the issue of limited output capacity. The world is set for a supply deficit of 700,000 bpd in the second quarter, the IEA has said.
The Eurozone and the U.K. are to release PMI data for March that will be a litmus test of sorts of the impact from the war in Ukraine.
Generally, PMIs have held above the 50-mark that divides contraction from expansion. But after the ZEW index showed a record slump in German investor morale in March, a recession in the euro area’s largest economy cannot be ruled out.
Markets shrugged off the slump in the ZEW index, focusing instead on efforts by central banks to curb inflation.
But as soaring energy costs squeeze household spending, a downbeat batch of PMIs might set off alarm bells.

Trump ended negotiations over the so-called Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and instead pressed a number of trade disputes with the EU.
""We should resume negotiations on a transatlantic free trade agreement. Especially now in the (Ukraine) crisis, it is becoming clear how important free trade is with partners around the world who share our values,"" Christian Lindner, the finance minister of Europe's largest economy, told Handelsblatt.
It is unclear to what extent there is support for such talks in Europe. In recent years, some officials have spoken in favour of a resumption, while others have been more cautious.
Germany's finance ministry didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

In a statement, the U.S. embassy in Berlin didn't respond directly to Lindner's proposal but said an existing U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council ensured that trade and technology policies support broad-based growth.
""The current crisis shows the United States and Germany, and the European Union, are indispensable partners,"" it added.
