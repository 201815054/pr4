WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity slowed in early February likely as a global semiconductor chip shortage hurt production at automobile plants, while prices of inputs and manufactured goods soared, which could heighten fears of strong inflation growth this year.
The report from data firm IHS Markit on Friday also showed businesses in the services industry were experiencing higher costs related to the procurement of personal protective equipment, a greater proportion of which they were passing on to clients ""through a marked rise in selling prices.""
Inflation is being closely watched amid concerns from some quarters that President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 rescue package could cause the economy to overheat. The package would be on top of nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus provided at the end of December.
""A concern is that firms' costs have surged higher, driving selling prices for goods and services up at a survey record pace and hinting at a further increase in inflation,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
IHS Markit's flash U.S. manufacturing PMI dropped to 58.5 in the first half of this month from a final reading of 59.2 in January. Extreme weather in large parts of the United States was also blamed. The data was in line with economists' forecasts. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Manufacturing has powered ahead as the pandemic left Americans grounded at home, shifting demand to household goods from services like airline travel and hotel accommodation.
But the coronavirus has disrupted labor at both suppliers and manufacturers, leading to shortages of goods critical to the production processes. Motor vehicle manufacturers have been hit by a semiconductor chip shortage, leading some to temporarily close assembly plants this month.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced it would take down production entirely at its Fairfax plant in Kansas City during the week of Feb. 8. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) has reduced shifts at its Dearborn truck plant and Kansas City assembly plant. 
The supply chain bottlenecks, which are widespread across the manufacturing sector as well as the services industry, have led to higher prices for inputs, including raw materials. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers shot up to its highest level since April 2011. A gauge of prices received by factories surged to its highest level since July 2008.
Though price pressures are expected to rise as last year's low readings drop out of the calculation, there is no consensus among economists whether higher inflation would stick beyond the so-called base effects. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week while he expected inflation to be boosted by base effects and pent-up demand when the economy fully reopens, that would be transitory, citing three decades of lower and stable prices. 
The inflation outlook will likely hinge on the labor market, which is currently experiencing considerable slack, with at least 18.3 million Americans on unemployment benefits.
While the manufacturing expansion cooled, activity in the services industry gained traction this month. 
The IHS Markit's flash services sector PMI edged up to 58.9 from a final reading of 58.3 in January. The highest reading since March 2015 came as new COVID-19 infections and hospitalization rates dropped, allowing authorities to roll back some restrictions on consumer-facing businesses. 
The services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, has borne the brunt of the pandemic.
Cost burdens for services businesses increased at their steepest pace since October 2009, leading to firms boosting their selling prices at the sharpest rate on record.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.

STRONG HOUSING MARKET
Manufacturing and housing are leading the economy's recovery from the pandemic recession. In a separate report on Friday, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales rose 0.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.69 million units in January. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would fall 1.5% to a rate of 6.61 million units in January. The second straight monthly increase in sales was despite contracts to buy a home declining for four consecutive months. The NAR attributed the misalignment to different sample sizes. 
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, surged 23.7% on a year-on-year basis. The gains have defied tight supply, which has led to a surge in house price inflation. Sales last month were concentrated in the mid-to-upper price range of the market. Sales fell in the Northeast and West. They, however, rose in the South and the Midwest.
""Existing home sales will remain strong but will be unable to move significantly higher until more supply appears,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.

The housing market is being driven by still historically low mortgage rates, and demand for spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling. 
There were a record-low 1.04 million previously owned homes on the market in January, down 25.7% from one year ago. The median existing house price shot up 14.1% from a year ago to $303,900 in January. 
At January's sales pace, it would take 1.9 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.1 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

The business confidence index fell 0.12% to 48.7% in January, the government's DANE statistics agency said.
Colombia's biggest cities declared neighborhood lockdowns during the last days of December and the start of January, as well as curfews and restrictions on movement to contain a second wave of the pandemic.
Business owners' outlook on whether things would improve for companies and the country over the next 12 months deteriorated last month, according to DANE. 
""This may be an indirect sign that effectively targeted closures, specific measures to restrict consumer access to goods and commerce due to the epidemiological situations that we saw in January are presenting cause for concern,"" said DANE director Juan Daniel Oviedo.
Some 46.9% of business owners reported declining demand for their goods and services, as well as supply-side problems, Oviedo said. 
Latin America's fourth-largest economy contracted a historic 6.8% last year.

While both analysts and authorities expect economic recovery this year, Colombia's central bank lowered its GDP growth projections for 2021 to a range of between 2% and 6%, with 4.5% as the most likely figure, from a previous projection of between 3% and 7%, due to the quarantines of the first month.

The inventory crunch could ease as builders step up construction, though they are facing challenges from record lumber prices as well as shortages of land and labor. 
The government reported on Thursday that permits for future home building soared in January to their highest level since May 2006.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales tumbled in January as shops went back into lockdown, official data showed, but lower-than-expected public borrowing gave at least some relief to finance minister Rishi Sunak as he prepares his next round of emergency spending.
A separate survey suggested the economy barely shrank in February as companies adjusted to the new restrictions and firms were very upbeat about the prospects for a rebound thanks to the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccinations.
The data for January showed retail sales volumes slumped by 8.2% from December, a far bigger fall than the 2.5% decrease forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and the second largest on record. 
""The only good thing about the current lockdown is that it's no way near as bad for the economy as the first one,"" Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
The smaller fall in retail sales than last April's 18% plunge reflected the growth in online shopping.
The Office for National Statistics said public sector borrowing of 8.8 billion pounds ($12.3 billion) was the first January deficit in a decade, but the deficit was a lot less than a forecast of 24.5 billion pounds in the Reuters poll.
That took borrowing since the start of the financial year in April to 270.6 billion pounds, reflecting the surge in spending and tax cuts ordered by Sunak.
That figure does not yet include losses on government-backed loans which are likely to add 30 billion pounds to the shortfall this year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank. 
Sunak is expected to extend the government's wage subsidies, at least for the hardest-hit sectors, in his budget statement on March 3, but he said on Friday the time would come for a reckoning.
""It's right that once our economy begins to recover, we should look to return the public finances to a more sustainable footing and I'll always be honest with the British people about how we will do this,"" he said.
Some economists see higher taxes sooner rather than later.
""Big tax rises eventually will have to be announced, with 2022 likely to be the worst year, so that they will be far from voters' minds by the time of the next general election in May 2024,"" Samuel Tombs, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.
Public debt rose to 2.115 trillion pounds or 97.9% of gross domestic product, a share not seen since the early 1960s. 
BOUNCE-BACK AHEAD?
Britain's economy - which had its biggest slump in 300 years in 2020 when it contracted by 10% - will shrink by 4% in the first three months of 2021 before recovering thanks to the fast COVID-19 vaccination programme, the Bank of England says.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will lift the lockdown in England only gradually.
But a survey by market research firm GfK showed consumers were the most confident since the pandemic struck. 
""The hope, and our expectation, is that when the lockdown is finally lifted, we will see a surge in consumer spending, rather than a more permanent scarring of the consumer confidence,"" James Sproule, an economist at Handelsbanken, said. 
Another survey, the IHS Markit/CIPS flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index suggested activity stabilised this month after a big fall in January.
""Although the data hint at a renewed contraction of the economy in the first quarter, business expectations for the year ahead improved to the highest for almost seven years, suggesting the economy is poised for recovery,"" IHS Markit's chief business economist, Chris Williamson, said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Business activity across the euro zone contracted again in February as lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus hammered the bloc's dominant service industry, a survey showed, even as factories had their busiest month in three years.
With daily reported infections still high governments have been encouraging citizens to stay home and closed much of the continent's hospitality industry while factories have largely remained open.
IHS Markit's flash composite PMI, seen as a good guide to economic health, nudged closer to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, registering 48.1 in February compared to January's 47.8. A Reuters poll had predicted 48.0.
However, some of that activity was from completing old orders. The backlogs of work index fell to 47.9 from 49.0.
""Ongoing COVID-19 lockdown measures dealt a further blow to the euro zone's service sector in February, adding to the likelihood of GDP falling again in the first quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
The euro zone economy is in a double-dip recession, according to last week's Reuters poll of economists, who said the risks to their already weak outlook was skewed more to the downside. [ECILT/EU]
A PMI covering the services industry fell to 44.7 from January's 45.4, well below the median expectation in a Reuters poll for 45.9.
But with vaccination programmes accelerating, driving hopes for a return to some form of normality, optimism about the year ahead improved sharply. The services business expectations index climbed to its highest since April 2018.
""Assuming vaccine roll-outs can boost service sector growth alongside a sustained strong manufacturing sector, the second half of the year should see a robust recovery take hold,"" Williamson said.
Strong demand for manufactured goods helped the factory PMI soar to 57.7 from 54.8, the highest since February 2018 and well above all forecasts in a Reuters poll that predicted 54.3. An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, jumped to 57.5 from 54.6.

The new orders index also soared and factories hired additional staff for the first time in nearly two years. The employment index rose to 50.9 from 49.4.

IHS Markit's flash purchasing managers' index (PMI) of activity in the manufacturing sector shot up to 60.6 from 57.1 in January, beating a forecast for fall to 56.5. 
Reflecting differing fortunes in Europe's biggest economy, activity in the services sector slowed to a nine-month low of 45.9 from 46.7 in January. This was below both the 50 mark separating growth from contraction and a forecast reading of 46.5.
As a result, the flash composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, rose to a two-month high of 51.3 from 50.8 the previous month.
Germany went into lockdown in November and restrictions were tightened in mid-December to stem the coronavirus. Most of the measures that shut all non-essential businesses have been extended until March 7 as more contagious variants of the virus led to border controls being imposed with the Czech Republic and Austria.
""Ongoing weakness in services, where large parts of the sector remain either closed or disrupted by virus containment measures, continues to be counterbalanced by strong, export-driven growth across manufacturing,"" said Phil Smith, Associate Director at IHS Markit.
He added that the survey had showed record reports of delivery delays and sharply rising input prices, pointing to increasing supply-side pressures.

""Looking further down the line, businesses are growing in confidence about the outlook for activity in the year ahead, with the vaccine roll-out hoped to bring an end to restrictions later in the year and help release pent-up demand,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices marked the sixth straight month of annual declines in January but the pace of falls slowed, offering some relief for policymakers worried about deflationary pressures the economy face from the coronavirus pandemic.
Still, soft domestic demand means the Bank of Japan's priority will be to avert a return to deflation, unlike other countries such as the United States where inflation has recently perked up.
Core consumer prices, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, fell 0.6% in January from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, compared with a median market forecast for a 0.7% drop.
The decline was smaller than a 1.0% drop in December, partly due to the termination of the government's ""Go To"" discount campaign for domestic travel and a recent rebound in fuel costs.
Durable goods prices rose on strong demand from stay-home policies to prevent the spread of the pandemic, with prices of air conditioners rising 7.2% and those for microwave ovens up 12.2%, the data showed.
The so-called ""core-core"" CPI, which strips away the impact of both energy and fresh food costs, rose 0.1% from a year earlier after three straight months of declines.
""Looking past a potential renewed drag once the Go To campaigns resume ... inflation should recover into positive territory over the coming months as energy prices rebound and underlying price pressures return in line with the economic recovery,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
Japan's economy expanded more than expected in the fourth quarter, extending the recovery from its worst postwar recession thanks to a rebound in overseas demand that boosted exports and capital spending.

But new state of emergency curbs rolled out in January cloud the outlook, underscoring the challenge policymakers face in preventing the spread of COVID-19 without choking off a fragile recovery.

7,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 08:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian household spending rose at a slower-than-expected pace in January as a short, sharp Covid-19 lockdown in the northeastern state of Queensland dragged on stronger performances in other parts of the country.
Preliminary retail sales advanced 0.6% from December, but came in below economists’ median estimate of a 2% gain, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said in a report released in Sydney Friday. Queensland dropped 1.5% last month, while New South Wales advanced 1%.
“There continues to be variations in retail sales between states and territories, as Covid-19 restrictions are tightened or eased,” said Ben James, an official at the ABS. “All states and territories rose in January, except Queensland, where a three-day lockdown impacted trade. NSW led the rises, as restrictions that began in December were eased during January.”
Australians are cashed up from government stimulus and fewer spending options during the Covid-19 lockdown. That’s been reinforced by the central bank slashing its key interest rate to 0.10% and initiating bond-buying programs that have helped lower borrowing costs across the economy.
Authorities’ success in suppressing Covid-19 -- outside occasional flare-ups -- has resulted in a rapid rebound in household and business sentiment, boosting activity and hiring. Unemployment has fallen from a pandemic peak of 7.5% to 6.4% in January as fiscal and monetary stimulus supported the economy through the worst of Covid-19, and is now fueling a recovery.
Australia’s household savings ratio stood at an elevated 18.9% at the end of September last year, having reached a record 22.1% in mid-2020.
Today’s data showed food retailing led the gains, as supermarkets recovered from a fall in December. There were declines in clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing, household goods and department stores, which all saw impacts from interrupted trade in Queensland, the ABS said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased last week, raising the possibility of a second straight month of tepid job growth despite declining new COVID-19 infections.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, could add impetus to President Joe Biden's push for a $1.9 trillion package to aid the recovery from the pandemic. 
At least 18.3 million Americans were receiving unemployment checks at the end of January. Government-funded benefits for millions of these people will expire in mid-March unless Congress approves the Biden administration's spending plan.
""Robust pandemic aid is precisely the medicine the economy needs to get Americans back where they want to be, at work,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 861,000 for the week ended Feb. 13. Data for the prior week was revised to show 55,000 more applications received than previously reported. 
There were big jumps in filings in California and Illinois, while claims in Ohio remained elevated. 
Graphic: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/qmyvmwbbavr/joblessclaims.png
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 765,000 applications in the latest week. Many were perplexed by the second straight weekly increase in claims, given the declining coronavirus cases, the disbursement of nearly $900 billion in additional rescue aid by the government in late December and the White House's pending massive stimulus package.
Timely data have shown an improvement in economic activity, with retail sales surging by the most in seven months in January. A Conference Board survey on Thursday showed only 12% of chief executive officers in the first quarter anticipated reducing their workforce over the next 12 months, down from 34% in the prior period. 
""Although the economy in the first quarter appears to be rebounding more strongly than expected, the same does not appear to be true of the labor market at this point,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
PLANT CLOSURES
Some of the increase in claims could be related to the temporary closure of automobile plants beginning last week due to a global semiconductor chip shortage. General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced it would take down production entirely at its Fairfax plant in Kansas City during the week of Feb. 8. 
Claims could remain higher after a winter storm walloped Texas and parts of the South this week. 
Filings for a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs jumped 174,427 to 516,299 last week, which economists blamed on fraud in Ohio. Including this program, 1.4 million people filed claims last week.
Claims remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession, though they are below the record 6.867 million reported last March when the pandemic hit the United States.
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm portion of February's employment report. Though claims have not provided a good signal on job growth because of the shock caused by the pandemic, the continued increase in filings is consistent with weak labor market conditions.
""The claims data are consistent with the downbeat message from labor market indicators at the start of the year,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""While downside risks remain, broader vaccine distribution and increased fiscal support should lead to a marked improvement in labor market trends by the spring and summer.""
The economy created 49,000 jobs in January after shedding 227,000 in December, the first drop in payrolls in eight months.
About 12.3 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic have been recovered. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated employment would not return to its pre-pandemic level before 2024. 
Labor market sluggishness is likely to prevent an anticipated acceleration in inflation this year from becoming troublesome. A second report from the Labor Department showed import prices increased by the most in nearly nine years in January, lifted by higher prices for energy products and a weak dollar.

But the economy is steadily improving, with the housing market and manufacturing the main pillars of support. 
In a third report, the Commerce Department said permits for future home construction soared 10.4% to a rate of 1.881 million units in January, the highest level since May 2006. 
The housing market has outperformed other sectors of the economy during the pandemic, supported by lower mortgages rates and demand for spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling.
""Strength in forward-looking building permits reaffirm that housing sector activity can remain strong into 2021, with new construction, in particular, becoming an engine for growth in the coming months,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. 
A fourth report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed its business conditions index slipped to a still solid reading of 23.1 this month from 26.5 in January amid a decline in new orders and shipments. But factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware boosted employment and increased hours for workers.

The Conference Board's ""Measure of CEO Confidence"" showed chief executives were the most confident they had been since 2004. 
It also indicated that 36% of CEOs planned pay increases for their employees of more than 3% in the next 12 months, up from 22% in the previous survey in September. And just 12% expect to cut jobs in the next year, down from 34% previously.
The survey, conducted between Jan. 14 and Jan. 29, also found that 45% of CEOs expect to increase capital spending, up from 25% in September, and 47% plan to expand their workforce, up from 33%.
The report may foreshadow a long-hoped-for improvement in a U.S. labor market that is still deeply scarred by the pandemic and its disruptions to businesses and everyday life.

The Labor Department said on Thursday import prices jumped 1.4% last month, the biggest gain since March 2012, after increasing 1.0% in December. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, gaining 1.0% in January. In the 12 months through January, import prices rebounded 0.9% after slipping 0.3% in December. That was the biggest year-on-year gain since October 2018 and followed 11 straight monthly declines.
Inflation is being closely watched amid concerns from some quarters that President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion COVDO-19 recovery plan could cause the economy to overheat. But inflation is likely to be driven by the labor market, which is experiencing considering slack. 
The government last week reported a moderate increase in consumer prices in January. Producer prices recorded their largest increase since 2009 in January, in part reflecting bottlenecks in the supply chain caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Imported fuel prices increased 7.4% last month after soaring 8.1% in December. Imported food prices surged 2.1%. 
Excluding fuels and foods, import prices accelerated 0.8% after gaining 0.4% in December. The rise in the so-called core import prices reflected the dollar's 2.7% drop last year against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners.
Last month, the cost of goods imported from China rose 0.3% for a second straight month. Prices for imported capital goods gained 0.2%. The cost of imported motor vehicles rose 0.2%. Prices for consumer goods excluding autos dipped 0.1%.
The report also showed export prices surged 2.5% in January, the largest rise since the index was first published on a monthly basis in December 1988, after increasing 1.3% in December. Prices for agricultural exports rose 6.0%, while nonagricultural exports increased 2.2%.

The housing market has outperformed other sectors of the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supported by lower mortgages rates and demand for spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling. But expensive inputs and lack of land pose a threat to continued robust housing market gains.
A survey on Wednesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders edged up in February. But builders complained that record high lumber prices were ""adding thousands of dollars to the cost of a new home and causing some builders to abruptly halt projects.""
Softwood lumber prices jumped a record 73% on a year-on-year basis in January, according to data from the Labor Department. Still, the housing market remains supported by historically low mortgage rates and lean inventories of previously owned homes.
Permits for future homebuilding shot up 10.4% to a rate of 1.881 million units in January. Permits typically lead starts by one to two months.

Investing.com -- The hoped-for improvement in the U.S. labor market failed to materialize, last week, as another wave of layoffs put the country on course for another disappointing payrolls report in two weeks' time.
Initial jobless claims rose to 861,000 last week, the Labor Department said, rather than falling to 765,000 as expected. To make it worse, the previous week's figures were revised upwards by over 50,000 to 848,000. As such, initial claims are still running fairly close to the recent peak of just over 900,000.
The number of continuing claims, which are calculated with a one-week lag to initial claims, also disappointed. They only inched down to 4.494 million from an upwardly revised 4.558 million. Analysts had expected a figure of 4.413 million.  
However, including those enrolled on pandemic-specific programs, the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits fell in the week through January 30 fell by some 1.3 million to 18.34 million.
Data from the housing market released at the same time showed that activity stayed at historically high rates in January, albeit coming slightly off December's 14-year high. Housing starts fell to 1.58 million from 1.68 million in December, a development that masked divergent trends for single- and multi-family build. Single-family starts fell 6% from the previous month, while multi-family starts - typically associated with rental property - rose 16.2%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rebounded sharply in January after households received additional pandemic relief money from the government, suggesting a pick-up in economic activity after being restrained by a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections late last year.
The largest gain in retail sales in seven months reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday was across the board, and ended three straight monthly decreases. The acceleration in activity at the start of 2021 was evident in other data showing strong growth in production and prices at factories last month.
Still, the solid economic data did not argue against President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery plan. Millions of Americans remain unemployed. Though COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates have declined, new strains of the virus pose a risk to the economy fully reopening. 
""The economy picked up steam in January and inflation came along for the ride,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Since President Biden is intent on getting a major bill through, look for that to happen and for government money to continue to get into the hands of households and businesses.""  
Retail sales surged by a seasonally adjusted 5.3% last month after decreasing 1.0% in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales increasing 1.1% in January. 
Retail sales increased 7.4% from a year ago. Sales last month were led by motor vehicles, with receipts at auto dealerships accelerating 3.1%. Sales at clothing stores soared 5.0%. Consumers also stepped up spending at restaurants and bars, boosting receipts 6.9%. Still, sales at restaurants and bars were down 16.6% compared to January 2020. 
Receipts at electronics and appliance stores powered ahead 14.7% and sales at furniture stores surged 12.0%. There were also hefty increases in sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores.
Receipts at food and beverage stores rose solidly, as did those at building material stores. Online retail sales jumped 11.0% after dropping 7.3% in December.

The government approved another coronavirus rescue package worth nearly $900 billion at the end of December, which included $600 checks to mostly low-income and some middle-income Americans. The bulk of the money was disbursed in early January, which supported discretionary spending last month. 
The package also extended a government-funded weekly unemployment subsidy as well as benefits for millions of people who do not qualify for state unemployment programs as well as those who have exhausted their six months of eligibility. These benefits are set to expire in mid-March.
As with the previous stimulus checks, consumers saved a big chunk of the latest payouts.
""Less than a quarter of the stimulus check funds were quickly spent at retailers,"" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We estimate that the personal saving rate moved up to around 20% last month."" 
Some of the sharp rebound was technical. The model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data typically anticipates a bigger post-holiday season drop in retail sales in January. The drop in unadjusted sales was the smallest since 1992, contributing to the big rise in the seasonally adjusted retail sales.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales jumped 6.0% last month after decreasing 2.4% in December. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
U.S. stocks fell. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
INFLATION BUILDING UP
Further gains in sales are expected in the months ahead. The Biden administration's recovery plan, under consideration in the U.S. Congress, will include an additional $1,400 check to households. The distribution of vaccines is improving, which should allow more restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses to reopen in the spring. 
Americans are sitting on $2.38 trillion in savings, which is expected could unleash pent-up demand for services like air travel and hotel accommodation, hardest hit by the pandemic.
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said manufacturing production rose 1.0% last month after gaining 0.9% in December. The ninth straight monthly advance in factory production was despite a shortage of semiconductors weighing on the output of motor vehicles.
Graphic: Industrial output - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jznvnoxnapl/industrialoutput.png
Solid manufacturing and robust core retail sales left economists to anticipate first-quarter GDP growth well above the 4.0% annualized rate logged in the fourth quarter.
""The blow-out retail sales report puts in place some initial strong scaffolding for growth in the first quarter of 2021,"" said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College. ""Underlying growth momentum is building as the third seasonal wave of the pandemic has moved over the hump, and the vaccination program is being accelerated.""
Firming economic activity is starting to boost inflation. In a third report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand jumped 1.3% last month, the biggest gain since December 2009. That followed a 0.3% rise in December.

Inflation is being watched amid concerns from some quarters that Biden's recovery plan could cause the economy to overheat, though much will depend on the labor market.

Business inventories rose 0.6% in December after gaining 0.5% in November, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories rising 0.5% in December. Inventories fell 2.6% on a year-on-year basis in December.
Retail inventories increased 1.2% in December, instead of 1.0% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.7% rise in November. Motor vehicle inventories increased 1.1%, rather than 0.9% as previously reported.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, gained 1.2%, instead of 1.1% as estimated last month.
The economy grew at a 4.0% annualized rate in the fourth quarter after a historic 33.4% growth pace in the third quarter. Inventories contributed to GDP growth for two straight quarters.
Businesses are replenishing inventories after they were drawn down early in the pandemic. That has helped to underpin manufacturing, offsetting slowing consumer spending.
Wholesale inventories rose 0.3% in December. Stocks at manufacturers also gained 0.3%.

Business sales jumped 0.8% in December after being unchanged in November. At December's sales pace, it would take 1.32 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from November.

Manufacturing production rose 1.0% last month after gaining 0.9% in December, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. That was the ninth straight monthly advance in factory production. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output increasing 0.7% in January. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, has powered ahead as the pandemic left Americans grounded at home, shifting demand to household goods from services like airline travel and hotel accommodation.
Manufacturing momentum could slow in the spring as the distribution of vaccines reaches large swathes of the population, helping to slow the spread of the virus. That could unleash pent-up demand for travel.
Still, production at factories will be supported by low customer inventories, as well as lean stocks at manufacturers. A survey this month showed a dip in manufacturing sentiment in January.
The Fed report showed motor vehicles and parts output declined 0.7% in January. Production at auto plants has been hampered by a shortage of semiconductors. Motor vehicle production slipped 0.2% in December. Excluding autos, manufacturing output increased 1.0%.
The strength in manufacturing output combined with 2.3% jump in mining to lift industrial production by 0.9% in January. That followed a 1.3% surge in December. Industrial production remains below its pre-pandemic level. Utilities output fell 1.2%. 
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose 0.7 percentage point to 74.6% in January. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector increased 0.7 percentage points to 75.6%. It is 4.0 percentage points below its 1972-2019 average.

Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate rose at a faster pace in January, edging slightly ahead of analyst expectations on higher prices for durable goods and gasoline, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.
The inflation rate accelerated to 1.0%, up from a year-on-year increase of 0.7% in December, and beating analyst expectations of 0.9%. 
Durable goods prices rose 1.7%, while gasoline prices were up 6.1% amid oil production cuts, though they remain 3.3% lower than January 2020 levels.
""In the next few months, with the run-up in oil prices in particular and other commodities, and when we compare ourselves to what happened a year ago, we are going to get some very big inflation numbers,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. 
""So I think this is just an opening salvo in terms of what we are about to see for headline inflation.""
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.2% lower at 1.2717 to the greenback, or 78.63 U.S. cents, as the greenback broadly rallied.
Two of the three core measures of inflation moved in January, with all remaining below the Bank of Canada's 2% target. The common measure, which the Bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was steady at 1.3%, while trim rose to 1.8% and median fell to 1.4%.
""I'd put more emphasis on a little bit weaker core inflation than the pop in the headline,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of Capital Markets Economics at Scotiabank. 
""We know that we're getting towards the bottom of a cycle if we're not there already. (The Bank of Canada's) greater concern should be about inflation outlook.""
The Bank of Canada has said it will keep its key rate at a record low 0.25% into 2023.

Statistics Canada noted that the rise in consumer prices occurred amid continuing economic uncertainty. Populous Ontario and Quebec were both under strict health restrictions in January as COVID-19 spread. Those restrictions are now being eased.

18,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 09:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased by the most since 2009 in January as the cost of goods and services surged, suggesting inflation at the factory gate was starting to creep up.
The producer price index for final demand jumped 1.3% last month, the biggest gain since December 2009 when the government revamped the series, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. That followed a 0.3% rise in December. In the 12 months through January, the PPI accelerated 1.7% after rising 0.8% in December.
A 1.3% rise in the prices of services accounted for two-thirds of the increase in the PPI. That was the biggest gain since December 2009 and followed a 0.1% drop in December. 
The cost of goods surged 1.4% after gaining 1.0% in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would rise 0.4% in January and gain 0.9% on a year-on-year basis.
Inflation is under focus this year amid concerns from some quarters that President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery plan could lead to the overheating of the economy. The package, which would follow on the heels of nearly $900 billion in additional COVID-19 pandemic relief from the government in late December, is working its way thorough the U.S. Congress.
Higher inflation is anticipated by the spring as price declines early in the coronavirus crisis wash out of the calculations, but there is no consensus among economists on whether it would stick beyond the so-called base effects.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week he expected the rise in price pressures would be transitory, citing three decades of lower and stable inflation. 
Slack in the labor market remains excessive, with at least 20 million Americans on unemployment benefits. 
The government last week reported a moderate rise in consumer prices in January. 
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices accelerated 1.2% in January. The so-called core PPI increased 0.4% in December. In the 12 months through January, the core PPI rose jumped 2.0% after gaining 1.1% in December.
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target, a flexible average. The U.S. central bank has signaled it would tolerate higher prices after inflation persistently undershot its target. The core PCE price index is at 1.5%. 
Wholesale energy prices surged 5.1% after rising 4.9% in December. Food prices gained 0.2%. Core goods prices increased 0.8%. A 1.4% jump in prices for final demand services less trade, transportation, and warehousing accounted for more than 70% of the increase in services last month.

Healthcare costs accelerated 1.2%, while portfolio fees soared 9.4%. Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index.

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation edged up in January as consumers hunkered down with new sofas and duvets and spent more on food, video games and other home entertainment as they went into a third national coronavirus lockdown.
Annual consumer price inflation rose to a three-month high of 0.7% last month, and many economists expect it to overshoot the Bank of England's 2% target later this year as temporary tax cuts and a cap on household fuel bills expire.
""That would knock on the head any lingering hopes of more policy stimulus from the Bank of England, although we doubt it would prompt tighter monetary policy, either,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
Customs fees and transport disruption caused by new post-Brexit red tape might also push up prices, though the Office for National Statistics said it saw no evidence of this yet.
Yields on 10- and 30-year British government bonds extended their recent climb and briefly hit their highest since March 2020 after Wednesday's data. Inflation worries have lifted yields globally as investors prepare for more fiscal stimulus in the United States.
Economists polled by Reuters had mostly thought the consumer price index would hold at December's 0.6% increase.
Food and drink prices rose by 0.6% from December to January, compared with a 0.2% fall over the same period a year earlier. Furniture and household goods prices dropped by 1.5%, a smaller decline than a year earlier at a time of year when there are normally big seasonal sales.
The costs for ""games, toys and hobbies"" was 3.4% higher than a month earlier, adding materially to overall inflation.
By contrast, clothing and footwear prices fell by the most between December and January in seven years as retailers, with their stores closed, tried to offload stock.
The shift to working and relaxing at home has also fed through into greater demand for housing, accelerated by a temporary tax break that is due to expire on March 31. 
House prices in December were up by 8.5%, the ONS said, the biggest annual increase in over six years. Later private-sector data has pointed to a cooling in prices as the end of the tax break nears.
INFLATION TO RISE, BOE TO WAIT
British inflation has been below the BoE's 2% target since mid-2019 and came close to zero last year as the economy tanked.
The BoE expects it will accelerate in the spring as last year's emergency cut in value-added tax for the hospitality sector expires and oil prices rise on expectations of recovery. 
But the BoE has stressed it will be in no hurry to start removing its huge stimulus.
Samuel Tombs, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said higher annual price rises for furniture and household appliances might reflect higher shipping and Brexit-related costs.
A core version of the CPI, which excludes volatile fuel and food prices, held steady at 1.4%.

Factory gate prices fell again, dropping by 0.2% on the year, but manufacturers' input costs rose by 1.3%, the biggest increase since May 2019.

Sweden was the only EU country where sales were positive, rising 22.5%, with low registration figures in January last year due to a vehicle tax increase behind the increase.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports accelerated in January, led by a jump in Chinese demand, and manufacturers' sentiment turned positive for the first time since 2019 signalling a gradual recovery from last year's deep coronavirus slump.
Core machinery orders, a volatile but leading indicator of capital spending, unexpectedly rose in December, an encouraging sign for a private sector-led recovery, even as renewed curbs to contain the pandemic weighed on business activity.
Despite the upbeat indicators, however, analysts warn the recovery momentum in the world's third-largest economy could stall as policymakers struggle to balance the need to contain the virus against the need to revive growth and fix Japan's dire finances.
""The economy's recovery is pausing in the current quarter, although development of coronavirus vaccines may reduce risks ahead,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""Uncertainty remains high for both exports and machinery orders, as delays in vaccinations or resumption of activity among the public on expectations for vaccines could heighten risks of another wave of virus resurgence.""
The indicators followed fourth-quarter gross domestic product data on Monday that showed Japan's economy grew more than expected, as a fast-recovering Chinese economy helped boost exports and capital expenditure.
Ministry of Finance data showed on Wednesday exports rose 6.4% in January from a year earlier, roughly in line with a 6.6% increase seen by economists in a Reuters poll and following a 2.0% gain in December.
By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, jumped 37.5% in the year to January, the biggest gain since April 2010, led by chip-making equipment, plastics and nonferrous metal. The big gain is partly due to the base effect of the large decline seen a year before when the Lunar New Year holidays, which weighs on trade activity, fell in January, a ministry official said.
U.S.-bound shipments fell 4.8%, dragged down by airplanes, motors and car parts.
Reflecting soft domestic demand, imports fell 9.5% in the year to January, versus the median estimate for a 6.0% drop, swinging a trade balance to a deficit of 323.9 billion yen ($3.05 billion).
Analysts expect Japan's economy to contract in the current quarter, as service consumption is hit hard by renewed state of emergency curbs issued last month and set to last until March.
Separate data by the Cabinet Office showed core machinery orders, considered an indicator of capital spending for the next six to nine months, rose 5.2% in December from the previous month, versus a 6.2% drop expected.
The government described machinery orders as picking up, marking an upgrade for the third straight month from its previous assessment that they were showing signs of a pick-up.
Raising worries about the outlook, however, manufacturers surveyed by the Cabinet Office expected core orders to fall 8.5% in January-March, after advancing 16.8% in the previous quarter.
Japanese manufacturers' morale turned positive for the first time since July 2019 in February, the Reuters Tankan survey showed.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sentiment among Japanese manufacturers turned positive in February for the first time since mid-2019, the Reuters Tankan poll found, lifted by improving overseas demand though caution about the ongoing fallout from the coronavirus persisted.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey, found non-manufacturers confidence remained gloomy as pandemic measures covering Tokyo and other cities hit consumers and some firms hard.
While the Reuters Tankan showed overall sentiment was expected to recover over the coming three months, respondents were on guard for further blows to demand, especially for the hard-hit consumer sector.
The sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 3 from minus 1 in the previous month, led by chemicals and manufactured food, the first time it has turned positive since July 2019. The index was seen recovering to 8 in May, according to the Feb. 2-12 survey.
Firms that were optimistic about the current business state said pointed to a stable market environment and exchange rate as evidence of a broader global economic recovery. 
""The car market in China is recovering and demand for electronic components is increasing,"" a manager at an electric machinery maker wrote in the survey. ""The car markets in Europe and the United States are good as well.""
But in the poll of 482 large- and mid-sized firms, in which 231 firms responded on condition of anonymity, managers also complained about low shipment volumes and cautious consumer behaviour.
""The spreading of the coronavirus is putting a brake on economic activity as a whole,"" said a manager at a service company.
A manager at a chemistry firm said a recovery in shipment volumes from the jolt the virus gave to the global economy was slow.
The non-manufacturers' index remained in negative territory in February, rising four points to minus 7 from minus 11 in the previous month, dragged down by the other services and wholesalers sectors.
The index was expected to be flat in May, partly due to a strongly positive outlook for the information/communications sector.
Japan's economy expanded more than expected in the fourth quarter, the government said on Monday, extending its recovery from its worst postwar recession thanks to a rebound in overseas demand that boosted exports and capital spending.
But the recovery slowed from the prior quarter's strong growth and the ongoing state of emergency curbs are casting a dark cloud over the outlook.
""Customers are cautious about capital spending as the spread of the coronavirus can't be expected to halt,"" another manager at a machinery maker wrote in the survey.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means pessimists outnumber optimists.

It was the first time the economy had shrunk since a marginal decline in 2002, but Israel in 2020 outperformed a 5.5% average contraction in OECD countries.
The economy, which grew 3.4% in 2019, had been expected to shrink 3.3% to 3.7% in 2020 based on government and central bank estimates because of COVID-19.
Growth is expected to rebound in 2021, with the Bank of Israel forecasting a 6.3% rise if Israel's rapid COVID-19 vaccination pace is maintained.
Despite a third lockdown, the economy grew an annualised 6.3% in the fourth quarter after a 41.5% jump in the third quarter. Analysts on average had projected a 0.5% decline.

In 2020, private spending declined 9.4%, while exports rose 0.6% despite the crisis and a stronger shekel. Imports slid 8.1%, investment in fixed assets dipped 1.5%, while government spending gained 2.9% last year.

Chancellor Angela Merkel and the premiers of Germany's states agreed last Wednesday to extend restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus until March 7. 
German exports rose in December as solid trade with China and the United States helped the economy as it struggles to grow under the lockdown restrictions.

While family-owned companies - particularly in Europe and the United States - looked to charitable giving and helping employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, most put sustainability on the back burner, the consulting firm's survey of 2,801 family business owners showed.
Without the investor pressure that listed companies face to conform to and set environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards, family businesses have implemented what PwC described as an ""increasingly out-of-date conception of how businesses should respond to society"".
""It is clear that family businesses globally have a strong commitment to a wider social purpose,"" Peter Englisch, global family business leader at PwC, said in a statement.
Most of them had made retaining staff a priority during the pandemic, for example, and some 80% engaged in proactive social responsibility in some form, often via philanthropy.
But more than three-quarters of the U.S.-based family businesses and 60% of those in Britain placed greater emphasis on direct societal contributions, mainly through charity, over a strategic approach to ESG matters.
Asian family businesses far outperformed their American and European peers in the self-reported incorporation of sustainability into their fundamental approach to business, the survey found.

Before the pandemic struck, President Emmanuel Macron had been chasing a goal of 7% unemployment by the end of his five-year term in 2022. He inherited a jobless rate of 9.5% in May 2017 and set about liberalising the labour market.

The French jobless rate stood above 10% throughout the 2012-2017 term of Macron's socialist predecessor, Francois Hollande.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy expanded more than expected in the fourth quarter, extending the recovery from its worst postwar recession thanks to a rebound in overseas demand that boosted exports and capital spending.
But the recovery slowed from the third quarter's brisk pace and new state of emergency curbs cloud the outlook, underscoring the challenge policymakers face in preventing the spread of COVID-19 without choking off a fragile recovery, especially in the battered consumer sector.
""Conditions are such that Japan will not be able to avoid negative growth in the first quarter,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research.
""There is a high possibility that there will be a repeating cycle of coronavirus infections spreading and being contained this year, which means that consumption is not likely to recover at the expected pace.""
The world's third-largest economy grew an annualised 12.7% in October-December, government data showed on Monday, exceeding a median market forecast of 9.5%.
It was slower than the revised 22.7% surge the previous quarter, when the economy got a lift from pent-up demand after a previous state of emergency was lifted in May.
For the full coronavirus-stricken year, Japan's economy contracted 4.8%, the first annual fall since 2009.
But Japan's October-December performance was stronger than U.S. growth of 4% and a 2.8% slump in the euro zone. With two straight quarters of solid growth, Japan's economy likely recouped 90% of pandemic-induced losses, analysts say.
""Japan's recovery proceeded at a much faster pace than initially expected,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""There's still some distance toward a full normalisation, but economic activity is recovering toward pre-pandemic levels.""
Japanese shares surged to close at over 30-year highs on rising expectations for a rebound in corporate earnings and economic growth.
OUTLOOK MURKY
Japan's stronger-than-expected GDP data comes amid signs the pandemic's hit to other Asian economies toward the end of last year was not as severe as first feared.
Figures released on Monday showed that GDP in Singapore and Thailand shrank less than expected in the fourth quarter. [nL4N2KI1FR].
A global rebound in manufacturing gave Japan's exports and capital expenditure a much-needed boost on strong shipments to a rapidly recovering Chinese economy.
External demand, or exports minus imports, added 1.0% point to fourth-quarter GDP growth thanks to a 11.1% surge in exports buoyed by shipments of electronic parts and autos to China.
Capital expenditure also grew 4.5%, marking the first increase in three quarters, as companies proceeded with spending that had been put off last year due to the pandemic.
Private consumption, which makes up more than half of the economy, rose 2.2%, slowing from the 5.1% increase the previous quarter but exceeding market forecasts for a 1.8% gain.
The outlook, however, remains highly uncertain as Japan lags Western countries in rolling out vaccines.
A resurgence in infections forced the government to terminate a controversial travel discount campaign that had supported service spending in October and November.
Analysts expect the economy to contract in the current quarter, as retailers take a hit from renewed state of emergency curbs rolled out in January and set to last until early March.
""If state of emergency measures are lifted in March, Japan's economy will probably rebound in April-June,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.
""But we can't count on a big expansion as it's likely to take time for vaccine shots to reach the wider population.""
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said the economy in the current quarter would unlikely suffer a contraction as large as its worst postwar slump earlier last year. 

""I don't expect the economy will shrink as much as we saw last spring but there are people who are in a severe situation, so we want to support businesses, jobs and people's livelihoods.""

The survey of nearly 300 firms, by consultants South West Manufacturing Advisory Service (SWMAS) and the Manufacturing Growth Programme, a government and European Union-funded initiative providing support to small firms, adds to the picture of disruption from new customs checks that came into force on Jan. 1 for goods trade with the EU.
""Price hikes in the supply chain have been immediate, and we are hearing tales of lead times being extended on raw materials,"" said Nick Golding, managing director of SWMAS.
Some 65% of manufacturers reported higher costs, and 54% said they had greater difficulties exporting goods to the EU.
Around a fifth of manufacturers thought they might gain from customers bringing work back to Britain from the EU.
Britain's government has said many of the difficulties are ""teething troubles"" and last week said it would make 20 million pounds ($27.7 million) available to help small firms get used to the new rules. Further restrictions are due to take effect later this year.
Earlier this month the Bank of England forecast that Brexit-related trade disruption would reduce economic output by 1% during the current quarter - equivalent to about 5 billion pounds - and it expects trade to fall by 10% in the long term.

Brexit supporters say Britain will gain long-term advantages by setting its own trade rules with countries outside Europe, as well as from greater control over domestic regulation.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's economy contracted less than initially estimated in the fourth quarter, putting the country on a path to a gradual recovery in 2021 after it marked its worst ever recession last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) fell 2.4% year-on-year in the quarter, the ministry of trade and industry said on Monday, versus the 3.8% drop seen in the government's advance estimate. Analysts had expected a contraction of 3.5%, according to a Reuters poll.
""The Singapore economy is projected to see a gradual recovery in 2021, with GDP not expected to return to pre-COVID levels until the second half of the year,"" said Gabriel Lim, the ministry's permanent secretary. 
The government expects GDP to grow 4% to 6% this year. The economy shrank 5.4% in 2020, marking its worst ever recession, compared with the advance estimate of 5.8%.
The government said outward-oriented sectors are likely to benefit from a pickup in global economic activity, but activity levels in sectors related to tourism and aviation are projected to remain below pre-pandemic levels even by the end of 2021. 
""The outlook ahead stays uneven, although we are optimistic overall,"" said Jeff Ng, senior treasury strategist at HL Bank. ""Barring another round of downside risks materialising, we see some possibilities of Singapore even outperforming our 2021 GDP forecast of 6.3%.""
Singapore, a travel and transport hub, has brought its COVID-19 situation under control with few new local cases and it has begun its vaccination programme. However, the pace of border re-opening has slowed due to the global surge in cases and the emergence of more contagious strains of the virus.
""For the broader economy and macro economy level, I think a large part of our recovery is still going to be somewhat linked to what's going on in the rest of the world rather than domestically,"" Lim said, citing the city-state's open and trade-reliant economy. 
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy expanded by 3.8% in the fourth quarter. 
The data comes a day ahead of the city-state's budget announcement. Economists expect an expansionary but trimmed down budget to support businesses still struggling from the impact of the coronavirus.
The central bank left monetary policy unchanged at its last meeting in October and said its accommodative stance would remain appropriate for some time. 

Edward Robinson, Deputy Managing Director, Monetary Authority of Singapore, told a media briefing current policy stance was unchanged.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell in early February amid growing pessimism about the economy among households with annual incomes below $75,000, even as the government is poised to deliver another round of COVID-19 relief money.
The ebb in sentiment reported by the University of Michigan on Friday was also despite a decline in new coronavirus cases and an improvement in the distribution of vaccines. It underscored the so-called K-shaped recovery, where better-paid workers are doing well while lower-paid workers are losing out.
The government provided nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus in late December, which included direct cash payments to mostly lower-income households and an extension of a weekly unemployment supplement. The U.S. Congress is working on President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion recovery plan, which would see more stimulus checks sent to poor families. 
""The decline in confidence is a bit of a surprise since it was driven by the outlook,"" said John Ryding, chief economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""It appears ... (to) be another page in the tale of two economies or K-shaped recovery theme.""  
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index slipped to a reading of 76.2 in the first half of this month, attributed entirely to households with incomes below $75,000. That was down from a final reading of 79 in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index little changed at 80.8.
The survey's measure of current economic conditions dipped to a reading of 86.2 this month from 86.7 in January. Its gauge of consumer expectations dropped to 69.8 from 74.0 in January.
Among lower-income households, only 23% reported improved finances, the lowest since 2014. That compared to 54% among higher-income households. Just 17% of lower-income families reported income gains this month, compared with 44% of upper-income households.
About 53% of consumers expected the economy will continue to perform poorly in the year ahead, up from 51% in January.
Stocks on Wall Street were little changed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
STRONGER GROWTH
Economists expect the pessimism to abate in the coming months, given the encouraging developments on the virus, which together with the planned additional fiscal stimulus are seen allowing more parts of the economy to reopen by the summer.
""We expect consumers will become more upbeat as the next fiscal package, which distributes much of its benefits to lower-income households, comes online, and as vaccine dispersion increases,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
""Improved sentiment should support the strong pickup in consumer spending we expect around mid-year."" 
Indeed, a separate survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on Friday showed forecasters expected stronger economic growth over the next three years than they did when they were polled last quarter. 
They, however, anticipated slower job growth. The findings were similar to a Reuters survey. 
The University of Michigan survey also showed consumers this month appeared to anticipate higher inflation in the near-term. The survey's one-year inflation expectation rose to 3.3%, the highest since July 2014, from 3.0% in January. 
That broadly fits in with inflation expectations on Wall Street, with the massive fiscal stimulus and pent-up demand for services as COVID-19 cases subside seen unleashing faster economic growth. 
Higher inflation is also expected by the spring as price declines early in the coronavirus crisis wash out of the calculations, but there is no consensus on whether it would stick beyond the so-called base effects.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday while he expected base effects and pent-up demand when the economy fully reopens to boost inflation, that was likely to be transitory, citing three decades of lower and stable prices.
The survey's five-to-10-year inflation outlook was unchanged at 2.7%. The Fed, which has a 2% inflation target, focuses on long-term inflation expectations.

""We think Fed officials will welcome that steady rise as evidence that inflation expectations are returning to a level consistent with their 2% average inflation target,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's coronavirus-ravaged economy suffered its biggest crash in output in more than 300 years in 2020 when it slumped by 9.9%, but it avoided heading back towards recession at the end of the year and looks on course for a recovery in 2021.
Official figures showed gross domestic product (GDP) grew 1.0% from October through December, the top of a range of economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll.
This makes it likely that Britain will escape two straight quarters of contraction - the standard definition of recession in Europe - even though the economy is set to shrink in early 2021 due to the effects of a third COVID lockdown.
""As and when restrictions are eased, we continue to expect a vigorous rebound in the economy,"" said Dean Turner, an economist at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Britain's economy grew 1.2% in December alone, after a 2.3% fall in output in November when there was a partial lockdown, pointing to greater resilience to COVID restrictions than at the start of the pandemic.
That left output 6.3% lower than in February before the start of the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics said.
However, the Bank of England forecasts the economy will shrink by 4% in the first three months of 2021 because of the new lockdown and Brexit disruption.
It thinks it will take until early 2022 before GDP regains its pre-COVID size, assuming vaccination continues at the current rapid pace, which outstrips the rest of Europe's. Many economists think recovery will take longer. 
""Today's figures show that the economy has experienced a serious shock as a result of the pandemic, which has been felt by countries around the world,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
Sunak, facing the heaviest borrowing since World War Two, said he would continue to focus on protecting jobs when he sets out a new annual budget on March 3.
Unemployment has risen much less than feared at the start of the crisis, largely due to subsidies to keep people in work, though sectors such as hospitality and high-street retail remain hard hit.
HARDER HIT THAN MOST 
Last year's fall in output was the biggest since modern official records began after World War Two. Longer-running historical data hosted by the Bank of England suggest it was the biggest drop since 1709, when Britain suffered a ""Great Frost"".
Britain has reported Europe's highest death toll from COVID-19 and is among the world's highest in terms of deaths per head. 
The GDP fall is steeper than almost any other big economy's, though Spain - also hard-hit by the virus - suffered an 11% decline.
Some of the damage reflects how Britain's economy relies more on face-to-face consumer services than other countries, as well as disruption to schooling and routine healthcare, which few other countries factored in to GDP.
Sunak, in an interview with Sky News, said Britain's economic performance could be seen as being marginally above that of some of its peers last year.
GDP is almost always compared on a ""real"" or inflation-adjusted basis, which shows Britain was the worst performer in the Group of Seven large advanced economies. But Sunak said Britain did better on a ""nominal"" basis, which ignores inflation.
Taking this approach, Britain's economy is closer to its pre-crisis size than Germany, France or Italy's, according to figures provided by the ONS, which said it ""may be useful"" to look at nominal as well as real measures of GDP.
But most international differences on inflation adjustment centre on government spending, and looking at household spending alone, Britain remains a laggard. Household spending in the fourth quarter was 8.4% below pre-crisis levels, compared with a 2.6% shortfall in the United States and 6.8% in France.

""The UK's underperformance can't simply be attributed to the different way the ONS measures government expenditure to most other countries,"" said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell slightly last week as the labor market continued to tread water, but a drop in new COVID-19 cases has raised cautious optimism that momentum could pick up by the spring.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also highlighted labor market scarring, with over 20 million people collecting unemployment checks in late January. 
""Claims remain stuck at painfully high levels,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""But we are seeing hopeful signs that claims will begin meaningful declines in the next month or two.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 793,000 for the week ended Feb. 6. Data for the prior week was revised to show 33,000 more claims received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 757,000 applications for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims decreased 36,534 to 813,145 last week. There were notable jumps in filings in California and Ohio. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 1.148 million people filed claims last week.
Claims are stuck in the upper end of their 711,000-842,000 band between October and November. They remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession, though they are below the record 6.867 million reported last March when the pandemic hit the United States.
The labor market recovery has stalled in recent months as the country battled a resurgence in coronavirus infections, which ravaged restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses. The government reported last Friday that the economy created only 49,000 jobs in January after losing 227,000 in December.
Labor market woes strengthen the case for President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion recovery package, which is under consideration in the U.S. Congress. The government provided nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief in late December. Republican lawmakers are opposing the planned massive fiscal stimulus due to concerns about the swelling national debt.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower.
LONG BOUTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT
But there are glimmers of hope on the horizon. Reported new coronavirus cases in the United States dropped 25% last week, the biggest fall since the pandemic hit the nation. Infections have now fallen for four consecutive weeks, according to a Reuters analysis of state and county reports.
Should the trend continue and the distribution of vaccines broaden out, that, together with additional stimulus, could allow more businesses to reopen. There are signs that businesses are testing the waters. Temporary help jobs, a segment normally considered a harbinger of future hiring, jumped in January.
""Temporary and contract jobs are running slightly ahead of where they were the same time a year ago,"" said Richard Wahlquist, chief executive officer at the American Staffing Association.
For now, the slack in the labor market remains immense. The claims report showed that people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 145,000 to 4.545 million in the week ended Jan. 30. But the decline in the so-called continuing claims was mostly due to people exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states.
At least 4.778 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended Jan. 23, up 1.2 million from the prior period. These benefits, which are funded by the government, will expire in mid-March if Congress does not pass the Biden administration's relief package. 
Another 1.653 million were on a state program for those who have exhausted their initial six months of aid. That meant 6.4 million people have been unemployed for more than six months.
""This is by the far the highest we have seen at any point during this crisis,"" said AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""Long-term joblessness is happening right now and is a very real challenge for the recovery."" 
About 20.435 million people were receiving benefits under all programs during that period, an increase of 2.6 million from mid-January. The surge partly reflected the extension of government-funded benefits in late December, and underscored the widespread nature of unemployment.
""The unemployed are having a difficult time reentering the labor force, and this highlights the need for additional federal aid,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. 

The economy has recovered 12.3 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated employment would not return to its pre-pandemic level before 2024.

Investing.com --The number of people filing initial claims for unemployment benefits again came in higher than expected, extending a sequence of only minimal declines as the pandemic continues to generate high numbers of layoffs.
Initial jobless claims totaled 793,000 last week, some 36,000 higher than the 757,000 expected ahead of time by economists. In absolute terms, that was still a decline from the previous week's number, which was revised higher to 812,000 from an initial estimate of 779,000.
The rate of initial claims hit its slowest since the pandemic back in early December and has run fairly constantly at around 800,000 a week since then. 
The number of people making continuing claims also came in above expectations at 4.545 million, but likewise indicated a drop from an upwardly revised number for the previous week.  
Continuing claims are calculated with a one-week lag to initial ones, and thus date to January 23rd. As of that date, there were a total of 20.44 million claiming jobless benefits of various sorts. That represented a rise of over 2.5 million from the previous week, owing to big increases in the use of two special schemes related to the pandemic. These have recently regained importance after Congress extended eligibility for the programs in the dying days of the Trump administration. 
The numbers underline the slow nature of progress as the U.S. starts to emerge from the worst surge yet in Covid-19 cases. The economy has lost around 10 million jobs on a net basis since the pandemic exploded a year ago. January's labor market report showed a net gain of fewer than 50,000 jobs through the middle of the month, although private payrolls processor ADP has indicated that private-sector hiring was substantially stronger.
In a keynote speech on Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had stressed the need for fiscal policy to give ""continued support"" to both households and businesses, while promising that the Fed's monetary policy would remain ""patiently accommodative."" 
“Published unemployment rates during Covid have dramatically understated the deterioration in the labor market,” Powell said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Just under half of British companies that export goods have run into difficulties caused by the Brexit shift in trade terms with the European Union since the start of the year, a British Chambers of Commerce survey showed on Thursday.
Some 49% of goods exporters said adapting to the changes had caused problems, while one in five services exporters reported issues, the BCC said.
The findings are in line with other surveys that show British companies struggled with supply chain issues last month, with the shift in trading arrangements exacerbating problems resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Trading businesses – and the UK's chances at a strong economic recovery – are being hit hard by changes at the border,"" said BCC director general Adam Marshall.
""For some firms these concerns are existential, and go well beyond mere 'teething problems',"" added Marshall, repeating the phrase used by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to describe the recent trade problems.
Marshall warned that the situation could worsen if Britain sticks to its plan to introduce checks on live animals and animal products from the EU in April, and for full customs checks from July.
""These timescales need to change – and the support available for businesses who are battling to adapt to new trading conditions significantly increased,"" Marshall said.
Last week an HSBC UK survey showed 40% of British importers and exporters said the shift to a new trading arrangement with the EU had made trade more cumbersome.
British manufacturers suffered the biggest deterioration in their supply chain out of almost 30 countries covered by IHS Markit's business surveys in January. 
Trade analysts think some of the extra cost and bureaucracy will be permanent, and the Bank of England has forecast they will lower trade by 10% in the long run compared with a frictionless arrangement. 

Proponents of Brexit say Britain will ultimately benefit by striking its own trade deals and forming its own regulations outside the EU.

House price growth slowed more than expected by economists polled by Reuters and prices in London fell for the first time since July, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said.
A measure of properties hitting the market was the second-weakest on record, excluding a slump during the first lockdown last year when the sector was closed along with much of the ret of the economy.
Near-term sales expectations were close to a pre-pandemic record low. New buyer enquires and agreed sales also fell.
Britain's housing market unexpectedly took off in the late spring of 2020 as people who had been stuck in their houses during the first lockdown sought bigger homes. A tax break for buyers also spurred demand.
The stamp duty tax exemption is due to expire at the end of next month although media have said finance minister Rishi Sunak might extend it in his March 3 budget statement.
Other gauges of the housing market have also suggested recently that last year's boom has run its course, including the first month-on-month falls since mid-2020 in house prices as measured by mortgage lenders Nationwide and Halifax. 
A Reuters poll of analysts published last week showed prices were expected to flat-line this year before rising by 2.7% in 2022.
RICS Chief Economist Simon Rubinsohn said despite attempts to keep the housing market open in the latest lockdown that began in January, there had been an impact on activity.
""The appeal of properties with more room and outside space is, meanwhile, a theme that continues to be strongly evident in the responses to the survey,"" he said.

In the rental market, concerns about a slow flow of properties coming on to the market - reflecting regulatory and tax changes - were pushing rents higher. The exception, again, was London where private rents were viewed as remaining under pressure over the coming months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose moderately in January as higher gasoline prices were blunted by a slump in airline fares amid a relentless pandemic, tempering expectations for a sustained acceleration in inflation this year. 
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday also showed underlying consumer prices were unchanged for a second straight month. Inflation is under the spotlight, with economic growth expected to be juiced by fiscal stimulus and coronavirus vaccines becoming accessible to large swaths of the population, unleashing pent-up demand for services. 
Higher inflation is anticipated by the spring as price declines early in the coronavirus crisis wash out of the calculations, but there is no consensus among economists on whether it would stick beyond the so-called base effects.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday while he expected base effects and pent-up demand when the economy fully reopens to boost inflation, that was likely to be transitory, citing three decades of lower and stable prices.
""As the economy reopens we may see a burst of spending ... there could be some upward pressure on prices there, again though, my expectations would be that would be neither large nor sustained,"" Powell said at an Economic Club of New York event. 
The consumer price index rose 0.3% last month after gaining 0.2% in December. In the 12 months through January the CPI increased 1.4% after climbing 1.3% in December. Last month's rise in the CPI was in line with economists' expectations.
Gasoline prices jumped 7.4% in January, accounting for most of the increase in the CPI, after rising 5.2% in December. Food prices gained 0.1%, but the cost of food consumed at home fell 0.1%. Prices for food consumed away from home climbed 0.3%.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI was unchanged for a second consecutive month. The so-called core CPI was restrained by a 3.2% plunge in the cost of airline tickets. That offset increases in the prices of health care, motor vehicle insurance and tobacco. The core CPI rose 1.4% on a year-on-year basis, slowing from December's 1.6% advance. 
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target, a flexible average. The U.S. central bank has signaled it would tolerate higher prices after inflation persistently undershot its target. The core PCE price index is at 1.5%.
Stocks on Wall Street were slightly higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
EYES ON SERVICES
The U.S. government provided nearly $900 billion in pandemic relief in late December. President Joe Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion recovery package, which is winding its way through Congress. In addition to the fiscal stimulus, the Fed has slashed interest rates to near zero and is pumping money into the economy through bond purchases.
The Fed is expected to maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy stance until mid-2023. Some economists believe the combination of generous fiscal stimulus and very accommodative monetary policy will stoke inflation this year. The pandemic has also caused bottlenecks in the supply chain, leading to a surge in prices of raw materials and other inputs at factories. 
A survey this month showed a measure of prices paid by manufacturers jumped to its highest level in nearly 10 years in January. Consumers are also anticipating higher inflation.
""Inflation is on its way thanks to fiscal and monetary stimulus and pent-up consumer demand that should intensify as the economy reopens,"" said Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
But other economists argue that labor market slack, characterized by at least 17.8 million people on unemployment benefits, would make it harder for inflation to become entrenched. They also believe the services sector, which has been fractured by the pandemic, will determine the path of inflation. Spending on services, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, is 7.5% below the pre-pandemic level.
""Excess capacity in wide swathes of the economy, and low wage pressures from elevated unemployment will all keep inflation low over the next couple of years, especially for services, which make up more than one-half of consumer spending,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Inflation will be stronger in a few areas with elevated demand, such as building materials and food purchased for home use.""
In January, apparel prices increased 2.2%, rising for a third straight month. The cost of healthcare rose 0.4%, driven by a jump in prices for doctor visits. Consumers, however, paid less for prescription medication. Used cars and trucks, as well as new motor vehicles were cheaper. 
Prices for household furnishings, communication and alcohol fell. Rents remained moderate. 

Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, nudged up 0.1%, matching the rise in December. Many tenants have entered into forbearance agreements with landlords.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government posted a budget deficit of $163 billion in January, a record high for the month and a $130 billion jump from the deficit in the same month last year, as a new round of direct payments to individuals were distributed, the Treasury said on Wednesday.
Receipts for January rose 3% from the year-earlier period to $385 billion, while outlays grew 35% to $547 billion. Both receipts and outlays were record highs for January.
For the first four months of the 2021 fiscal year, the deficit rose 89% to $736 billion, with receipts rising 1% to $1.19 trillion and outlays increasing 23% to $1.92 trillion. The deficit, receipts and outlays were all year-to-date record highs.
The January deficit would have been considerably larger if not for some $44 billion in benefits being paid in December because the New Year's Day holiday came at the start of a weekend.
Receipts last month were helped by an 18% increase in individual non-withheld tax payments, and a 49% increase in corporate tax payments, the latter of which a Treasury official said were increased by the repatriation of overseas earnings.
The official said January outlays were increased by about $139 billion in direct payments by the Treasury to individuals, mostly through $600 checks sent out as part of a year-end COVID-19 stimulus bill. Replenished unemployment benefits and rental assistance also boosted U.S. outlays, the official said.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday business applications surged 42.6% to a seasonally adjusted 492,133 last month. The data is derived from business applications for tax identifications. 
There were a seasonally adjusted 54,635 applications from corporations. Applications for businesses with planned wages totaled 58,023. Overall, applications increased in all four regions last month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has decimated businesses in the services sector, especially restaurants and bars, leaving millions unemployed. 

The economy has recovered 12.3 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April, when the pandemic started in the United States. At least 17.8 million Americans are on unemployment benefits.

The Commerce Department said wholesale inventories rose 0.3% in December instead of gaining 0.1% as reported last month. Stock at wholesalers was unchanged in November. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product shot up 0.7% in December.
Inventories fell 1.6% in December from a year earlier. 
The economy grew at a 4.0% annualized rate in the fourth quarter after a historic 33.4% growth pace in the third quarter. Inventories contributed to GDP growth for two straight quarters. 
Businesses are replenishing inventories after they were drawn down early in the pandemic. That has helped to underpin manufacturing, offsetting slowing consumer spending. 

Wholesale stocks of motor vehicles and parts tumbled 3.3%. Sales at wholesalers surged 1.2% in December after rising 0.3% in November. At December's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.29 months to clear shelves, down from 1.31 in November.

The Labor Department said on Wednesday its consumer price index increased 0.3% last month after climbing a revised 0.2% in December. In the 12 months through January the CPI rose 1.4% after gaining a revised 1.3% December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising 0.3% and increasing 1.5% year-on-year.

43,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A key measure of prices paid by U.S. consumers was unchanged in January for a second straight month, underscoring the pandemic’s lingering restraint on inflation.
The core consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, increased 1.4% from the prior year, a Labor Department report showed Wednesday. The broader CPI once again got a boost from higher gasoline prices, advancing 0.3% from the prior month and 1.4% from a year earlier.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists for month-over-month core CPI was for a 0.2% gain. The overall measure was projected to rise 0.3%.
The CPI data are part of an intensifying debate in financial markets over the course of inflation. Despite the tame January figure, price pressures are set to firm in the months ahead. That’s partly a reflection of expectations that Congress will pass another large aid package and an anticipated pickup in demand as more are vaccinated against the coronavirus.
At the same time, a jobless rate that indicates elevated slack in the labor market is seen limiting wage growth, which makes up the biggest share of companies’ total costs.
The report showed declining prices for used and new vehicles and transportation services. At the same time, Americans are paying higher prices for fuel, apparel and medical care services.
Lawmakers continue to debate the size of the next pandemic relief package. President Joe Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion plan, which some economists have warned could spur an outbreak of inflation. Other economists say there’s plenty of room for fiscal stimulus without fear of a more durable increase in price pressures.
Looking ahead, inflation metrics are expected to be distorted by so-called base effects in the coming months. Because of the pandemic and the recession it spurred, the CPI fell in March, April and May. When the annual figures are calculated this year, inflation will appear to be quickly accelerating when compared with the first three months of the health crisis.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said policy makers will ensure monetary policy continues to be a strong support to the economy “until the recovery is complete.” That, paired with the central bank’s willingness to let inflation run above its 2% objective for a period, means the Fed will likely leave interest rates near zero for some time.
How fast the labor market recovers will also play a role. Persistently high unemployment would limit workers’ ability to demand higher wages, limiting the degree to which inflation heats up. Powell is scheduled to speak Wednesday afternoon on the economic outlook.

Investing.com – China’s factory gate prices rose in annual terms, and at the fastest rate since May 2019, in January for the first time in a year.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released earlier in the day showed that January’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew 1% month-on-month, against the 1% in forecast prepared by Investing.com and December’s 0.7% growth. However, the CPI fell 0.3% year-on-year, against the predicted 0.1% drop and December's 0.2% growth.
The data also showed that January's Producer Price Index (PPI) grew 0.3% year-on-year, smaller than the forecast 0.4% growth but improving on December’s 0.4% drop.
Although there were still signs of a gathering growth momentum in the world’s second largest economy, an outbreak of COVID-19 cases in December saw the re-imposition of lockdowns in the affected areas and worries about temporary disruptions to production.
The outbreak, the country's worst since March 2020, saw measures such as home quarantines and travel curbs imposed to curb the spread of the virus. The disappointing data also reflected the impact of the measures’ impact on both production and services, including logistics and transportation, ahead of the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays.
Other key datasets for January, including those for trade, industrial output and retail sales, will be combined with figures for February and released in March. Investors will therefore have to wait for more datapoints with which to gauge economic health."

The producer price index (PPI) rose 0.3% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement, the fastest pace of increase since May 2019 but slightly lagging a 0.4% gain tipped by a Reuters poll of analysts. PPI declined 0.4% in December.
Consumer prices, however, unexpectedly slipped into deflation in January, the first time upstream prices have risen faster than downstream costs in more than two years.
China's return to factory-gate inflation was driven by increases in upstream raw materials, said Betty Wang, an analyst at ANZ. Over the next months PPI ""may extend the uptrend and rise positively,"" she said.
The country's factories staged a stunning export-driven recovery in 2020 thanks to hot global demand for home electronics and anti-epidemic goods, and as other manufacturing economies struggled with COVID-19 lockdowns.
The economy is expected to grow 8.4% this year, following a 2.3% rise in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic that forced the country to shut down for much of the March quarter last year.
But a resurgence of the virus last month, though mostly isolated to the northeastern provinces, raised concerns about temporary disruptions to production.
Some regional authorities rolled out tough measures including home quarantines and travel curbs to contain what was the country's worst outbreak since March 2020. Numbers of new domestically transmitted cases fell sharply by early February.
China's factory activity grew at the slowest pace in five months in January, official data showed last week, reflecting the outbreak's impact on production and transportation as the country sought to contain COVID-19 ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays.
China does not release several key datasets such as trade, industrial output and retail sales for January and instead reports combined January-February numbers in March, leaving markets with fewer data points to assess the health of the economy.
The consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.3% in January from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said in a separate statement, compared with no change tipped by the Reuters poll and a 0.2% rise in December.
The slip into deflation was mainly caused by high base effects a year earlier and will likely reverse sharply in February due to Lunar New Year demand, said analysts from Capital Economics in a note. CPI is likely to increase by around 2% by the end of the second quarter, they said.

""That shouldn't alarm the PBOC but will provide reassurance that they are right to focus on controlling credit risks. As such, we think the PBOC will tighten policy this year,"" they said, referring to the People's Bank of China.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. layoffs eased in December and job openings increased modestly, suggesting the decline in employment that month was largely due to companies cutting back on hiring amid uncertainty caused by a raging COVID-19 pandemic.
Though the Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, offered cautious optimism that job growth could regain speed as coronavirus vaccines become accessible to large swaths of the population, unemployment remains pervasive.
The economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months following renewed outbreaks of the virus. 
""The decline in employment in December was more a product of reduced hiring than a pick-up in layoffs,"" said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""Employers were hesitant about adding new workers. This trend is easier to reverse than the destruction of employer-employee relationships that happens when workers are laid off.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose 74,000 to 6.65 million on the last day of December from 6.572 million. There were an additional 296,000 job openings in the professional and business services industry. But vacancies decreased for state and local government, excluding education. 
There also were fewer unfilled jobs in the arts, entertainment and recreation industries as well as at factories producing goods that are not intended to last longer than three years, such as clothing. 
The job openings rate ticked up to 4.5% from 4.4% in November. Layoffs decreased by 243,000 to 1.81 million, lowering the layoffs rate to 1.3% from 1.4% in November. Layoffs declined in the federal government, transportation, warehousing and utilities industries as well as the healthcare and social assistance sector.
But 50,000 people were laid off in the arts, entertainment, and recreation industry. 
Hiring dropped by 396,000 to 5.54 million. It was led by a decrease of 221,000 in the accommodation and food services industry. Hiring in the transportation, warehousing, and utilities sector fell by 133,000 and decreased by 82,000 in the arts, entertainment and recreation industry.
But retailers hired 94,000 workers. The hiring rate declined to 3.9% from 4.2% in November. 
U.S. financial markets were unmoved by the data.
WORKER SHORTAGE
The government reported on Friday that the economy created only 49,000 jobs in January after shedding 227,000 jobs in December. Employment is 9.9 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
The labor market has largely stalled amid a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, which now appears to be ebbing. In December, there were 16 unemployed people for every 10 job openings.
""The January jobs report was a stark reminder that near-term risks remain tilted to the downside amid a third COVID-19 wave,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""But the labor market outlook is slowly brightening. We foresee increased vaccinations, elevated savings and robust business activity contributing to a 6.6 million jobs rebound in 2021."" 
Many economists do not expect the labor market to return to its pre-pandemic peak until 2023. Amid the labor market slack, signs of a skills mismatch are emerging. 
A separate survey from the NFIB on Tuesday showed a third of small businesses reported in January that they had vacancies they could not fill, with 28% of those for skilled workers. 
The dearth of skilled workers was more acute in construction, with 56% of firms reporting few or no qualified applicants, according to the NFIB. Overall, among small businesses hiring or trying to hire, 90% also reported few or no qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill.
""The pandemic has undoubtedly made it more difficult for many workers to rejoin the workforce, while the expansion of unemployment benefits has likely also reduced the urgency to return to work,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The JOLTS report also showed the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs rose 106,000 to 3.29 million in December. That lifted the quits rate to 2.3% from 2.2% in November. The quits rate is normally viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. 

But the pandemic has forced millions of women to drop out of the labor force mostly because of problems related to child care, with many schools still only offering online learning.

Seasonally adjusted exports edged up 0.1% on the month after an increase of 2.3% in November, the Federal Statistics Office said on Tuesday. Imports fell 0.1% after an increase of 5.4% in the prior month.
The trade surplus expanded to 16.1 billion euros.
On the year, exports to China increased by 11.6%. Those to the United States rose by 8.4%, the Office said. Exports to the United Kingdom decreased by 3.3% in December and imports from the United Kingdom fell by 11.4 %.
Official data released on Monday showed Germany's industrial sector avoided a contraction in December despite coronavirus lockdowns at home and abroad as strong demand from China helped export-oriented manufacturers weather the COVID-19 pandemic.
The German government last month slashed its GDP growth forecast to 3% this year, a sharp revision from last autumn's estimate of 4.4%. This means the economy probably won't reach its pre-pandemic level before mid-2022.
Once a role model for fighting the pandemic, Germany has struggled with a second wave. Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders are due to review lockdown measures on Wednesday. Bavaria's premier said on Sunday it was too soon to lift restrictions.

Germany suffered its second-biggest economic plunge in post-war history last year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Spending by British consumers plunged in January at the fastest rate in seven months as the country went back into a tight COVID-19 lockdown, payment card firm Barclaycard said on Tuesday.
A 73% annual increase in online retail spending and record demand for takeaway food - which jumped by a third from a year ago - failed to compensate for the closure of many businesses.
Overall consumer spending shrank by 16.3% in year-on-year terms last month, Barclaycard said, the biggest drop since May when the country was starting to emerge from its first lockdown.
Spending in pubs and bars dropped nearly 94% and was down by more than 84% in restaurants, the survey showed. Travel agents also reported an 87% drop in spending during a month when many Britons would normally book summer holidays abroad.
By contrast spending at supermarkets soared by 17% as people prepared more food at home. 
The difference in spending patterns was reflected in a separate survey on Tuesday published by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body.
It said overall retail spending at major retail chains fell by 1.3% in January compared with the same month last year.
Over the three months to January, food sales were up nearly 8% while non-food sales were down 5.6%.
""The current lockdown has hit non-essential retailers harder than in November, with the new variant hampering consumer confidence and leading customers to hold back on spending – especially on clothing and footwear,"" Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive, said.
Barclaycard said a survey it commissioned showed only 40% of respondents felt secure in their jobs, down from 50% in January last year and the lowest proportion in over a year. 
The survey of 2,001 people was conducted between Jan. 22 and Jan. 25 by Longitude Research, while the card data covered Dec. 25 to Jan. 22. The BRC figures covered Jan. 3 to Jan. 30.

The Bank of England predicts Britain's economy will shrink by 4% in the first three months of 2021, largely due to the new lockdown. But it says pent-up savings among people stuck at home could fuel strong growth later this year when the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations allows restrictions to be lifted.

Exports jumped 36.8% from a year earlier to $34.27 billion in January, the highest monthly figure on record, the Ministry of Finance said on Monday, though it was helped by a low base with the week-long Lunar New Year holiday falling in January last year.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a rise of 15% for last month, compared with a 12% jump in December.
The ministry attributed the growth to demand for chips to help power the ""zero touch economy"" exceeding expectations, as millions of people are forced to work and study remotely on laptops, tablets and other technology.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), for which firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd are major suppliers, launched its next-generation iPhone 12 with faster 5G connectivity in September.
The ministry expected exports to steadily expand in the first quarter, saying vaccines will help the global economy recovery and that Taiwan, with its strong semiconductor industry, stood ready to benefit from the digital economy transformation.
Exports to China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, jumped an annual 57% to $14.85 billion, while exports to the United States grew 21.9% on year.
Taiwan's economy grew at its fastest pace in almost a decade in the fourth quarter after a steep contraction earlier last year, as strong global demand for its tech exports offset the hit from the pandemic.
January imports rose 29.9%, against economists' expectations for a 14.7% jump and a small gain of 0.9% in December.
Taiwan could see February exports rise more modestly in the range of 3% to 8% year on year, the ministry said, with the Lunar New Year holiday taking place in the middle of the month and cutting the number of work days.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's industrial sector avoided a contraction in December despite coronavirus lockdowns at home and abroad as strong demand from China helped export-oriented manufacturers in Europe's largest economy weather the COVID-19 pandemic.
Industrial output was flat on the month after an upwardly revised increase of 1.5% in the previous month, figures released by the Federal Statistics Office showed. A Reuters poll had forecast an increase of 0.3%.
This was the first stagnation following seven consecutive months of expansions.
The main drag came from construction where output fell by 3.2%. Looking at core manufacturing alone, output rose by 0.9% on the month.
The upwardly revised November figure helped overall industrial output in the fourth quarter to increase by 6.1% on the quarter.
""The German manufacturing sector has performed relatively well in recent months and that's mainly thanks to the well-running Chinese economy,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said.
""If production in China is humming, local production is also humming here,"" Gitzel said, adding that the German automobile industry with its premium cars was benefiting in particular from the good income situation in China.
DekaBank analyst Andreas Scheuerle also pointed to positive one-off factors in December related to the expiration of a temporary sales tax cut in January and British clients stocking up supplies in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit. 
OUTLOOK CLOUDED
In 2020 as a whole, production in the manufacturing sector tumbled by a calendar-adjusted 8.5% on the year, in further proof of the wider economic devastation caused by the pandemic.
The economy ministry said the outlook for the industrial sector remained subdued given further development of the pandemic and supply bottlenecks in the semiconductor industry. A drop in industrial orders and a decline in business morale were clouding the outlook further, it added.
Data last week showed that orders for German-made goods fell more than expected in December, ending a seven-month streak of positive data as restrictions to contain the coronavirus dragged down demand from other euro zone countries.
This followed a survey by the Ifo economic institute which showed that German business morale slumped to a six-month low in January as a second wave of COVID-19 halted a recovery in the economy.
The Ifo institute expects the German economy to stagnate in the first quarter while the Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) predicts a decline.

The German government last month slashed its GDP growth forecast to 3% this year, a sharp revision from last autumn's estimate of 4.4%. This means the economy probably won't reach its pre-pandemic level before mid-2022.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector sentiment index worsened for a third straight month in January, hitting its lowest since last May after a state of emergency was reimposed in Tokyo areas and some other prefectures, a Cabinet Office survey showed on Monday.
The survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff - called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends - showed their confidence about current economic conditions declined 3.1 points from December to 31.2.
It was the lowest level since the index hit 17.0 in May 2020, when the economy was reeling from the first wave of the pandemic and suffered its worst post-war slump.
Re-assessing the economy based on the survey's findings, the government said the economy was now weakening, downgrading its view for a third straight month. 
""The number of the coronavirus cases is on the rise. Conditions in the restaurant business, hotels and the tourism industry remain severe,"" a respondent at a financial company in northern Japan said in the survey.
The service sector sentiment outlook index, which indicates the level of confidence in future conditions, rose 3.8 points to 39.9 in January, up for a second straight month. 
The government aims to start COVID-19 vaccinations in mid-February, which should support the economy, some respondents said.

Still, analysts expect Japan's economy is expected to shrink again in the current quarter as renewed restrictions rolled out in January to curb the spread of the coronavirus would further hurt businesses and consumers.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economic growth likely moderated in October-December after rebounding from its worst postwar recession earlier in 2020, a Reuters poll showed, a sign households and companies have yet to recover from the coronavirus pandemic's huge hit.
A state of emergency rolled out in January has inflicted further pain on consumption, stoking fears of another economic slump that could push Japan back into deflation.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect the economy to have marked a quarter-on-quarter expansion of 2.3% in October-December, as improving exports made up for some of the weakness in consumption.
However, that would be much slower than a 5.3% jump in the third quarter, when the lifting of the previous state of emergency helped the economy emerge from its worst postwar slump in the April-June quarter.
""Consumption, especially service spending, will continue to decline while restrictions apply on economic activity,"" said Masato Koike, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""A slump in January-March consumption is unavoidable.""
Underscoring the heavy toll the pandemic took on the fragile economy, the central bank's estimates in January show the economy likely shrank 5.6% in the year ending March.
Japan's October-December gross domestic product (GDP) data, set for release at 8:50 a.m. on Feb. 15 (2350 GMT, Feb. 14), will likely highlight the challenges policymakers face in supporting the economy while preventing the spread of the virus.
On an annualised basis, the economy likely expanded 9.5% in October-December after a 22.9% gain in the previous quarter, the poll showed.

Even if the economy rebounds at the estimated pace in the final quarter of last year, it will remain at roughly 80% the level before the pandemic struck in March, analysts say.
Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of the economy, likely rose just 1.8% in October-December after a 5.1% increase in the previous quarter, the poll showed.
Capital spending was projected to have risen 2.6%, which would be the first increase since January-March last year.
External demand - or exports minus imports - likely contributed 1.0 percentage point to October-December GDP growth, according to the poll.

""Brisk overseas demand underpinned exports, while domestic demand got some boost from the government's stimulus measures,"" said Shinichiro Kobayashi, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting. ""But the outlook remains uncertain.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese bank deposits surged at a record annual pace in January, data showed on Monday, a sign companies and households were continuing to hoard cash to guard against the prolonged damage from the coronavirus pandemic.
Total deposits at commercial banks rose a record 9.8% in January from a year earlier to hit 806.2 trillion yen ($7.6 trillion), accelerating from a 9.3% gain in December, according to data released by the Bank of Japan.
Companies were piling up money from subsidies and loans they took up as a precaution against the health crisis, while households were holding back on spending due to the third wave of infections, a BOJ official told reporters.
The pace of growth in bank lending slowed, however, as big borrowers have already amassed precautionary loans to weather the hit from the pandemic.
Outstanding loans held by Japan's four main categories of banks, including ""shinkin"" or credit unions, rose 6.1% in January from a year earlier to hit a record 578.1 trillion yen, the data showed.
""Some small- and medium-sized firms are borrowing more but there doesn't appear to be a huge increase in requests for additional loans. Demand for spending on capital expenditure also remains weak,"" the official said.
The BOJ eased monetary policy twice last year to cushion the economic blow from COVID-19, including by creating a new lending facility aimed at channeling funds to cash-strapped firms via financial institutions.
While lending by cash-strapped firms has peaked, the government's decision to impose new state of emergency curbs from January to prevent the spread of the virus has clouded the outlook for the world's third-largest economy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment growth rebounded less than expected in January and job losses the prior month were deeper than initially thought, strengthening the argument for additional relief money from the government to aid the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Labor Department said on Friday nonfarm payrolls increased by 49,000 jobs last month. Data for December was revised to show 227,000 jobs lost instead of 140,000 as previously reported. 
December's drop was the first in eight months and came amid renewed restrictions on businesses like restaurants and bars to slow a resurgence in coronavirus infections.
The unemployment rate was at 6.3% in January. The jobless rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 50,000 jobs in January. 
The closely watched employment report underscored the need for additional relief money from the government, with millions of people experiencing long bouts of unemployment and others having permanently lost their jobs, and given up the search for work. Employment is more than 9 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated it would not return to its pre-pandemic level before 2024. 

President Joe Biden is pushing the U.S. Congress to pass a $1.9 trillion recovery plan, which has been met with resistance from mostly Republican lawmakers, now worried about the swelling national debt. The Senate worked late into the night on Thursday, with Biden's fellow Democrats aiming to override Republican opposition to the sweeping COVID-19 relief plan.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy added only 49,000 jobs in the month through mid-January, in line with early expectations but well short of the 174,000 reported by private payrolls processor ADP on Wednesday.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics also revised its figures for December to show a net loss of 227,000 jobs, rather than the 140,000 originally reported.
U.S. futures shrugged off the data, Dow Jones Futures losing only 10 points, or less than 0.1%, on the back of the news. 
The data come against the backdrop of still-widespread restrictions on businesses, especially in the services sector, as a result of public health measures to stop the spread of Covid-19. As so often already, the main job losses came in the retail and entertainment sectors. General merchandise stores shed 30,000 jobs, eletronics and appliance stores shed 29,000 and amusement parks and casinos shed 27,000. Employment services, a category that covers sectors such as temporary labor, took up the slack with a gain of 62,000.
The numbers come as something of a reality check at the end of a week when investor optimism has been strengthened by the progress of President Joe Biden's $1.9 stimulus package and the Congressional Budget Office's upward revision to its growth forecasts for this year. 
""Numbers like these should give you pause before taking too seriously the CBO potential GDP estimates,"" said David Beckworth, a senior research fellow with the Mercatus think-tank, via Twitter.
Greg Daco, an analyst with Oxford Economics, added that the numbers still mean that nearly 10 million jobs, on a net basis, have been lost since the start of the pandemic. 
The unemployment rate fell surprisingly to 6.4% from 6.7%, but analysts noted that even this flattered the underlying dynamic, since some 400,000 people had left the labor force during the month.

The 32,298 bankruptcies filed in January across both commercial and non-commercial cases was the lowest since Feb. 2006, Epiq reported.
The onset of the coronavirus pandemic sparked concern that waves of businesses and households would be driven into bankruptcy as health restrictions halted commerce and threw millions out of work.
While some categories of commercial bankruptcy did increase in recent months, the overall trend was in the other direction as federal pandemic relief programs kept companies and families afloat.
That continues, as does optimism about further fiscal aid from the Biden administration and now a possible end to the pandemic from vaccinations, said Chris Kruse, senior vice president of Epiq AACER.
""We continue to expect new filings to grow substantially in the second-half of 2021,"" Kruse said in press release. But ""we appear to be suspended in an air bubble at the moment...The optimism around a new political administration and potential new government relief for consumers has kept new filings historically low.""

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that factory orders increased 1.1% after surging 1.3% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders gaining 0.7% in December. Orders dropped 6.6% year-on-year.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, has been driven by strong demand for goods such as electronics and furniture as 23.7% of the labor force works from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
But spending on long-lasting manufactured goods declined for a second straight month in December, government data showed last week. The distribution of vaccines to fight the coronavirus is picking up, which is expected to lift spending on services by summer, and slow the manufacturing momentum.
The Institute for Supply Management reported this week that its index of national factory activity slipped in January.
Unfilled orders at factories fell 0.3% in December. Factory goods orders in December were boosted by strong demand for machinery, electrical equipment, appliances and components, as well as primary metals and fabricated metal products.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 0.7% in December instead of 0.6% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, advanced 0.7%. They were previously reported to have gained 0.5% in December.

Business spending on equipment increased robustly for a second straight quarter in the fourth quarter, contributing to the economy's 4% annualized growth rate during that period.

The Labor Department said on Thursday nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, dropped at a 4.8% annualized rate last quarter. That was the deepest pace of contraction since the second quarter of 1981. 
Data for the third quarter was revised higher to show productivity growing at a 5.1% pace instead of the previously reported 4.6% rate. Productivity rose 2.6% in 2020 compared to 1.7% in 2019. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast productivity declining at a 2.8% rate in the fourth quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, productivity increased at a 2.5% rate.
The coronavirus pandemic has decimated lower-wage industries, like leisure and hospitality, which economists say tend to be less productive.
Hours worked rose at a 10.7% rate last quarter. That followed a 37.1% pace in the third quarter.
Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - rebounded at a 6.8% rate after plunging at a 7.0% rate in the third quarter. Unit labor costs increased at a 5.2% rate from a year ago. They rose 4.3% in 2020 after gaining 1.9% in 2019.
Though labor costs have been distorted by the pandemic's disproportionate impact on lower-wage industries, the rebound supports expectations of higher inflation this year.

Hourly compensation increased at a 1.7% rate last quarter. That followed a 2.2% pace of decline in the July-September quarter. Compensation increased at a 7.8% rate compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. It grew 7.0% in 2020 after rising 3.6% in 2019.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to 779,000 last week, and also revised the previous week's figure down to 812,000 from an initial estimate of 847,000. 
The news follows an expectedly strong report on private-sector hiring on Wednesday by ADP. The payrolls processor said that the private sector hired a net 174,000 people in the month through mid-January.
The numbers are the latest to suggest the U.S. economy has started the year more solidly than expected by many, and come as President Joe Biden makes his first steps to pushing through a $1.9 trillion relief and recovery package of fiscal measures. The Congressional Budget Office earlier this week raised its forecast for economic growth this year, reflecting in part the expected impact of the measures. The CBO now expects U.S. gross domestic product to return to its pre-pandemic level by the middle of the year.
The Labor Department said the number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, fell to 4.592 million, a drop that was over 100,000 more than expected.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars in the European Union almost trebled to over 1 million vehicles last year, accounting for more than 10% of overall sales, data showed on Thursday.
The jump in sales shows electrified vehicles are becoming more mainstream products after years of being a niche market and it came at a time when overall EU car sales plunged nearly 24% to 9.9 million because of COVID-19 lockdowns.
The data released by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) showed sales of fully-electric and plug-in hybrids surged to 1.046 million vehicles from 387,808 in 2019.
Sales of self-charging hybrid cars climbed 59% to 1.182 million last year while petrol and diesel vehicle sales fell 37% and 32% respectively, the data showed. Petrol cars remained the biggest seller, however, accounting for 48% of all EU sales.
As well as having to meet stringent new EU carbon emissions targets, carmakers benefited from government subsidies for electric vehicles as part of pandemic recovery programmes, especially in France and Germany.

Sales of fully-electric vehicles more than doubled to 538,772 from 247,854 a year earlier.

64,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 04:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China watchers are in for a wild ride of economic data in the early months of 2021, giving a largely distorted picture of the recovery from coronavirus shutdowns a year ago.
The world’s second-largest economy was the first to go into lockdown to control virus outbreaks in 2020, leading to an historic contraction in gross domestic product in the first quarter of last year. That means year-on-year comparisons for the main indicators watched by most economists will show surging growth over the next few months.
“Buckle up, is the best advice,” said Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics Ltd. “Year-on-year is going to tell us very little about how things are evolving.”
Economists are lining up alternative comparisons to cope with an issue that will hit other major economies from the Spring. Some are relying on month-on-month data or using 2019 as a base year to avoid annual figures that will flatter the pace of China’s recovery.
Distortions will show up first in data recording industrial production, retail sales and investment. These are usually released monthly, but because of the Lunar New Year holidays -- which fall sometime in the first two months of the year -- China typically combines the release of January and February’s data and publishes them in March.
Because of factory shutdowns last February, even if industrial output in the first two months of this year remained constant from the level in December, the annual growth rate would be 25%, said Adam Wolfe, an economist at London-based Absolute Strategy Research.
The big one to watch will be first-quarter GDP, which is scheduled for release on April 16. It could hit a record 18.1% compared with a year ago, according to a Bloomberg survey economists. Wolfe says “a print above 20% can’t be ruled out, even with the current restrictions on travel for the new year holiday.”
China’s quick suppression of coronavirus means the base effect will fade in quarterly data after March, but the impact on annual growth will remain. If GDP remains at the same level for the whole of 2021 as in the last quarter of 2020, the economy would still register 6.6% average growth for the full year, according to the Institute of International Finance. That is the biggest base effect of any country, reflecting China’s ability to return to pre-pandemic growth levels by the end of last year.
“China had its Covid-19 in the first quarter of 2020, unlike most other countries where the contraction was only in the second quarter,” said IIF Chief Economist Robin Brooks. “That gives a steeply upward sloping profile for China’s GDP in the course of 2020, which means that the statistical carry over is very high.”
The data will pose a challenge to Chinese policy makers, who tend to watch carefully for signs of overheating in the economy. A premature withdrawal of policy support is among the biggest risks to China’s recovery this year, the World Bank has warned.
“Last year’s extremely depressed low base will inevitably make this year’s macro numbers look super strong, which does not necessarily mean that the economy has become overheated,” said Yan Wang, chief China strategist at Alpine Macro.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
While “the year-on-year jump would be a hurdle for market players and policy makers to judge the situation, I think the jump in 1Q data won’t influence the authorities’ policy stance.”
-- David Qu, China economist
Economists are likely to gauge the recovery by comparing with the previous month, the previous quarter, or by taking 2019 as a baseline and calculating average growth over the two years since, said Ding Shuang, chief economist for Greater China at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc in Hong Kong.
Monthly business surveys, like the Purchasing Manager’s Index, may give a better picture of the recovery. Already there are signs of a peaking late last year and a weakening in activity in January due to new travel restrictions to control flare-ups of the coronavirus.

High frequency indicators, like transport data, car sales and cinema box-office income, could also prove useful.
“Monthly changes of high frequency indicators such as industrial production or retail sales will be more indicative,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) in Hong Kong. “We should also pay attention to how consumption and passenger traffic fare during the Lunar holidays.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls rebounded more than expected in January, suggesting the labor market recovery was back on track after the economy shed jobs in December as soaring COVID-19 infections hurt operations in the leisure and hospitality industry.
There was also encouraging news on the embattled services sector, with other data on Wednesday showing activity racing to its highest level in nearly two years in January amid an acceleration in new orders and employment. The upbeat reports likely reflected nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief provided by the government in late December.
If the solid hiring is confirmed in the government's closely watched employment report on Friday, that could complicate President Joe Biden's push for a $1.9 trillion package to speed up the economic recovery, which has met with resistance from some lawmakers worried about the ballooning national debt. 
Authorities have started to ease restrictions on businesses amid signs of a peak in the recent coronavirus wave, though a new strain of the virus has been reported in many states. 
""The rebounds suggest that demand rebounded quickly once the latest coronavirus wave passed its peak,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. 
The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 174,000 jobs last month after dropping by 78,000 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would rebound by 49,000 in January. The gains in hiring were broad, though the pace was half of the 347,000 monthly average job growth in the last six months of 2020.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. 
Goods producers added 19,000 jobs in January, with employment in the construction industry rising 18,000. Manufacturing payrolls gained only 1,000. Hiring in the services sector rebounded by 156,000 jobs after falling 73,000 in December. 
The leisure and hospitality industry added 35,000 jobs after shedding 79,000 positions in December.
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index increased to a reading of 58.7 last month. That was the highest reading since February 2019 and followed 57.7 in December. The index is now above its pre-pandemic level. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index at 56.8. 
The survey's index of services industry employment rebounded to an 11-month high of 55.2 from 48.7 in December.
SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES
The distribution of vaccines has boosted optimism in the industry hardest hit by the pandemic because of the restrictions on businesses like restaurants and bars. 
Still, the ISM noted that ""various local-and state-level COVID-19 restrictions continue to negatively impact companies and industries,"" and that ""production capacity and logistics issues continue to cause supply chain challenges.""
The pandemic has shifted spending away from services to goods, with consumers staying away from other businesses and venues which attract crowds. 
Consumer spending on services is about 7.5% lower than before the outbreak of the virus in the United States.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry shot up to a six-month high of 61.8 from a reading of 58.6 in December. Backlog orders recovered, though export orders contracted as a global resurgence in the coronavirus led to renewed lockdowns in some of the United States' trade partners. 
""Recovery in payrolls is ongoing, albeit at a slow pace,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. 
The reports were published ahead of the government's closely watched, and comprehensive, monthly employment report on Friday.
Despite the solid ADP number, few economists changed their estimates for January nonfarm payrolls, noting its spotty record predicting the private payrolls count in the government's employment report. 
According to a Reuters poll of economists payrolls likely increased by 50,000 jobs in January after declining by 140,000 in December, the first drop in employment in eight months.
Expectations for a rebound in hiring were bolstered by a report on Monday from the Institute for Supply Management showing that manufacturers hired more workers in January, though a flare-up in COVID-19 infections caused labor shortages at factories and their suppliers.
But the Conference Board's survey last week showed consumers' perceptions of labor market conditions deteriorated further in January.
""We project that payrolls rose by 100,000 in January but the margin of error associated with this forecast still suggests a decline in jobs is a significant possibility,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.

The economy has recouped 12.5 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April. The Congressional Budget Office estimated on Monday that employment would not return to its pre-pandemic level before 2024.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat estimated that consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.2% month-on-month in January for a 0.9% year-on-year jump, rebounding from a 0.3% year-on-year fall in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.5% year-on-year rise in January.
Volatile energy prices rose 3.8% month-on-month in January, Eurostat estimated, but were still 4.1% lower than a year earlier, while also volatile unprocessed food prices went up 1.1% on the month and 1.9% year-on-year.
The measure excluding these two volatile components, which the European Central Bank calls core inflation and follows closely in policy decisions, still eased 0.3% on the month, but rose 1.4% on the year. 
An even narrower measure excluding also alcohol and tobacco prices that are often subject to changes because governments raise excise tax on them, fell 0.5% on the month but was also 1.4% higher than in the same period of 2020, far higher than expected
This is likely to be welcome news for the European Central Bank, which wants to keep inflation below, but close to 2% percent but has been missing that target for years despite ultra low interest rates and buying hundreds of billions of euros in government bonds to inject liquidity into the banking system.
The faster consumer price growth in January was mainly visible in the biggest economy Germany, where prices went up 1.6% on the year, and in the Netherlands, where they rose 1.7% year-on-year.
Separately, Eurostat said prices at factory gates rose more than expected, at 0.8% in December against November for a -1.1% year-on-year fall. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.7% monthly increase and a -1.2% annual decline. 

Producer prices give an early indication of consumer inflation trends because changes to prices at factory gates are most often passed on to the final consumer.

The final version of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) - spanning services businesses and manufacturers - fell to 41.2 in January from 50.4 in December, far below the growth threshold of 50.0.
This was the index's lowest reading since May. But it was up slightly from a preliminary reading of 40.6 for January and was nothing like as weak as during Britain's first lockdown last spring when it slumped to 13.8.
The fast rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations in Britain helped to push optimism among services firms to its highest since May 2014, in contrast to falling confidence in the euro zone, where vaccinations have been slow.
The Bank of England is expected to hold off from pumping more stimulus into the economy on Thursday as it waits for the lockdowns across Britain to be eased in the spring.
""While the UK economy is on course to contract sharply during the first quarter of 2021, businesses remain confident that pent-up demand and an easing of pandemic restrictions will provide a springboard to recovery later this year,"" Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said.
The PMI for the services industry alone, which accounts for the bulk of Britain's private-sector economy, fell to 39.5 in January from 49.4 in December, its lowest since May and marking a third month of contraction.

Companies mostly cited the hit from COVID-19 international travel restrictions on export sales but some said Brexit pushed down orders from clients in the European Union.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone's economic downturn deepened in January as renewed restrictions to quell the spread of the coronavirus hit the bloc's dominant service industry hard, a survey showed.
Coronavirus cases have been soaring again and governments across the continent have renewed tough lockdown measures, clamping down on public life and forcing hospitality and entertainment venues to close their doors.
IHS Markit's final January Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, fell to 47.8 from December's 49.1 but was a touch above a flash reading of 47.5. Anything below 50 indicates contraction.
""The euro zone economy endured a predictably tough start to 2021 as ongoing efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 continued to hit business activity, especially in the service sector,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.

""Manufacturing growth continued to help offset some of the weakness in the service sector, though even here factories saw output growth slow amid subdued demand and supply delays, often linked to the pandemic,"" Williamson said.
""A contraction of GDP therefore looks likely in the first quarter, though on current trends this should be modest in comparison to the falls seen in the first half of 2020."" 
The bloc's economy contracted 0.7% last quarter, official data showed on Tuesday, and a January Reuters poll predicted it would take up to two years for the economy to return to pre-COVID-19 levels.[ECILT/EU]
With venues closed, demand for services unsurprisingly fell. The new business index dropped to 45.4 from 46.6, albeit ahead of the 44.7 flash estimate.

But amid hopes the vaccines being rolled out would allow for some return to normality, overall optimism about the year ahead remained resilient. The composite future output index only nudged down to 64.2 from December's 64.5, which was the highest since April 2018.

Investing.com – China’s services sector grew at slowest pace in nine months in January, according to a private sector survey, as an outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the country impacted consumer sentiment.
January’s Caixin services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was 52 and remained above the 50-mark indicating expansion. In comparison, December’s figure was 56.3.
A sub-index for employment came in at 50.7, the lowest since July 2020 and down from December's 52 figure. New export business growth, which had only returned to expansion in November 2020, slowed from the previous month.
The data was largely in line with disappointing economic data released earlier in the week, and further suggests a slowdown in China’s economic recovery.
The Caixin manufacturing PMI was 51.5, with the manufacturing PMI at 51.3 and the non-manufacturing PMI at 52.4 respectively.
The services sector survey also showed that although input prices continued to rise, the rise in prices charged by services firms slowed. The sector has seen a slower recovery from the impact of COVID-19 than the industrial sector, as it is more vulnerable to restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, imposed to curb COVID-19 outbreaks.
“The services sector’s post-epidemic recovery continued, but at a much slower pace. Some surveyed enterprises said the services market continued to recover, while many said the market had been hurt by the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic.” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a statement accompanying the data release.
A recent outbreak of COVID-19 cases in northern China was the worst seen since March 2020, with local lockdowns imposed in January to curb the spread of the virus. The number of cases has dropped over the past few days, however travel over the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays has been discouraged.

The Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) for the one-week tenor, the Chinese yuan equivalent of Libor, fell to 2.241%, the lowest level since Jan. 18, compared with a near six-year high of 3.194% in previous session.
The volume-weighted average rate of benchmark seven-day repo traded in the interbank market dropped to a two-week low of 2.2285% at midday, compared with the previous close of 3.1656%.
Short-term funding cost in China started to pick up earlier last week as the central bank refrained from making its usual substantial liquidity injections to meet high demand for cash ahead of the week-long Lunar New Year holidays, which starts on Feb. 11 this year.
Due to coronavirus fears, authorities are seeking to discourage people from travelling or visiting too many friends and relatives during the break, which should lessen demand for cash this year.
Some analysts say this is one of the reasons why there has been no reduction in the banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) ahead of the holiday this year. The other reasons include a desire to avoid creating excess liquidity that could fuel potential bubbles in the property and share markets.
On Tuesday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected a net 78 billion yuan ($12.07 billion) into money markets through open market operations, bringing total net injection to 176 billion yuan so far this week. But it drained a total of 216.5 billion yuan in January. [CN/MMT]
Yuan borrowing also declined in Hong Kong. The CNH Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate benchmark (CNH HIBOR) for overnight tenor fell to 2.34183%, down from 3.64591% on Monday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy contracted less than expected in the fourth quarter of 2020 amid pandemic-induced lockdowns, initial EU estimates showed on Tuesday, but it is heading for another, probably steeper decline in the first quarter of this year.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said that according to its preliminary flash estimate, gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter, for a 5.1% year-on-year decline.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 1.0% quarterly fall and a 5.4% annual contraction after a sharp rebound in the July-September period when the euro zone eased restrictions on travel and leisure after a first wave of COVID-19 cases.
""In the first quarter of 2021, the decline is likely to be somewhat steeper. However, there will not be a slump like the one in the first half of 2020. Instead, a noticeable recovery is likely to set in again from the spring,"" said Christoph Weil, economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Eurostat preliminary data showed the second and third largest euro zone economies, France and Italy, pulled down the overall result with quarterly GDP declines of 1.3% and 2.0% respectively. Meanwhile Germany inched up 0.1% from the third quarter and Spain grew 0.4%.
Economists said the fourth quarter slump was milder than in the first half of the year because restrictive measures have been adapted and were less severe than earlier.
""Think of countries like France and Spain, for example, where industry and construction have remained largely open over the course of the quarter. This has had a very positive effect on GDP, especially because demand for goods and construction has remained strong despite lockdowns in place,"" said Bert Colijn, economist at ING.
""Mobility, the movement of people which was largely correlated to GDP growth in the first wave, was also stronger in the fourth quarter than during the first wave, which also supported economic activity,"" he said. ""What also helps is that the rest of the world is still open.""
Eurostat said that, according to its first estimation of annual growth for 2020, based on seasonally and calendar adjusted quarterly data, GDP fell by 6.8% in the euro area and 6.4% in the 27-nation European Union.

Eurostat said this was the deepest annual contraction since the series started in 1995. Even in 2009, following 2008 crisis, the contraction was only a 4.3% decline, Eurostat said.

House prices fell by a monthly 0.3%, slowing the pace of their annual increase to 6.4% from 7.3% in December, which was their biggest jump in six years.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a monthly increase of 0.3% and a 6.9% rise in annual terms.
""To a large extent, the slowdown probably reflects a tapering of demand ahead of the end of the stamp duty holiday, which prompted many people considering a house move to bring forward their purchase,"" Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said.
""If the stamp duty holiday ends as scheduled, and labour market conditions continue to weaken as most analysts expect, housing market activity is likely to slow, perhaps sharply, in the coming months.""
Demand for housing surged after Britain's first coronavirus lockdown last year, helped in part by the temporary exemption of property purchase taxes as well as people seeking bigger homes in response to the lockdown restrictions.
On Monday, data from the Bank of England showed British mortgage approvals remained close to a 13-year high in December.

British media have reported that finance minister Rishi Sunak might extend the tax break and support for the labour market as he seeks to help the economy through the COVID-19 pandemic.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. house prices will continue to race ahead over the next two years, according to a Reuters poll of analysts who said any COVID-19 resurgence was unlikely to knock housing market activity off its current upward course. 
Last year, most of the world's largest economies were brought to their knees by the pandemic but record low interest rates and pent-up demand for homes pushed U.S. house prices to levels not seen in more than half a decade. 
Despite the U.S. economy on average contracting last year at its sharpest pace since the Second World War, it had little bearing on housing market activity, an immunity the sector was expected to carry this year. 
The Jan. 12-Feb. 1 poll of nearly 40 housing analysts forecast the U.S. Case-Shiller house price index to rise 5.7% this year and 4.6% in 2022, the highest since polling began for both periods.
""The U.S. housing market will continue to expand this year, perhaps at a little slower rate than recently as some of the pent up demand has been exhausted, but overall it should be a fairly good year,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.

A majority, 19 of 34 analysts who answered an additional question, said U.S. housing market activity this year was likely to accelerate. The other 15 said it would slow.
While renewed restrictions to curb a resurgence of infections has weighed on the near-term U.S. economic outlook, over 85% of analysts, or 30 of 35, said the risk of COVID-19 derailing the housing market in 2021 was either low or very low.[ECILT/US] 
Asked what would drive demand for housing this year, 12 of 35 analysts said an economic recovery and 10 respondents picked a desire for more living space. Among the rest, seven chose easy monetary policy and six said a successful vaccine rollout. 
""Two factors here: exceedingly easy monetary policy and changes in tastes and preferences away from crowded cities in favor of areas with lower population density. This will likely continue for all of 2021,"" said Troy Ludtka, U.S. economist at Natixis.

Although strong demand has led to higher home prices, a shortage of supply was squeezed further with inventory levels falling to a third of what is viewed as healthy. After existing home sales touched nearly 7.0 million units last October - the highest since November 2005 - home builders ramped up construction activity to try and match demand.
Both housing starts and building permits are at levels not seen since the previous housing boom well over a decade ago. Existing home sales were forecast to drop but stay elevated and average around 6.0 million units this year. 
Strong demand at a time of a supply squeeze has pushed prices up, and when asked to rate U.S. housing affordability on a scale of 1 to 10 - where one was cheap and 10 expensive - analysts rated it 7. 
""It's not just very strong demand but also record low supply of existing and new homes that's driving rapid price increases ... that will eventually, if it continued, erode affordability,"" said BMO's Guatieri.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. manufacturing activity slowed slightly in January, while a measure of prices paid by factories for raw materials and other inputs jumped to its highest level in nearly 10 years, strengthening expectations inflation will perk up this year.
The moderation in activity reported by the Institute for Supply Management on Monday reflected a flare-up in COVID-19 infections, causing labor shortages in factories and their suppliers, which the ISM said ""will continue to restrict the manufacturing economy expansion until the coronavirus crisis abates."" Manufacturing and housing are anchoring the economic recovery from the pandemic.
""It's another reminder, not that we need one, the vaccine rollout has a long way to go before COVID loses its place as the biggest risk to economic growth,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
The ISM's index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 58.7 last month from 60.5 in December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index at 60 in January. 
The ISM revised data going back to 2012. Sixteen industries, including electrical equipment, appliances and components, machinery, primary metals and chemical products expanded in January. Printing and related support activities, and petroleum and coal products industries contracted.
Manufacturing has been driven by strong demand for goods like electronics and furniture as 23.7% of the labor force works from home because of the coronavirus outbreak. But spending on long-lasting manufactured goods fell for a second straight month in December, government data showed on Friday.
With the distribution of vaccines to fight the coronavirus expected to broaden and accelerate, spending on services is likely to pick up by summer. That could cause a slowdown in manufacturing activity from current levels. Still, a contraction is unlikely as customer inventories fell to an 11-year low in January. Factory stocks are also very lean.
A separate report on Monday from the Commerce Department said construction spending increased 1.0% to $1.490 trillion, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2002. That followed a 1.1% jump in November.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher following a sharp sell-off last week. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
SUPPLY SQUEEZE
Manufacturers mostly described demand as strong last month, but worried about labor and input supply constraints. Makers of computer and electronic products said ""increased demand, labor constraints and upstream supply delays are pushing lead times.""
Food producers reported that ""labor continues to be one of our largest challenges."" Machinery manufacturers complained about ""significant cost increases in logistics and raw materials."" Makers of miscellaneous goods reported ""an increase in employees testing positive for COVID-19, negatively impacting manufacturing.""
A separate survey from data firm IHS Markit showed strong manufacturing activity in January and rising supply constraints. 
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index fell to a reading of 61.1 last month from 67.5 in December. Export orders at factories also moderated. Despite the cool-off in orders, factories increased hiring last month. 
The survey's manufacturing employment gauge rose to 52.6 from 51.7 in December. That raises hope for a rebound in hiring this month after the economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months. According to a Reuters poll of economists, the government's employment report on Friday is likely to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 50,000 jobs in January.
Job losses have been disproportionately in the services industry.
""The structural mismatch between those who are out-of-work, primarily service workers, and those looking to hire, manufacturers, is a key reason why our forecast shows a more gradual jobs recovery than an otherwise robust rebound in output would suggest,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Bottlenecks in the supply chain worsened, with suppliers struggling to meet factory needs. That drove costs for manufacturers even higher. The survey's prices paid index jumped to a reading of 82.1 last month, the highest since April 2011, from 77.6 in December. Coming in the wake of recent data showing a rise in consumer prices and labor costs, it supports predictions of a pickup in inflation in the coming months.

""It could be interpreted as a sign that inflation pressures are becoming a broader issue for the economy,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""While we think it is too early to be especially concerned, we do predict that headline inflation will rise above 3% and core inflation above 2.5% in coming quarters.""
But high unemployment could limit manufacturers' ability to raise prices. Employment is still 10 million jobs below the pre-pandemic peak.

JANTETELCO, Mexico (Reuters) - Alberto Burgos is one of thousands of Mexican migrants living in the United States who dug deep and sent extra money to family back home last year to alleviate the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
    Growing plants and helping to handle their sale at a huge nursery in Alabama, the 35-year-old dipped into savings to transfer about a third more to his home town in central Mexico than he did in 2019, he said in an interview.
Burgos is one of a growing number of Mexicans with U.S. work permits or access to benefits who helped to fuel a more than 10% jump in remittances to Mexico last year to more than $40 billion, even as money transfers to other countries tumbled.
The record remittances have made Burgos' home town of Jantetelco - which has sent many economic migrants to work in U.S. nurseries and elsewhere - an oasis of relative prosperity despite the worst recession to batter Mexico since the 1930s.
""Returning to Mexico made me very sad this time: it's hard to see people with nothing,"" Burgos said. ""Thank God I was able to support them because I didn't lose my job.""
Because of a surge in demand for flowers from Americans trying to brighten up their homes and enjoy gardening during lockdown, Burgos had about nine months of work in the United States last year, three months more than usual, he said. 
    The pandemic shaved 8.5% off Mexican gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020, but remittances softened the blow, helping Jantetelco residents to repair their homes and even cover private medical bills sparked by the strain on public hospitals.
Last year, total remittances to Mexico were equivalent to about 3.8% of GDP, according to calculations by economists including Jonathan Heath, a board member of Mexico's central bank. Over 95% come from the United States, official data show.
The volume underlines Mexico's reliance on the United States even as former President Donald Trump attempted to shut down migration with a border wall and threats of trade sanctions.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has hailed the migrants as ""heroes"" but Mexico's dependence on their money shows the difficulty he has had in delivering on his pledge to create economic conditions that render migration unnecessary.
MEXICAN EXCEPTIONALISM
Helping to fuel remittances is greater access to social security among Mexicans in the United States, 60% of whom have lived there for at least 20 years, according to data from Washington-based think tank the Migration Policy Institute.
Since the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the percentage of Mexican migrants with U.S. citizenship has risen significantly, said Jesus Cervantes, a remittance expert at the Centro de Estudios Monetarios Latinoamericanos (CEMLA) research institute.
Over the past decade, the number of Mexican-born people registered in the United States has declined slightly. But the proportion of those holding U.S. citizenship rose by nearly a third to 37% of the total, according to the IPUMS USA database, based on an annual U.S. survey.
That, Cervantes said, made remittances to Mexico ""more resilient"" than they have been to other countries.
Global transfers to Latin America as a whole likely fell by around 20%, and declined by 13-22% to countries across Asia, according to an annual report by bank BBVA (MC:BBVA).
Much of the money captured in Mexico last year went into healthcare and housing, experts say.
In Jantetelco, some two hours' drive southeast of Mexico City, 78-year-old Maria Elena Sandoval said she saved her foot from thrombosis thanks to private surgery paid for by money from a son living in the United States.
Burgos asked Reuters not to reveal how much money he was sending back via  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) lest it encourage criminals to target his family, a risk in Mexico.
A municipality of about 18,000 inhabitants, Jantetelco took in about 25% more in remittances between January and September than in the same period in 2019, according to central bank data.
In the third quarter, that equated to about $425 per person - or to almost two months' worth of Mexico's daily minimum wage.
""Thank God and thank my son they didn't cut off my foot,"" said Sandoval, a grandmother who said she spent the equivalent of $600 on medical treatment to save her limb.
Other Jantetelco residents said they have used remittances to pay for everything from construction and renovation of homes damaged by a 2017 earthquake, new cars, appliances and crop seeds, to coming-of-age parties.
Mexico's leaders have traditionally tended not to draw attention to the money, given the often murky U.S. migration status of many people supporting families in Mexico.
But Lopez Obrador has repeatedly celebrated their contributions, and welcomed U.S. President Joe Biden's bid to implement a reform that would settle the migration status of many Mexicans living in the United States.

""You're vulnerable on remittances,"" said Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) economist Carlos Capistran, ""because it's income the country doesn't control.""

The Commerce Department said on Monday that construction spending increased 1.0% to $1.490 trillion, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2002. Data for November was revised higher to show construction outlays surging 1.1% instead of 0.9% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would increase 0.9% in December. Construction spending rose 5.7% on a year-on-year basis in December. Construction spending, which accounts for about 4% of gross domestic product, advanced 4.7% in 2020.
Spending on private construction projects rose 1.2%, boosted by investment in single-family homebuilding amid cheaper mortgages and a pandemic-driven migration to suburbs and low-density areas. That followed a 1.5% jump in November.
Spending on residential projects shot up 3.1% after increasing 3.0% in November. But outlays on nonresidential construction like gas and oil well drilling fell 1.7% in December. Still, spending on nonresidential structures rebounded in the fourth quarter after four straight quarterly declines.

Spending on public construction projects gained 0.5%. State and local government outlays rose 0.4%, while federal government spending increased 1.3%.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global manufacturing activity remained resilient in January although some countries suffered amid a resurgence in coronavirus infections, underscoring the fragile and uneven nature of the economic recovery.
Factories across parts of Europe, as well as in China and Japan, struggled as renewed lockdown measures alongside supply shortages hurt activity, surveys showed.
With coronavirus infections soaring again countries have forced vast swathes of their service industries to shut their doors, leaving manufacturing to support economies as factories have largely remained open.
""In general manufacturing is doing okay. You see some supply side constraints coming through but production and new orders are still growing quite strongly,"" said Claus Vistesen at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
""Manufacturing is still offering support and it will continue to do so.""
In the euro zone, IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 54.8 in January from December's 55.2, although that was a touch above the initial 54.7 ""flash"" estimate. A reading above 50 indicates growth. [EUR/PMIM]
A gauge of British manufacturing growth was at its slowest in three months in January as the combined impact of COVID-19 and Brexit weighed on new export orders and there were signs of disruption of supply chains. [GB/PMIM]
Factories in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, had been humming along during the pandemic on higher demand from abroad but also suffered from increasing supply delays and another hard lockdown.
But in other parts of Europe activity accelerated, with France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and some countries in the east of the continent recording stronger numbers.
ASIAN STRAIN
Factory activity quickened in major chip exporters South Korea and Taiwan, as they benefited from continued brisk demand for semiconductors crucial to work-from-home IT goods.
But China's manufacturing activity expanded at the slowest pace in seven months in January, weighed down by falling export orders.
Japan also saw factory activity slip back into contraction as a new state of emergency hit operating conditions.
""PMI readings for Asia suggest that manufacturing sectors improved further in most places. Buoyant global demand for electronics should continue to support the sector for at least the next few months,"" said Alex Holmes, emerging Asia economist at Capital Economics.
Takeshi Okuwaki, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo, said Japanese manufacturers may slash output as the state of emergency will unavoidably hurt the economy.
""A shortage of chip supply will take time to fix, which will also weigh on Japan's automobile production,"" he said.
China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI dropped to 51.5 in January, its lowest level since June last year and broadly aligned with Beijing's official PMI, which showed the recovery in factory activity slowing as local COVID-19 cases rose.
That was in stark contrast to South Korea, where factory activity rose at its fastest pace in a decade thanks to soaring exports.
Separate data showed South Korea's exports jumped 11.4% in January from a year earlier to mark a third straight month of gains due in part to surging sales of memory chips.
In India, factory activity expanded at its strongest pace in three months, fuelled by a continued recovery in demand and output.
Manufacturing activity in Indonesia increased at a faster pace and activity stopped contracting in the Philippines but shrank in Malaysia and rose at a slower pace in Vietnam, PMI data showed.
China's economy expanded a faster-than-expected 6.5% in the fourth quarter last year, as factories raced to fill overseas orders.

But recovery hopes are being dampened by a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases as authorities impose lockdown measures to curb the spread of the virus in the country's north.

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturers suffered a double hit last month as COVID-19 disruption to global shipping combined with new trade barriers with the European Union, according to a survey published on Monday.
Separate data from the Bank of England showed a record fall in borrowing by consumers in December, potentially paving the way for a spending rebound once the pandemic eases.
But for now the data paints a picture of a British economy that is struggling in early 2021 as finance minister Rishi Sunak considers whether to extend his emergency support programmes.
Data firm IHS Markit said its monthly survey of the factory sector showed a hit to new export orders, signs of supply chain problems and inflation pressure.
Fhaheen Khan, an economist at Make UK, a manufacturing lobby group, said the worst of the supply chain challenges were yet to come as many manufacturers were still working down stockpiles.
""The impact of both COVID-19 and leaving the EU could linger for many years to come,"" he said. 
The final IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 54.1, below the level in the euro zone and down from a three-year high of 57.5 in December, when factories rushed to beat problems when Britain's new trade relationship with the EU began on Jan. 1.
Smaller manufacturers were the hardest hit.
Britain's fast COVID-19 vaccination programme and progress by companies in adapting to Brexit held out the prospect of a pick-up in the pace of growth but there was no swift end to the headwinds in sight, Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said.
Input price inflation rose to a four-year high, reflecting raw material shortages and transport delays, leading to the steepest inflation of selling prices for 28 months.
Monday's data from the BoE showed unsecured lending to consumers was 7.5% lower in December than a year earlier, the biggest decline since monthly records began in 1994.
""With households paying down debt now, they should be in a good position to start spending again once the COVID-19 restrictions are eventually lifted,"" Ruth Gregory, an economist with Capital Economics, said.
But Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said many households were likely to buy foreign holidays and imported items such as new cars which would not boost economic output.
The BoE data also showed mortgage approvals slipped back slightly in December but remained close to a 13 year-high.

Tombs said the housing market rebound would lose steam before the scheduled March 31 expiry of Sunak's tax cut for property purchases.

Still, Eurostat said 13.671 million people were out of work in the 19 countries sharing the euro in December, up from 13.616 million in November.
In Belgium, Ireland, Cyprus, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal and Slovakia the number of people unemployed actually fell in December, but it rose slightly in other countries, such as Germany, France and Italy.

To keep unemployment levels down during the pandemic, euro zone countries have been using furlough systems where governments subsidise a portion of wages to help employers keep staff on their payrolls. This prevents layoffs and means production capacity can more easily rebound.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German retail sales plunged more than expected in December as a decision to tighten lockdowns to curb the spread of COVID-19 choked consumer spending in Europe's largest economy at the end of the year, data showed on Monday.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and state premiers closed most shops and services from mid-December after a partial lockdown for bars, restaurants and entertainment venues introduced in early November failed to push down infections.
The stricter lockdown, which included schools and kindergartens but excluded factories and offices, has been extended until mid-February.
The Federal Statistics Office said retail sales fell by an unprecedented 9.6% on the month in real terms after a downwardly revised increase of 1.1% in November.
This undershot a Reuters forecast for a drop of 2.6% and marked the steepest monthly drop since records began in 1994, the office said. December is usually the best month for German retailers.
""The containment measures left massive scars in December. Compared to November, sales dropped by an alarming extent,"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
On the year, retail sales - a notoriously volatile indicator often subject to revisions - rose 1.5% in real terms following a downwardly revised increase of 5% in November.
ONLINE SALES BENEFIT
For 2020 as a whole, retail sales jumped by 3.9% on the year in real terms, the office said. That was slightly below a previous estimate of 4.1% but still marked the highest annual increase on record.
Online retailers continued to benefit from shifting consumer habits with a strong jump in sales. That came at the expense of clothing and shoe stores ,which continued to suffer.
The HDE retail association has warned that up to 50,000 shops are facing bankruptcy because of the lockdown and the broader shift towards online retailing.
The weaker-than-expect retail sales data followed a consumer sentiment survey by GfK research group last week, which showed that German consumer morale fell a fourth month in a row heading into February as the stricter lockdown kept people from going shopping.
The Ifo economic institute said on Monday that the number of workers on reduced hours as part of the 'Kurzarbeit' job protection scheme rose by almost 20% to 2.6 million in January as a result of the stricter lockdown.
Germany's uneven lockdown has created a two-speed economy in which export-oriented manufacturers are doing well while domestically driven services are suffering.
""Since the lockdown is likely to continue for some time, a significant improvement cannot be expected for the time being,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Ralph Solveen said, adding the economy was likely to shrink significantly in the first quarter of 2021.
Robust exports and construction activity helped the economy eke out 0.1% growth in the final quarter of last year despite the phased lockdown.

A survey by IHS Markit among purchasing managers showed on Monday that increasing supply delays threaten to slow Germany's manufacturing. It nonetheless remained in growth territory in January despite the harder lockdown.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing growth remained resilient at the start of the year but the pace waned from December as renewed lockdown measures across the continent, alongside supply shortages, hurt activity, a survey showed.
With coronavirus infections soaring again in Europe countries have forced vast swathes of the bloc's dominant service industry to shut their doors, leaving manufacturing to support the economy as factories have largely remained open.
IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 54.8 in January from December's 55.2, although that was a touch above the initial 54.7 ""flash"" estimate.
""Euro zone manufacturing output continued to expand at a solid pace at the start of 2021, though growth has weakened to the lowest since the recovery began as new lockdown measures and supply shortages pose further challenges to producers across the region,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday that is seen as a good gauge of economic health fell to 54.6 from 56.3, still comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
But with much of the service industry likely to remain closed for some time the bloc's economic outlook remains bleak and it will take up to two years for GDP to reach pre-COVID-19 levels, a Reuters poll found last month. [ECILT/EU]
Restrictions meant a sub index measuring delivery times sank to 31.6 from 34.4, suggesting factories were struggling to obtain the raw materials they need. The index has only been lower once since the survey began in mid-1997 and that was at the height of the pandemic last year.
""Supply shortages have meanwhile put pricing power in the hands of suppliers, pushing raw material prices sharply higher. Increased shipping costs are adding to the burden,"" Williamson said.
Despite rocketing input costs factories increased their own prices at a shallower rate than in December.

Still, with hopes the vaccines being rolled out will allow some return to normality, optimism about the year ahead climbed to a three-year high.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index rose to 51.6 in January from 51.1 in December, reaching the highest level since last July.
The result was also marginally better than a preliminary reading of 51.5 and brought the index further from the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
""January's PMI results were emblematic of the current situation with COVID-19 as demand conditions began to improve amid expectations of a recovery, while output remained subdued because of ongoing restrictions designed to stem the spread of the virus,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.
Manufacturing activity has picked up since slipping in November when France was under its second coronavirus lockdown, which hit the bigger service sector harder because many restaurants, non-essential retail outlets and hotels were forced to close while factories remained operational.

After restrictions were eased in December, France was on tenterhooks through much of January on speculation that a new third lockdown would be imposed.

Investing.com – China's economic recovery hit a block on the road in January, with factory activity expanding at the slowest pace in seven months as falling export orders and resurgent COVID-19 cases dampened sentiment.
The disappointing economic data also highlighted the fragility of China’s recovery from the virus, with a resurgent number of COVID-19 cases reported in the country and a re-navigation of relations with the U.S. as the Biden administration took office.
Data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 51.5, lower than the 52.7 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and December’s reading of 53. The Caixin services PMI is due later in the week.
The Caixin survey follows disappointing official data released on Sunday. The manufacturing PMI for January was 51.3, against the 51.6 in forecasts and December’s 51.9 figure. The non-manufacturing PMI was 52.4, against December’s 55.7.
Exports ended a five-month growth streak, re-entering contraction territory in January as surging numbers of COVID-19 cases globally saw reduced overseas demand.
China reported a larger-than-expected 6.5% growth in GDP for the fourth quarter of 2020, which was boosted by the surprising resilience in exports as factories scrambled to fulfil overseas orders as the number of global COVID-19 cases climbed.
However, a resurgent number of COVID-19 cases in the country’s northeast saw the reintroduction of restrictive measures such as lockdowns, impacting both production and consumer confidence.
“The gauge for future output expectations was the lowest since May last year though it remained in positive territory, showing manufacturing entrepreneurs were still worried about the sustainability of the economic recovery,” Caixin Insight Group Senior Economist Wang Zhe told Reuters.
“In addition, the weakening job market and the sharp increase in inflationary pressure should not be ignored,” the economist added, with factories continuing to reduce headcount at a faster rate in January.
Average input costs continued a sharp rise in January, with inflation rates only slightly easing from the three-year high reported in December. Increased raw material prices and supplier shortages also continued to soaring prices, according to the Caixin survey.
Logistical delays as the restrictive measures impacted supply chains also increased suppliers’ delivery times, the survey added."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's home prices are expected to rise at a slower pace this year while sales will likely remain steady, as Beijing shifts its focus to tackling rising debt risks in the sector as the economy recovers, a Reuters poll showed.
The residential property market recovered quickly in 2020 benefiting from lower mortgage interest rates and a marginal relaxation of some official curbs on buyers, offering much-needed support for an economy nearly fully recovered to pre-coronavirus levels. But the rebound has raised concerns about financial risk and policymakers have since then tightened screws on the funnelling of funds into the sector.
Average residential property price growth is estimated to cool to 3.3% in 2021, according to 13 analysts and economists surveyed from Jan. 25-29.
Home prices climbed around 4.9% in 2020, a Reuters calculation of official data showed.
The price rises this year will continue to be driven by bigger cities as the credit liquidity released during the COVID-19 epidemic cannot be recalled in the short term, said Nie Wen, economist at Hwabao Trust.
Sluggish demand in smaller cities and stringent lending regulations for developers and buyers, however, will put a lid on any spurt in demand this year, analysts say.
Property transactions are expected to be flat from last year, versus a 2.6% gain in 2020.
Zhao Ke, analyst at China Merchants Securities, said pent-up buying in the second half of 2020 could mean that demand won't be as strong this year.
Yuan Hao, chief real estate analyst with SWS Research also expected the central bank's tight controls on banks' property loan issuance to curb home transactions this year.
Regulators outlined borrowing caps known as ""the three red lines"" last August, while the central bank in December introduced caps on property loans granted by banks.
Major Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen also recently ramped up transaction restrictions and launched probes into illegal flows of funds into the real estate sector.
Housing investments are estimated to rise 6.4% this year, slightly softer than the pace of 7% in 2020.
""The volume of new construction starts is expected to stay elevated this year, as land sales in 2020 remained high,"" said Nelson Wong, head of research for Greater China at commercial property services provider JLL.
Housing project construction investment will also be driven by developers who are accelerating project launches to raise cash amid tight financing conditions, he said. However, land purchase, the other component of real estate investment, is likely to slow down due to the tight financing situation.
The survey also found analysts think the COVID-19 epidemic will have a limited impact on China's property sector, and many believe the market will remain stable or further cool this year.
Most respondents say top-tier cities may extend tightening curbs to avoid market froth due to a low level of residential housing supply, while lower-tier cities facing a slump in demand may roll out more support.

Asked to rate the affordability of Chinese housing on a scale, with 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, analysts' median answer was 7, in line with the last poll.

88,"<span>Jan 31, 2021 08:55PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity expanded at the slowest pace in seven months at the start of 2021, weighed down by falling export orders amid a surging global pandemic and rising costs, a business survey showed on Monday.
The slowdown in the manufacturing sector underscores the fragility of the ongoing economic recovery in China, as Beijing grapples with a resurgence of local COVID-19 cases in northern China and navigates rising tensions with Washington and its allies.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 51.5 last month, the lowest level since June last year and easing markedly from December's reading of 53.0. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 52.7.
The survey broadly aligned with Beijing's official PMI on Sunday, which showed the recovery in factory activity slowing as COVID-19 cases rose.
A sub-index for production in the Caixin/Markit PMI dropped to 52.5 in January, the slowest pace of expansion since April last year, while another sub-index for new orders fell to 52.2, the lowest since June.
In particular, export orders plunged back into contraction in January, ending a five-month growth streak as the surging global pandemic suppressed foreign demand.
China's economy expanded at a faster-than-expected rate of 6.5% in the fourth quarter last year, thanks to the surprisingly resilient export sector, as factories raced to fill overseas orders amid a surging pandemic.
But recovery hopes are being dampened by a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases as authorities race to impose lockdown measures to curb the spread of the virus in the country's north, affecting steel mills and consumer confidence.
""The gauge for future output expectations was the lowest since May last year though it remained in positive territory, showing manufacturing entrepreneurs were still worried about the sustainability of the economic recovery,"" said Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group. 
""In addition, the weakening job market and the sharp increase in inflationary pressure should not be ignored.""
Average input costs continued to rise sharply during January, with the rate of inflation only easing slightly from December's three-year high. Respondents reported increased raw material prices and supplier shortages drove up expenses in January.
Factories continued to reduce their headcount at a faster pace in January. 

Manufacturers also reported widespread logistics delays as government imposed lockdown measures hit supply chains, leading to a marked increase in delivery times for suppliers.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A continued surge in demand for chips and bio-health products helped South Korea's exports to gain for a third month in January, signalling a recovery in global demand in the year ahead. 
Exports jumped 11.4% from a year earlier to $48.01 billion, after a 12.6% jump in December, government data showed on Monday, beating the 9.8% expansion forecast by 12 economists in a Reuters survey.
The trade picture of South Korea comes into a focus when it comes to global trade, as its monthly trade data is the first to be released among major exporting economies.
Sales of memory chips soared 21.7% year-on-year, continuing their stellar double-digit growth for a fifth month in a row as the nation's chipmakers, including Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix, posted strong earnings. 
Exports of bio-health products soared 66.5% to continue its double-digit expansion for a 14th straight month. Of the nation's 15 major export items, shipments of 12 items, including memory chips, mobile devices, bio-health products and cars increased in January.
Imports increased 3.1% to $44.05 billion, also beating forecasts for a 1.9% increase.

The trade surplus shrank to $3.96 billion from $6.77 billion in December. By destination, exports to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, gained 1% year-on-year.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell to 51.3 in January from 51.9 in December, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement on Sunday.
It remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis, but was below the 51.6 expected in a Reuters poll of analyst forecasts.
In January, mainland China reported more than 2,000 local cases of the coronavirus. While the number was small compared with other countries, authorities were concerned about transmission risks during the Lunar New Year travel rush - the world's biggest annual human migration spanning 40 days from January to February.
During the month several large cities were locked down with tens of millions tested for COVID-19, interrupting factory activity and weighing on the services sector, including logistics and transportation.
""The recent localised epidemic has had a certain impact on the production and operation of some enterprises, and the overall expansion of the manufacturing industry has slowed,"" said Zhao Qinghe, an official at the statistics bureau.
""The period before and after the Lunar New Year is also traditionally an off-season for the country's manufacturing industry,"" Zhao said in an accompanying statement.
The new coronavirus outbreak, mostly in the north, is expected to be a temporary restraining factor while China's vast industrial sector continues to find strength in resilient export demand.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed the sub-index for new export orders stood at 50.2, expanding for the fifth straight month, though down from 51.3 in December. 
Economic indicators ranging from trade to producer prices all suggest a further pickup in the industrial sector. 
A sub-index for small firm activity stood at 49.4 in January, up from December's 48.8.
China's gross domestic product grew 2.3% on year in 2020, making it the only major economy in the world to dodge a contraction last year as many nations struggled to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.
The central bank will extend the country's monetary policy support for economic growth with a focus on maximising employment to help boost consumption, Governor Yi Gang said last week.

In the services sector, activity expanded for the 11th straight month, the statistics bureau said, albeit at a slower clip, weighed by the latest COVID-19 outbreaks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending fell for a second straight month in December amid renewed business restrictions to slow the spread of COVID-19 and a temporary expiration of government-funded benefits for millions of unemployed Americans.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed inflation steadily rising last month. Expectations that inflation would perk up this year were supported by other data showing a solid increase in labor costs in the fourth quarter. 
But a rise above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, a flexible average, is unlikely to worry policymakers. The U.S. central bank is expected to maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy stance for a while as the economy battles the pandemic. Excess capacity remains throughout the economy, which could limit companies' ability to raise prices.
""The Fed would like inflation to average 2%, so it would like inflation to temporarily move above 2%,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Inflation pressures will remain limited to a few sectors as high unemployment will restrain wage growth."" 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slipped 0.2% last month as outlays at restaurants declined. Spending at hospitals also fell, likely as patients stayed away in fear of contracting the coronavirus.
Households also cut back spending on recreation. Consumer spending tumbled 0.7% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast spending would fall 0.4% in December.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending decreased 0.6% last month after dropping 0.7% in November. That likely sets a lower base for consumer spending in the first quarter.
Another drop in January is not expected as states, including New York and California, have started easing pandemic-related restrictions. But outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods, the main driver of spending during the pandemic, fell for a second consecutive month in December. Spending on nondurable goods dropped for a third straight month. Services gained 0.1%.
""Goods spending has clearly rolled over, and we anticipate the pull-forward in demand in the second half of last year will also weigh on consumption of goods at the start of this year,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""We do not anticipate spending to pick up significantly until a vaccine is widely administered.""
U.S. stocks fell sharply. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower. 
The data was included in Thursday's advance gross domestic product report for the fourth quarter, which showed the economy growing at a 4% annualized rate after a record 33.4% pace in the July-September period. Consumer spending rose at a 2.5% rate last quarter following a spectacular 41.0% growth pace in the third quarter.
Separately on Friday, the University of Michigan said its measure of consumer sentiment eased in January. A third report from the National Association of Realtors showed contracts to purchase homes decreased for a fourth straight month in December, suggesting some moderation in the housing market, one of the economy's star performers.
Growth is expected to decelerate to around a 2% rate in the first quarter as the economy works through the disruptions from a COVID-19 surge in the winter. Faster growth is expected by summer. The government provided nearly $900 billion in additional relief in late December and distribution of vaccines is expected to broaden and accelerate. 
President Joe Biden also has unveiled a recovery plan worth $1.9 trillion, though the package is likely to be pared down amid worries about the nation's swelling debt.
The late December stimulus package, which included direct cash payments to some households and renewal of a $300 unemployment supplement until March 14, helped to boost personal income, which rebounded 0.6% after tumbling 1.3% in November. 
Some of the money was stashed away, boosting the saving rate to 13.7% from 12.9% in November. 
Inflation crept higher. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy component gained 0.3% after being unchanged in November. In the 12 months through December, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5% after advancing 1.4% in November. The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. 
Gradually firming inflation was reinforced by a fourth report from the Labor Department showing its Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.7% last quarter after advancing 0.5% in the third quarter.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation, as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Wages jumped 0.9% last quarter.
But with employment still 10 million jobs below the pre-pandemic peak, the rise is probably unsustainable. Still, inflation is seen accelerating in the months ahead as weak readings last March and April drop from the calculation.
Strengthening economic growth is also expected to boost price pressures. Bottlenecks in the supply chain are raising costs for manufacturers, and the increases are being passed on to consumers. Recent manufacturing surveys have shown a surge in price measures for both raw materials and finished products.

""Though inflation will accelerate this year, some of that will be transitory,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico's economy last year suffered its biggest annual contraction since the 1930s, although it recovered better than expected from the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic during the final quarter, preliminary data showed on Friday.
Gross domestic product in Latin America's second-biggest economy tumbled by 8.5% last year in seasonally adjusted terms, according to the preliminary estimate issued by national statistics agency INEGI. The fall was slightly shallower than the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for an 8.8% decline.
Still, the contraction was the sharpest since 1932 during the Great Depression, data published by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) show. And the economy has recently faced fresh headwinds due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.
During the second half of 2020, the economy made up much of the ground lost to the pandemic, and an unexpectedly robust performance in the October-December period helped lift the peso against the dollar early on Friday.
But the economy remains a major challenge for President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whose efforts to strengthen the state's hand in the energy market have led to disputes with businesses and upset Mexico's allies, chilling investment.
The second quarter bore the brunt of economic disruptions caused by the pandemic, before a sharp increase in infections towards the end of 2020 led to renewed commercial restrictions in the Mexico City metropolitan area before Christmas.
That is expected to dent the recovery in early 2021, which has seen deaths from coronavirus hitting record levels. Lopez Obrador himself contracted COVID-19 this month.
During the final three months of 2020, GDP advanced by 3.1% from the previous quarter in adjusted terms, beating the prediction for 2.8% growth seen in a Reuters poll.
Nikhil Sanghani, an economist at Capital Economics, said the figures for the fourth quarter meant that Mexico had recouped more than 70% of its losses from the first half of 2020.
""However, the recent surge in new COVID-19 cases will cause the recovery to grind to a halt in Q1,"" he said.
A breakdown of the unadjusted 2020 GDP figures showed manufacturing took the biggest hit last year. Secondary activities, which encompass factory output, fell by 10%, while tertiary activities, which include services, declined by 7.7%.
By contrast, primary activities such as farming, fishing and forestry, rose by 2.0% from 2019, the data showed.
The latest data also showed that 2020 was the second year running in which the economy went backwards. In 2019, the economy shrank by 0.1% in unadjusted terms, INEGI said.
Manufacturing activity has bounced back quickly from the depths of the slump, but companies are still wary about investing in new factories, buildings and machinery.
In the ten months through October, which is the latest data available, gross fixed investment was down by 19.5% compared with the same period in 2019, INEGI data show.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said in a client note that the outlook remained challenging for Mexico, though the rollout of a vaccination program would help the recovery.
""Firmer U.S. growth, stronger terms of trade, and additional moderate monetary policy easing should leverage the recovery,"" Ramos said. ""With the better than expected fourth quarter 2020 print we now expect real GDP growth to firm to 4.0% in 2021.""

The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.7% last quarter after advancing 0.5% in the third quarter. That lifted the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.5% from 2.4% in the third quarter.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI climbing 0.5% in the fourth quarter.
Wages and salaries increased 0.9% after gaining 0.4% in the third quarter. They were up 2.6% year-on-year. The private sector accounted for the surge in wages and salaries. Benefits rose 0.6%, matching the third quarter's increase.
Inflation is expected to pick up this year and breach the Federal Reserve's 2% target, a flexible average, as weak readings last March and April drop from the calculation. Price pressures are also seen boosted by a strengthening in economic growth, driven by fiscal stimulus and the inoculation of more Americans against COVID-19.

Bottlenecks in the supply chain are expected to contribute to higher inflation. Recent manufacturing surveys have shown a surge in price measures for both raw materials and finished products.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's pandemic-hit economy recorded its steepest contraction on record in 2020, and increasingly tough COVID-19 restrictions imposed since the turn of the year suggest that expectations of a strong rebound in 2021 may have to be scaled back.
Gross domestic product fell 11% last year, data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed on Friday, as revenues in the crucial tourism sector plummeted. 
That was more than the economy shrank over the five years during and after the global financial crisis that began in 2008, and historians said it marked the steepest drop since Spain's 1936-39 civil war. 
There was a modest recovery in the final three months, when higher spending boosted GDP 0.4% from the previous quarter, outstripping the 1.5% drop expected by analysts polled by Reuters.
But since then a third wave of contagion has been spreading across Europe and, like many of its neighbours, Spain has tightened curbs on movement, imposing regional curfews and restricting business hours.
The government's projects a 7.2% GDP rebound this year, above forecasts from markets analysts who last week cut their consensus to 6.3% from 6.5%.
The International Monetary Fund has trimmed its prediction to 5.9%, and warned that the euro zone's recovery is slipping behind those of other advanced economies including the United States and Japan.
Over 2020, a year in which global travel was dramatically curtailed, tourism accounted for just 4%-5% of Spain's GDP, according to estimates from Funcas analyst Maria Jesus Fernandez. That compares with a 12% share in 2019.
Agriculture was the only economic sector to expand, growing by 4.7%. Public spending grew 4.5%, its highest rate since 2008, while private consumption fell 12.4%, according to calculations by an INE official.
Between March and June 2020, Spain imposed one of Europe's toughest lockdowns, confining the population to their homes for all but essential activities and shutting down many industries.

That drove a 17.9% second-quarter slump in economic activity and, while the current lockdown allows people to circulate, many business activities have again been curtailed.

Goods exports and construction supported the economy while a renewed lockdown at the end of last year hit private consumption, the Office said on Friday. A Reuters poll had pointed to 0.0% fourth-quarter growth.
In the third quarter, the economy grew 8.5%.
""In Q4, this recovery was slowed by the second coronavirus wave and the renewed lockdown at the end of the year,"" the Statistics Office said.
""This particularly affected private consumption, while goods exports and construction investments supported the economy.""
The German government on Wednesday slashed its growth forecast for Europe's largest economy to 3% this year, a sharp revision from last autumn's estimate of 4.4%, caused by a second coronavirus lockdown.
Presenting the revised forecast, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said he expected the upswing to continue in 2022 and for the economy to regain its pre-crisis level in the second half of next year.
Germany suffered its second-biggest economic plunge in post-war history last year.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders agreed last week to extend the latest lockdown until mid-February as Germany, once a role model for fighting the pandemic, struggles with a second wave and record daily numbers of COVID-19 deaths.
The economy shrank by a smaller-than-expected 5% last year. That was surpassed in the post-war era only by the record -5.7% in 2009, during the financial crisis.

A survey published on Monday showed German business morale slumped to a six-month low in January as the second wave of COVID-19 halted an economic recovery.

PARIS (Reuters) - The French economy contracted much less than expected at the end of last year, official data released on Friday showed, as the growing prospect of a new lockdown wipes out hopes for a recovery early this year.
The euro zone's second-biggest economy shrank 1.3% in the final three months of last year after France entered a second coronavirus lockdown in October to contain a second wave of infections, the INSEE statistics agency said.
The slump, which followed an 18.5% rebound in the third quarter after a first lockdown, exceeded expectations for a 4% contraction on average in a Reuters poll of 28 economists, surpassing even the highest estimate of -1.4%.
It also meant that for the whole of 2020, the economy contracted 8.3%, which though France's worst post-war recession was better than the -11% the government had forecast in its budget plans.
It also eases some of the strain on the public finances as the budget deficit is, therefore, likely to come in at less than the 11.3% of gross domestic product the government had expected.
France is on tenterhooks to find out in the coming days whether the government will put the country under a new lockdown and in particular whether schools will be closed.
""If the restrictions are made harder, it will be very difficult to get any growth"" in the first quarter, Euler Hermes France economist Selin Ozyurt.
INSEE said consumer spending surged 23% in December from the previous month as coronavirus restrictions were eased heading into the holiday period, which helped to limit the overall fourth-quarter drop in household spending - the traditional motor of the French economy.
Meanwhile, exports surpassed imports so that foreign trade contributed 0.9 percentage points to fourth quarter GDP while inventory building added 0.4 percentage points.

INSEE said that exports of transport goods and pharmaceuticals had held up well in the period while lower economic activity had limited imports of oil.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output extended declines in December as factories struggled with a hit to demand from expanded COVID-19 lockdown measures globally, suggesting the economic recovery was slowing.
The output slowdown may fan worries that the world's third-largest economy has failed to secure a firm footing after last year's sharp recession as businesses are pressured by a wider, local state of emergency covering parts of the country, including Tokyo.
Separate data showed the average number of available jobs per applicant for 2020 saw its biggest decline in 45 years, while the average jobless rate last year rose for the first time in 11 years.
Official data released on Friday showed factory output declined 1.6% in December, as falling production of general machinery and cars offset strength in inorganic and organic chemicals manufacturing.
The decline was larger than the previous month's 0.5% fall, but broadly in line with a 1.5% decline in a Reuters poll of economists.
""Output will likely be positive in the first quarter, but we expect (economic) growth to be negative. The biggest reason is the contraction in private spending due to the state of emergency,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank.
While the economy was likely to contract by around 5% on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter, it was still expected to avoid a technical recession--two straight quarters of decline--thanks to a second-quarter rebound in exports and output, he said.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to rebound 8.9% in January and decline 0.3% in February.
Although production was still likely to grow at a sharp pace in January, manufacturers' forecasts didn't fully reflect the impact of Japan's new state of emergency, a trade ministry official said.
Factory output weakened in November as a rebound in car production ended on sagging global demand. Analysts worry that is delaying Japan's recovery with the economy at risk from starting the year with a contraction.
COVID-19 HURTS JOBS
Official data on Friday also showed the average jobs-to-applicants ratio for 2020 was 1.18, down 0.42 point from 2019, its biggest annual fall since 1975. The ratio was unchanged at 1.06 in December from the previous month.
Other data showed the average jobless rate stood at 2.8% in 2020, up for the first time since 2009 when the Lehman Brothers collapse hit the employment sector.
An average of 2.56 million people per month were furloughed last year, the highest since comparable data became available in 1968.
The country's seasonally adjusted jobless rate held steady at 2.9% in December, beating the median estimate of 3.0%.
Meanwhile, the core consumer price index for Tokyo, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, fell 0.4% in January from a year earlier, down for a sixth straight month, government data showed on Friday.

In the consumer sector, sentiment worsened in January, an official gauge showed on Friday, prompting the government to cut its view on the closely watched index, saying it was on a weak tone.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) is expected to dip slightly to 51.6 in January from 51.9 in December, according to the median forecast of 20 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion inactivity on a monthly basis.
""High-frequency indicators suggest a slowdown in production as temperature cools and Lunar New Year holiday approaches,"" said Liu Xuezhi, an analyst at the Bank of Communications, in a note to clients. 
China's economy expanded at a faster-than-expected rate of 6.5% in the fourth quarter last year, thanks to the surprisingly resilient export sector, as factories raced to fill overseas orders amid a surging pandemic.
Profits at China's industrial firms surged 20.1% year-on-year in December, helped by improving factory-gate prices, which fell at their slowest pace since February last month.
But recovery hopes are being dampened by a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases as authorities in Northern China raced to impose lockdown measures to curb the spread of the virus, affecting steel mills and consumer confidence.
Many exporters have told Reuters that they're facing a squeeze in their profit margins amid a shortage of containers, an appreciating Chinese currency and rising raw material prices.
""The surging shipping costs and a tumbling U.S. dollar have forced our factories to give up on some overseas orders,"" said a business owner that runs several textile factories in the southeastern city of Jiaxing.
""So we've decided to let workers go home earlier than usual,"" the owner said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector, will both be released on Sunday.

The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Monday. Analysts expect that headline reading will dip to 52.7from 53 in December.

New home sales increased 1.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 842,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. November's sales pace was revised down to 829,000 units from the previously reported 841,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales would rebound 1.9% to a rate of 865,000 units in December. New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from building permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. New home sales jumped 15.2% on a year-on-year basis. Sales totaled 811,000 in 2020, up 18.8% from 2019.
The government reported last week that housing starts soared in December to their highest level since September 2006. Permits for future homebuilding were also the highest since August 2006. But surging lumber prices and labor and land shortages could slow the housing market momentum. 
The housing market is being supported by cheaper mortgages and an exodus from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as companies allow employees to work from home and schools shift to online classes because of the coronavirus pandemic. About 23.7% of the labor force is working from home. Lower-wage earners in the services sector have borne the brunt of the COVID-19 crisis.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 2.77%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). 
In December, new home sales rose in the Midwest and West, but fell in the Northeast and South.

The median new house price surged 8% to $355,900 in December from a year ago. There were 302,000 new homes on the market last month, up from 290,000 in November. At December's sales pace it would take 4.3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 4.2 months in November.

102,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 09:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German annual consumer prices turned positive and rose by far more than expected in January, the Federal Statistics Office said on Thursday, attributing a rise in sales tax and the minimum wage as factors behind the increase.
Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose by 1.6% year-on-year after declining by 0.7% in December.
January's reading was the highest since 1.7% last February, the Statistics Office told Reuters. It compared with a Reuters forecast for a rise of 0.5%.
""In addition to the changes in VAT rates, the development of consumer prices may also be influenced by other factors such as the CO2 price and the increase in the statutory minimum wage from January 2021,"" the Statistics Office said in a statement.
The European Central Bank targets an inflation rate of below but close to 2% across the euro zone. Annual inflation for the euro area stood at -0.3% last month.
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the surge was mainly the result of the reversal of last year’s VAT reduction, higher energy prices and a new carbon tax.
But, in a note headlined ""Germany: inflation shock"", he added: ""Today’s inflation number is just the beginning of a period of significantly higher headline inflation in Germany ... With price mark ups in some sectors once the economy starts to reopen again, headline inflation in Germany could be pushed above 2% after the summer.""
Klaas Knot, a member of the ECB's Governing Council, said on Wednesday he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about Europe's economy recovering during 2021, as the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines should give more room for growth in the second half of the year.

Interest rates in the euro zone will remain low in the foreseeable future, he added, as relatively low production will limit inflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy contracted at its sharpest pace since World War Two in 2020 as COVID-19 ravaged services businesses like restaurants and airlines, throwing millions of Americans out of work and into poverty.
The Commerce Department's snapshot of fourth-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday also showed the recovery from the pandemic losing steam as the year wound down amid a resurgence in coronavirus infections and exhaustion of nearly $3 trillion in relief money from the government.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero and pledged to continue injecting money into the economy through bond purchases, noting that ""the pace of the recovery in economic activity and employment has moderated in recent months."" 
President Joe Biden has unveiled a recovery plan worth $1.9 trillion, and could use the GDP report to lean on some lawmakers who have balked at the price tag soon after the government provided nearly $900 billion in additional stimulus at the end of December. 
The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance since 1946. That followed 2.2% growth in 2019 and was the first annual decline in GDP since the 2007-09 Great Recession. The economy plunged into recession last February
In the fourth quarter, GDP increased at a 4.0% annualized rate as the virus and lack of another spending package curtailed consumer spending, and partially overshadowed robust manufacturing and the housing market. GDP growth for the last quarter was in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. 
The big step-back after a historic 33.4% growth pace in the July-September period left GDP well below its level at the end of 2019. With the virus not yet under control, economists are expecting growth to further slow down in the first quarter of 2021, before regaining speed by summer as the additional stimulus kicks in and more Americans get vaccinated. 
The services sector has borne the brunt of the coronavirus recession, disproportionately impacting lower-wage earners, who tend to be women and minorities. That has led to a so-called K-shaped recovery, where better-paid workers are doing well while lower-paid workers are losing out. 
The stars of the recovery have been the housing market and manufacturing as those who are still employed seek larger homes away from city centers, and buy electronics for home offices and schooling. Manufacturing's share of GDP has increased to 11.9% from 11.6% at the end of 2019.
A survey last week by professors at the University of Chicago and the University of Notre Dame showed poverty increased by 2.4 percentage points to 11.8% in the second half of 2020, boosting the ranks of the poor by 8.1 million people.

Rising poverty was underscored by persistent labor market weakness. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said 847,000 more people filed new claims for state unemployment benefits last week. The economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months. Only 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy slowed sharply in the final quarter of 2020 as a third wave of coronavirus infections caused states across the country to put tight restrictions on social gatherings and economic activity.
Gross domestic product expanded at an annualized rate of 4.0% in the three months through December, according to the Census Bureau’s first reading. The reading is likely to be revised over the coming weeks.
That contrasts with an annualized growth rate of 33% in the three months through September, when the economy broadly reopened after the first wave of infections and lockdowns.
The number was exactly in line with expectations ahead of time. It means that over 2020 as a whole, the economy contracted by 3.6%, its worst contraction since 1946.
The figures suggest that, in the second half of the year, the economy recovered around three-quarters of what it lost in output in the first half, Jason Furman, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute, said via Twitter.
Most analysts expect the economy to bounce back strongly this year, with many noting that output and consumption have remained relatively resilient under the latest wave of lockdowns as businesses and consumers have adapted to the new circumstances. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday raised its estimate for U.S. GDP growth in 2021 to 5.1%, having expected only a 3.1% rebound as recently as October.
At the same time, the Department of Labor reported a bigger-than-expected drop in the number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits last week, although the number remained stubbornly high at 847,000. Analysts had expected claims a number of 875,000.
The improvement was not as large as seemed at first glance, however: the previous week’s figure was revised upward by 14,000 to 914,000.
The number of those making continuing claims for benefits, which comes with a one-week lag to the initial claims estimate, fell to its lowest since April at 4.77 million. Including those claiming under pandemic-specific programs, the total number of those claiming unemployment-related benefits as of January 9 rose by nearly 3 million to 18.28 million. That was due largely to a jump in claimants for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance."

LONDON (Reuters) - Early signs of disruption caused by Britain's shift to its new, less open trading relationship with the European Union are emerging in economic data.
Although the biggest problem for many companies remains the COVID-19 pandemic, details of recent surveys show that Brexit is adding to the strain on the economy.
Manufacturers and services firms have been hit hard by supply chain and export disruption, according to data company IHS Markit.
British factories reported the steepest increase in supplier delivery times among the six ""flash"" preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) surveys published by IHS Markit last week for France, Germany, Japan, Australia and the United States as well as the United Kingdom.
""This was almost exclusively linked to both Brexit disruption and a severe lack of international shipping availability,"" IHS Markit said.

Under a deal struck last month, trade between Britain and the European Union remains free of tariffs and quotas but a new full customs border means goods must be checked and paperwork filled in.
Using a phrase that has angered many business owners, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the disruption as ""teething problems"" which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Trade experts think some of the extra cost and bureaucracy will be permanent. Proponents of Brexit say Britain will benefit in the long run by striking its own trade deals and forming its own regulations outside the EU.
Brexit disruption in the first quarter of 2021 was likely to reduce British economic output by around 1%, International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said on Wednesday.
Services companies - which account for the bulk of the British economy and generate a surplus in trade with the bloc - were hit this month, the IHS Markit survey showed.
Services exports deteriorated faster in Britain than in any other of the six flash PMIs published this month, bucking a trend of improvement seen in most other countries.

""The service economy was hard-hit by restrictions on trade and reduced consumer spending at the start of the year,"" IHS Markit said.
Following the initial disruption, a truer picture of the costs and benefits of Brexit is likely to emerge over time, although many businesses are not hopeful.
A Confederation of British Industry survey published last week showed British manufacturers' confidence in their ability to compete in the EU market has fallen to its lowest level since records began 20 years ago.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports likely expanded for a third straight month in January on continued strong chip sales and overseas demand, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, underpinning export-led recovery hopes in the economy.
Overseas sales in the first month of 2021 were seen increasing 9.8% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of 12 economists.
That would be slower than a 12.6% rise in December, when it marked the sharpest growth in over 2 years, but remaining on a recovery track that began in November.
""Interim exports data showed that the two key semiconductor and auto sectors were pretty strong with double-digit growth. We also noticed the sustained strength of exports to the U.S. and EU despite the worsening of the pandemic in these two major economies,"" said Oh Suktae, economist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Preliminary data showed shipments of chips and cars jumped 11.6% and 15.7%, respectively, during Jan. 1-20.
Imports were expected to have risen 1.9% in January, after growing 2.2% last month, on higher oil and commodity prices.
Economists see vaccine distribution and easing of coronavirus-related regulations in major economies to further tow the export recovery track.
""Vaccination is already underway in some of South Korea's major trading partners, which will likely lead to a more sustained relaxation of social distancing measures. This should support a rebound in global trade this year, providing a tailwind for South Korean exports,"" said Lloyd Chan, an economist at Oxford Economics.
Trade data for January will be out on Feb. 1 at 9 a.m. local time (0000 GMT).
Meanwhile, 15 economists predicted industrial output in December would expand by a seasonally adjusted 1.2% month-on-month, after rising 0.3% a month earlier.

Nine economists also estimated consumer prices in January would rise a median 0.3% year-on-year, slowing from December's 0.5% rise.

However, as the world's second-largest economy bounces back from COVID-triggered paralysis, growth in fiscal revenue accelerated to 5.5% in the fourth quarter, from 4.7% the previous quarter, the ministry said in a statement on its website. 
China's economy picked up speed in the fourth quarter, with growth beating expectations as it ended a rough coronavirus-striken 2020 in remarkably good shape and remained poised to expand further this year even as the global pandemic rages unabated.
The finance ministry expects tax and fee cut efforts last year helped reduce burdens on corporates by more than 2.5 trillion yuan, and pledged to continue implement reforms in value-added tax and personal income tax to maintain the necessary support to the economic recovery. 
""Some industries are still digesting the negative impact brought by the pandemic and the foundations of a steady economic rebound are yet to be consolidated,"" said the ministry. 
It added the ratio of 2020 government debt to GDP stood at 45.8%, which was lower than the international redline of 60%. 
Going forward, authorities would maintain a stable macro leverage ratio, balancing the needs of economic growth and risk control, said the finance ministry, adding that it would reasonably determine the size of government bonds to maintain an appropriate magnitude of spending. 

It would firmly curb the increase in hidden local government debts and properly resolve the outstanding hidden debt issues, it said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased for an eighth straight month in December, pointing to solid growth in business spending on equipment in the fourth quarter and likely helping to underpin the economic recovery.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday was published ahead of the government's snapshot of fourth-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, expected to show a sharp slowdown in growth after a historic pace of expansion in the third quarter.
The anticipated loss of momentum will likely reflect a resurgence in COVID-19 cases and exhaustion of relief money from the government. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero and made no change to its monthly bond purchases, noting ""the recovery in economic activity and employment has moderated in recent months.""
""Business demand for new equipment is booming but Fed officials know that until companies start to rehire workers, the economic recovery will be incomplete,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.6% last month. These so-called core capital goods orders advanced 1.0% in November. Last month's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
Core capital goods orders surged 1.8% year-on-year in December. Demand has shifted away from services like travel and hospitality towards goods like motor vehicles, electronics and medical equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. That has contributed to boosting production at factories, though output remains about 2.6% below its pre-pandemic level.
(Graphic: Core capital goods: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jbyprnbaxpe/capgds.png)
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, is also being supported by businesses rebuilding depleted inventories. In December, core capital goods orders were lifted by demand for machinery and primary and fabricated metal products. But orders for computers and electronic products fell while bookings for electrical equipment, appliances and components barely rose.
U.S. stocks trimmed losses after the Fed's interest rate decision. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
SHIPMENTS RISE
Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.5% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's GDP measurement. They gained 0.5% in November. Unfilled orders of core capital goods increased 0.7%, matching November's gain.
Strong business spending on equipment likely helped to partially offset an anticipated slowdown in consumer spending last quarter. According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP likely increased at a 4.0% annualized rate last quarter after surging at a record 33.4% pace in the July-September period.
""Factory activity saw a quicker-than-expected recovery and should remain well supported in the near-term as businesses restock inventories and consumers continue to spend on consumer goods,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
It will likely remain supported by nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus provided by the government at the end of December, which is seen jolting consumer spending in January after it slowed in the last two months. President Joe Biden has unveiled a recovery plan worth $1.9 trillion, though there is resistance from some lawmakers. 
The economy contracted at a 31.4% rate in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
Business investment on equipment rebounded strongly in the third quarter after five straight quarterly declines. Regional manufacturing surveys have suggested that the strength in business investment could be sustained in the near term. 
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, gained 0.2% in December after rising 1.2% in November. Durable goods orders were restrained by a 1.0% decline in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 1.9% increase in November. 
(Graphic: Durable goods: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/rlgpdgqbqvo/durgds.png)
Orders for civilian aircraft plunged 51.8%. This was despite Boeing (NYSE:BA) reporting on its website that it had received 90 aircraft orders in December, up from 27 in November. 
The government recently lifted a 20-month grounding of Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX jets that came after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Boeing on Wednesday reported a record annual loss because of the pandemic and 737 MAX safety crisis. 

Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 1.4% in December after accelerating 2.8% in November.

Profits surged 20.1% year-on-year in December to 707.11 billion yuan ($109.40 billion), after rising 15.5% in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Wednesday.
China is the only major economy in the world to avoid a contraction in 2020, with gross domestic product up 2.3% for the full year, while many countries remain crippled by the pandemic. 
Economists polled by Reuters expect China's GDP to rise 8.4% in 2021, the fastest pace in a decade. However, some analysts cautioned that a slower recovery in consumption and a potential rapid slowdown in credit growth could be risks for the Asian powerhouse.
China's factory gate prices fell last month at their slowest pace since February, pointing to improving corporate profitability.
For the full year of 2020, annual profits for China's industrial firms grew 4.1% year-on-year to 6.45 trillion yuan, recovering from a 3.3% on-year decline seen in 2019. It was also quicker than a 2.4% gain seen in January-November.
The profit gains last year were notably driven by the manufacturing sector, which saw margins increase by 7.6%, said Zhu Hong, a senior statistician at the statistics bureau, in a statement published alongside the data.
China's exports were surprisingly strong last year as factories raced to fill overseas orders amid a raging pandemic. 
Liabilities at industrial firms rose 6.1% year-on-year at end-December, versus 6.8% growth as of end-November and a 5.4% uptick as of end-2019.
Earnings at China's state-owned industrial firms were down 2.9% for 2020 year-on-year, compared with a 4.9% decline in January-November and 12.0% slump in 2019, the statistics bureau data showed. 
Private sector profits grew 3.1% in 2020, improving from January-November's 1.8% growth and stronger than 2019's 2.2% rise.

The consumer price index advanced 0.9% from the third quarter, underpinned by increases in tobacco excise, compared with economists’ estimates of a 0.7% gain, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Wednesday. Annual CPI also beat forecasts, similarly rising by 0.9% versus an estimated 0.7%.
“Since the June quarter fall of 0.3%, the increase in annual inflation largely reflects the unwinding of free child care and higher petrol prices,” said Michelle Marquardt, head of Prices Statistics at the ABS. “The rise in demand for new dwellings is reflected in higher building approvals for houses and a record value for housing loan commitments.”
Australian prices have been hit by cross-currents caused by fallout from Covid-19 and governments ending some support programs in favor of stimulus for areas like housing. The Reserve Bank of Australia has adjusted its inflation framework to allow the economy to run a little hotter. It doesn’t intend to tighten borrowing costs until inflation is sustainably within the 2-3% target.
Achieving that will require strong wage growth stemming from a tighter labor market, outcomes unlikely to be in the offing any time soon with the jobless rate at 6.6%.
Today’s report showed the quarterly trimmed-mean gauge of inflation matched estimates, rising 0.4%, and slightly exceeded them on an annual basis, advancing 1.2% versus a forecast 1.1%
The weighted-median gauge, another core measure, advanced 0.5% from the third quarter for an annual increase of 1.4%, compared with forecast increases of 0.4% and 1.2%, respectively.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“There is little sign of emerging inflation pressure, with such tension only witnessed in higher purchase costs for new dwellings and motor vehicles, and a stabilization in rents..”

Separate data released at the same time as inflation, showed business conditions -- measuring hiring, sales and profits -- surged in December to the highest level since 2018. The employment index surged, reflecting Australia’s strengthening labor market that has seen unemployment fall to 6.6% in December from a high of 7.5% in July. The economy entered the pandemic with a jobless rate of 5.1% in February 2020.
“The rise in the employment index is very encouraging,” said Alan Oster, chief economist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) Ltd. that runs the monthly business sentiment survey. “The gains have been seen across all states and notably, Victoria appears to have caught up with New South Wales and Queensland -- great news for the state that has suffered an extended lockdown.”
Yet, business confidence slid in the period amid a flareup in Covid outbreaks in Sydney and elsewhere.
More Detail
Today’s inflation report showed tradables prices, which are typically impacted by the currency and global factors, fell 0.4% in the fourth quarter from the previous three months. Non-tradables, which are largely affected by domestic variables like utilities and rents, advanced 1.5% due to the scheduled hike in the tobacco excise.
Other details in the report include:
The Reserve Bank of Australia meets for the first time this year on Tuesday and is expected to keep its cash rate and yield target to 0.10%. It is also set to maintain its A$100 billion ($77.4 billion) quantitative easing program.

The British Retail Consortium, a trade body, said on Wednesday that its members saw average prices fall by 2.2% in January compared with a year earlier, the largest such fall since the depths of Britain's first lockdown in May.
Food prices rose by 0.2%, the smallest increase since January 2017, and non-food prices dropped by 3.6%.
""Post-Christmas sales and the national lockdown drove non-food prices down – especially for clothing and DIY goods,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
Britain's official measure of consumer price inflation, which covers a wider range of goods and services, showed annual prices rises of 0.6% in December.
Dickinson said that as well as facing softer consumer demand, retailers were under pressure from higher costs which they may prove unable to absorb.
""Brexit-related red tape, rising global shipping costs and food commodity prices, as well as the weight of forced closures and restrictions for many retail businesses, means that pricing pressures are stacking up,"" she said.
New lockdown measures to combat a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths have added to a normal post-Christmas belt-tightening by British consumers.

Experimental data last week from the Office for National Statistics, which is not seasonally adjusted, showed a 35% fall in consumer spending in early January, and on Tuesday the Confederation of British Industry reported its weakest retail number since May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rose moderately in January while lingering concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic led to a further deterioration in households' perceptions of the labor market, raising the risk of a second straight month of job losses.
But the survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumers more than willing to buy homes and automobiles in the next six months, indicating that the housing market and manufacturing industry will continue to underpin the economy. 
""The slow rollout of the vaccines and the still-raging pandemic continue to depress consumer confidence despite the prospect of further fiscal aid and a brighter health situation,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index increased to a reading of 89.3 this month from 87.1 in December. The slight gain likely reflected nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief provided by the government at the end of December, which lifted consumers' near-term expectations.
The was no indication that the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by former President Donald Trump's supporters had impacted on confidence. The cut-off date for the survey was Jan. 14. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index little changed at 89 in January.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, fell to a reading of 84.4 from 87.2 in December. The expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions increased to 92.5 from a reading of 87.0 in December, suggesting households foresee conditions improving in the near term.
President Joe Biden has unveiled a $1.9 trillion recovery plan from the pandemic. The new Biden administration has pledged to speed up and simplify the distribution of vaccines. 
More than 25 million people have been infected by the virus, with the death toll over 420,000 since the pandemic started in the United States in early 2020. About 6% of the U.S. population has so far been vaccinated. Economists said though Biden's rescue plan was facing resistance from some lawmakers, that was unlikely to derail the recovery from the pandemic. 
""It is not likely we will see any household and business subsidy plan passed before March or April,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland Pennsylvania. ""That should be early enough to get us through the year, even if there are significant cuts to the subsidies.""
U.S. stocks were little changed. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.

LABOR MARKET STILL SHAKY
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, deteriorated to a reading of -3.2 this month from -1.9 in December. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report.
The economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months. 
""Jobs are harder to get or not as plentiful for a second month in a row and we will see if this means a second month of negative payroll jobs is in store for the markets in the report for January due out next Friday,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The share of consumers expecting an increase in income decreased to 14.4% from 15.7% last month. The proportion anticipating a drop declined to 14.2% from 14.6% in December.
More consumers expected to purchase homes and motor vehicles in the next six months. Though buying plans for major household appliances were little changed, more expected to purchase refrigerators and washing machines. 
The pandemic has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners mostly in the services industry. It has fueled a migration from city centers to suburbs and other lower-density areas as Americans seek more space for home offices and schooling. Record-low mortgage rates are also boosting the housing market.
But supply is failing to keep up, leading to a surge in house prices, which economists and realtors warn could put homeownership out of the reach of many first-time buyers. A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index jumped 9.1% from a year ago in November after rising 8.0% in October.
(Graphic: Case Shiller: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/bdwpkylxopm/caseshiller.png)
Robust house price inflation was corroborated by a third report showing the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) house price index surged a seasonally adjusted 11.0% year-on-year in November after increasing 10.3% in October.
The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).

""Demand for homes remains strong and with inventories at historic lows, home prices will likely continue to accelerate over coming months, until supply can catch up,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's unemployment rate hit its highest in nearly five years in the three months to November, when coronavirus cases began to rise for a second time and most of the country returned to a partial lockdown.
Redundancies touched a record high, taking the unemployment rate to 5.0%, its highest since mid-2016, according to official data, although the increase was slightly weaker than economists' forecasts.
There were some signs of a limited recovery in December, when lockdown measures eased, although a deterioration is likely in early 2021 as a tougher lockdown shut schools and closed most non-essential businesses to the public.
Tax data for December showed a 52,000 increase in the number of staff on company payrolls from November, but there were 828,000 fewer workers on payrolls than in February.
Economists said the data showed the jobs market was holding up better than many forecasters had feared.
Unemployment has been kept down by the government's Job Retention Scheme, which supported 2.4 million jobs as of Oct. 31, down from a peak of 8.9 million in May.
The programme is Britain's most expensive COVID-19 economic support measure, costing 46.4 billion pounds ($63 billion) up to mid-December, and is due to end on April 30.
""This crisis has gone on far longer than any of us hoped – and every job lost as a result is a tragedy,"" finance minister Sunak said after Tuesday's data. ""We're throwing everything we've got at supporting businesses, individuals and families.""
Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, urged Sunak to extend support for jobs in his March 3 budget. 
""The latest lockdown will have only added further pressure on firms with troubled balance sheets, which means more jobs are likely to be lost in the coming months,"" Parikh said.
The number of people in employment dropped 88,000 in the three months to the end of November, the smallest fall since the start of the pandemic and less than the 100,000 drop forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said this month that he believed the underlying jobless rate was higher, as the official definition excludes people without work who have temporarily postponed their job search due to the pandemic.
The data showed growth in wages rose by an annual 3.6%, the biggest increase in more than a year. 

But the ONS said the increase largely reflected how the brunt of job cuts and lost pay had fallen on workers in lower-paid sectors and on part-time workers. Underlying pay growth was less than 2%, it said.

Higher construction costs due to preparations for the Olympics and popularity of high-rise condominiums in formerly industrial waterfront areas helped drive the average apartment price up to 60.84 million yen ($586,410), the highest since 1990 when it reached a record 61.23 million yen.
The most expensive unit was a 690 million yen ($6.65 million) condominium in Daikanyama, the real estate data and consultancy firm said.
The number of sales fell 12.8% from a year earlier to 27,228 units, however, down around 70% from 1990 levels. 
Real estate website Suumo said in a report last week that low interest rates and tax breaks helped sustain property demand amid the coronavirus outbreak. 
Unlike people in other big cities such as New York which saw an exodus to the suburbs during the coronavirus pandemic, Tokyo residents appeared more interested in moving to new developments in central locations to reduce their commuting times, it said.

The Tokyo stock market's Nikkei 225 average rose around 16% last year.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economy grew at a faster-than-expected pace in the fourth quarter as it ended the coronavirus-stricken year solidly poised for a recovery in 2021 thanks to surging exports. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew a seasonally adjusted 1.1% in the December quarter from the third quarter, the Bank of Korea said on Tuesday, faster than the median estimate of 0.7% in a Reuters poll and following a 2.1% expansion in the September quarter.
That limited the contraction over the whole year to 1.0%, which is likely to be the smallest GDP slump among the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in the year of the pandemic that has killed more than 2 million worldwide. 
""Recovery momentum should gather pace from the second quarter onwards, led by strong export prospects as global growth and 5G deployment pick up speed,"" said Lloyd Chan, an economist at Oxford Economics.
""A vaccine rollout around February should also stimulate domestic demand, as it would reduce the need for stringent containment measures,"" he said.
South Korea's economy has had a sharp albeit uneven bounce since the second quarter when it suffered its steepest downturn in over a decade.
A recent Reuters poll of 27 economists forecast the economy to grow 3.0% this year, in line with the BOK's projections.
December exports rose 12.6% from a year earlier, the biggest expansion in 26 months.
Underlining the optimism, shares of Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) has surged about 50% in the fourth quarter alone as it reported a 26% jump in its fourth quarter profit.
But the number of jobs plunged at the sharpest rate in over two decades in December, while private consumption over the fourth quarter declined 1.7% in a sign the recovery is still fragile amid a third wave of the coronavirus now sweeping the country.
Construction investment rose 6.5% from a quarter earlier, marking the best performance since the fourth quarter of 2019. 
On a year-on-year basis, the economy shrank 1.4% in the fourth quarter, versus the 1.7% decline forecast in the poll. 
Last year, the government pledged fiscal stimulus of about 310 trillion won ($281.4 billion), while the BOK cut interest rates by 75 basis points to 0.5%.
Most analysts expect the BOK to retain its accommodative policy stance in 2021.

""BOK will keep emphasizing financial stability, but that does not mean any unwinding of easier monetary policy adopted after COVID-19,"" Lee Seung-hoon, an economist at Meritz Securities said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Some 8.8% of global working hours were lost last year due to the pandemic, roughly four times the number lost in the 2009 financial crisis, but there are ""tentative signs"" of recovery, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said on Monday.
The losses compared with the previous year were equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs and included an ""unprecedented"" 114 million workers joining the ranks of the unemployed and others whose working hours were reduced due to restrictions, it said.
""These massive losses resulted in an 8.3 per cent decline in global labour income (before support measures are included), equivalent to $3.7 trillion or 4.4 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP),"" the ILO, a U.N. agency, said in its seventh report on the crisis since March.
Guy Ryder, ILO director-general, told a news briefing: ""This has been the most severe crisis for the world of work since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Its impact is far greater than that of the global financial crisis of 2009.""
""I am pleased to say that there is some relatively good news in all of this, that we do see tentative signs of recovery - these signs are fragile, they are uncertain and the prospects are notably uneven,"" he said.
But it was ""particularly concerning"" that 71% of the job losses, or 81 million people, came in the form of inactivity, Ryder said. ""These people have simply dropped out of the labour market. Either they are unable to work, perhaps because of pandemic restrictions, or social obligations or they have given up looking for work,"" he added.
And more hours will be lost this year and possibly next.
""All scenarios project that working hour losses will continue, in other words the financial and social distress for millions of people will continue through 2021 and beyond that,"" Ryder said.
ILO data show that women and younger workers were most affected, while the hardest-hit sectors were accommodation, food services, retail and manufacturing, it said.
""There are some sectors - there are the financial sectors, the information technology sectors - which have actually continued to grow in the course of 2020,"" Ryder said.
Employment loss among 15-24 years old stood at 8.7% compared with 3.7% for adults and ""highlights the all too real risk of a lost generation"", it said. 

""While there is still a high degree of uncertainty, the latest projections for 2021 show that most countries will experience a relatively strong recovery in the second half of the year, as vaccination programmes take effect,"" the ILO said.

Companies signed up for $12.1 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, down from $12.9 billion a year earlier. Borrowings in December, however, rose 66% from the previous month.
ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said most equipment finance sector observers would consider a single-digit decline in year-over-year new business volume tolerable, given the optimism around new U.S. stimulus measures and COVID-19 vaccine distribution.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals rose to 75.2% in December from 70.4% in November.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States.

The report showed that consumers are slowly spending more as the economy reopens and more people gradually return to work, and offered a sign consumers are hopeful their financial situations will improve further as the coronavirus is contained. 
The share of households that made at least one large purchase in the last four months rose to 54.6% in December. That is up from a series low of 50.7% in April of 2020, but was still well below pre-pandemic level of 62.5% in December of 2019.
Consumers from all education and income groups were much more optimistic about how much they would be able to spend in a year, with the median household expecting spending to grow by 3% over the next year, up from 2.2% in August. 
Households reported in December that they expect spending on daily living expenses and other necessary bills to rise by a median of 4.1% over the next year, up from 3.5% in August and reaching a series high for the survey.
Consumers also said they expected spending on nonessential items such as hobbies, entertainment and travel, to rise by a median 1.6% over the next year, up from 1.0% in August and also reaching a high for the survey. 
If surprised with a 10% increase in income, consumers said they would allocated an average 36.3% to paying down debt, 44.5% would be saved or invested and 19.3% would be spent or donated. 

The household spending survey is conducted every four months as part of the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale slumped to a six-month low in January as a second wave of COVID-19 halted a recovery in Europe's largest economy, which will stagnate in the first quarter, the Ifo economic institute said on Monday.
Ifo said its business climate index fell to 90.1 from an upwardly revised reading of 92.2 in December. A Reuters poll had forecast a January reading of 91.8.
""The second Corona wave has temporarily ended the recovery of the German economy,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders agreed last week to extend a lockdown until mid-February as Germany, once seen as a role model for fighting the pandemic, struggles with a second wave of infections.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters the economy would stagnate in the first quarter of the year, adding: ""The German economy is starting the year with little confidence.""
The economy is likely to reach its pre-pandemic levels in mid-2022, according to a draft document prepared by the economy ministry and seen by Reuters on Monday.
In a telling sign of corporate nervousness, Ifo's expectations index fell to its lowest level since June, confounding expectations for a rise.
Unprecedented government rescue and stimulus measures helped lessen the shock of the pandemic in Germany last year, when the economy shrank by 5.0%, less than expected and a smaller contraction than during the global financial crisis.
But the renewed lockdown measures are suppressing economic activity and confidence. Ifo's index on current conditions fell to its lowest since September.
""Fear is back,"" wrote ING economist Carsten Brzeski. ""It will take more momentum in the vaccination schemes and a further reduction in the number of infections before the economy can take off again. It currently looks as if it will take at least until spring time before this will be the case.""
Highlighting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on German industry, carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Friday profit almost halved last year because of the pandemic, but a rebound in premium car sales in China and stronger deliveries in the fourth quarter helped keep it in the black.
The Federal Statistics Office will publish gross domestic product figures on Friday for the fourth quarter, when some lockdown measures had already been implemented. The statistics office said earlier this month growth probably stagnated in the fourth quarter.

The government expects the economy to grow by 3% this year, a government official told Reuters on Friday, a sharp downward revision from last autumn's estimate of 4.4% caused by November's imposition of a second coronavirus lockdown.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity surged to its highest level in nearly 14 years in early January, but bottlenecks in the supply chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are driving up prices and signaling a rise in inflation in the months ahead.
Other data on Friday showed an unexpected increase in sales of previously owned homes in December. Manufacturing and the housing market are helping to anchor the economy, which is being battered by a wave of coronavirus infections. But the pandemic is causing labor shortages at construction sites and factories, which could erode some of the strength in the manufacturing and housing sectors.
Data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI accelerated to a reading of 59.1 in the first half of this month, the highest since May 2007, from 57.1 in December.
Economists had forecast the index would slip to 56.5 in early January. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Manufacturing is being supported by businesses rebuilding inventories and a shift in demand towards goods from services because of the pandemic.
The IHS Markit survey's measure of new orders received by factories raced to its highest level since September 2014. The surge in demand reflected both existing and new customers, ""with some clients reportedly committing to orders previously placed on hold."" That led to manufacturers hiring more workers early this month. The survey's factory employment index increased to 54.8 from 52.2 in December.
But the pandemic is gumming up the supply chain, resulting in manufacturers paying more for materials, and they are passing on the higher production costs to consumers. The survey's gauge of prices received by factories vaulted to its highest level since July 2008.
This mirrored other manufacturing surveys, suggesting inflation could pick up and remain elevated beyond the anticipated boost from the drop of weak readings in March and April from the calculation.
The strength in manufacturing helped to lift business activity. The survey's flash composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to a reading of 58.0 early this month from 55.3 in December. While its flash services sector PMI increased to 57.5 from 54.8 in December, the pace of new business growth softened at the start of 2021.
The services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, has borne the brunt of the pandemic, with severe disruptions to restaurants, bars and other businesses that attract crowds. COVID-19 has infected more than 24 million people in the United States, with the death toll exceeding 400,000.
The survey's measure of services industry employment fell to a six-month low in early January.
U.S. stocks were trading lower while the dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

In a separate report on Friday, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales increased 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.76 million units last month. Economists had forecast sales would decrease 2.0% to a rate of 6.55 million units in December.
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, surged 22.2% on a year-on-year basis. They totaled 5.64 million in 2020, the most since 2006. Sales in December increased in the Northeast and South. They were unchanged in the Midwest and declined in the West.
Cheaper mortgages and an exodus from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as companies allow employees to work from home and schools shift to online classes because of COVID-19 are underpinning demand for housing. About 23.7% of the labor force is working from home. The pandemic has disproportionately impacted lower-wage earners.
But housing supply remains a challenge. While the government reported on Thursday that homebuilding and building permits surged in December to levels last seen in 2006, builders are complaining about higher lumber prices and persistent shortages of labor and land, and they said ""delayed delivery times had put upward pressure on home prices.""
In December, there were a record low 1.07 million previously owned homes on the market, down 16.4% from November and 23% from a year ago, leading to an acceleration in house price inflation. The median existing house price jumped 12.9% from a year ago to $309,800 in December. House prices increased 9% in 2020.
At December's sales pace, it would take a record low 1.9 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 2.3 months in November and 3.0 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

The IHS Markit flash January composite index of purchasing managers at manufacturers and service providers increased to 58, the second-highest since March 2015, from 55.3 a month earlier, the group reported Friday. Readings above 50 indicate growth.
The improvement stands in stark contrast to the euro area, where the composite gauge contracted for a third-straight month and pointed to a double-dip recession. In Japan, business activity shrank for a 12th month and at the fastest pace since September.
In the U.S., the group’s measure of manufacturing advanced 2 points to 59.1, the highest reading in data back to May 2007. Gauges of production, orders, export demand and employment all strengthened in January.
At the same time, pandemic-related challenges in the supply chain and shortages of some materials continue to drive up input prices. Producers are having some success passing those along to customers.
“Not only have the last two months seen supply shortages develop at a pace not previously seen in the survey’s history, but prices have also risen due to the imbalance of supply and demand,’’ Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. “Input cost inflation consequently also hit a survey high and exerted further upward pressure on average selling prices for goods and services.’’
The IHS Markit’s flash services PMI also improved in January, though new business softened as some states tightened commercial restrictions to combat a resurgent coronavirus. Employment growth was the slowest in six months.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers struggled to recover in December from a partial coronavirus lockdown the previous month, marking a weak end to their worst year on record, while public debt has climbed to its highest since 1962, official data showed on Friday.
The figures suggest Britain's economy had little momentum going into 2021. The government tightened COVID-19 lockdown rules on Jan. 5 to tackle a surge in cases that has kept Britain's death toll the highest in Europe.
A closely watched business survey released on Monday showed the measures contributed to the sharpest fall in economic activity since May, in addition to headwinds from new paperwork for exports to the European Union.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak faces pressure from some in his Conservative Party to show spending is under control when he presents a new budget on March 3, after what is on track to be the heaviest annual borrowing since World War Two.
Sunak has again promised to put the public finances on ""a more sustainable footing"" once the economy begins to recover, after Friday's data showed public borrowing since the start of the financial year in April reached a record 271 billion pounds ($370 billion).
Britain's Office for National Statistics said retail sales volumes rose 0.3% in December, far less than economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll for a 1.2% increase, leaving them just 2.9% higher than a year earlier.
For 2020 as a whole, retail sales were down 1.9%, the biggest calendar-year fall since these records began in 1996. Clothing sales slumped by more than a quarter and spending on fuel dropped by more than a fifth.
Sterling fell slightly against the dollar and the euro following the weaker-than-expected retail numbers.
""With no end in sight for retailers closed in lockdown, many will struggle to survive,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium trade body, calling for more government help for the sector.
Department store Debenhams is among well known names to have collapsed. Administrators said last week its flagship Oxford Street store in central London would close permanently due to the latest COVID restrictions.
RECORD BORROWING
Public sector borrowing for the month of December came in at 34.1 billion pounds, just above Reuters poll forecasts. Total public sector debt had reached 2.132 trillion pounds, equivalent to 99.4% of GDP, the most since 1962.
Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane said on Tuesday government borrowing on this scale was essential to stabilise the economy. He said he did not see a looming debt crisis, predicting interest rates would remain very low for a long time.
""This level of spending may be eye-wateringly large, but it is absolutely necessary,"" said Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation think tank.
December offered a partial respite for Britain's economy, which has seen sharper falls in its official measure of output than any other advanced country, as well as Europe's highest official death toll from COVID-19.
In November, the economy shrank 2.6%, due to a four-week lockdown in England and similar measures in other parts of Britain, although some restrictions had remained in place for retailers in December.
This month the government went further and shut schools as well as all non-essential retailers, which most economists think will lead to the economy contracting in the first quarter.
Flash purchasing managers index (PMI) data on Monday showed manufacturing growth slowed in early January, and services firms suffered a sharp fall in activity and reduced their workforce.
""The steepest loss of jobs was recorded in the hotels, restaurants, travel and leisure sectors, reflecting the new lockdown measures,"" survey publishers IHS Markit said.
Experimental data from the ONS on Thursday showed consumer spending in early January was 35% lower than before the pandemic began in February, although the figures were not seasonally adjusted to reflect the typical post-Christmas lull.
Retail sales have performed better than other areas of consumer spending, with shoppers switching to online stores, where spending surged by 46.1% in 2020.

Excluding the slump in fuel sales, retail sales grew in 2020, albeit by the lowest level since 2011, reflecting extra spending on groceries and household goods by people stuck at home.

LONDON (Reuters) - Economic activity in the euro zone shrank markedly in January as stringent lockdowns to contain the coronavirus pandemic hit the bloc's dominant service industry hard.
With hospitality and entertainment venues forced to remain closed across much of the continent, surveys on Friday highlighted sharp contractions in the services industry but also showed manufacturing remained strong as factories largely kept working.
IHS Markit's flash composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the euro zone, seen as a good guide to economic health, fell further below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction to 47.5 in January from December's 49.1. A Reuters poll had predicted a fall to 47.6.
""High infection rates are again forcing governments to extend and tighten containment measures,"" said Tomas Dvorak at Oxford Economics.
""The flash PMIs point to a looming contraction in euro zone GDP in Q1. We don't expect any meaningful economic recovery before the pandemic is brought under control.""
Still, a Reuters poll earlier this week showed the bloc's economy was expected to grow 0.6% this quarter and would return to its pre-COVID-19 level within two years on hopes the rollout of vaccines will allow a return to some form of normality. [ECILT/EU]
Activity in Germany's services sector shrank for a fourth month in a row as a hard lockdown shuttered most non-essential businesses in Europe's biggest economy. Despite slowing to a four-month low, manufacturing remained in expansion territory as exports kept German factories humming.
With hotels and restaurants closed, France's service sector bore the brunt of national coronavirus restrictions and overall activity there shrank more than expected.
In Britain, outside the European Union, a third national lockdown sparked the sharpest drop in business activity since May. A post Brexit shift to a more bureaucratic trading arrangement with the EU also contributed to the decline.
Global shares slipped off record highs as the gloomy data reminded investors of the struggles facing the economic recovery, taking the shine off a rally fuelled by hopes of U.S. stimulus by newly inaugurated President Joe Biden. [MKTS/GLOB]
HEADCOUNT, PRICES FALL
A PMI covering the euro zone's dominant service industry dropped to 45.0 from 46.4, exceeding expectations in a Reuters poll that had predicted a steeper fall to 44.5 and still a long way from historic lows at the start of the pandemic.
With activity still in decline and restrictions likely to be in place for some time yet, services firms were forced to chop their charges, with the output price index falling to its lowest reading since June.
That will be disappointing for policymakers at the European Central Bank - who on Thursday left policy unchanged - as uncomfortably low inflation has been a thorn in the ECB's side for years.
Factory activity remained strong and the manufacturing PMI held well above the breakeven level.
But despite strong demand factories again cut headcount, as they have every month since May 2019.
As immunisation programmes are being ramped up after a slow start in Europe survey respondents remained optimistic about the coming year.

""The outlook hinges on the pace of the so-far slow vaccine rollout; more delays will only postpone the recovery,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's relapse into a third national COVID-19 lockdown has sparked the sharpest drop in business activity since May, with services companies hit hardest, a survey showed on Friday.
A preliminary ""flash"" IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 40.6 in January, down from 50.4 in December.
The drop below the 50 threshold for growth was bigger than any economist forecast in a Reuters poll, which had pointed to a reading of 45.5.
In addition to the latest lockdown, data company IHS Markit said Britain's post-Brexit shift to a more bureaucratic trading arrangement with the European Union had contributed to the decline.
“Services have once again been especially hard hit, but manufacturing has seen growth almost stall, blamed on a cocktail of COVID-19 and Brexit, which has led to increasingly widespread supply delays, rising costs and falling exports,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.
The pace of job losses accelerated, after easing in December.
Economists polled by Reuters last week forecast a 1.4% fall in output for the first quarter. [ECILT/GB]
The official death toll from COVID-19 in the United Kingdom is nearing 100,000 and is currently the highest in Europe and the fifth worst in the world after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico.
Britain is rolling out vaccines faster than many of its peers, which should bode for a swift economic rebound later this year.
Thursday's survey showed companies were upbeat about their business prospects for the year ahead, with optimism hitting a 6-1/2-year high.
The PMI for the services industry, which accounts for the vast bulk of Britain's private sector economy, fell to 38.8 in January from 49.4 in December, its lowest level since May and marking a third month of contraction.
Factories fared much better, despite fading growth in output and a renewed decline in order books. The manufacturing PMI fell to 52.9 in January from 57.5 in December, remaining above the 50 dividing line for growth.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices slumped in December at the fastest annual pace in a decade, a sign of intensifying deflationary pressures that sharpen the case for the central bank to come up with better ways to combat the deepening impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Friday's weak data underscores the challenges policymakers face in preventing the spread of the virus without adding to the strain on an economy already suffering from a renewed state of emergency rolled out this month.
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil but excludes fresh food costs, fell 1.0% in December from a year earlier, government data showed, slightly less than a median market forecast for a 1.1% drop.
It was the biggest annual fall since September 2010, when Japan was grappling with grinding deflation and a spike in the yen that dealt a severe blow to the export-reliant economy.
""Consumption is slowing quite sharply so retailers can't raise prices. Japan is certainly facing deflationary pressures,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
Analysts, however, are split on whether Japan was heading back towards the two-decade long deflation it endured until 2013, when many companies competed for demand with big discounts.
""I don't think Japan is reverting to deflation as a trend, as price falls aren't necessarily broad-based,"" Tsunoda added.
Still, new state of emergency measures could cripple services spending and prod more firms to cut prices. That, in turn, could stoke public perceptions prices will keep falling - a risk the BOJ flagged on Thursday.
""I don't think the risk of Japan sliding back into deflation is high,"" BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters on Thursday. ""But potential growth may be falling so we need to look at the impact (on prices) carefully.""
The weak price data could affect the BOJ's debate when it examines its framework in March as it aims to make its policy tools more ""sustainable and effective"", some analysts say.
Mounting deflationary pressures would heighten the need for the BOJ to come up with ways to ensure its massive stimulus programme can endure the battle towards achieving its 2% inflation target, prolonged by COVID-19.
Some analysts expect consumer prices to recover over the short-term.
Slumping fuel costs and a government campaign offering discounts for domestic travel were mainly behind the drop in CPI, the data showed. Of the total 523 components of the core index, 242 saw prices rise while those for 220 items fell.
When stripping away the effect of fresh food, energy and the impact of the government's travel discount campaign, consumer prices rose 0.1% in December, government estimates showed.
""While headline inflation dropped to an 11-year low in November, that was due to weaker energy and fresh food inflation. We expect inflation to recover over the coming months,"" said Tom Learmouth, an economist at Capital Economics.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits decreased modestly last week as the COVID-19 pandemic tears through the nation, raising the risk that the economy shed jobs for a second straight month in January.
Despite the labor market woes, the economy remains anchored by strong manufacturing and housing sectors. Other data on Thursday showed homebuilding and permits for future residential construction surged in December to levels last seen in 2006. Factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated this month, with manufacturers reporting a boom in new orders.
The services sector has borne the brunt of the coronavirus crisis, disproportionately impacting lower-wage earners, who tend to be women and minorities. Addressing the so-called K-shaped recovery, where better-paid workers are doing well while lower-paid workers are losing out, is one of the key challenges confronting President Joe Biden and his new administration.
White House economic advisor Brian Deese said the fragile labor market underscored the urgency for U.S. Congress to act quickly on Biden's $1.9 trillion relief plan to ""get this virus under control, stabilize the economy, and reduce the long-term scarring that will only worsen if bold action isn't taken.""Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 900,000 for the week ended Jan. 16, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 910,000 applications in the latest week. 
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs 1.4 million people filed claims last week.
Out-of-control coronavirus infections are disrupting operations at businesses like restaurants, gyms and other establishments where crowds tend to gather, reducing hours for many workers and pushing others out of employment. 
Consumers are also hunkering down at home, hurting demand. COVID-19 has infected more than 24 million people, with the death toll exceeding 400,000 since the pandemic started in the United States.
U.S. stocks hovered near record highs. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower. 
Some of the elevation in claims reflects people re-applying for benefits following the government's recent renewal of a $300 unemployment supplement until March 14 as part of the nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus. Programs for the self-employed, gig workers as well as those who have exhausted their benefits were also extended.
(GRAPHIC: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xklvylqbrpg/joblessclaims.png) 
JOB LOSSES IN JANUARY?
The claims data covered the week during which the government surveyed establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of January's employment report. Claims were slightly higher between the December and January survey period.
""Another negative print for payrolls in January remains within the realm of possibility,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The economy shed 140,000 jobs in December, the first job losses since April when authorities throughout the country enforced stay-at-home measures to slow the spread of the virus. Retail sales fell for a third straight month in December.
Though jobless claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March, they remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession.
The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 127,000 to 5.054 million during the week ending Jan. 9. 
About 16 million people were on unemployment benefits under all programs at the start of the year. The decrease from 18.4 million at the end of 2020 reflected the temporary expiration of government-funded benefits. The economy has recovered 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April. 
But housing and manufacturing are bucking the labor market distress. In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said housing starts jumped 5.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.669 million units in December, the highest level since September 2006. 
Building permits for future homebuilding, which typically lead starts by one to two months, accelerated 4.5% to a rate of 1.709 million units in December, the highest since August 2006. Surging lumber prices and labor and land shortages could, however, slow the housing market momentum.
""Rising material prices, including lumber, are beginning to weigh on builder confidence and reduce housing affordability,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
(GRAPHIC: Housing starts - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xlbpgyjzmpq/hsbp.png) 
A third report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed its business conditions index soared to a reading of 26.5 this month from 9.1 in December. A measure of new orders at factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, vaulted to a reading of 30.0 from 1.9 in December. Manufacturing is being boosted by businesses rebuilding inventories.
(GRAPHIC: Philly Fed - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jbyprnmeepe/phillyfed.png) 
Factory employment measures also improved. While manufacturers reported paying more for raw materials, they were also able to increase prices for their goods. This mirrored other manufacturing surveys, suggesting inflation could pick up and remain elevated for a while this year. Manufacturers were upbeat about capital investment plans in the six months ahead.

""Inflation is likely moving up and should continue to do so, albeit slowly,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.

131,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 09:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding and permits surged in December as historically low mortgage rates supported the housing market, but momentum could slow amid surging lumber prices and a shortage of labor.
Housing starts jumped 5.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.669 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would rise to a rate of 1.560 million units in December. Homebuilding increased 5.2% on a year-on-year basis. Starts totaled 1.380 million in 2020, up 7.0% from 2019.
Permits for future homebuilding accelerated 4.5% to a rate of 1.709 million units in December. Permits, which typically lead starts by one to two months, totaled 1.452 million last year, a 4.8% increase from 2019.
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, soared 12.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.338 million units. Single-family starts have increased for eight straight months.
Though the housing market and manufacturing remain the economy's stars performers, the relentless COVID-19 pandemic is hurting the availability of labor at construction sites as sick workers stay at home.
A survey on Wednesday showed a dip in confidence among single-family homebuilders in January. Builders complained about ""supply-side constraints related to lumber and other material costs, a lack of affordable lots and labor shortages that delay delivery times and put upward pressure on home prices.""
Softwood lumber prices surged 52.2% on a year-on-year basis in December, according to data from the Labor Department.
The housing market is being underpinned by cheaper mortgages and an exodus from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as companies allow employees to work from home and schools shift to online classes because of the pandemic. About 23.7% of the labor force is working from home. Lower-wage earners in the services sector have borne the brunt of the coronavirus crisis.
Single-family building permits raced 7.8% to a rate of 1.226 million units in December. Homebuilding is being supported by lean inventories, especially for previously owned homes.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.79%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Starts for the volatile multi-family segment tumbled 13.6% to a pace of 331,000 units. Building permits for multi-family housing projects fell 3.0% to a pace of 483,000 units.
Rising rental vacancy rates are a challenge for the multi-family housing market. The pandemic has also seen renters moving away from city centers to suburban apartments in search of a more outdoor lifestyle.

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturers' concerns about shortages of low-wage workers and supplies have risen the most in almost 50 years, a survey showed on Thursday, as they wrestle with COVID-19 disruptions and new customs rules after leaving the European Union.
A measure of how manufacturers feel about their competitiveness relative to EU rivals deteriorated at the fastest pace on record, meanwhile, and companies expected output and orders to decline, the Confederation of British Industry said of its survey results.
""Manufacturers across the board are continuing to battle major headwinds,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
A monthly index of new orders for January dropped to -38 from -25 in December, and a quarterly measure of optimism sank to -22 from zero in October.
However, export orders bucked the broader trend, with this balance rising to its least negative since March, though it was still below its long-run average.
""(This) suggests that EU firms are not hesitating to source goods from the UK, despite the extra red tape and rise in haulage costs,"" Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
The survey adds to signs that Britain's economy will contract in early 2021, hit by a surge in coronavirus cases and restrictions, and new bureaucracy for trade with the EU. 
Manufacturing accounts for about 10% of Britain's economy.
The much bigger services sector has been hit far harder by social-distancing measures and is also facing new barriers to trade with the EU.
Separately, a new experimental measure of consumer spending indicated that credit and debit card spending in early January slumped to 35% below its level last February, before the pandemic.
The figures - published by the Office for National Statistics using Bank of England data - are not seasonally adjusted, so part of the fall probably reflects a normal drop in spending after Christmas, on top of the impact of new COVID restrictions which closed non-essential retailers this month.
The CBI figures showed many manufacturers reported a rush to build up stocks and complete EU orders in December, before the new customs rules took effect on Jan. 1.
British goods are not subject to tariffs or quotas as they enter the EU, but do face significant new paperwork, adding to costs and delays.
Concern about shortages of materials and components rose by the most since January 1975, which the CBI linked to COVID disruption to international trade and Brexit-linked customs delays.

Concerns about a lack of unskilled workers rose by the most since April 1974. New immigration rules since Jan. 1 limit employers' ability to hire low-paid workers from the EU, at a time when COVID has led to increased staff absence.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to 900,000 from 926,000 the week before – a figure that itself was revised downward from an initial estimate of 965,000.
Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-month lag, also fell to 5.054 million, from a downwardly-revised 5.181 million. That confounded expectations for an increase to around 5.4 million."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports rose for the first time in two years in December, driven by shipments to China, government data showed, offering a glimmer of hope for policymakers counting on an export-led recovery amid a resurgence of the coronavirus.
A recovery in exports may ease the risk of a double-dip recession, while the Bank of Japan is seen upgrading its growth forecast for next fiscal year at its rate review ending Thursday. The central bank is expected to stand pat on policy.
Still, the pace of recovery in Japan's shipments paled in comparison with neighbouring export hubs such as China, Taiwan and South Korea, all of which saw a double-digit growth led by global demand for chip and tech products.
The Ministry of Finance data out on Thursday showed Japan's exports rose 2.0% in December from a year earlier, slightly below a 2.4% increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll but up from a 4.2% decline in the previous month.
It marked the first annual increase since November 2018.
In a worrying sign, however, car exports fell 4.2% in the year to December, with shipments to the European Union plunging 32.2%. The fall comes as carmakers like  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd are set to cut vehicle production this month due to a shortage of semiconductors as demand rebounds from the coronavirus crisis.
For the full year 2020, Japan's car exports fell 20% -- the biggest decline since shipments more than halved during the 2009 global financial crisis -- making it the main culprit behind overall yearly export decline of 11.1%, the data showed.
""Exports are stalling due to restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus infections in Europe and America,"" said Yutaro Suzuki, economist at Daiwa Institute of Research. ""A supply crunch among automakers caused by a shortage of chips could weigh on exports.""
By region, exports to China -- Japan's largest trading partner -- grew 10.2% in the year to December, led by shipments of plastic, nonferrous metals and other raw materials.
Shipments to the United States -- a key market for Japanese goods such as cars and electronics -- dropped 0.7% year-on-year in December, dragged down by airplanes and chip-making equipment.
Exports to Asia, which accounts for more than half of Japanese shipments, advanced 6.1%, while shipments to the European Union decline 1.6%. 
Imports fell 11.6% in the year to December, roughly in line with the median estimate, bringing a trade surplus of 751 billion yen ($7.25 billion).

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate slowed to 0.7% in December from 1.0% the previous month amid a new round of COVID-19 lockdowns and declining costs of airplane tickets, clothing and footwear, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.
Headline inflation was below analyst expectations for inflation to remain at November's 1.0% rate. Consumer prices fell 0.2% on the month, as did the cost of food.
""It's an unexpected slowdown in inflation,"" said Royce Mendes, a senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets. ""Looking at the details, I don't think it much changes the thinking at the Bank of Canada.""
The Bank of Canada left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.25% on Wednesday and reiterated it did not expect inflation to return sustainably to its 2% target until 2023.
However, the central bank said COVID-19 vaccines had helped brighten the outlook.
""The arrival of effective vaccines combined with further fiscal and monetary policy support have boosted the medium-term outlook for growth,"" the bank said.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.8% higher at 1.2635 to the greenback, or 79.15 U.S. cents, after the rate announcement.
Two of the three core measures of inflation fell in December. The common measure, which the Bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was unchanged at 1.8%.
Both Ontario and Quebec, Canada's most populous provinces, imposed tighter health restrictions in December as the novel coronavirus spread.
Canada reported 4,679 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, and has seen more than 18,000 total deaths since the start of the pandemic.
""It should be expected there would be slack in the economy given the persistent shutdowns related to COVID,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities. ""It's nonetheless... a touch more concerning to see the move in the core measures than it is in the headline measures.""

The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index slipped to a reading of 83 this month from 86. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index would be unchanged at 86. A reading above 50 means more builders view market conditions as favorable than poor. The index hit an all-time high of 90 in November.
""Despite robust housing demand and low mortgage rates, buyers are facing a dearth of new homes on the market, which is exacerbating affordability problems,"" said NAHB chairman Chuck Fowke. ""Builders are grappling with supply-side constraints related to lumber and other material costs, a lack of affordable lots and labor shortages that delay delivery times and put upward pressure on home prices.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation gathered speed in December, starting what is expected to be a climb this year as pandemic-fighting measures, Brexit and a recovery in the economy combine to push up costs for consumers and businesses.
Consumer prices rose 0.6% in annual terms after a 0.3% increase in November, the Office for National Statistics said.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a rate of 0.5%.
A temporary easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions helped to push up air and sea fares while a rise in global oil prices made fuel more expensive and the price of clothes also rose.
Inflation has been below the Bank of England's 2% target since mid-2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic pushed it close to zero as the economy tanked.
But it is likely to rise as the impact of value-added tax cuts and other emergency pandemic measures fade from the statistical comparisons, and because of Britain's new, less open trading relationship with the European Union.
""We are going to be talking a lot more about inflation in 2021 than we did 2020,"" said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, an economist at foreign exchange company Equals Group. ""Both Brexit and COVID-19 are factors that have caused substantial pain for businesses and their supply chains.""
A Reuters poll of economists published last week showed inflation is likely to rise to close to the BoE's 2% target by the end of this year, and some like Capital Economics think it will peak at 2.5%. [ECILT/GB]
But economists see little pressure on the BoE to start raising interest rates from their all-time low any time soon with Britain's economy still about 10% smaller than before the pandemic.
Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said a rise in unemployment after the end of the government's job protection scheme - scheduled for April - was likely to keep a lid on domestic inflation pressures.
""The (BoE) will not need to even talk about the prospect of interest rates rising in future within the next two years,"" Tombs said.
The ONS said air and sea fare prices rose last month, making transport services the biggest contributor to the increase in inflation during December. 
Prices at petrol pumps rose by 1.5 pence per litre.
Clothing and footwear prices - which rose last month, unlike in December 2019 - also contributed to higher inflation.

The ONS said factory gate prices fell last month by the least in annual terms since March, down 0.4%, and the measure for core output prices rose by the most since September 2019, up 1.2%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Business volumes in UK financial services grew for the first time in two years during the final quarter of 2020 when firms shed staff and remote working in the pandemic spurred reviews of office space, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The latest Financial Services Survey published by employers' body CBI and compiled by consultants PwC, was completed before a third lockdown was introduced in England from January.
""Unfortunately, the health and economic picture has sadly deteriorated since with restrictions tightening again,"" said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI.
A trade deal with the European Union came into effect on Jan. 1 but does not cover financial services, which is being handled separately by Brussels under its ""equivalence"" system.
The EU was the City of London's biggest customer.
""Meanwhile, work must continue on using existing pathways with the UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement to reach better outcomes for the financial services, particularly on equivalence,"" Newton-Smith said.

The figure compared with 6.3% in the September-November period and was the highest since the last quarter of 2004 when unemployment hit 6.6%.
The underemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.4% in the two three-month rolling periods. The number of unemployed rose by about 1,500 people to 245,800 in the three months ended in December.
Labour Secretary Law Chi-kwong said the labour market deteriorated due to the fourth wave of the pandemic that started in the latter part of November.
""As the fourth wave of local epidemic continues to weigh on local consumption sentiment and disrupt economic activities, the labour market will remain under notable pressure in the near term,"" he said, adding the government has rolled out measures to provide further support to the hard-hit sectors.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy picked up speed in the fourth quarter, with growth beating expectations as it ended a rough coronavirus-striken 2020 in remarkably good shape and remained poised to expand further this year even as the global pandemic rages unabated.
Gross domestic product grew 2.3% in 2020, official data showed on Monday, making China the only major economy in the world to avoid a contraction last year as many nations struggled to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. And China is expected to continue to power ahead of its peers this year, with GDP set to expand at the fastest pace in a decade at 8.4%, according to a Reuters poll.
The world's second-largest economy has surprised many with the speed of its recovery from the coronavirus jolt, especially as policymakers have also had to navigate tense U.S.-China relations on trade and other fronts.
Beijing's strict virus curbs enabled it to largely contain the COVID-19 outbreak much quicker than most countries, while government-led policy stimulus and local manufacturers stepping up production to supply goods to many countries crippled by the pandemic have also helped fire up momentum.
GDP expanded 6.5% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, quicker than the 6.1% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, and followed the third quarter's solid 4.9% growth.
""The higher-than-expected GDP number indicates that growth has stepped into the expansionary zone, although some sectors remain in recovery,"" said Xing Zhaopeng, economist at ANZ in Shanghai.
""Policy exiting will pose counter-cyclical pressures on 2021 growth.""
Backed by the strict virus containment measures and policy stimulus, the economy has recovered steadily from a steep 6.8% slump in the first three months of 2020, when an outbreak of COVID-19 in the central city of Wuhan turned into a full-blown epidemic.
EXPORTS ENGINE REVS UP
Asia's economic powerhouse has been fuelled by a surprisingly resilient export sector, but China's consumption - a key driver of growth - has lagged expectations amid fears of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases.
Data last week showed Chinese exports grew by more than expected in December, as coronavirus disruptions around the world fuelled demand for Chinese goods even as a stronger yuan made exports more expensive for overseas buyers.
Yet, underscoring the massive COVID-19 impact worldwide, China's 2020 GDP growth marked its weakest pace since 1976, the final year of the decade-long Cultural Revolution that wrecked the economy.
Overall, the slew of brightening economic data has reduced the need for more monetary easing this year, leading the central bank to scale back some policy support, sources told Reuters, but there would be no abrupt shift in policy direction, according to top policymakers.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP rose 2.6% in October-December, the bureau said, compared with expectations for a 3.2% rise and an upwardly revised 3.0 gain in the previous quarter.
Highlighting the weakness in consumption, retail sales fell 3.9% last year, marking the first contraction since 1968, records from NBS showed. Growth in retail sales in December missed analyst forecasts and eased to 4.6% from November's 5.0%, as sales of garments, cosmetics, telecoms and autos slowed.
However, China's vast manufacturing sector continued to gain momentum, with industrial output rising at a faster-than-expected rate of 7.3% last month from a year ago, hitting the highest since March 2019.
LINGERING RISKS IN 2021
Ning Jizhe, head of China's statistics bureau, told a briefing that there would be many favourable conditions to sustain China's economic recovery in 2021, citing the country's large market and resilient supply chains.
This year marks the start of China's 14th five-year plan, which policymakers see as vital for steering the economy past the so-called ""middle income trap"".
China still faces many challenges, not least the tensions between Beijing and Washington and how they would play out under the new U.S. administration led by President-elect Joe Biden. As well, rising labour costs, the aging population, and a recent spike in credit defaults add to risks for an economy that is still trying to reduce a mountain of debt.
""We should be alert to the following problems in 2021: first the imbalance of economic recovery. Compared with investment and export, consumption is weak as a whole and has yet to return to normal levels,"" said Wang Jun, Beijing-based chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank.
The second problem, Wang said, is a possible rapid slowdown in credit growth.
The central bank is poised to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged in coming months while steering a steady slowdown in credit expansion in 2021, policy sources have said.
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think tank, sees the macro leverage ratio jumping by about 30 percentage points in 2020 to over 270%.
While this year's predicted growth rate of over 8% would be the strongest in a decade, led by an expected double-digit expansion in the first quarter, it is rendered less impressive coming off the low base set in pandemic-stricken 2020.
Some analysts also cautioned that a recent rebound in COVID-19 cases in the northeast of the country could impact activity and consumption in the run-up to next month's long Lunar New Year holidays.
""Control of people-flows has started, so the risk of a widespread outbreak of Covid should be small,"" said Iris Pang, ING's chief China economist.

""But the risk of a technology war between China and some economies remains if the U.S. does not remove some measures.""

Investing.com – The Chinese economy reported growth in 2020, as it controlled the COVID-19 outbreak in the country and positioned itself as the only major country to report economic growth.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics released earlier in the day showed that industrial production grew 7.3% year-on-year in December, above the 6.9% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com, and the 7% growth seen in November, according to data released earlier in the day.
The data also showed that GDP rose 6.5% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, above the forecast 6.1% growth and the 4.9% growth in the third quarter. However, the GDP grew 2.6% quarter-on-quarter, below the forecast 3.2% and the 2.7% growth seen during the previous quarter.
Fiscal and monetary stimulus from the government that boosted investment in infrastructure and real estate powered early recovery. Chinese exports such as medical equipment and work-from-home devices also saw strong overseas demand as the COVID-19 outbreak was brought under control and factories resumed production. This demand is expected to remain strong, with lockdowns and restrictive measures still in place in many countries.
Some investors struck an optimistic note.
“The quarter really seems to have shown the economy ended the year on a strong note, manufacturing is doing well,” CCB International Holdings Ltd. head of macro research Cui Li told Bloomberg.
Economists widely expect China’s GDP to expand 8.2% in 2021, continuing to outpace global peers, even as other large economies begin their recoveries as COVID-19 vaccinations are rolled out.
However, China has recently seen cooler-than-expected weather and a resurgent outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the northeastern part of the country. The National Health Commission reported 109 new COVID-19 cases for Jan. 17.
“The Chinese economy accelerated to a strong finish to 2020, though challenges at the start of 2021 could put a damper on growth,” Bloomberg chief Asia economist Chang Shu said."
142,"<span>Jan 17, 2021 09:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy grew 2.3% last year, as the successful control of Covid-19 positioned it as the only major country to avoid an economic contraction.
That expansion was boosted by 6.5% growth in the final quarter of 2020 from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said Monday, marking a return to pre-pandemic growth rates. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted 6.2% growth for the quarter and 2.1% for the full year.
The recovery was aided early on by fiscal and monetary stimulus that boosted investment in infrastructure and real estate. Once China had virus cases under control and factories were able to resume production, growth was fueled by strong overseas consumer demand for Chinese exports, especially medical equipment and work-from-home devices.
Emerging from the pandemic larger than when it started is a capstone to a dramatic year for the world’s second-largest economy, which began 2020 with a historic first-quarter slump when the coronavirus lockdowns brought most activity to a halt.
With global output likely contracting 4.2% last year, China’s gains mean it increased its share of the world economy to 14.5%, according to World Bank estimates, compared with 22% for the U.S. Based on projections from the International Monetary Fund, China will now overtake the U.S. by 2028, two years earlier than previously predicted, according to  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc.
Economists expect China’s GDP will expand 8.2% this year, continuing to outpace global peers, even as other large economies begin to recover with vaccines being rolled out.
The ongoing recovery in 2021 will depend on whether China can prevent a large-scale spread of virus infections, and on whether it can pass the baton of spending from local governments and large state companies to smaller businesses and consumers. Household spending and investment by manufacturing companies has lagged overall growth in 2020.
An increasingly tense trade relationship with the U.S. could also weigh on the outlook. In his final weeks in office, President Donald Trump has tightened restrictions on Chinese businesses to curb the nation’s dominance in high-tech industries, roiling financial markets. It’s still unclear how the incoming administration under Joe Biden will navigate those issues.
Global demand for Chinese-made goods is expected to remain strong as the pandemic continues to keep large parts of the world’s population locked down. Already the top exporter, the value of China’s goods shipments increased 3.6% in 2020, according to official data. Imports declined 1.1%, resulting in a $535 billion annual trade surplus, the highest since 2015.
The fiscal and monetary stimulus to support the economy through the pandemic has been accompanied by a surge in debt, a development that authorities are now seeking to address as the recovery takes hold. At a December meeting to lay out economic goals for 2021, the ruling Communist Party signaled that stimulus would be gradually withdrawn, although it would avoid any “sharp turns” in policy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sentiment among Japanese manufacturers stabilised in January to the least pessimistic in more than a year from the impact of COVID-19, but service firms grew gloomier just as new lockdowns hit most of the population, the Reuters Tankan poll found. 
Manufacturers in the world's third-biggest economy were the least pessimistic since July 2019, though the outlook, especially for services, is clouded by a pandemic state of emergency covering Tokyo and other population centres through Feb. 7.
Driving the improvement for manufacturers were upbeat views in the chemical, metal products and electric machinery sub-sectors, according to the monthly Reuters poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched tankan quarterly survey.
""The car market is rapidly recovering, especially in China, and demand for electronic parts is growing,"" a manager at a electric machinery maker wrote in the survey of 482 large and midsize nonfinancial firms, in which 253 responded anonymously.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers rose to minus 1 from minus 9 in the previous month, while the service-sector index fell to minus 11 from minus 4 in December, according to the Dec. 24-Jan. 13 survey.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are derived by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means pessimists outnumber optimists.
A manager at a chemical producer said business has been recovering since September in line with a recovery in broader market conditions.
Japan's economy surged an annualised 22.9% in the third quarter, rebounding from its deepest postwar slump in the July-September period when the pandemic crushed economic activity.
The government had already committed to spending $3 trillion to bolster the economy before Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga this month announced a second state of emergency, which now covers Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and other areas accounting for 55% of Japan's population.
The Tankan survey showed overall sentiment for the manufacturing sector was poised to fall again, with business confidence expected to edge down to minus 2 in April, despite an expected increase in the mood among chemical firms.
Sentiment in the service industry was forecast to improve slightly to minus 9, with companies highlighting the COVID-19 resurgence as a major headwind.
""Customer numbers have declined significantly in line with the spread of coronavirus infections,"" said a manager at a retailer.

Official data showed 547,000 job vacancies in Britain in the three months to November, down almost a third on a year earlier.
For now, it is unclear how many remote roles will return to being office-based once the pandemic is over.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment dipped in early January as Americans reacted to the assault on the U.S. Capitol and a relentless surge in COVID-19 infections and deaths, the University of Michigan said on Friday in a report that also showed a deep partisan divide in views on the economy and outlook.
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index dropped to 79.2 early this month from a final reading of 80.7 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would be little changed at 80.
""Consumer sentiment posted trivial declines in early January despite the horrendous rise in COVID-19 deaths, the insurrection, and the impeachment of Trump,"" University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers Chief Economist Richard Curtin said in a statement.
(GRAPHIC: Shifting tides of consumer sentiment by party - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/SENTIMENT/bdwpkydorpm/chart.png)
The survey period covered the earliest days in January, including Jan. 6, when thousands of angry supporters of Donald Trump stormed the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying Democrat Joe Biden's victory over the Republican president in the Nov. 3, 2020, election. Trump, who leaves office on Jan. 20, has subsequently been impeached for inciting the crowd to violence.
The report revealed a chasm in economic sentiment between Republicans and Democrats.
Even as the survey's overall reading of sentiment dipped modestly, it plummeted to a six-and-a-half-year low among Republicans while surging to a four-year high among Democrats.
(GRAPHIC: Expectations have swung after both recent elections - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/SENTIMENT/dgkplkxmxvb/chart.png)
In both cases, the swings were driven by each group's perceptions of the economic outlook, darkening among Republicans to pre-Trump administration levels and brightening among Democrats to levels registered in the final months of Barack Obama's presidency.
The magnitude of the swing in expectations by party affiliation in the last six months of 2016 and 2020 were nearly identical at around 74 points, Curtin noted.
""The Trump and Biden partisan gaps in expectations are too extreme to be justified by economic fundamentals,"" Curtin said. ""Rather, the partisan gaps are rooted in sharply different policy preferences, with one side favoring economic growth and efficiency, and the other side giving top priority to greater equity and fairness in the distribution of income and wealth.""
On COVID-19, the survey found some optimism around the nascent rollout of vaccines as helping limit the decline in overall sentiment. ""Importantly, COVID's threats to physical and mental health were seen in January as more important than its financial repercussions.""

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said the trade surplus of the 19 countries sharing the euro with the rest of the world was 25.8 billion euros in November, up from 20.2 billion a year earlier.
Though both exports and imports fell year-on-year, imports declined 4.2% while exports only 1.0%, Eurostat said.
The biggest changes in the trade balance in the January-November period were with energy exporter Russia, where the European Union's trade deficit narrowed to 13.8 billion euros from 52.1 billion in the same period of 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales fell for a third straight month in December as renewed measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 triggered job losses, further evidence that the wounded economy lost considerable speed at the end of 2020.
The downturn in sales reported by the Commerce Department on Friday is, however, unlikely to push the economy back into recession, with other data showing production at factories accelerating last month. There is also cautious optimism that nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief provided by the government at the end of December will offer a backstop.
The ebbing economic momentum, which appears to have spilled over into the new year, could persuade the U.S. Congress to agree to President-elect Joe Biden's ambitious $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan, which includes bolstering the response to the virus and direct relief to households and small businesses.
""That should make Congress more willing to deal on Biden's wish list,"" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York. ""Critical to Biden's story is that the virus itself is creating the downturn, not any fundamental problems with the economy, and this is what needs to be done to address it.""
Retail sales dropped 0.7% last month. Data for November was revised down to show sales tumbling 1.4% instead of 1.1% as previously reported. Sales rose 2.9% on a year-on-year basis.
The monthly decline in sales was led by a 4.5% plunge at restaurants and bars after many authorities banned indoor dining over the holiday season. Online sales tumbled 5.8%. Receipts at electronics and appliance stores dropped 4.9%.
Consumers also cut back spending at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores as well as beverage stores. That offset a 1.9% rebound in sales at auto dealerships and a 2.4% increase in receipts at clothing stores. There were also gains in sales at building material stores as well as health and personal care outlets.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales tumbled 1.9% last month after a downwardly revised 1.1% decline in November. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have decreased 0.5% in November.
""There were plenty of culprits ruining the holiday spirit, including a frightening health situation, rising layoffs, and a looming lapse in jobless benefits,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Biden's ambitious fiscal agenda could juice up household spending during the delicate vaccine rollout phase.""
Optimism over the distribution of vaccines limited a decline in consumer sentiment in early January after President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop lawmakers from certifying Biden's victory in the Nov. 3 election. In a second report on Friday, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index slipped to 79.2 from a final reading of 80.7 in December.
U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
JOB LOSSES
The steep declines in core retail sales prompted economists to cut their consumer spending and GDP growth estimates for the fourth quarter. The government reported last week that the economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months. Further job losses are likely in January as new claims for unemployment benefits surged in the first week of the month.
Rampant coronavirus infections and delays by the government to approve more money to help businesses and the unemployed are behind the loss of economic momentum. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are around a 5% annualized rate, largely reflecting an inventory build, which is boosting manufacturing.
The economy grew at a 33.4% rate in the third quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the April-June quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.
In a third report on Friday, the Federal Reserve said manufacturing production rose 0.9% last month after advancing 0.8% in November. That was the eighth straight monthly gain in factory production. Manufacturing is being supported by a shift in demand towards goods from services.
Production at factories increased at a 11.2% rate in the fourth quarter.
""Manufacturing is clearly weathering this wave of confirmed COVID-19 cases better than occurred earlier this year,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Manufacturers are busy, as there is a need to rebuild inventories and demand for consumer goods remains strong, for now.""
A fourth report from the Commerce Department showed business inventories increased 0.5% in November.
Though economic growth is slowing, inflation is stirring, with a fifth report from the Labor Department showing the producer price index for final demand increased 0.3% in December after nudging up 0.1% in November.

""Additional government spending as well as a fuller reopening of the economy that will bring back demand are all factors that will boost inflation over coming months,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.

Business inventories rose 0.5% in November after increasing 0.8% in October, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. November's increase was in line with economists' expectations. Inventories fell 3.2% on a year-on-year basis in November.
Retail inventories rose 0.7% in November as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.9% increase in October. Motor vehicle inventories jumped 1.9% instead of 1.5% as previously reported.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, gained 0.2% instead of 0.3% as estimated last month.
Businesses are replenishing inventories after they were drawn down early in the pandemic. That has helped to underpin manufacturing. Inventory accumulation is expected to blunt some of the drag on GDP from a widening trade deficit, which hit a more than 14-year high in November.
The economy grew at a historic 33.4% pace in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. Inventories added to GDP growth in the third quarter after being a drag for five straight quarters.
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% rate because of the outbreak in coronavirus infections and the largely expired fiscal stimulus.
Wholesale inventories were unchanged in November. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.7%.

Business sales slipped 0.1% in November after accelerating 0.9% in October. At November's sales pace, it would take 1.32 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from October.

The record-breaking December capped off a record year for Canadian real estate, with more than 550,000 homes trading hands despite the COVID-19 pandemic, which some economists and real estate experts had feared would lead to a housing crash.
""Despite all the challenges, 2020 was a record year for Canadian resale housing activity,"" Costa Poulopoulos, chair of CREA, said in a statement, adding that the momentum was continuing into 2021.
The industry group noted that the number of homes listed for sale in Canada on Jan. 1 was the lowest on record, which coupled with new restrictions amid a surge in COVID-19 cases and lockdowns, pointed to further supply tightness in 2021.
""So we have record-high demand and record-low supply to start the year. How that plays out in the sales and price data will depend on how many homes become available to buy in the months ahead,"" said Shaun Cathcart, senior economist with CREA.

The government this week reported solid increases in both consumer and import prices in December. Economists expect inflation to accelerate in the months ahead as the government provides more money to stimulate the economy, and weak prices early in the coronavirus crisis fall out of the calculations.
But any inflation spark will probably be temporary against the backdrop of ample slack in the labor market, with at least 18.4 million Americans on unemployment benefits.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy shrank in November for the first time since the initial COVID-19 lockdown last spring, hit by a tightening of social-distancing rules. 
The 2.6% monthly decline was much smaller than most analysts expected - a Reuters poll had pointed to a 5.7% contraction - but several economists said Britain was still likely to suffer a double-dip recession.
Britain's economy, which shrank more sharply than any other major advanced economy in the first half of 2020, is now 8.5% smaller than it was before the start of the coronavirus pandemic in February.
""It's clear things will get harder before they get better and today's figures highlight the scale of the challenge we face,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
But the roll-out of vaccines in Britain - which has been faster than elsewhere in Europe - was a reason to be hopeful, Sunak said.
Several economists warned that Britain was still on course for renewed recession, with the economy likely to shrink in both the final quarter of 2020 and the first three months of 2021.
""A third lockdown means that a double-dip recession in the first quarter of this  year may be inevitable, particularly if the current post-Brexit disruption persists through the quarter,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce.
The scale of the hit to the economy in November was much smaller than in the first lockdown last year, something the Office for National Statistics attributed to businesses adjusting to social-distancing rules and schools remaining open.
But with a third, tougher lockdown now in place, and the impact of the country's new, less open trading relationship with the European Union also a drag on business, the country is facing major challenges in early 2021.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said this week that it was too soon to say if further stimulus would be needed after the central bank ramped up its bond-buying programme to almost 900 billion pounds ($1.23 trillion) in November. 
Friday's data showed Britain's economy in November was 8.9% smaller than a year earlier, a smaller drop than the 12.1% fall forecast in a Reuters poll. In October the economy had been 6.8% smaller than a year before.
At its lowest point in April, when many businesses closed temporarily, output was a record 25% below its year-ago level.
November's downturn was led by the services sector, where output fell 3.4% from October as pubs, restaurants, non-essential shops and many other consumer services businesses had to shut as part of a four-week lockdown in England and similar measures in other parts of the United Kingdom. 
Part of the scale of the hit to Britain's economy in 2020 reflects a decision by the ONS to take account of disruption to routine medical care and schooling due to COVID-19, an approach which not all countries' statistics agencies have taken.
BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent has estimated this factor accounted for a quarter of the almost 9% annual drop in output recorded for the third quarter of 2020.

Next week's key data includes core consumer inflation, which is expected to show the fastest pace of decline in over a decade, further adding to deflation fears as a renewed state of emergency in Tokyo and some other areas due to the pandemic are likely to dent consumer spending. 
Exports likely rose 2.4% in December from a year earlier, which would be the first increase since November 2018, the poll of 17 economists showed.
Imports were forecast to have fallen 14.0% in December from a year earlier, which would result in a trade surplus of 942.8 billion yen ($9.09 billion).
""Exports are recovering thanks to a pick up in overseas economies,"" said Kenta Maruyama, an economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting.
""But the pace of recovery will likely slow down as they have come to the level before the pandemic and the virus cases are surging in Europe and other parts of the world.""
The finance ministry announces trade data at 8:50 a.m. on Thursday (2350 GMT Wednesday).
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, is expected to have fallen 1.1% in December from a year earlier due to energy price falls and weak consumer spending, the poll showed.
That would the fastest pace of year-on-year drop since September 2010, when the index also fell 1.1%.
The government releases core CPI at 8:30 a.m. on Friday.
The poll also showed the Bank of Japan is expected to keep its policy interest rate at minus 0.1% and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target at around 0% at its policy meeting on Jan. 20-21.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits surged last week, confirming a weakening in labor market conditions as a worsening COVID-19 pandemic disrupts operations at restaurants and other businesses.
The larger-than-expected increase in weekly unemployment claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday was seen by some economists as driven by the recent renewal of supplemental jobless benefits, but nonetheless raised the risk of further job losses in January after nonfarm payrolls slumped in December for the first time in eight months.
A stalling labor market recovery could put pressure on the incoming Biden administration for a bigger relief package. Joe Biden will take over from President Donald Trump next Wednesday. He is expected to propose stimulus of as much as $2 trillion on Thursday. The government approved nearly $900 billion in additional relief at the end of December.
""The economy clearly needs additional support from Washington because right now rising jobless claims tells us the labor market recovery has stalled and the direction is full-tilt down,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 181,000 to a seasonally adjusted 965,000 for the week ended Jan. 9, the highest since late August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 795,000 applications in the latest week.
Unadjusted claims shot up 231,335 to 1.151 million last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted number because of earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations due to the economic shock caused by the pandemic. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs 1.4 million people filed claims last week.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday the economy was far from the U.S. central bank's inflation and employment goals. Powell said in a web symposium with Princeton University that it was too soon for the Fed to talk about changing its monthly bond purchases, part of an array of measures it has deployed to help the economy. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower. 
STRICTER MEASURES
The surge in claims last week also likely reflected people re-applying for benefits following the government's renewal of a $300 unemployment supplement until March 14 as part of the latest stimulus package. Government-funded programs for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the state unemployment programs as well as those who have exhausted their benefits were also extended.
""Not all individuals eligible for unemployment assistance actually claim benefits, and the supplementary payments add an incentive to file for benefits,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Authorities in many states have banned indoor dining to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months. 
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide in early January showed on Wednesday that ""contacts in the leisure and hospitality sectors reported renewed employment cuts due to stricter containment measures.""
The central bank also noted that the resurgence in the coronavirus was causing staff shortages in the manufacturing, construction and transportations sectors. The virus has infected more than 22.5 million people in the United States and killed over 376,188, the most of any country.
Though jobless claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March, they remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. Economists say it could take several years for the labor market to recover from the pandemic.
The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 199,000 to 5.271 million during the week ending Jan. 2. At least 18.4 million were on unemployment benefits on all programs in late December.
Labor market stress could curb inflation amid signs of rising price pressures. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said import prices jumped 0.9% in December after rising 0.2% in November. Import prices were boosted by higher prices for energy products and recent dollar weakness.
Economists had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, accelerating 0.7% in December. In the 12 months through December, import prices slipped 0.3% after dropping 1.0% in November.
""Prices are filtering upward, but with the labor market no longer improving, inflation is not likely to affect the economy,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday business applications dropped 28.5% to a seasonally adjusted 1.115 million last quarter. All four regions recorded a decrease, with steep declines in the Midwest, South and West. 
The coronavirus crisis has worsened, with restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses suffering the most. The economy has recovered 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April, when the crisis started in the United States.
At least 18.4 million Americans are on unemployment benefits. Economists expect employment will return to its pre-pandemic level in the 2023.

Investing.com -- Initial claims for jobless benefits surged last week to their highest level in five months as the restrictive measures put in place around the country to stop the Covid-19 pandemic continued to take their toll on the U.S. labor market.
The Labor Department said 965,000 people filed initial jobless claims last week, up from 784,000 and well above the 795,000 expected. 
The number of continuing claims under regular state programs also rose by some 200,000 to 5.27 million. A further 13 million are claiming unemployment benefits under other programs, chiefly the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation scheme. 
The figures from the last two weeks have been distorted by volatility in the reports filed by Illinois, which showed a sharp and uncharacteristic drop last week, only to post more claims than any other state this week. However, even allowing for that, the increase in claims is clearly bigger than expected, and suggests a further weakening in conditions since the cut-off date for December's employment report. 
The monthly jobs report showed the devastation being suffered by the hospitality industry due to restrictions on social gatherings that seem destined to last for weeks to come.
""January is shaping up to be another down month for employment,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist with Grant Thornton, via Twitter.
While U.S. authorities have been rolling out vaccines since their approval by the Food and Drug Administration, the overall level of protection among the population remains low. That argues against relaxing restrictions in the near term. Fatalities across the U.S. due to Covid-19 have topped 4,000 on both of the last two days, and the overall number of lives lost, at 385,000, is fast closing in on the 418,000 suffered during World War II.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has said that extending benefits for those made jobless by the pandemic will be a central part of a broad stimulus plan ""in the trillions of dollars"", which are due to be announced later Thursday.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's economy shrank by 5.0% in 2020, less than expected and a smaller contraction than during the global financial crisis, as unprecedented government rescue and stimulus measures helped lessen the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic.
With France and Italy, the euro zone's second and third biggest economies, each forecast to shrink by 9% in 2020, Thursday's preliminary data underlines how the crisis is increasing discrepancies within the 19-country currency bloc.
The contraction was smaller than a Reuters poll forecast of -5.1% and less severe than the record -5.7% suffered in 2009, during the financial crisis. Adjusted for calendar effects, gross domestic product declined by 5.3%, the statistics office said.
""It was actually a year of disaster, but judging by what had been feared in the course of the year, one could say we got off lightly,"" LBBW analyst Uwe Burkert said.
The statistics office said growth probably stagnated in the fourth quarter but carried positive momentum into 2021, suggesting Germany has so far managed to cope relatively well with a second wave of COVID-19 infections.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government has since March unleashed an array of measures to help companies and consumers in Europe's biggest economy through the pandemic.
The debt-financed programmes include liquidity aid for struggling firms, job protection schemes for employees, tax cuts and cash handouts to boost domestic demand and long-term investments in green technologies and public infrastructure.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Berlin will do everything it can to ensure 2021 becomes the year of recovery but cautioned that overall growth could be somewhat smaller than previously projected.
The government estimated 2021 GDP growth of 4.4% in an October forecast due to be updated later this month. The Ifo economic institute expects 4.2% growth this year.
BORROW AND SPEND
The fiscal splurge was possible because parliament suspended constitutional limits on budget deficits, sending government borrowing to record highs.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who is running as the Social Democrat (SPD) candidate for chancellor at elections in September, is expected to rack up a total of more than 300 billion euros in new debt in 2020 and 2021.
The public sector, including federal states, municipalities and social security systems, ran a budget deficit of 158.2 billion euros ($192.31 billion) or 4.8% of GDP, the office said.
That marked a severe deterioration of public finances following a surplus of 52.5 billion euros or 1.5% in 2019.
Private consumption tumbled 6% in 2020 on the year although disposable income edged up on average thanks to state aid and the Kurzarbeit short-time work scheme, the office said.
Lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus meant many consumers were not able to spend their money, so the net savings rate ballooned to a record high of 16.3%.
This pent-up spending power could boost household spending from the second quarter of 2021 if lockdown measures are gradually lifted in spring, the statistics office said.
Exports plunged nearly 10% while imports dropped 8.6%, suggesting that Germany's traditionally large trade surplus narrowed in the course of the pandemic.
The only bright spots came from government spending, which pushed up state consumption by 3.4%, and construction, where investment in building rose 1.5%, the preliminary data showed.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese exports grew more than expected in December, customs data showed on Thursday, as coronavirus disruptions around the world fuelled demand for Chinese goods even as a stronger yuan made shipments more expensive for overseas buyers.
A robust domestic recovery also spurred Chinese appetite for foreign products in December, with import growth quickening from the month prior and beating expectations in a Reuters poll.
While Chinese exports are likely to benefit from solid global demand at the start of this year, some analysts say a stronger yuan and rising raw materials costs could temper the momentum over coming months.
Exports rose 18.1% in December from a year earlier, slowing from a 21.1% jump in November but beating expectations for a 15% rise. Imports increased 6.5% year-on-year last month, topping a 5% forecast and picking up pace from November's 4.5% growth.
""China's exports grew in 2020, taking market share from other export-oriented economies. Although other export economies are likely to see a stronger 2021, the global recovery should still support China's export growth,"" said Iris Pang, ING's chief economist for China.
Customs spokesman Li Kuiwen concurred, telling a briefing that domestic demand will also support foreign trade, but cautioned that the pandemic would also bring some challenges in 2021.
Buoyant exports helped drive an impressive rebound in China's key manufacturing sector last year, with the world's second-biggest economy picking up the slack as the pandemic crunched production in many countries. China is expected to be the only major economy to have grown in 2020. Exports rose 3.6% over the full year and imports fell 1.1%.
Analysts say sustained demand for medical supplies and work-from-home products from coronavirus-hit trading partners should underpin the outlook for Chinese exports. 
But some worry a rise in raw material prices and in the yuan could squeeze exporters' profits. The onshore yuan jumped 6.7% in 2020 -- its first annual rise in three years.
""We think trade will remain resilient in the near-term but will soften later this year,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a research note.
U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS
China posted a trade surplus of $78.17 billion in December -- the highest reading on Refinitiv records going back to 2007. Analysts in the poll had expected the trade surplus to narrow to $72.35 billion from $75.40 billion in November. 
But its trade surplus with the United States narrowed to $29.92 billion in December from $37.42 billion in November, as Chinese imports grew faster than its exports to the United States.
The data points to ""Beijing’s continued effort to fulfill its commitments on the Phase One trade deal with the U.S.,"" said Nomura in a research note.
The world's two largest economies, which have imposed tit-for-tat tariffs in a bitter trade war, agreed on a Phase 1 trade agreement in January 2020, but significant tensions remain. 
While analysts think relations with China could be less fractious under the presidency of Joe Biden, due to take office on Jan. 20, Biden has said in a newspaper interview he will not immediately cancel the Phase 1 agreement nor take steps to remove tariffs on Chinese exports. 
""The main risk to China's trade outlook is on technology exports,"" ING's Pang said.
""It is unclear if the new U.S. government will put more pressure on China's technology exports, or if allies of the U.S. will join forces with them on this.""

Investing.com – Chinese exports exceeded growth expectations in December, according to customs data released earlier in the day, with continuous COVID-19 outbreaks fueling demand for Chinese goods although overseas buyers paid more for them thanks to a stronger yuan.
The data showed that all metrics outperformed. Exports grew 18.1% year-on-year against the 15% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com, but was lower than the 21.1% growth seen in November. Imports grew 6.5% year-on-year, beating the forecast 5% growth and November’s 4.5% growth.
The impressive rebound in China’s manufacturing sector in 2020 was largely driven by buoyant exports as the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic. The country is expected to be the only major economy to see positive growth in 2020, with exports growing 3.6% over the full year and imports falling 1.1%.
While COVID-19 will bring challenges, a reviving global economy and a steady recovery in China’s domestic economy provide a foundation for China to maintain trade growth in 2021, customs spokesman Liu Kuiwen said at a briefing.
Chinese exports are expected to see continuous support from the sustained demand for medical supplies and work-from-home products as trading partners continue to deal with COVID-19 outbreaks.
However, worries are mounting that the stronger yuan and rising raw material price could squeeze exporters’ profits. The yuan strengthened 6.7% in 2020 onshore trade, the first annual rise in three years.
“Exports continued to do well last month, as renewed lockdowns abroad ensured the shift in consumption from services to goods persisted in many of China’s trading partners,” Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note.
But Evans-Pritchard expects exports and imports to fall in late 2021 as the stimulus rolled out in 2020 runs out and overseas consumption returns to pre-COVID-19 patterns as vaccines boost a recovery.
“We think trade will remain resilient in the near-term but will soften later this year,” the note added.
Meanwhile, China’s trade balance was $78.17 billion in December, the highest reading on Refinitiv records going back to 2007. It was also higher than the forecast of $72.35 billion and November’s $75.40 billion figure.
The country’s trade surplus with the U.S., the country with which a bitter trade war has been waged in the last few years, narrowed to $29.92 billion in December from November’s $37.42 billion.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has indicated that he will not immediately cancel the phase one trade agreement that incumbent President Donald Trump struck with China in February 2020. Biden also said that he would not take steps to remove the current tariffs on Chinese exports."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly rose for a second straight month in November, data showed on Thursday, although a renewed coronavirus emergency in Tokyo and 10 other areas may cool business appetite for capital spending. 
The surprise gain in core orders, a key indicator of capital expenditure, could be a temporary relief to policymakers hoping for corporate investment to spur a private demand-led recovery in the world's third-largest economy.
The Cabinet Office data showed core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, grew 1.5% in November from October, led by increased demand for chip-making equipment and computers, possibly backed by people working from home.
It was a second straight month of gains and compared with economists' median estimate of a 6.2% drop, following a 17.1% jump in the previous month.
However, Japanese firms could grow cautious about boosting capital expenditure due to dwindling corporate profits, while a state of emergency implemented in Tokyo and 10 other prefectures through Feb. 7 could exacerbate conerns.
""Core orders likely picked up in the fourth quarter due to pent-up demand for capital spending thanks to government stimulus and overseas economic recovery,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""That will be temporary. The coronavirus has been spreading in Japan and elsewhere, forcing lockdowns in major economies, which will affect Japanese exports and service-sector activity.""
By sector, orders from manufacturers fell 2.4% month-on-month, while those from non-manufacturers grew 5.6% from the previous month, the Cabinet Office data showed.
The government raised its assessment on machinery orders, saying they showed a pick-up move. Previously it said orders had stopped falling.
Japan's economy rebounded sharply in the third quarter from its deepest postwar slump, thanks to pick-ups in exports and private consumption, which makes up more than half the economy.

But some analysts flagged the risk of a double-dip recession ahead given the current third wave of coronavirus infections.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased solidly in December amid a surge in the cost of gasoline, though underlying inflation remained tame as the economy battled a raging COVID-19 pandemic that has weighed on the labor market and services industry.
Inflation could, however, temporarily accelerate this year as the government provides more money to stimulate the economy, and the consumer price declines early in the coronavirus crisis wash out of the calculations. 
But that is unlikely to have an impact on the Federal Reserve, which has signaled it would tolerate higher prices after inflation persistently undershot the U.S. central bank's 2% target. The Fed has slashed interest rates to near zero and is pumping money into the economy through asset purchases.
Economists expect the ultra-easy monetary policy stance to last at least until 2024.
""We are likely to see a near-term spike in inflation on base effects of a reopening economy in 2021 versus a calamitous period in 2020, but that will fade through the second half of 2021,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""Longer-term inflation is going to be primarily driven by wage costs given this is a service sector economy."" 
The consumer price index increased 0.4% last month after gaining 0.2% in November, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. An 8.4% jump in gasoline prices accounted for more than 60% of the increase in the CPI. Food prices also rebounded. The rise in the CPI was in line with economists' expectations. 
In the 12 months through December, the CPI advanced 1.4% after increasing 1.2% in November. The annual inflation rate is below the 1.7% average over the last 10 years.
(GRAPHIC: Inflation - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dgkvlkggnpb/inflation.png) 
Higher prices could linger beyond the first half of 2021. A survey this month showed a measure of prices paid by manufacturers surged to a 2-1/2-year high in December because of bottlenecks in the supply chain. Rising price pressures at the factory gate were underscored by the Fed's Beige Book report on Wednesday showing ""growth in input prices continuing to outpace that of finished goods and services"" in early January. 
The report also showed businesses in several districts were able to pass on the higher production costs to consumers, especially in the retail, wholesale trade and manufacturing sectors, ""and some cited plans to increase selling prices in coming months.""
""Inventories are unusually lean for this early stage of the cycle and if the vaccination programs are a success ... the resulting surge in pent-up demand could keep inflation at, or above 2%, in the second half of the year, even after the spring base effects have faded,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. 
But with at least 19 million Americans on unemployment benefits, inflation is unlikely to become troublesome.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI edged up 0.1% in December after climbing 0.2% in November. The so-called core CPI was restrained by decreases in the prices of used cars and trucks, recreation, airfares and healthcare. 
That blunted gains in the prices of new motor vehicles, apparel prices, household furnishings, personal care products and motor vehicle insurance.
The core CPI gained 1.6% on a year-on-year basis, matching November's rise, and is below the 2.0% average over the past 10 years. The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its inflation target, a flexible average. The core PCE price index is at 1.4%.
The services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, has been hardest hit by the virus. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
RENTS MUTED
The government approved nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief in late December. More fiscal stimulus is expected from President-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration and a Congress that will soon be controlled by Democrats. 
Biden, who will be sworn in next Wednesday, is expected to unveil a plan this week that will include relief for cash-strapped state and local governments, new support for people who lost their jobs or cannot afford rent, and $2,000 in direct cash payments to many Americans. 
Economists have upgraded their growth estimates for this year and U.S. Treasury yields have risen in anticipation of stronger economic growth in the second half of the year. 
Last month's rebound in gasoline prices followed two straight monthly decreases. Food prices rose 0.4%, with the cost of food consumed at home increasing 0.4%. Prices for food consumed away from home also rose 0.4%. 
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, edged up 0.1% after being unchanged in November. Many tenants have entered into forbearance agreements with landlords. Healthcare prices declined for a third straight month. 

""For the Fed, the biggest inflation concern over the next few years will remain inflation that is too low, not too high,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government posted a December budget deficit of $144 billion - a record for the month - due to far higher outlays with coronavirus relief spending and unemployment benefits, while revenues ticked slightly higher, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday.
The Treasury said the December deficit compares with a $13 billion deficit in December 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic started in the United States.
Receipts for the month rose 3% from a year earlier to $346 billion, while outlays were up 40% to $490 billion.
December individual withheld income tax receipts were flat, while the Treasury registered increases in non-withheld income taxes and year-end corporate tax payments.
The cumulative U.S. deficit for the first three months of fiscal 2021, which started Oct. 1, reached $573 billion, up from $357 billion in the pre-pandemic year-earlier period.

Receipts for the first three months of the fiscal year were largely flat at $803 billion, while outlays were up 18% at $1.376 trillion.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's currency in circulation and bank deposits rose at a record pace in December, data showed on Wednesday, as a resurgence in coronavirus infections prompted companies and households to continue hoarding cash rather than spending it.
The numbers highlight the challenge the government faces in trying to contain the virus without threatening Japan's already fragile economic recovery.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is expected to announce an extension of state of emergency measures beyond Tokyo as early as Wednesday as COVID-19 infections keep rising.
Japan's M3 money stock - or currency in circulation and deposits at financial institutions - rose 7.63% in December from a year earlier, marking the biggest increase on record, Bank of Japan data showed. The rise slightly exceeded a 7.59% gain in November.
Companies continue to pile up deposits as a precaution against the pandemic, while households are holding off on spending due to uncertainty over the outlook, a BOJ official said at a briefing.
Japan's economy has been recovering moderately, after suffering its biggest postwar slump in April-June last year due to curbs imposed on economic activity to contain the virus.

The Labor Department said on Wednesday its consumer price index increased 0.4% last month after gaining 0.2% in November. In the 12 months through December the CPI rose 1.4% after increasing 1.2% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI shooting up 0.4% and rising 1.3% year-on-year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings fell moderately in November, but mounting layoffs amid rampant COVID-19 infections supported views that the labor market recovery from the pandemic was stalling.
The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report from the Labor Department on Tuesday followed on the heels of news last Friday that the economy shed workers in December for the first time in eight months. The slowing labor market and a worsening public health crisis could pressure the incoming Biden administration to deliver a bigger relief package.
Joe Biden will take over from President Donald Trump next Wednesday. The government approved nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus in late December after months of haggling, causing a delay that has also been blamed for the labor market's struggles.
""The labor market started softening even before the latest virus shutdowns,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped 105,000 to 6.527 million on the last day of November. Though vacancies have decreased from as high as 7.012 million in January, they remain more than double levels seen during the 2007-09 Great Recession.
There were 1.6 unemployed workers for every vacancy in November. Job openings declined in manufacturing, information and educational service sectors. But there were more unfilled jobs in the retail sector. The job openings rate fell to 4.4% from 4.5% in October.
Layoffs increased 295,000 to nearly 2.0 million in November and were mostly in the West. That lifted the layoffs rate to 1.4% from 1.2% in October. Job cuts were led by the accommodation and food services industry, which shed 263,000 workers. Out-of-control coronavirus infections have led to wide-spread curbs on businesses, with restaurants and bars bearing the brunt of the restrictions.
There were 42,000 job losses in the healthcare and social assistance sector. State and local governments, which are experiencing tight budgets because of the pandemic, laid off 21,000 workers.
""Stripping out the wild monthly swings of the coronavirus recession, the rise in layoff activity is historically large and surpasses the increases seen at the height of the Great Recession,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the JOLTS data.
SLOW RECOVERY
A separate report showed a sharp decline in confidence among small businesses in December. Economists, however, cautioned against reading too much into the plunge in sentiment reported by the National Federation of Independent Business, which they said largely reflected Republican Trump's electoral loss to Democrat Biden.
""Respondents to the NFIB survey tend to favor Republicans,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The NFIB survey overestimates growth under Republicans and underestimates it for Democrats.""
In November, hiring rose 67,000 to 5.979 million. Hiring increased in the professional and business services, and mining and logging industries. It fell in accommodation and food services, other services and information sectors. The hiring rate was steady at 4.2%.
The economy shed 140,000 jobs in December, the first decline in nonfarm payrolls since April, after adding 336,000 positions in November. The economy has recovered 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April.
The JOLTS report showed the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs was steady at 3.156 million, though 64,000 workers quit in the accommodation and food services industries. Many people in the prime-age group, mostly women, have quit jobs to look after children or because they are fearful of contracting COVID-19.
The quits rate was unchanged at 2.2% in November.

""With hiring and job openings at these levels, the economy is facing a long, slow recovery without additional action from Congress,"" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.

Investing.com – Chinese factory gate prices fell at their slowest pace since February 2020 in December, an indication that the manufacturing sector in the world’s second largest economy continues its rapid recovery from the impact of COVID-19.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) earlier in the day showed that the producer price index (PPI) contracted 0.4% year-on-year in December, smaller than the 0.8% drop in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 1.5% decline.
The industrial sector has seen a quick rebound from the strict lockdowns seen in early 2020. The pace of recovery. The pace of this recovery led some investors to believe the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) could begin unwinding loose monetary policy.
However, PBOC Governor Yi Gang said on Friday China will prioritize stability in monetary policy in 2021.
“With economic activity set to remain strong and underlying inflation likely to continue rising, we think the PBOC will tighten policy this year,” Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard told Reuters.
The NBS data also showed that December’s consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.7% month-on-month and 0.2% year-on-year in December. The pair also beat expectations, with the index forecasted to rise 0.4% month-on-month and 0.1% year-on-year. The CPI returned to growth in December, after seeing declines of 0.6% month-on-month and 0.5% year-on-year during the previous month, as food prices rebounded.
Food prices rose as extreme cold weather drove the transportation costs of fresh vegetables and fruit higher while holiday demand drove up meat product prices, NBS senior statistician Dong Lijuan told Reuters.
Prices saw a 1.2% increase from a year ago, compared with a decline of 2.0% in November. However, some investors expect a drop in pork prices due to the replenishment of hog stocks, to weigh on consumer prices over the next couple of months.
Further data, including exports, imports and trade balance data, is due to be released on Thursday."

The producer price index (PPI) eased 0.4% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement. The index was expected to decline by 0.8%, according to a median forecast in a Reuters poll, after a 1.5% drop in November. Monthly PPI rose at its fastest pace in four years.
Annual consumer prices meanwhile returned to growth last month, underpinned by a rebound in food prices, after falling in November for the first time in over a decade.
An impressive rebound in China's industrial sector has helped the world's second-largest economy post a robust recovery from the COVID-19 shock in early 2020.

The data comes as Chinese manufacturing activity expanded in December but at a slightly slower pace amid higher raw material costs.
Prices for raw materials fell 1.6% from a year ago, compared with a decline of 4.2% in the previous month, the data showed. PPI rose 1.1% last month, the fastest pace since December 2016.
""Judging from the current significant rebound in global commodity prices, (annual) PPI could soon enter positive growth territory,"" said Zhang Yongjun, analyst at China Centre for International Economic Exchanges. 
MUTED CONSUMER INFLATION
Consumer prices rose in December due to higher food prices.
The consumer price index (CPI) increased 0.2% from a year earlier, against expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.1% rise, and bringing full-year consumer price inflation to 2.5% in 2020. 
The index had eased 0.5% in November, the first fall since 2009.
Food prices rose as extreme cold weather drove the transportation costs of fresh vegetables and fruit higher while seasonal holiday demand drove up the prices of meat products, said Dong Lijuan, senior statistician with the NBS.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada lost more jobs than expected in December, Statistics Canada data showed on Friday, with economists and industry groups warning protracted COVID-19 restrictions across much of the country are darkening the outlook into the first quarter.
Canada lost 62,600 jobs in December, more than double analysts' expectations of a decline of 27,500, while the unemployment rate edged up to 8.6%, in line with expectations. Employment remains 3.3% below pre-pandemic levels.
Canada's new COVID-19 cases, meanwhile, now average 7,688 per day, forcing a number of regions across the country to impose harsher restrictions that experts say will further hit employment. 
""As cases continue to reach record highs, the prospect of protracted lockdowns loom large over the first quarter,"" said Leah Nord, senior director of workforce strategies at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, in a statement.
""We believe that many of the rebound gains of the last seven months are at risk of being lost, signaling a potential return to darker times for Canada's labor market over the coming months,"" she added.
Populous Quebec imposed a curfew earlier this week and extended existing lockdowns through to February, while Ontario on Thursday said it would keep most schools closed for an additional two weeks amid a partial lockdown. 
The poor outlook for employment could put pressure on the Bank of Canada to further ease monetary policy, economists said. The central bank has said it could cut record low interest rates further if the economic situation worsens. 
The Canadian dollar gave back some of the week's gain, dipping 0.2% to 1.2713 per U.S. dollar, or 78.66 U.S. cents, while Canada's S&P/TSX composite index fell 14.84 points, or 0.08%, after notching a record high Thursday as investors bet on a global economic rebound.
The service sector, hit by fresh restrictions on retail, food services, fitness and travel, lost 74,000 jobs, while employment in the goods sector rose by 11,300.
""It's almost textbook, the decline was almost entirely in accommodation and food services, which lost almost 57,000 jobs,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
Porter added the overall decline was only a fraction of that in March and April, when broad national shutdowns led to more than 3 million job losses.

Part-time employment fell by 99,000 positions, while full-time employment fared better, up by 36,500 jobs, Statscan said. Youth employment slipped in December, with employment of 15-24 year olds remaining 10.5% below pre-pandemic levels.

The Commerce Department estimated last month that wholesale inventories dipped 0.1% in November. Stocks at wholesalers surged 1.3% in October. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product fell 0.1% in November.
Inventories decreased 2.1% in November from a year earlier.
The economy is expected to have expanded at around a 5% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, with the bulk of the rise in gross domestic product seen coming from inventory investment.
Businesses are replenishing inventories after they were drawn down early in the pandemic. That has helped to underpin manufacturing. Inventory accumulation is expected to blunt some of the drag on GDP from a widening trade deficit, which hit a more than 14-year high in November.
The economy grew at a historic 33.4% pace in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. Inventories added to GDP growth in the third quarter after being a drag for five straight quarters.
Wholesale stocks of motor vehicles and parts rebounded 0.8% in November after slipping 0.2% in October.
Sales at wholesalers rose 0.2% in November after accelerating 1.7% in October. At November's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.31 months to clear shelves, unchanged from October.

Investing.com --- The U.S. labor market suffered its first net loss of jobs in eight months in December, as the surge in Covid-19 cases hit service sectors of the economy hard in the runup to the Christmas holiday. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said nonfarm employment fell by 140,000 through the middle of the month, compared with expectations for an increase of 71,000. However, the waters were muddied by a big upward revision to hiring in November, where payrolls grew by 336,000, rather than the 245,000 initially reported last month. 
The unemployment rate, meanwhile, stayed at 6.7% of the workforce, defying expectations of an increase to 6.8%.
The carnage of lockdown measures was most evident in the hospitality sector, where 372,000 jobs were lost in bars and restaurants nationwide. Another 92,000 were lost in entertainment parks and casinos.  That was partly offset by a boom in delivery services as the pandemic forced Christmas shoppers online. Around 37,000 jobs were created for messengers and couriers, while another 59,000 were created in warehouses and other wholesale centers.
The markets reacted by seeing the data as 'bad news but old news'. After an initial dip, Dow Jones Futures were back trading at their pre-release level within 20 minutes.  The yield on the 10-Year Treasury bond, which had broken out of a long-standing range to the upside this week on expectations of a big increase in government borrowing, was also little changed, rising two basis points to 1.09%.
The monthly labor report is no longer the key driver that it once was for markets that are focusing overwhelmingly on the spending plans of the new administration and the perceived willingness of the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels."

The quarterly poll of chief financial officers from accountants Deloitte showed the biggest improvement in optimism since the survey started in 2007.
Still, half of the respondents said it would take at least until the end of 2021 before revenues return to their pre-pandemic levels - chiming with a Bank of England survey published this week.
""Boosted by the prospect of mass vaccination and growth, business sentiment surged this quarter with CFOs taking the most positive view on profit margins for the last five years,"" said Ian Stewart, Deloitte's chief economist.
Expectations for hiring and investment recovered in the latest survey but still remained in negative territory.
On Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said a surge in investment was critical this year to help heal the scars left by the pandemic.
Many economists believe Britain has slipped back into recession, with the BoE estimating the economy shrank by just over 1% in the fourth quarter and others predicting further contraction in early 2021.
Britain has recorded Europe's highest death toll from COVID-19 at more than 78,000 and also saw its economy shrink by a fifth during the second quarter of 2020, the sharpest decline among the world's seven largest advanced economies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly dipped last week while staying extremely high, with the labor market recovery appearing to stall as a raging COVID-19 pandemic threatens to overwhelm the country.
Layoffs announced by U.S. companies surged 18.9% in December, other data on Thursday showed. Though services industry activity accelerated last month, employment fell. The reports followed on the heels of news on Wednesday that private companies shed workers in December, heightening the risk that the economy lost jobs last month for the first time since April. 
Still, the economy is unlikely to slide back into recession after the government approved additional pandemic relief in late December, with more fiscal stimulus likely. Democrats on Wednesday won two Senate seats in runoff elections in Georgia, giving the party control of the chamber and boosting the prospects for President-elect Joe Biden's legislative agenda. Congress on Thursday formally certified Biden's election victory hours after hundreds of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.
""The labor market will struggle this winter because of surging COVID-19 cases,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The good news is additional support is likely coming in the first quarter.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dipped 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 787,000 for the week ended Jan. 2, compared to 790,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 800,000 applications in the latest week.
Claims were likely held down by difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations around this time of the year. Unadjusted claims jumped 77,400 to 922,072 last week. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.08 million people filed claims last week. 
(GRAPHIC: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnpwknrjpw/joblessclaims.png) 
Elevated claims are in line with other data that have suggested the economy was taking a beating from business restrictions and retrenchment in consumer spending because of the pandemic. Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Dec. 15-16 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers expected soaring coronavirus cases ""would be particularly challenging for the labor market in coming months."" 
COVID-19 cases in the United States have jumped to more than 21 million, with the death toll exceeding 356,000 since the virus first emerged in China in late 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
In a second report on Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S. companies announced 77,030 job cuts in December, up from 64,797 in November. That brought total layoffs in 2020 to a record 2.305 million, a 289% surge compared to 2019. Nearly half of the job cuts were due to the pandemic.

Separately, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of services industry employment dropped to a reading of 48.2 last month from 51.5 in November. The ISM said comments from companies included ""less staff needed in restaurants due to restrictions"" and ""we had to reduce our workforce even further.""
U.S. stocks were trading higher as investors bet on more pandemic aid under a Democrat-controlled Congress. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
MILLIONS ON BENEFITS
The government is scheduled to publish its closely followed employment report for December on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 71,000 jobs after rising by 245,000 in November. 
That would be the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and mean the economy recouped about 12.5 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April.
Jobless claims remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though they have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March. The government in late December approved nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus, including the renewal of a $300 unemployment supplement until March 14.
Government-funded programs for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the state unemployment programs as well as those who have exhausted their benefits were also extended in the package. 
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 126,000 to 5.072 million in the week ending Dec. 26. But many have exhausted their eligibility, limited to six months in most states. About 4.517 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Dec. 19. Roughly 19.177 million people were receiving benefits under all programs in mid-December. 
The economy plunged into recession in February. Though it is expected to have expanded at around a 5% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the bulk of the rise in gross domestic product will likely come from the rebuilding of inventories.
A fourth report from the Commerce Department showed the trade deficit widened 8.0% to $68.1 billion in November, the highest since August 2006. The deficit was boosted by a jump in imports.

176,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 10:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity accelerated in December, but sky-rocketing COVID-19 infections depressed employment, heightening the risk that the economy shed jobs for the first time since the labor market recovery from the pandemic started.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its non-manufacturing activity index increased to a reading of 57.2 last month from 55.9 in November.
That lifted the index to within striking distance of its 57.3 level in February, before the coronavirus pandemic reached the United States. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 54.6 in December.
The surprise pick-up in services sector activity mirrors a similar rise in production at factories last month despite the country being engulfed by a fresh wave of coronavirus cases.
As with the manufacturing data, the improvement in the services industry index partly reflected a rise in the survey's measure of supplier deliveries to a reading of 62.8 last month from 57.0 in November. A lengthening in suppliers' delivery times is normally associated with a strong economy and increased customer demand, which would be a positive contribution.
But in this instance that indicates supply shortages due to the pandemic.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry rebounded to a reading of 58.5 in December from 57.2 in November. That came as a measure of export orders jumped to 57.3 from a reading of 50.4 in November. But the global resurgence in the virus suggests the robust export growth is unsustainable.
Backlog orders contracted, indicating a slowdown in the services industry activity in the near term.
The survey's index of services industry employment fell to a reading of 48.2 last month from 51.5 in November. That increases the possibility that the economy lost jobs in December for the first time since April. A report on Wednesday showed a decline in employment at private companies last month.
But a survey from the ISM on Tuesday showed employment at factories rebounded in December.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 71,000 jobs after rising by 245,000 in November. That would the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and mean the economy recouped about 12.5 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade gap widened 8.0% to $68.1 billion in November, the highest level since August 2006. The deficit in October was unrevised at $63.1 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade shortfall increasing to $65.2 billion in November.
Imports jumped 2.9% to $252.3 billion. Goods imports accelerated 3.0% to $214.1 billion, the highest since May 2019. Exports rose 1.2% to $184.2 billion. Goods exports advanced 1.0% to $127.7 billion.
Rising imports and the resulting widening in the trade deficit are a drag on gross domestic product. But much of the imports likely ended up in warehouses, boosting inventories. The accumulation of inventories is likely to counter the hit to GDP from imports.
The economy is expected to have expanded at around a 5% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, with the bulk of the rise in gross domestic product seen coming from inventory investment.

Investing.com -- The number of people making initial claims for jobless benefits stayed roughly unchanged at the historically high level of 787,000 last week, according to figures released on Thursday by the Labor Department.
That's fractionally below the 800,000 expected by analysts ahead of time and down by 3,000 from the previous week's figure, which was revised up a shade.
The number of continuing claims fell by more than expected to 5.072 million from 5.198 million, the latter figure being revised down by 21,000 from its initial estimate. 
The numbers appear to indicate no meaningful improvement in the labor market since the cut-off date for December's nationwide payrolls surveys. ADP's monthly survey for December, which covered the period up to the middle of last month, showed that private payrolls fell by 123,000 in a month when the service sector in particular was hit by a fresh surge in Covid-19 cases nationwide.
""The underlying story here is clear,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""A combination of Covid fear and state-mandated restrictions on activity in the services sector is squeezing businesses, and no real relief is likely until a sustained decline in pressure on hospitals emerges; that’s probably a story for late February at the earliest.""
He noted that while the figures reflect real hardship, there was comfort in the fact that they had not developed more serious upward momentum.
The impact of the numbers on financial markets was minimal Thursday, overshadowed by the prospect of more aggressive stimulus from the incoming administration of Joe Biden, which will be able to count on majorities in both houses of Congress. By 9 AM, Dow Jones Futures were up 128 points, or 0.4%, while NASDAQ Futures were up 0.9%.
 Yields on 10-YearTreasury bonds, however, resumed their rise, hitting 1.07% after crashing through 1% for the first time in 10 months on the back of Georgia's Senate seat runoffs on Wednesday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Economic sentiment in the euro zone ticked up last month but inflation held in negative territory before what is likely to be a slow rise this year as some tax cuts are reversed, oil prices rise and the economy starts to recover.
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro was unchanged at minus 0.3% in December, Eurostat data showed on Thursday, underperforming analyst expectations for a minus 0.2% reading but broadly in line with the European Central Bank's own projections. 
With the economy likely shrinking again in the fourth quarter and inflation below zero since August, the ECB already approved a new package of stimulus measures in December, extending copious asset buys well into 2022 to insulate an economy likely to face permanent damage from the pandemic.
Its measures are expected to keep borrowing costs record low for years to come, providing crucial support just as the bloc faces even stricter lockdown measures with governments shutting down much of the services sector over fears that a fresh wave of coronavirus infections could overwhelm heath care system. 
Still, economic sentiment edged up to 90.4 points in December from 87.7 in November, against expectations of a rise to 90.0 points, a European Commission monthly survey showed.
The better reading was mainly thanks to an improvement in industry to -7.2 from -10.1 and among consumers to -13.9 from -17.6 points. 
Thursday's inflation reading could be the last negative figure in the current cycle as a temporary German value added tax cut expired at the end of 2020 and crude oil prices are up around 45% since the start of November. 
The ECB expects inflation to rise to 0.3% in the first quarter, then to 1.5% by the fourth quarter as activity restarts and weak year earlier figures get knocked out from base figures.
Still, inflation, which has undershot the ECB's nearly 2% target since 2013, is likely to dip again next year and will not approach the bank's objective for years to come as the recover from the pandemic will be protracted. 
Separately, Eurostat said euro zone retail sales plunged much more than expected in November as countries across Europe began to re-introduce pandemic restrictions. The sales falls were deepest in Belgium and France which imposed the toughest measures early.

Euro zone retail sales dropped 6.1% month-on-month for a 2.9% year-on-year fall. In Belgium the monthly drop was 15.9% and in France 18.0%. Economists polled by Reuters had expected euro zone retail sales to fall 3.4% on the month and rise 0.8% on the year.

LONDON (Reuters) - British companies saw a slightly worsening hit to sales and jobs from the COVID-19 pandemic last month when the virus spread increasingly through the population, a Bank of England survey showed on Thursday.
Companies said the pandemic cut 16.1% on average from sales during the fourth quarter, the BoE said, more than the 15.3% hit pencilled in from November's survey. They also saw a bigger hit to jobs.
The worsening conditions came last month despite positive news on COVID-19 vaccines and a relaxation of health restrictions in many parts of England.
On Wednesday the United Kingdom recorded more than 1,000 COVID-19 daily deaths for the first time since April as the government struggles to deal with a new, more infectious variant of the coronavirus.
Like previous editions, the latest BoE survey showed hospitality businesses have been hit especially hard by the pandemic.
Food and accommodation businesses thought the hit to jobs and sales from the pandemic would persist into at least 2022.

The BoE survey was conducted between Dec. 4 and Dec. 18 and was based on responses from 2,933 firms.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's construction sector extended its robust recovery from earlier COVID lockdown restrictions in December, a survey showed on Thursday, helping the broader private-sector economy eke out modest growth.
Housing was the biggest driver of construction growth, reflecting the boost to builders' confidence from a surge in prices and property purchases since the middle of the year, when lockdown curbs eased and property purchase taxes were cut.
The IHS Markit/CIPS construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to 54.6 in December from 54.7 in November, but remained comfortably above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction, as it has been since June.
""A sustained improvement in construction order books resulted in a rise in employment numbers for the first time in nearly two years and the most optimistic growth expectations since April 2017,"" IHS Markit economics director Tim Moore said.
Britain's wider economy has been doing less well since COVID cases started to rise from late September onwards, leading to a four-week lockdown in England in November and open-ended curbs introduced this week due to a new more infectious variant.
The all-sector PMI, which is dominated by the services industry, barely returned to growth in December, rising to 50.8 from November's five-month low of 49.5.
Services PMI data on Wednesday painted a picture of firms continuing to struggle as restaurants, pubs and many other consumer-facing businesses remained shut or under heavy restrictions.
Many economists believe Britain has slipped back into recession, with the Bank of England estimating the economy shrank by just over 1% in the fourth quarter and others predicting further contraction in early 2021.

Britain has recorded Europe's highest death toll from COVID-19 at more than 76,000 and also saw its economy shrink by a fifth during the second quarter of 2020, the sharpest decline among the world's seven largest advanced economies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private companies shed workers in December for the first time in eight months as out-of-control COVID-19 infections unleashed a fresh wave of business restrictions, setting the tone for what is likely to be a brutal winter for the economy.
The ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed job losses across all industries last month as the coronavirus outbreak kept many consumers and workers at home. While the report underscored the magnitude of the crisis, the economy was unlikely to slide back into recession, thanks to additional fiscal stimulus approved in late December.
The ADP report added to slumping consumer spending and persistently high layoffs in suggesting that the economy lost significant momentum at the end of 2020. Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Dec. 15-16 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers expected skyrocketing cases ""would be particularly challenging for the labor market in coming months.""
""America's great jobs machine ran into a wall of rising coronavirus cases and state lockdowns which puts the entire economic recovery from recession at risk,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The heart of every recession is job losses and right now the decline in jobs at year end is hinting that the dark days of the labor market last spring have returned.""
Private payrolls decreased by 123,000 jobs last month, the first decline since April, after increasing 304,000 in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would rise by 88,000 in December.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. Though it has a spotty record predicting the government's private payrolls count because of methodology differences, it is still watched for clues on the labor market's health. 
(GRAPHIC: ADP - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/oakpejwwlvr/adp.png) 
COVID-19 cases in the United States have jumped to more than 20 million, with the death toll exceeding 352,000 since the virus first emerged in China in late 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In addition to the virus, the labor market has been constrained by government delays in providing another relief package for businesses and the unemployed. 
More than $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus helped companies to rehire workers and keep others on payrolls. It also assisted millions of unemployed and underemployed Americans to pay bills and maintain spending, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter. Nearly $900 billion in additional government rescue money was approved in late December.
""While the economy is on the verge of double-dipping, I don't think it will,"" Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told reporters. ""The additional $900 billion will help in ensuring that the economy does not backslide into recession.""
More fiscal stimulus is likely. Democrats won one Senate race in Georgia and led in another on Wednesday, moving closer to a surprise sweep in a former Republican stronghold that would give them control of Congress and greater power to advance President-elect Joe Biden's agenda.
Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the Dow and the S&P 500 notching record highs as investors bet on more stimulus and infrastructure spending from a Democrat-led Congress. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
BROAD WEAKNESS
Manufacturing shed 21,000 jobs in December, while payrolls in the private services industry dropped by 105,000. There were 13,000 job losses among small companies. Large companies payrolls decreased by 147,000. Medium-sized companied hired 37,000 workers last month.
The ADP report was released ahead of the government's closely watched, and comprehensive, monthly employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, private nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 98,000 jobs in December after rising by 344,000 in November.
With government payrolls expected to have dropped again last month, overall nonfarm payrolls are forecast increasing by 71,000 jobs after rising by 245,000 in November. That would the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and mean the economy recouped about 12.5 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April.
Economists are predicting it could take a while for all the lost jobs to be recovered, even with additional fiscal support and herd immunity to the virus from vaccines that are being rolled out. The decline in ADP private payrolls supports several economists' expectations that the economy shed jobs in December, though those dire predictions have been countered by a survey on Tuesday showing employment at factories rebounding in December.
Other economists said this argued for job growth last month, though at a significantly slower pace than in November.

Economic growth estimates for the fourth quarter are around a 5.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a historic 33.4% pace in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that factory orders rose 1.0% after increasing 1.3% in October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders increasing 0.7% in November. Orders fell 7.3% year-on-year.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, is being supported by a shift in demand towards goods from services because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Institute for Supply Management reported on Tuesday that its index of national factory activity increased in December to the highest level since August 2018.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, advanced 0.5% in November instead of 0.4% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, rose 0.5%. They were previously reported to have increased 0.4%.
Business spending on equipment rebounded in the third quarter, ending five straight quarters of decline. The economy grew at a 33.4% rate in the July-September quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy made only a subdued return to growth in December after shrinking during a four-week England-wide coronavirus lockdown in November, as the large services sector failed to fully recover, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.4 in December from 49.0 in November, a slightly smaller increase than in an earlier flash estimate.
The services PMI, which makes up the largest part of the composite index, remained below the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction at 49.4. This was up from November's five-month low of 47.6 but also below the flash reading.
""December data confirm that the UK service sector has swung back into decline after the partial rebound seen during the third quarter of 2020, largely reflecting tighter restrictions on consumer services amid the worsening trajectory of the pandemic,"" IHS Markit economics director Tim Moore said.
December had brought some optimism to British businesses with the beginning of the rollout of coronavirus vaccines.
Businesses are more optimistic about the outlook, with the index for future output only a fraction lower than November's five-year high.
But vaccinations started too late to stop a surge in cases which on Monday prompted Prime Minister Boris Johnson to set out a new, tougher lockdown. This will last until at least mid-February and economists think it will tip Britain back into recession.
""Service providers will be braced for a sustained period of subdued UK economic conditions and deferred client spending in the first quarter of this year,"" Moore said.
The economic damage is not expected to be on the scale of the first lockdown, when economic output slumped as much as 25%.
But a survey from the British Chambers of Commerce, released late on Tuesday, showed many businesses not directly affected by lockdown restrictions reported a drop in sales during November's lockdown as their clients suffered cashflow difficulties.

With infection rates soaring across Europe, countries have clamped down on public life. Germany is set to extend its strict lockdown until the end of the month and Italy decided on Tuesday to keep some nationwide restrictions in place.
IHS Markit's final December Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, did rise to 49.1 from November's 45.3 but was significantly below a flash reading of 49.8. Anything below 50 indicates contraction.
""Service sector activity in particular fell more sharply than estimated by the earlier flash PMI estimate, as more countries stepped up their fights against rising virus case numbers,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
The services PMI registered 46.4 in December, better than the previous month's 41.7 but far weaker than the 47.3 preliminary estimate.
With much of the service industry being forced to close demand also shrank a lot more than thought. The final services new business index was 46.6 compared to the flash estimate of 47.9, albeit better than November's 40.6.
""Worse may be yet to come before things get better, especially as the latest survey data were collected before the news of the new – more contagious – strain of the virus,"" Williamson said.
""Service sector activity in particular looks likely to remain constrained by severe social distancing in the early months of the new year.""
But with vaccines being rolled out across the continent overall optimism about the year ahead improved. The composite future output index rose to 64.5 from 60.4, its highest reading since April 2018.
The bloc's economy is expected to gain momentum this year on vaccine hopes, a Reuters poll found last month, and will return to pre-crisis levels within two years. [ECILT/EU]

Investing.com – China’s services sector activity expanded at a slower pace in December, according to a private sector survey, as sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks in the country tempered the recovery in consumer confidence and impacted new business growth.
The Caixin services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for December, released earlier in the day, read 56.3, a three-month low. The reading was lower than November’s 57.8 figure, but remained above the 50-mark indicating expansion.
The data follows Monday’s Caixin Manufacturing PMI, which read 53 for December. The National Bureau of Statistics also released the manufacturing PMI and the non-manufacturing PMI during the previous week, which read 51.9 and 55.7 respectively.
Growth in new export business, which had only returned to expansion in November, eased as the surging number of COVID-19 cases globally dampened overseas demand. The survey also showed that a further sharp rise in input price led companies to increase their prices charged at the fastest pace since January 2008.
The services sector has been slower to recover than the industrial sector as it is more vulnerable to the impact of tightened social distancing measures. Measures have been tightened in northern China, including Beijing, Hebei and Liaoning provinces, as clusters of COVID-19 cases emerge in those areas. Chinese tourists shunned overseas travel in 2020 thanks to COVID-19, and are limiting travel to nearby cities as well as avoiding trips out of their provinces.
However, the survey showed that business expectations over the next 12 months were at their highest levels since April 2011, as vaccine rollouts globally increase hopes that the pandemic will come to an end.
“Looking ahead, we expect the post-epidemic economic recovery to continue for several months, and macroeconomic indicators will be stronger over the next six months due to the low bases in the first half of 2020,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said.
“Meanwhile, we need to pay attention to the mounting pressure on costs brought by the increase in raw material prices and its adverse impact on employment, which is particularly important to figuring out how to exit the stimulus policies implemented during the epidemic,” Wang added."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. factory activity accelerated to its highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years in December as the coronavirus pandemic continues to pull demand away from services towards goods, though spiraling new infections are causing bottlenecks in supply chains.
The strength in manufacturing reported by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Tuesday likely helped to soften the blow on the economy in the fourth quarter from the relentless spread of COVID-19 and government delays in approving another rescue package to help businesses and the unemployed.
The ISM said the virus was ""limiting manufacturing growth potential"" because of absenteeism and short-term shutdowns to sanitize facilities at factories and their suppliers.
""U.S. manufacturing should fare reasonably well this winter as businesses need to restock inventories and the shift in consumer spending away from services to goods helps manufacturers,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The ISM's index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 60.7 last month. That was the highest level since August 2018 and followed a reading of 57.5 in November. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would slip to 56.6 in December. 
The ISM survey mirrored manufacturing gains in the euro zone and China. 
Some of the surprise rebound in the ISM index, however, was due to an increase in the survey's measure of supplier deliveries to a reading of 67.6 last month from 61.7 in November. A lengthening in suppliers' delivery times is normally associated with a strong economy and increased customer demand, which would be a positive contribution. 
But in this case slower supplier deliveries indicate supply shortages related to the pandemic.
Nevertheless, demand for manufactured goods has been strong as the resurgence in new COVID-19 cases has led to fresh business restrictions across the United States, largely impacting the vast services sector. 
A large section of the population continues to work and take classes at home, fueling a scramble for electronics, home improvement products and other goods like exercise equipment.
Sixteen out of 18 manufacturing industries reported growth in December. Computer and electronic products manufacturers said they continued to have ""tailwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic research support for vaccines and treatments.""
Makers of miscellaneous products reported that sales had exceeded pre-COVID-19 levels. Electrical equipment, appliances and components producers said business was stronger than expected, ""with higher demand for many products."" 
Despite strong demand, manufacturing output is still about 3.8% below its pre-pandemic level, according to the Federal Reserve. That could persist for a while as the new wave of infections causes disruptions to labor and the supply chain.
Food manufacturers complained the virus was ""affecting us more strongly now than back in March."" Similar sentiments were echoed by transportation equipment makers who said the outbreaks were constraining suppliers. Plastics and rubber products also reported that their suppliers were having difficulty finding and retaining labor.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as investors focused on two runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday that will determine whether Republicans maintain control of the U.S. Senate. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
STRONG ORDERS GROWTH 
The ISM report followed on the heels of data on Monday showing strong construction spending in November and October. Strength in these sectors supports economists' predictions that the economy grew at around a 5% annualized rate in the fourth quarter after a record 33.4% pace in the third quarter.
The manufacturing boost to gross domestic product would come through an accumulation of inventory by businesses.
The virus and depleted government pandemic money took a bite out of consumer spending in November. More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief fueled growth in the July-September quarter after the economy contracted at a historic 31.4% rate in the second quarter. Nearly $900 billion in fiscal stimulus was approved in late December.
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index rose to a reading of 67.9 last month from 65.1 in November. A measure of backlog orders hit a 2-1/2-year high.
Strong orders growth boosted manufacturing employment, which had contracted in November. The ISM's manufacturing employment gauge rebounded to 51.5 from a reading of 48.4 in November. 
That could temper some economists' expectations that the economy shed jobs in December. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government's closely watched employment report on Friday is likely to show that nonfarm payrolls increased by 100,000 jobs last month after rising by 245,000 in November.
But the supply chain gridlock is driving up costs for manufacturers. The survey's prices paid index jumped to a reading of 77.6 last month, the highest since May 2018, from 65.4 in November. That raises the risk of higher inflation.

""If the cost pressures are sustained and passed on to consumers, it could lead to higher consumer inflation down the road,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.

The labor market has lost steam in tandem with the economy since job growth peaked at a record 4.781 million in June.

According to an early Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 100,000 jobs last month after rising by 245,000 in November.

192,"<span>Jan 05, 2021 06:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German retail sales rose in November and jobless numbers fell last month, against forecasts that both readings would worsen, suggesting that parts of Europe's largest economy have weathered the impact of the coronavirus unexpectedly well.
Retail sales rose 1.9% in November, when markets had anticipated a contraction, the Federal Statistics Office said on Tuesday, adding that it expected sales to have grown around 4% during 2020 as a whole - exceeding 2019's 3.2% expansion.
The monthly increase - covering a period when Germany was in partial lockdown with shops still open - was driven by online transactions and spending on home improvements, the office said on Tuesday.
In separate data, the Federal Labour Agency said the number of jobless fell a seasonally-adjusted 37,000 year on year in December, when the lockdown was tightened, with most shops forced to close from mid-month. Analysts had expected an increase.
""The apparent resilience of the German economy in late 2020 bodes well for the new year,"" said Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding. ""Despite a likely setback early this year, we look for a strong rebound starting no later than April.""
The employment numbers - which ING analyst Carsten Brzeski cautioned should be taken with ""a big spoon of salt"" - were boosted by a state-backed part-time work scheme designed to protect jobs that some 666,000 people were placed on in December.
Germany is expected to further extend its tougher anti-COVID restrictions on Tuesday as infection rates have remained high.
The Statistics Office said its provisional full-year retail sales growth figure - contrasting with an expected drop of 5.5% in gross domestic product, according to the Bundesbank - included December's full lockdown.
The office also said the estimate was ""freighted with greater uncertainties"" than usual due to the pandemic. 
November's biggest winners were in online and delivery retail, where revenues rose 31.8% year on year, while spending on household decorations, appliances and building materials rose 15.4%.

Mixed retail, including department stores, fell 6.1%.

193,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 11:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending rose to a record high in November, boosted by a robust housing market amid historically low mortgage rates, which could help blunt some of the hit on the economy from raging COVID-19 infections.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that construction spending increased 0.9% to $1.459 trillion, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2002. Data for October was revised higher to show construction outlays accelerating 1.6% instead of 1.3% as previously reported.
Strong construction spending supports economists' predictions that the economy grew at around a 5% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The sharp step-down from a record 33.4% pace in the third quarter reflects a resurgence in coronavirus cases, which has slammed the services sector. 
Growth is also slowing following the exhaustion of more than $3 trillion dollars in government pandemic relief and delays in approving another rescue package. Nearly $900 billion in fiscal stimulus was approved in late December. 
Construction spending accounts for about 5% of gross domestic product. 
""The data imply modest upside risk for our GDP growth forecast of a 4.3% rate in the fourth quarter,"" said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado. ""The housing boom is lifting construction activity overall ... despite some stalling in the transactions-related housing data in recent months.""
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would rise 1.0% in November. Construction spending increased 3.8% on a year-on-year basis in November.
Spending on private construction projects increased 1.2%, fueled by investment in single-family homebuilding amid record-low mortgage rates and a pandemic-driven migration to suburbs and low-density areas. That followed a 1.6% advance in October.
Spending on residential projects increased 2.7% after surging 3.2% in October. 
But outlays on nonresidential construction like gas and oil well drilling fell 0.8% in November. The pandemic has depressed prices, leading to a contraction in spending on nonresidential structures in the third quarter. The fourth straight quarterly drop in investment in nonresidential structures bucked a rebound in overall business investment.
Spending on public construction projects eased 0.2% in November after rising 1.6% in October. State and local government outlays edged up 0.1%, while federal government spending dropped 4.2%.

""Nonresidential and public construction remain subdued owing to weak demand related to disruptions from virus containment as well as budget constraints,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.

Still, IHS Markit's final manufacturing purchasing managers' survey of a rocky 2020, released on Monday, showed the sector's rebound was uneven. Consumer goods makers saw weaker order flow as COVID-19 infections surged and limited consumer spending, while producers of machinery and equipment noted strong demand in a potential sign of improving business investment, said Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit.
IHS Markit said its manufacturing PMI climbed to 57.1 in December from 56.7 in November. The index also improved from its preliminary - or ""flash"" - reading in mid-December of 56.5, with a reading above 50 signaling expansion in activity.
The index finished 2020 at its highest level since September 2014, with December's gain marking the eighth straight month of improvement after plunging to its lowest in more than a decade in April when the first rounds of business shutdowns to contain COVID-19 were in full swing.
With output moderating to 58.3 last month from 59.2 in November, the headline index's improvement was driven largely by a strong pricing environment, IHS Markit said. Its output price index rose to its highest since May 2011.

""Amid a significant deterioration in vendor performance, cost burdens and selling prices soared, as firms sought to partially pass on higher input prices,"" IHS Markit said in a statement. ""Output expectations moderated slightly, however, as the post-election spike eased and virus cases surged once again.""

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 57.9 in December from 55.8 in November, the sixth straight month that the PMI was above the 50 threshold that marks expansion in the sector.
It was the highest level for the index since the survey began in October 2010.
The data ""indicated the Canadian manufacturing sector concluded 2020 with a record month-on-month improvement in business conditions,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. ""New orders and output supported the latest rise with robust increases registered.""
Demand conditions continued to improve in both domestic and foreign markets, said IHS Markit, adding that the rise in new work from abroad was attributed by purchasing managers to rising demand from clients in the U.S. and Asia.
Increased manufacturing workloads contributed to the strongest job creation in over two years, IHS Markit said. Less encouraging was mounting capacity and supply chain pressures, with the latter often linked by manufacturers to coronavirus-related restrictions.
""Relatively high virus case numbers still pose a threat to the industry should restrictions tighten again,"" said Patel.
A number of Canadian provinces have announced tighter economic restrictions as a second wave of coronavirus sweeps across Canada.

Still, the data showed that Canadian manufacturers remain upbeat about their prospects for growth over the next 12 months. The measure of future output rose to a three-month high of 64.1 from 62.9 in November.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Manufacturers across Europe ended 2020 on a high while Asian factory activity expanded moderately thanks to robust demand in regional giant China, surveys showed, but the prospect of tougher coronavirus curbs clouded the outlook for the recovery.
Despite hopes that vaccination programmes being rolled out will eventually quell the virus, a resurgence of infections is forcing many countries to reimpose strict controls on economic activity, possibly hurting large exporters such as China and Germany.
""Global manufacturing was still on a roll until the middle of December which is a very good basis for an economic rebound once the current wave of the pandemic subsides,"" said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg.
""We may have a modest setback in January as renewed lockdowns affect manufacturing but with China remaining fairly strong and the U.S. not showing significant signs of a consumer slowdown the outlook for manufacturing is still good.""
Activity in euro zone manufacturing increased at its fastest pace since mid-2018 last month, suggesting the bloc's economy was less hard hit by the pandemic than earlier in the year.
IHS Markit's final euro zone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 55.2 in December from November's 53.8, although that was below the initial 55.5 ""flash"" estimate.

Manufacturing activity expanded in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, according to PMI surveys, the latest indication manufacturers in Asia continue to bounce back from the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic last year.
But a slowdown in China's factory activity growth underscored the challenges. China's Caixin/Markit PMI fell in December to 53.0 - its lowest level in three months - but stayed well above the 50 level.
""External demand was likely impacted by the continued global spread of COVID-19 and reimplementation of lockdowns,"" HSBC's China economist Erin Xin said in a research note.
The reading, lower than November's 54.9, fell roughly in line with the official gauge of factory activity that showed activity moderating at a high level.

The most recent official data, for October, showed factory output was 7.1% lower than a year earlier, largely due to reduced demand in consumer-facing industries as a result of COVID-19 shutdowns.
IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said he did not think December's surge in activity would last.
""Customers, especially those based in the EU, brought forward purchases, boosting sales temporarily. It seems likely that this boost will reverse in the opening months of 2021, making for a weak start to the year,"" he said.

The survey showed manufacturers stockpiled materials at the fastest rate since March 2019 - when there were also fears of disruption to trade with the EU - and that delivery times were the slowest since the initial lockdown in April and May.
Throughout December there were delays at British ports, culminating in a lengthy blockage at Dover (NYSE:DOV) just before Christmas after France shut the border following the identification in Britain of a new, more infectious, variant of the coronavirus.

""HUGE DIVERGENCE""
The modest improvements in manufacturing activities were in contrast to sharp rises in stock prices, which some analysts say have benefited from ample global monetary stimulus but are not justified by the continued weakness in many economies.
Japan's Nikkei average ended 2020 up 66% from the year's low hit in March, even as the world's third-largest economy suffered a deep recession due to the hit from COVID-19.
A slowdown in U.S. business activity in mid-December did little to halt a surge in equities that drove up the S&P 500 index by over 16% last year.
""We're seeing a huge divergence between the dismal state of the economy and zooming stock markets, as investors price in a best-case scenario under which vaccines will help contain the pandemic this year,"" said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research in Tokyo.
""Things might not turn out as rosy as investors believe, which means asset prices could already be experiencing a bubble. But for now, investors have little choice but to ride the tide.""
China's industrial sector has staged an impressive recovery from the coronavirus shock thanks to surprisingly strong exports, helping brighten prospects for Asia's recovery.
But a resurgence of infections is forcing some western countries to reimpose strict controls on economic activity, clouding the outlook for exports including those from China.

Japan may join other countries in applying tighter restrictions with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga signalling on Monday the chance of declaring a state of emergency for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures.

Investing.com – China’s factory activity continued its recovery towards pre-COVID-19 levels, a business survey said. However, rising cost pressures are slowing the pace of expansion in the world’s second largest economy.
The Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) released earlier in the day, showed a reading of 53 for December. Although the figure stayed above the 50-level indicating expansion, it was lower than the 54.8 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 54.9 reading. Growth also eased to softest pace in three months.
Strong exports have buoyed the Chinese industrial sector towards a rapid recovery from the COVID-19 economic impact in 2020. The expected growth of around 2% in the economy for the whole of 2020 is the weakest pace of growth in over 30 years but stronger than other major economies that are seeing surges in the number of COVID-19 cases.
However, the prospect of tougher coronavirus control measures in many key trading partners in the west could dampen industrial demand and hamper the recovery. China is also dealing with its own cluster of COVID-19 cases.
The data follows National Bureau of Statistics’ release of the manufacturing PMI and the non-manufacturing PMI during the previous week. The manufacturing PMI was at 51.9 in December, down from the reading of 52 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 52.1 figure. The non-manufacturing PMI was at 55.7, also down from November’s reading of 56.4.
“The negative impact of the pandemic on the domestic economy further subsided and the manufacturing industry continued to recover. Both the supply and demand sides continued to improve. Overseas demand also steadily increased,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a note accompanying the survey release.
The survey also showed that input prices rose at the fastest pace since 2017, with pricier raw materials, especially metals, blamed for the hike. In terms of employment, Chinese factories also laid off more workers than they hired for the first time in four months. However, the decline was modest.
“We need to pay attention to the mounting pressure on costs brought by the increase in raw material prices and its adverse impact on employment, which is particularly important for the design of the exit from stimulus policies implemented during the epidemic,” the note added.
Wang’s note remained cautiously optimistic, however. Gauges of both total new orders and factory output remained strong, although they were lower than November’s figures, and growth in new export orders also slowed.
“We expect the economic recovery in the post-epidemic era to continue for several months, and macroeconomic indicators will be stronger in the next six months, taking into account the low bases in the first half of 2020,” the note said."

""Businesses reported a sustained increase in optimism, with a third of respondents predicting a rise in output over the coming 12 months,"" Bhatti said.
The survey results were not completely rosy, with export orders falling at a faster rate for the second straight month thanks to restrictions recently imposed over the coronavirus in major export markets, particularly in Europe.
Purchases also fell at a quicker pace from the previous month, with lower production and order volumes leading to a reduction in raw material purchases.

New home prices in 100 cities rose 0.25% in December from a month earlier versus a 0.32% gain in November, moderating for the second straight month, according to data from China Index Academy (CIA), one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms.
More cities reported monthly gains, however, with the number climbing to 79 from 71 in November, and 19 cities saw lower home prices compared with 28 in the preceding month, the CIA data showed. 
Dongguan and Guangzhou, two cities in the southern Greater Bay Area, led the price rises. While central and northern cities like Luoyang and Zhangjiakou saw the biggest monthly price drops.
""With the government's market-cooling steps taking hold, the overall price gains remained on a mild level,"" said Cao Jingjing, Research Director with CIA.
""The cooling growth is also weighed by deepening price drops in some smaller cities which saw a withered local economy and continued population outflow.""
On an annual basis, new home prices rose 3.46% in December, versus November's 3.63% gain.
For the whole year of 2020, new home prices rose 3.46%, slightly more than 3.34% seen in 2019, the CIA data showed. 
China's property market has recovered quickly from the COVID-19 pandemic early last year, thanks to cheaper credit and looser purchase restrictions.
But with the economy nearly fully recovered to pre-coronavirus levels, policymakers have been turning their attention back to containing financial risks in the highly leveraged sector, ramping up scrutiny of financing activities of developers and buyers.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports expanded at their fastest pace in 26 months in December, on robust chip demand and improved global demand, providing additional signals that the recovery is on track despite resurgences in the novel coronavirus.
Exports in the final month of 2020 grew 12.6% year-on-year, the sharpest growth since October 2018 when it grew 22.5%, government data showed on Friday.
The rate of growth was sharply higher than forecast as analysts had expected a 5.6% jump from a year earlier, and was much faster than a 4.1% growth in November.
""Semiconductor exports were exceptionally strong, with 11 of 15 major export items posting growth ... sales of IT products boosted the overall growth,"" a trade ministry official told Reuters.
South Korea's monthly trade data, the first to be released among major exporting economies, is considered a bellwether for global trade.
Overseas sales of semiconductors surged 30% from a year earlier, marking the sharpest expansion since August 2018, towing the overall exports recovery.
Other major items such as mobile devices, displays and computers also soared 39.8%, 28.0% and 14.7% year-on-year.
By destination, exports to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, gained 3.3% from a year ago, and those to the United States and European Union jumped 11.6% and 26.4%.
Imports rose 1.8%, reversing a 1.9% decline in November and marking the best reading since April 2019. Reuters' poll had expected a 2.6% decline.
Meanwhile, for the whole of 2020, South Korea's exports slid 5.4% as the coronavirus pandemic swept world trade, but that was much better than a 10.4% fall in 2019, the worst in a decade and the third-worst in the country's modern history.

(Reuters) - Fewer Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, but the modest drop did little to dispel concerns that the U.S. job market and wider economy face an arduous recovery from the devastation inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.
The final major economic data point for a year that saw a recession of historic magnitude erupt out of nowhere stood as a fitting reminder for both how far the recovery has progressed and how much more it has to go.
While new claims for benefits reported by the U.S. Labor Department on Thursday dropped for the second week in a row to a seasonally adjusted 787,000 in the week ended Dec. 26 from 806,000 a week before, it left them at roughly the level they were three months ago and with little indication they would show material improvement any time soon.
The arrival of effective COVID-19 vaccines and additional federal pandemic aid have set the stage for a brighter 2021. But economists agree the still-raging epidemic and the fractured government response to it means more difficult months ahead before improvement takes hold. 
""While prospects for the economy later in 2021 are upbeat, the economy and labor market will have to navigate some difficult terrain between now and then and we expect claims to remain elevated,"" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note.
COVID-19's unexpected appearance late last year and rapid spread in early 2020 brought an abrupt end to a record-long U.S. economic expansion that had fostered the strongest job market in generations. It also brought down the global economy, dashing hopes for a second straight decade of uninterrupted growth and widening prosperity.
(Graphic: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/ygdvzjeekvw/joblessclaims.png)
JOBS DROP IN DECEMBER?
The report also showed that as of mid-December, more than 19.5 million people were receiving some form of jobless aid, including from emergency measures extended by the latest coronavirus aid bill that was passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump. Those emergency programs now account for roughly two-thirds of all ongoing jobless assistance. 
As of Dec. 19, the number of people continuing to draw benefits under regular state unemployment insurance programs declined to 5.219 million, the lowest since March, from 5.322 million the week before. Economists took little solace from that decline, however, seeing it more the result of people exhausting benefits rather than finding new work.
The elevated level of claims aligns with other recent weak economic reports, including a decline in consumer confidence to a four-month low in December and drops in both consumer spending and income last month. 
With persistently high COVID-19 infection levels forcing renewed restrictions on businesses and consumer activity around the country, some economists now see a chance that overall U.S. employment has fallen this month for the first time since April, when 20.8 million people lost jobs in a single month.
While payrolls have risen each month since then, the total level of employment remains roughly 10 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level.
Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), said this week the company's in-house economic activity index, which tracks the recovery through high-frequency measures, has fallen to a three-week low, led by weakness in measures of consumer spending and employment.
""Taken at face value, our data suggest further downside for retail sales and raise the prospect of an outright contraction in December employment,"" Markowska wrote. ""However, with more fiscal stimulus on the way, we expect the negative momentum to reverse in January.""
The Labor Department will issued December's employment data on Jan. 8.

PANDEMIC RELIEF TUSSLE 
The latest report's end date - Dec. 26 - was when as many as 14 million people were set to lose jobless benefits provided by a $3 trillion pandemic relief bill enacted in the spring. That was a cliff that lawmakers had raced to avoid by passing a nearly $900 billion supplemental package in the days before Christmas, including $600 payments to most individuals and extensions of unemployment benefits and eviction moratoriums. 
Trump, however, railed against the deal negotiated by his own Treasury secretary, demanding higher payments to individuals, and did not sign it into law until Sunday after extensive badgering by senior lawmakers in his Republican Party.
It was unclear whether that lapse had a material effect on last week's data or what impact it might have on the level of claims in the current week and into the new year.

""The new stimulus package is a life preserver, but containing the virus is the only way to completely end the economic chaos,"" AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, said in a note. ""Even then, a full recovery will have to clear the hurdle of mounting long-term joblessness.""

Investing.com – China’s factory activity continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace, in December. Export demand continued to fuel economic recovery, but growth was slowed by higher labor and transport costs.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) earlier in the day showed the manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) at 51.9, down from the reading of 52 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 52.1 figure. The non-manufacturing PMI was at 55.7, also down from November’s reading of 56.4. Both PMIs remained above the 50-mark indicating expansion.
NBS economist Zhao Qinghe said despite the slight fall in the PMI “the overall manufacturing industry maintained a good momentum of steady recovery”
The world’s second-largest economy continued its recovery from tough COVID-19-induced lockdowns earlier in the year, with Christmas demand boosting overseas demand for manufactured goods and an uptick in domestic activity. With the pandemic largely under control in most of the country, China is still on track to be the only major economy that reported growth in 2020. Economists have forecast an expansion of around 2% for the full year, the weakest pace in over three decades but much stronger than other major economies.
Demand for medical equipment and work-from-home electric devices have continued to prop up exports, which surged in the run-up to the end of the year and the holiday season as the number of COVID-19 cases globally continue to rise incessantly.
There are over 82.6 million COVID-19 cases globally as of Dec. 31, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
However, severe cold weather and power shortages in parts of the country in December, on top of winter output restrictions in industries such as steel and coal, could weigh on production.
Tighter COVID-19 control measures in many of China’s key trading partners, including the U.S. could also put a dent in industrial demand and weigh in on the recovery.
An outbreak of COVID-19 cases has seen Beijing impose lockdowns on the impacted areas, the first since the outbreak in June and July, could also dampen demand as it comes ahead of the peak travel season.
However, some investors remained optimistic.
“It is still a level that is consistent with very solid growth,” Qian Wang, Asia-Pacific chief economist at Vanguard Group Inc., told Bloomberg.
“The Chinese economy seems to be holding up pretty well in spite of the second wave on the external side.”"

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity expanded in December as hot export demand fueled a recovery in the world's second-largest economy from the coronavirus slump, although higher labour and transport costs slowed the pace of growth.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell to 51.9 in December from 52.1 in November, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Thursday.
The index remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction but was a tad below the 52.0 in a Reuters' poll of analysts.
China's vast industrial sector has staged an impressive recovery from the coronavirus shock thanks to surprisingly strong exports.

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed the sub-index for new export orders stood at 51.3 in December, easing from 51.5 a month earlier. 
But an index for factory prices rose strongly, reflecting solid overseas demand as well as increased shipping costs, even though some export markets are under lockdown, said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING.
Economic indicators ranging from trade to producer prices all suggest a further pickup in the industrial sector.
A sub-index for small business activity stood at 48.8 in December, sharply down from November's 50.1 and returning to contraction.
Zhao Qinghe, an official at the NBS, said in a statement accompanying the data release that small businesses were pressured by higher labour, raw material and distribution costs.
""Small manufacturers also suffer from the problem of hiring labour as the service sector in China is competing for workers,"" said Pang.
A sub-index for employment in the official PMI stood at 49.6 in December, slightly up from November's 49.5. 
China has also seen strong improvement in retail sales driven by firm demand for autos and communication equipment.
In the services sector, activity expanded for the 10th straight month, albeit at a somewhat slower clip. An indicator for construction activity rose at a faster pace.

Ahead of China's peak travel season, the capital Beijing imposed lockdowns on some COVID-infected areas, the first since the last coronavirus outbreak in the months of June and July.

The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 55.7 in December from 56.4 in November, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Though slower than manufacturing, China's services sector, which includes many smaller and private companies, has posted solid growth thanks to strong domestic demand.

210,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes fell for a third straight month in November as an acute shortage of properties pushed up prices, though the housing market remains supported by record-low mortgage rates.
The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, fell 2.6% last month to 125.7. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, would be unchanged in November from the month before.
Compared with a year ago, pending home sales jumped 16.4% in November. Sales of existing homes have slackened recently, declining in November for the first time in six months.
The housing market is being driven by record low mortgage rates. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen at least 21% of the labor force working from home, has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out more spacious accommodation for home offices and schools.
The coronavirus-triggered recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners. At least 20 million people are on unemployment benefits. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average 2.86%, according to the most recent data from the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Housing supply has failed to keep up with demand, boosting home prices out of the reach of many first-time buyers, despite builders ramping up construction. 
Though homebuilder confidence is at historic highs, builders have complained about shortages of land and materials.

Pending home sales declined in all four regions. They fell 1.1% in the South, 4.7% in the West, 3.3% in the Northeast, and 3.1% in the Midwest.

LONDON (Reuters) -British house prices rose faster than expected in December to record their biggest annual increase in six years, as tax incentives and COVID-driven appetite for larger homes continued to boost demand, mortgage lender Nationwide said.
House prices rose by 0.8% in December alone, barely slowing from the 0.9% recorded in November, and were 7.3% higher than a year earlier, well above forecasts in a Reuters poll for a 6.7% rise.
After a collapse in house purchases during the first months of lockdown, there has been a surge in demand to move house, driven in part by a temporary exemption of property purchase taxes which will expire at the end of March.
Nationwide said the strength of the housing market contrasted with weakness in some other parts of the economy - especially those exposed to renewed COVID-19 restrictions - and said the outlook for prices in 2021 was highly uncertain.
""Housing market activity is likely to slow in the coming quarters, perhaps sharply, if the labour market weakens as most analysts expect, especially once the stamp duty holiday expires at the end of March,"" Nationwide economist Robert Gardner said.
So far furlough payments and similar support for the self-employed had limited the impact of a historic 26% fall in economic output on the housing market, against most economists' earlier expectations, he added.

Demand for detached homes had risen most, with an average rise of just over 8% in the past 12 months, while prices for flats had risen by 4%.

The 3,065 foreign tourists in November is just a fraction of the 3.39 million arrivals in the same period last year. In October, there were 1,201 foreign visitors.
Though the country is gradually opening up to foreign visitors and offering incentives to boost domestic travel, efforts to revive its tourism-driven economy are being hampered by an outbreak found 10 days ago that has since infected more than 1,600 people in 43 provinces.
In the January-November period, the number of foreign visitors slumped by 81% from a year earlier to about 6.7 million of that 6.69 million were recorded in the first quarter. 
That compares with last year's nearly 40 million tourists who spent 1.91 trillion baht ($63 billion), or about 11.3% of gross domestic product.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output growth stalled in November after rising for five months, underscoring the fragile nature of the global economic recovery due to a recent resurgence in COVID-19 infections.
The world's third-largest economy recovered sharply in the third quarter from its worst postwar contraction, but lockdown measures in some major economies in response to a new wave of coronavirus infections threatens to hurt demand.
Official data released on Monday showed factory output was flat in November from the previous month, as declining output of cars and plastic products offset strength in production and general machinery output.
The flat reading was much slower than the prior month's final 4.0% gain, and below the median market forecast of a 1.2% rise in a Reuters poll of economists.
""The recovery pace is slowing a little more than expected,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
Tsunoda still expected the positive trend in output to continue largely because of underlying strength in Japan's exports, which are heavily focused on Asia.
""Demand for high-tech and IT-related products is currently expanding, so I think that will provide support,"" he said.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to decline 1.1% in December and see a sharp 7.1% rebound in January.
The government kept its assessment of industrial production unchanged, saying it was picking up.
Factory output has been recovering from a pandemic-induced downturn earlier this year, helped particularly by solid global demand for cars. Car output in November suffered from falling shipments to the United States and Australia, a government official said.
Some analysts worry that new virus infections around the world, especially in Europe and the United States, may prevent demand for Japan's manufactured goods to grow further as corporate and consumer activity take a hit.
Separate data released on Friday showed Tokyo consumer prices in December fell at their fastest pace since September 2010, while nationwide retail sales slowed in November.

Profits at Chinese industrial firms rose 15.5% from a year earlier to 729.32 billion yuan ($111.50 billion), easing from October's three-year high 28.2%, data from National Bureau of Statistics showed on Sunday. 
China's industrial sector has seen a strong rebound from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic, aided by a stunning export comeback as factories ramp up to meet demand overseas. Factory-gate prices, a gauge for profitability, fell less than expected last month. 
The pullback of growth in November was mainly due to a higher base a year earlier, said Zhu Hong, a senior statistician at the statistics bureau.
""Profits at some traditional industries have showed improvement. With the approach of heating season, demand for thermal coal has risen and prices have increased, leading to an accelerated recovery in the coal sector,"" Zhu said in a statement. 
Coal industry profits rose 9.1% in November, the first increase this year. 
""Industrial profits are expected to maintain double-digit growth over the next few months, driven by low base effects, domestic economic recovery, improvements in overseas demand and the rebound in commodity prices benefiting the upstream sector,"" said analyst Zhou Maohua at China Everbright (OTC:CHFFF) Bank. 
For the January-November period, industrial firms' profits rose 2.4% from a year earlier, accelerating from the 0.7% gain recorded for the first 10 months.
Earnings at China's state-owned industrial firms were down 4.9% for January-November, narrowing from the 7.5% decline in the first 10 months.

U.S. ecommerce sales jumped 49% in this year's holiday shopping season, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse report, underscoring the COVID-19 pandemic's role in transforming customers' shopping habits.
Holiday e-commerce sales made up 19.7% of total retail sales this year, the data showed, noting that options such as buy online and pick-up-in-store, contactless technologies were key for retailers.
The holiday shopping season can account for the majority of certain retailers' annual sales, but the health crisis meant several retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), faced with capacity constraints in certain stores, rolled out their holiday promotions early.
E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) also pushed back its annual summer promotional event to October, marking a longer-than-ever holiday season for retailers who missed out on sales for several weeks during the lockdowns earlier this year.
""This was a healthier holiday season than many had forecast,"" senior advisor for Mastercard Steve Sadove told Reuters in an interview. 
Sadove believes the digital trend will continue to grow in 2021, with smaller retailers also embracing new technology to offer customers new ways to shop. 
People spending longer at home due to extended work-from-home and remote learning policies have fueled demand for home decor and home-improvement products, with retail sales in the home furniture and furnishings category jumping 16.2% according to the report.
Electronics and appliances also rose 6% during the period, as a reduction in spending on dining out, travel and leisure encouraged shoppers to make other purchases.
Sales of apparel and jewelry slumped overall, but e-commerce sales rose 15.7% and 44.6%. 

The SpendingPulse report tracks spending by combining sales activity in Mastercard's payments network with estimates of cash and other payment forms but excludes automobile sales.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Tokyo consumer prices fell the fastest in more than a decade, while Japan's jobs market and retail sales remained subdued, data showed on Friday, raising the risks of a return to deflation as the COVID-19 pandemic hammers demand.
The world's third-biggest economy recovered in the three months to September from its worst postwar contraction, but a third wave of the coronavirus infections threatens the economic revival. The Bank of Japan unveiled a plan last week to examine more effective ways to achieve its elusive 2% inflation target.
The core consumer price index (CPI) for Japan's capital, including oil products but excluding fresh food, fell 0.9% in December from a year earlier, the steepest drop since September 2010.
That was deeper than economists' median estimate for a 0.8% fall and deepened from a 0.7% decline in November. The December drop was the fastest downturn since September 2010, when core consumer prices slumped 1.0%.
Nationwide data last week for November also showed the steepest price slump since late 2010. 
""There is a chance that the nation will return to deflation due to the coronavirus pandemic,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""Private demand is weak as people, especially older people, stay home to keep from getting infected, making it difficult for prices to rise.""
Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 2.9%, better the median forecast of 3.1%, government data showed. In October, the jobless rate stood at 3.1%.
There were 1.06 jobs per applicant in November, up from the previous month's 1.04, labour ministry data showed, but still near September's seven-year low 1.03.
The pandemic remained a drag on consumer spending, with a renewed spike in infections raising fresh risks for a weakened economy. 

Japanese retail sales a moderate 0.7% in November from a year earlier, the second straight gain but slower than October's 6.4% jump and below the median market forecast for a 1.7% gain.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, though remaining elevated as more businesses face restrictions and consumers hunker down amid an explosion of new COVID-19 cases.
The raging pandemic and delays by Congress to approve another rescue package are sapping energy from the economy as the curtain closes down on a brutal year. Other data on Wednesday showed consumer spending dropping in November for the first time since the recovery from the coronavirus recession started in May. Spending was depressed by a plunge in income.
Even housing, the economy's star performer is getting tired, with sales of new single-family homes tumbling to a five-month low in November. The reports followed on the heels of data on Tuesday showing consumer confidence slumping to a four-month low in December. 
They bolstered analysts' predictions of a sharp slowdown in growth in the fourth quarter after fiscal stimulus led to a historic surge in gross domestic product in the third quarter. 
""The economy lost momentum in November,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 89,000 to a seasonally adjusted 803,000 for the week ended Dec. 19, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 885,000 applications in the latest week.
(Graphic: U.S. jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dgkplqqwrvb/joblessclaims.png)
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.3 million people filed claims. There were about 20.4 million people collecting unemployment benefits in early December.
Congress on Monday approved additional fiscal stimulus worth almost $900 billion, but economists said this was too little and too late. President Donald Trump has threatened not to sign the relief bill because he wants Congress to raise the amount in the stimulus checks to $2,000 for individuals, instead of the $600 that is in the legislation. 
Economists expect a chunk of the stimulus checks will be saved. Health experts also warn it could take a while for herd immunity to the virus, suggesting that more government aid would be needed to support the economy through at least summer. 
The United States is being battered by a new wave of coronavirus cases, with more than 18 million people infected and over 320,000 dead, according to a Reuters tally of official data. State and local governments have re-imposed restrictions on businesses, undercutting consumer spending and unleashing a fresh round of layoffs. 
More than $3 trillion in government aid led to a 33.4% annualized GDP growth rate in the third quarter following a 31.4% pace of contraction in the April-June period.
Though jobless claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March, they remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. Some economists attributed the surprise drop in claims last week to states cracking down on fraud. Claims are also volatile this time of the year.
""The labor market is still much worse than it was before the pandemic, and the pace of improvement has slowed since the summer,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
U.S. stocks were higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
INCOME FALLING
A second report from the Commerce Department showed consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, fell 0.4% in November after gaining 0.3% in October. Consumers cut back on purchases of goods like new motor vehicles, clothing and footwear, offsetting increases in spending on food and beverages from supermarkets and liquor stores. They also slashed spending at restaurants and bars, as well as on accommodation and household electricity and gas.
Personal income decreased 1.1% in November, pulled down by the expiration of a government loan program for businesses hit by COVID-19. There were also declines in coronavirus-related government payments to farmers and ranchers, as well as unemployment subsidies. It was the fifth drop in income in seven months. As a result, Americans dipped into savings. The saving rate fell to a still-high 12.9% from 13.6% in October. 
With consumer spending weak, inflation remained muted. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components increased 1.4% year-on-year in November, matching October's gain. The so-called core PCE index is the preferred inflation measure for the Federal Reserve's 2% target, a flexible average.

A third report from the Commerce Department showed business spending rising in November, though the pace has slowed. Still, business investment could blunt some of the impact of slowing consumer spending and keep the economy on a moderate growth path this quarter.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.4% last month after jumping 1.6% in October.
The department also reported that new home sales plunged 11.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 841,000 units last month, the lowest level since June.

Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% rate. Economists expect modest growth or even a contraction in the first quarter of 2021.

New home sales tumbled 11.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 841,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. October's sales pace was revised down to 945,000 units from the previously reported 999,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11.2% of housing market sales, slipping 0.3% to a rate of 995,000 units in November. New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from building permits and tend to be volatile month-to-month.
New home sales jumped 20.8% on a year-on-year basis. The government reported last week that single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, rose in November to the highest level since April 2007.
But persistent shortages of land, materials and skilled labor are raising construction costs for builders. A report on Tuesday showed sales of previously owned homes fell in November after five straight monthly increases.
The housing market, the economy's star performer, is being supported by pent-up demand and historically low mortgage rates. The COVID-19 pandemic has left 21.8% of the labor force working from home. That has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out spacious accommodation for home offices and schooling.
The coronavirus recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.67 percent, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). That is the lowest rate since the agency started tracking the data in 1971.
In November, new home sales fell in all four regions.

The median new house price rose 2.2% to $335,300 in November from a year ago. There were 286,000 new homes on the market last month, up from 281,000 from October. At November's sales pace it would take 4.1 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 3.6 months in October.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders increasing 0.7% in November. Core capital goods orders increased 0.8% year-on-year in November.
The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted demand away from services like travel and hospitality towards goods. Orders last month were boosted by demand for electrical equipment, appliances and components, computers and electronic products, primary metals and machinery.
Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.4% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They surged 2.6% in October.
Business investment on equipment rebounded strongly in the third quarter after five straight quarterly declines. Spending on equipment could help to blunt the impact of slower consumer spending on GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending is being hampered by a resurgence in new coronavirus infections and a delay by Congress to approve another rescue package.
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% annualized rate. The economy rebounded at a record 33.4% rate in the third quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, rose 0.9% in November after advancing 1.8% in October.
Durable goods orders were lifted by 1.9% jump in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 1.5% advance in October. Orders for civilian aircraft fell 2.8%.

Investing.com -- The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell unexpectedly last week, but remained above 800,000 for the third week in a row.
The Labor Department said there were 803,000 initial claims last week, down from 892,000 the week before. The previous week’s numbers were revised up by 7,000 and were the highest since early September.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial ones, fell to 5.337 million, from 5.507 million. Economists had expected an increase of some 50,000 ahead of time. Even so, with another 14 million Americans enrolled in two other pandemic-related unemployment benefit programs, the total number of those receiving benefits remained at over 20 million as of December 5th. 
The figures reflect sustained pressure on the economy from the most recent wave of the pandemic, which has seen states and cities shut a large part of their economies to stop the spread of Covid-19. Infection curves are now starting to flatten, but the number of people admitted to hospital with the disease remains at a record high of over 117,000.
Other data released Wednesday reflected similar trends: personal income fell by 1.1% in November, more than expected and the biggest drop in four months, as many Americans' eligibility for enhanced unemployment benefits expired.  At the same time, durable goods orders rose by the least in seven months, at only 0.4%. Spending on durable goods, especially electronics and furnishings, has held up relatively well this year as households have diverted spending away from services in response to being locked down or forced to work from home.
The figures are the first to be released Congress approved a $900 billion relief package that aims to provide a safety net for those who have lost their work due to the pandemic and the public health measures imposed in order to contain it. The new bill includes another 11-week extension for enhanced unemployment benefits, as well as direct payments of $600 for those on low and medium incomes, with additional payments for dependents. 
The bill, which also includes an extension of the ban on evictions, should help cushion the recent slowdown in the economy, 
President Donald Trump late Tuesday demanded changes to the package before he would sign it, arguing for bigger direct checks to households. The bill passed both chambers of Congress with veto-proof majorities.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian firms turned most optimistic in the fourth quarter this year, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed, as business activity picked up in the region and COVID-19 vaccines started rolling out in Western countries ahead of their Asian launch.
The outlook for Asian companies in the next six months tracked by the Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index jumped to 62 this quarter from 53 in the third quarter.
The latest number according to the survey of 101 firms across 11 Asia-Pacific countries was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2019. A reading above 50 indicates a positive outlook.
""There's a sense of optimism going forward,"" said Antonio Fatas, Singapore-based economics professor at global business school INSEAD.
""Things are getting better but they are getting better with still a dose of uncertainty. The effect of the crisis is very different across sectors,"" he added, noting the weakness in the transport sector due to curbs on global travel.
Still, more than half the respondents polled flagged persistent cases of the novel coronavirus as well as the possible scarcity of vaccines in parts of the world - at least initially - as their biggest risk.
While the United States and Britain have already started vaccinating their populations, few Asian countries expect to get significant amounts of coronavirus vaccines in coming weeks.
Some Asian countries are still running their own late-stage trials of vaccines, while others are allowing time to check for any side effects in people inoculated elsewhere.
A quarter of the companies in the survey, which was conducted between Dec. 4-18, were most concerned about businesses cutting jobs, which would hurt consumption.
Yet others flagged as their top risks a withdrawal of stimulus by central banks, and newly elected United States President Joe Biden keeping a tough line on China.
The coronavirus pandemic has brought on the worst global economic slowdown since the Great Depression, with millions of jobs lost and industries brought to their knees.
Still, Asia, which has had greater success in controlling the virus than Europe and the United States, is leading hopes of an economic recovery.

""After a year marked by economic contraction, 2021 stands to be the 'year of the phoenix', with a strong rebound in global gross domestic product and corporate earnings in 2021 thanks to the unrolling of vaccines and substantial policy support,"" said Cesar Perez Ruiz, chief investment officer at Pictet Wealth Management.
A recovery to pre-pandemic levels in China, the world's second-largest economy, has fuelled revival hopes. Equity markets in China, South Korea and Taiwan are up at least 20% this year, leading the region's gains.
According to the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) INSEAD survey, some 44% of the companies polled in the fourth quarter were positive about their outlook for the next six months, up sharply from 28% in the third quarter and nearly 8% in the second.
About 58% of the firms said they did not hire or lay off people this quarter, and a fifth said staffing levels were lower. This was similar to numbers in the third quarter. In the second quarter, 62% of the companies said they had cut jobs.
""While I still see some uncertainty, the numbers are good,"" said Fatas. ""It looks like a recovery that is taking speed and where more businesses feel confident.""
Companies polled included India's Housing Development Finance Corp Ltd, Japanese car maker Suzuki Motor Corp, and Thai electronics company Delta Electronics (Thailand) PCL.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence dropped for a second straight month in December as a deterioration in the labor market amid renewed business restrictions to slow the raging pandemic offset the rolling out of a vaccine for COVID-19.
The decline in confidence to a four-month low reported by the Conference Board on Tuesday was the latest indication that the economic recovery from the pandemic was losing steam, also because of delays by Congress to approve another rescue package.
The government confirmed on Tuesday that the economy grew at a historic pace in the third quarter, juiced up by more than $3 trillion in pandemic relief. Congress on Monday approved additional fiscal stimulus worth almost $900 billion, but economists said this was insufficient and too late to counter a bleak winter of rising coronavirus infections and layoffs.
""The storm clouds are growing darker and the worst may be yet to come,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The new coronavirus outbreak means the economy will be flirting with disaster in the first quarter of 2021 where a downturn is possible despite Congress throwing more money our way."" 
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 88.6 this month, the lowest since August, from 92.9 in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index ticking up to 97.0 in December. The index was at 132.6 in February. The cut-off date for the survey was Dec. 14. 
Two vaccines have since been approved for use to combat the respiratory illness, which economists believe will limit further downside in consumer confidence. 
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, tumbled to a reading of 90.3 this month from 105.9 in November. The expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions increased to 87.5 from a reading of 84.3 in November.
The United States is struggling with a resurgence in new coronavirus cases, with more than 17.78 million people infected and over 317,800 dead, according to a Reuters tally of official data. State and local governments have re-imposed restrictions on businesses, undercutting consumer spending and unleashing a fresh wave of layoffs. 
The decline in consumer confidence followed data this month showing the economy in November added the fewest jobs since the jobs recovery started in May. Retail sales decreased in November for a second straight month and the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits is at three-month high. 
The worsening employment outlook was underscored by the Conference Board survey, which showed its so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, tumbled to a reading of -0.2 this month from 6.9 in November. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. It was as high as 38.3 in August last year.

December's contraction strengthens economists' expectations for a decline in nonfarm payrolls this month. The government will publish December's employment report in January.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
LITTLE SPEED
The share of consumers expecting an increase in income rose to 16.8% from 16.0% in November. The proportion anticipating a drop slipped to 14.3% from 14.5% last month. 
Fewer consumers expected to purchase homes and motor vehicles over the next six months, relative to November's survey. But more consumers planned purchases of appliances like refrigerators and television sets.
That suggests some cooling ahead for housing, the star of the recovery. A separate report from the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday show existing home sales fell 2.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.69 million units in November. That followed five straight monthly increases.
GRAPHIC: Existing home sales - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/rlgpdqagevo/ehs.png 
The housing market is being driven by record low interest rates, but surging home prices amid a dearth of properties is sidelining many first-time buyers.
Robust housing and consumer spending helped to power the economy last quarter. Gross domestic product rebounded at a 33.4% annualized rate in the July-Sept quarter, the Commerce Department said in its third estimate of GDP on Tuesday. That was revised up from the 33.1% pace reported last month and recouped two thirds of output lost during the pandemic.
GRAPHIC: GDP - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xlbpgmzyypq/gdp.png 
The economy plunged into recession in February and output remains 3.4% below its level at the end of 2019. The economy contracted at a 31.4% rate in the April-June quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
Twenty-one industries led by the automobile sector contributed to GDP growth last quarter. Mining was the only drag as cheaper oil weighed on businesses' spending on residential structures like gas and oil well drilling. 
Corporate profits also rebounded strongly last quarter. But performance has been overtaken by the relentless pandemic, leaving GDP growth estimates for the fourth quarter around a 5% rate. Most economists expect modest growth or even a contraction in the first three months of 2021.

""On the eve of 2021, the economy carries very little momentum,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell more than expected in November after five straight month of gains amid a shortage of properties and more expensive houses, but the housing market remains underpinned by record low mortgage rates.
The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday that existing home sales fell 2.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.69 million units last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales declining 1.0% to a rate of 6.70 million units in November.
Existing home sales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, surged 25.8% on a year-on-year basis in November. 
Sales fell in the South, Midwest and Northeast. They were flat in the West. 
The housing market has been the economy's star performer, thanks to pent-up demand and historically low mortgage rates. The COVID-19 pandemic has left 21.8% of the labor force working from home. That has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out spacious accommodation for home offices and schools.
The coronavirus recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.67 percent, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). That is the lowest rate since the agency started tracking the data in 1971.
Housing supply has failed to keep up with demand, pushing home prices out of the reach of many first-time buyers, despite builders ramping up construction. The government reported last week that single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, increased in November to the highest level since April 2007.
In November, there were 1.28 million previously owned homes on the market, a record low and down 22% from a year ago. The median existing house price jumped 14.6% from a year ago to $310,800 in November. Sales were concentrated in upper price segment of the market.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week though the U.S. central bank was monitoring house prices and those of other assets, ""from a financial stability standpoint, housing prices are not of a level of concern right now."" Powell said the higher prices were ""just reflective of a lot of demand.""

At November's sales pace, it would take a record low 2.3 months to exhaust the current inventory. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economic recovery from its coronavirus crash was quicker than previously thought in the third quarter, according to official data, but new lockdowns are threatening to cause a another recession.
Tuesday's data also showed government borrowing sped up last month to pay for the mounting cost of the coronavirus crisis.
Gross domestic product grew by a record 16.0% from July to September, revised up from a previous estimate of 15.5%.
But that still did not make up for its 18.8% slump in the second quarter, when much of the economy was shut down.
Britain's economy was hit harder by the pandemic than most others as it went into a longer lockdown. Only Italy has recorded more deaths in Europe.
Now London and nearby areas are back under tough restrictions as the government tries to slow the spread of a new variant of the virus that spreads more easily.
Capital Economics, a consultancy, said a double-dip recession was a clear possibility if the latest COVID-19 restrictions continue into 2021.
The economy almost ground to a halt in October and is expected to shrink again in the fourth quarter as worries about the Dec. 31 deadline for a Brexit trade deal with the European Union compound the damage from COVID-19.
But Capital Economics said a high savings rate among households ""provides optimism that as long as vaccines are effective and widespread, GDP will stage a strong rebound in the second half of next year.""
Tuesday's data showed the economy was 8.6% below where it was at the end of 2019.
It also showed household incomes grew in the third quarter as workers returned from temporary layoffs. Consumer spending rose by almost 20%.
The Office for National Statistics also said Britain borrowed a record 241 billion pounds ($323 billion) in the first eight months of the financial year, nearly 190 billion pounds more than in the same period a year earlier.
Borrowing in November alone reached 31.6 billion pounds, up more than 40% from October as the government extended its job- retention scheme to cover workers hit by the latest lockdowns.
The deficit is on course to widen to about 400 billion pounds in the 2020/21 year, close to 20% of GDP, double the hit from the global financial crisis.
Public debt stood at almost 2.1 trillion pounds or 99.5% of GDP, the highest ratio since 1962.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak reiterated his pledge to tackle the huge shortfall, but not immediately.
""When our economy recovers, it's right that we take the necessary steps to put the public finances on a more sustainable footing,"" he said.
The International Monetary Fund has said Britain will probably need to raise taxes after the pandemic to fill the gap.
Britain's current account deficit - one of the economy's weak spots - widened to 15.7 billion pounds, or 2.9% of GDP.

The GfK research institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to -7.3 points from a revised -6.8 in the previous month.
This marked the lowest reading since July and came in slightly better than a Reuters forecast of -8.8.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders imposed a ""lockdown lite"" from Nov. 2, under which restaurants, bars and entertainment venues were closed while shops remained open.
As the measures failed to push down infection numbers, the government put in place stricter curbs from Dec. 16 which have shuttered most stores as well hair salons and other services.
""At present, the savings indicator is the main factor driving the third decline in a row in the consumer climate,"" GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said.
The survey chimes with data that showed a temporary reduction in sales tax, put in place by the government to stimulate domestic demand, has failed to turn anxious savers into big spenders.
As long as new COVID-19 cases remain high there is no improvement in sight which means any recovery can only be expected when infections drop so far that curbs can be loosened again, Buerkl said.
Senior government officials have said they expect the stricter lockdown measures, so far announced until at least Jan. 10, to be extended well into the new year.

The Confederation of British said its monthly retail sales balance rose to -3 in December from -25 in November, its highest level in three months.
But the outlook for January was much more negative with a reading of -33.
""It says something about the challenges the retail sector has faced during 2020 that stable sales volumes in the run-up to Christmas were seen as a good result for the time of year,"" CBI economist Ben Jones said. 
""The new year looks set for an unpromising start, with retailers anticipating a sharp fall in sales in January.""
The survey was conducted between Nov. 23 and Dec. 14, covering the end of a second English coronavirus lockdown, when non-essential shops were closed - and the return to tiered restrictions.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Saturday a new tougher lockdown for London and nearby parts of England.
Grocers, furniture vendors and retailers of other ""normal goods,"" such as cards, flowers and jewellery, saw strong growth, according to the CBI survey.
But clothing, footwear and department stores again reported that volumes were lower than a year earlier.
The CBI said stock levels were viewed as broadly adequate for expected sales, but the balance of responses was the lowest in more than a decade.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturing recovery, fuelled in part by demand from COVID-constrained consumers abroad, has soared past expectations this year, so much so that factories are now struggling to fill a shortage of blue-collar workers to clear mounting orders.
The country's output of industrial robots, computer equipment, and integrated circuits has roared back from its coronavirus paralysis - production for the year to November is up 22.2%, 10.1% and 15.9%, respectively.
Much of the manufacturing boom has come from foreign demand, with export growth topping expectations for eight of the last nine months.
The remarkable turnaround comes as China has mostly eradicated the virus and contrasts with the sluggish comebacks seen in major industrialised peers, where factories are still struggling with pandemic disruptions and the hit to demand.
China's global export share increased to over 13% in the second and third quarters from 11% last year, according to Nomura, the highest for any quarter since at least 2006 when the investment bank started compiling the data.
While emergency stimulus in the United States and Europe pumped money into consumers' wallets, the fight to contain the virus in those markets fired up demand both for China-made PPE goods and gadgets for westerners stuck at home.
Government data shows that in November there were more people employed in the industrial sector in Jinhua city, which includes the eastern export hub of Yiwu, than there had been at any time since end-2017. 
""We laid off about 50 workers in the first half, and now with orders soaring, we're short of staff and not able to further ramp up production,"" said Deng Jinling, who owns a thermal flask factory in Yiwu, selling to the Middle East, United States and Europe.
""We tried hiring dozens of temporary workers but they're not good enough,"" said Deng. 
Some workers she laid off have found jobs back home and are not willing to travel back just a few months before the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays in February.
But with clients chasing her heels, Deng bought two automated production lines at the end of November to boost efficiency.
""We've never thought about doing this before, but this year has been so busy and we've exhausted our options,"" she said. ""One automated production line is the equivalent of 10 workers."" 
A private index by Renmin University tracking demand for blue-collar labour hit a record in the third quarter. Some factory managers have hiked wages by 25% to 10,000 yuan ($1,530) per month, well above the average starting wage for graduates, according to local media. 
 BEST  (NYSE:BEST) YEAR
For China's bicycle industry, 2020 is the best year in a decade, with consumers abroad craving exercise and ways to avoid public transport, said Liang Xiaoling, general manager at Guangzhou-headquartered Trinx Bikes.
""Our capacity maxed out in September and October, and we hired a lot of temporary workers to catch up with the demand,"" said Liang, adding that orders are now stretching into 2022.
His factories now employ about 100 extra temporary workers on top of 1,000 or so regular staff.
Although manufacturing investment was slow to recover, falling 3.5% over the first 11 months, strong export demand helped it rebound in the last quarter. 
Investment jumped 12.5% year-on-year in November, up from 3.7% in October, according to research from analysts at CICC, an investment bank. 
Zhang Qinming, who owns a company manufacturing speakers for European and American markets, says demand is 25% higher than in previous years. 
He's been paying his normal staff overtime to keep up and has also hired temporary workers for about 18-19 yuan an hour, 20% more than his full-time workers. As a last resort, he's leased other factories to take the load.
LIMITED OPPORTUNITY
A labour crunch isn't the only constraint.
China's lopsided trade balance - exporting three containers for every one imported recently - and delays in containers returning to China due to the pandemic overseas, have created severe shipping bottlenecks, now starting to pinch exports.
The yuan is also hovering near multi-year peaks against the dollar, pressuring profits further. And an official gauge of factory raw materials costs reached the highest level since 2017 in November. 
Despite the red-hot demand, Liang, of Trinx Bikes, said profits are being squeezed. ""Some of our orders are already seeing some losses,"" he said.
But for policymakers, the export boom has been a welcome one in a tough year. The surprising resilience of China's export sector, which employs around 180 million people, has reduced the need for massive stimulus to revive the economy this year, said analysts.
China hit 122% of its annual job creation target by end-November.
But manufacturers don't expect this boom to last as other economies ramp up production.
""It started with the pandemic, so it will end with the vaccine rollout,"" said Liang.

Lloyds said its monthly business barometer rose by 17 percentage points to -4% in December, its highest since March, before the coronavirus pandemic hit Britain's economy.
""The news of the vaccine progress has bolstered this month’s confidence figures, more than offsetting uncertainties around the UK's new trading relationship with the EU,"" Lloyds economist Hann-Ju Ho said.
The improved business sentiment mirrors a similar gains among households whose confidence rose this month by the largest margin in eight years, according to a survey last week from market researchers GfK.
The immediate economic backdrop is weak. Britain's economy is on course to shrink 11% this year, the most since 1709, according to the Bank of England, while growth in early 2021 looks set to be hampered by ongoing COVID-19 restrictions.
Lloyds said 32% of firms it surveyed expected to cut staff next year, and 22% planned to increase numbers. Larger businesses tended to be more upbeat, and also more likely to plan to end pay freezes.

The survey was based on a poll of 1,200 firms conducted between Nov. 25 and Dec. 10.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. current account deficit surged to its highest level in more than 12 years in the third quarter as a record rebound in consumer spending pulled in imports, outpacing a recovery in exports.
The Commerce Department said on Friday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, widened 10.6% to $178.5 billion last quarter. That was the highest since the second quarter of 2008.
Data for the second quarter was revised to show a $161.4 billion shortfall, instead of $170.5 billion as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account gap increasing to $189.0 billion in the July-September quarter.
The current account gap represented 3.4% of gross domestic product in the third quarter. That was up from 3.3% in the April-June quarter and the largest since the fourth quarter of 2008. Still, the deficit remains below a peak of 6.3% of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 as the United States is now a net exporter of crude oil and fuel. 
Imports of goods increased $94.4 billion to $602.7 billion, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2019. The broad rise in response to pent-up demand following the easing of business restrictions to slow the spread of COVID-19, was led by imports of passenger cars. 
Imports of services rose $6.5 billion to $107.7 billion, mostly reflecting increases in fees for intellectual property, mainly licenses for research and development. There were also increases in sea freight transportation and personal travel.
Consumer spending grew at a historic 40.6% annualized rate in the July-September period, driven by more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief. Consumer spending contracted at a record 33.2% pace in the second quarter.
Exports of goods rebounded $68.4 billion to $357.1 billion last quarter. The broad increase in exports was led by shipments of motor vehicles, parts and engines. Exports plunged in the April-June period amid coronavirus shutdowns overseas.
Exports of services gained $2.8 billion to $164.8 billion. That mainly reflected an increase in fees for research and development licenses. But education-related travel declined. 
Primary income receipts rose $26.8 billion to $238.7 billion, driven by investment income, mostly earnings.

Secondary income climbed $1.4 billion to $35.3 billion, lifted by an increase in private sector fines and penalties.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales fell sharply last month when a four-week lockdown in England closed stores which sold non-essential goods to the public, official figures showed on Friday.
Retail sales volumes dropped by 3.8% on the month in November, their biggest decline since the first lockdown in April and broadly in line with the forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, after a 1.3% increase in October.
Annual sales growth halved to 2.4% from 5.8%, the Office for National Statistics said.
Retail has been one of the few bright spots in Britain's economy since the COVID pandemic, which the Bank of England estimates has caused Britain's economy to shrink 11% over the course of 2020, the biggest slump since 1709.
Consumer confidence data for December, released earlier on Friday, showed the biggest jump in eight years as households welcomed news of the rollout of coronavirus vaccines.
However the picture has been extremely mixed across the retail sector, with online retailers booming and supermarkets enjoying solid results, but many clothing retailers struggling from the closure of their high-street premises.
Inflation data on Wednesday showed the biggest annual fall in clothing and footwear prices in a decade, due in part to unusually large Black Friday discounts.

The BoE estimates Britain's economy as a whole will shrink by just over 1% in the final quarter of 2020, slightly less than it feared a month ago, but expects slower growth in early 2021 due to longer-lasting lockdown restrictions.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government raised its economic growth forecast for the next fiscal year thanks to its latest stimulus package aimed at speeding up the recovery following the damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic.
The economy is expected to grow 4.0% in price-adjusted real terms in the next fiscal year starting April 2021, the latest estimate by the Cabinet Office showed on Friday.
The new estimate compared with its previous forecast of 3.4% growth projected in July. 
The upgrade was underpinned by the government's third supplementary budget, which was approved earlier this week, to fund the $708 billion stimulus package to help the economy recover from its COVID-induced slump in the second quarter.
The forecast 4.0% growth for next fiscal year would be the fastest annual expansion on record, if realized, since comparable data became available in 1995, the Cabinet Office said.
The government, which expects the economy will return to pre-COVID-19 levels by January-March 2022 helped by its broad policy support, also cautioned about risks.
Policymakers need to keep a close watch ""on downside risks to the economy in Japan and overseas from the pandemic and impacts from moves in financial capital markets,"" an official at the Cabinet Office said.
The government will use the forecasts to finalize the state budget for the next fiscal year.
For the current fiscal year that ends in March 2021, the government cut its gross domestic product forecast to a 5.2% contraction, which would be the biggest annual slump on record.
Previously, it projected the economy to shrink 4.5%.
Consumer prices remain subdued due to weak domestic demand and the government' discount travel campaign to support the tourism industry. 
Overall consumer prices are forecast to fall 0.6% for this fiscal year, from a 0.3% decline expected previously. 

In fiscal 2021, overall prices will grow 0.4%, the government said, revised down slightly from the previous forecast of a 0.5% increase.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week as a relentless wave of new COVID-19 infections hobbled business operations, offering more evidence that the economy's recovery from the pandemic recession was faltering.
That was underscored by other data on Thursday showing manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region cooled in December, with factories reporting a sharp slowdown in new orders and job growth. But the housing market remains resilient, with homebuilding and permits powering ahead in November, thanks to record-low mortgage rates and pent-up demand.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday acknowledged the moderation in economic activity following a record growth spurt in the third quarter. Powell cautioned that ""the path ahead remains highly uncertain."" The U.S. central bank kept its main interest rate near zero and pledged to continue injecting more money into the economy through asset purchases. 
""The coronavirus pandemic has split the economy in two where the winners are interest-rate sensitive sectors like housing and the stock market, while the losers employed in the leisure and hospitality industries are falling further and further behind,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 885,000 for the week ended Dec. 12. The second straight weekly increase lifted claims to their highest level since September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 800,000 applications in the latest week.

Jobless claims are way above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though they have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March. The weekly unemployment claims report, the most timely data on the economy's health, followed in the wake of data on Wednesday showing retail sales declined for a second straight month in November.
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the state unemployment programs, 1.4 million people filed claims. California and Illinois led the increase in applications, with layoffs concentrated in the services industries.
The United States is battling a fresh coronavirus outbreak, with at least 16.7 million infected and more than 304,000 dead, according to a Reuters tally. State and local government have responded with renewed restrictions on businesses, while some consumers are avoiding crowded places like shopping malls, restaurants and bars. California, home to nearly 40 million people, imposed new tough stay-at-home orders last week.
The restrictions and reduced income as millions of unemployed and underemployed lost a government-funded weekly subsidy is undercutting consumer spending, which will lead to more job losses. Though a COVID-19 vaccine is being deployed, health experts say it could take months for herd immunity. 
Congress moved closer on Thursday to a $900 billion rescue package. Economists said the new fiscal stimulus could limit, but not fully offset weaker consumer spending and prevent further layoffs. More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief powered the economy in the third quarter.

HOUSING SHINES
In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index dropped to a reading of 11.1 this month from 26.3 in November. Measures of new orders and shipments at factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware also fell. 
The survey's gauge of factory employment declined and as did a measure of the workweek. A report this week from the New York Fed also showed a moderation in manufacturing in December.

The housing market has so far been unscathed by the pandemic. But spiraling infections are causing raw material shortages. Lumber prices have soared, which could slow the housing market momentum. 
Housing starts rose 1.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.547 million units in November, with single-family homebuilding hitting its highest level since April 2007, the Commerce Department said in a third report. Permits for future homebuilding raced 6.2% to a rate of 1.639 million units, the highest since September 2006.

Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed establishments for the nonfarm payrolls portion of December's employment report. Economists expect a decrease in employment this month. 
""The rise comes during the payroll survey week, and increases the odds of a negative print for December,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The economy, which plunged into recession in February, added the fewest jobs in six months in November. Only 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered. 
The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 273,000 to 5.508 million in the week ending Dec. 5, but that was because many have exhausted their eligibility, limited to six months in most states. 
At least 4.8 million people filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Nov. 28, up 268,532 from the prior week. These benefits as well as those for gig workers and the self-employed will lapse next Saturday. 

About 21 million people were collecting benefits under all programs at the end of November.

Housing starts rose 1.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.547 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That lifted homebuilding closer to its pace of 1.567 million units in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts holding steady at a rate of 1.530 million units in November. Homebuilding surged 12.8% on a year-on-year basis. 
Permits for future homebuilding raced 6.2% to a rate of 1.639 million units in November. Permits typically lead starts by one to two months. 
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, rose 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.186 million units, the highest level since April 2007.
Single-family starts have increased for seven straight months. The housing market is defying slowing economic growth, thanks to pent-up demand and historically low mortgage rates. Recent data have shown a moderation in the labor market and consumer spending half-way through the fourth quarter as the country battles a fresh wave of COVID-19 cases.
The coronavirus pandemic has left 21.8% of the labor force working from home. That has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out spacious accommodation for home offices and schools. 
Lower-wage earners have borne the brunt of the recession, which started in February. 
Though a survey on Wednesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders eased in December, it remained near November's all-time high. Builders worried about rising construction costs, noting persistent shortages of land, materials and skilled labor.
Single-family building permits jumped 1.3% to a rate of 1.143 million units in November. Homebuilding is being driven by lean inventories, especially for previously owned homes. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.71%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
Starts for the volatile multi-family segment accelerated 4.0% to a pace of 361,000 units. Building permits for multi-family housing projects soared 19.2% to a rate of 496,000 units.

But rising rental vacancy rates remain a challenge for the multi-family housing market. Renters are also moving away from city centers to suburban apartments in search of a more outdoor lifestyle.

Residential starts rose 1.2% to a 1.547 million annualized rate from an downwardly revised 1.528 million a month earlier, according to government report released Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 1.535 million pace.
The figures underscore strong demand for new homes thanks to record-low mortgage rates and buyers looking for bigger spaces during the pandemic. Housing has been a bright spot in the economy, with new home construction now nearly back to February’s level.
Still, housing may face headwinds as the worsening spread of the virus prompts fresh restrictions and stimulus talks in Washington remain unresolved.
Single-family starts rose for a seventh month to a 1.186 million annualized rate that was the highest since 2007, while starts for projects with five or more units, a category that tends to be volatile and includes apartments and condos, increased to 352,000.
A separate report Wednesday showed that U.S. homebuilder confidence eased slightly in December to the second-best level on record following the prior month’s peak.
Meanwhile, a separate report Thursday showed that applications for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly jumped last week to the highest level in three months.
Strength new construction was broad-based nationally. Housing starts climbed in all four regions, led by a 12.9% rise in the Northeast, according to the report, which is published jointly by the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Applications to build, a proxy for future construction, rose to 1.639 million, the highest since 2006.

Investing.com -- The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose again to a new three-month high last week, indicating that the pace of layoffs due to the latest wave of the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating.
The Labor Department said 885,000 initial claims were filed last week, and revised the previous week’s number up by 12,000 to 865,000. Economists had counted on a decline to 800,000.
That’s the highest level since early September. The news comes a day after figures showing that retail sales fell 1.1% in November, their first monthly decline in six months.  Together, the figures show a clear loss of momentum in the economy under pressure from a pandemic that has gained in strength with the onset of winter and with the increased transmission opportunities created by the election campaign and the holiday shopping season.
The number of people filing continuing jobless claims fell however, to 5.508 million from an upwardly revised 5.781 million. That was bigger than the expected drop, but economists warned against seeing it as a sign of improvement. 
""The drop in continuing claims is not a sign of improving labor market conditions,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist with Grant Thornton, via Twitter. ""Long-term unemployed are running out of benefits and shifting into special pandemic insurance, which is slated to expire unless Congress acts before year end.""
There was further evidence of the slowdown as the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's monthly business survey showed a sharp drop in its main manufacturing index to 11.1 from 26.3, with declines in all of its sub-indices: prices paid, employment and new orders. 
However, there was slightly better news from the housing market, which has been a source relative of strength all through the pandemic. The number of housing starts rose 1.2% on the month to 1.547 million, their highest since March. Building permits, meanwhile, rose 6.2% on the month to their highest in over 12 years."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australians packed into shopping malls on Thursday to stock up on supplies for the Christmas holiday season, spending money that might usually go toward overseas travel and cheering an annual rite that was threatened by the new coronavirus.
With travel and many social activities curtailed for most of the year by restrictions on movement intended to slow the virus, consumers have turned to home cooking and entertainment for their leisure - and spent up.
Australian retail sales rebounded a stronger-than-expected 1.4% in October, the most recent period covered by official data, and other figures have pointed to a solid recovery in the A$2 trillion ($1.5 trillion) economy.
Much of the spending has gone to online merchants, but with movement restrictions easing amid low numbers of new infections, shoppers have started returning to physical stores.
""I thought maybe we would be doing a lot more online shopping, so I feel really lucky that we can go into stores and have that physical experience,"" said Jordan McCormack, a holiday shopper in Sydney. ""When you look around at how busy the mall is, it's like old times.""
Laticia Francini, another shopper on a muggy summer's day in Sydney, said she had family in Italy where lockdowns had resumed following a rise in cases, so ""we're one of the luckiest countries in the world right now"".
Australia ended a weeks-long run without community transmissions with the most populous state, New South Wales, reporting three locally acquired cases in the previous 24 hours.
Industry body the Australian Retailers Association said it expects sales after Christmas Day on Dec. 25, when many stores offer discounts, to increase 3.9% over the same period a year earlier as people cash in on a swag of stimulus payments.
""The Australian economy is bouncing back,"" said association CEO Paul Zahra in a statement. ""Consumer confidence is on the rise, people are heading back to their favourite shops, and that's reflected in these figures.""

Saudi Arabia is facing its worst economic decline in decades after the COVID-19 pandemic curbed global crude demand and measures to contain it also hurt other sectors.

Investing.com – The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday, and signaled that near-zero rates would continue through 2023 to support the next phase of the economic recovery as the vaccine rollout gets underway.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25%. 
The low-rate environment will continue for some time, with policymakers backing rates to remain unchanged through 2023.
The Fed's interest-rate outlook for 2020 through 2023 was 0.1%, unchanged from previous projections in September, the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections showed.
The central bank pledged to maintain its near-zero interest rate range for some time comes as the recovery has slowed recently amid rising infections that have triggered restrictions and exacerbated concerns over the uncertain economic outlook.
Despite the recent slowdown, the Fed has upped its outlook on growth, though reiterated the ongoing pandemic poses ""considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.""  
The economy is expected to contract by 2.4% in 2020, up from an estimate for 3.7% contraction previously. For 2021, the Fed expects the economy to grow by 4.2%, and 3.2% in 2022, up from previous estimates of 4% and 3% respectively.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the first-quarter data will show a significant impact from a surge in the virus, but the economy should perform strongly in the second half of next year, underpinned by a boost from the vaccine rollout. 
The unemployment rate for the year is expected to come in at 6.7%, down from 7.6% previously, and fall further to 5% next year, down from a previous estimate of 5.5%. The unemployment rate was estimated to improve further, and eventually drop to 3.7% in 2023, down from a prior estimate of 4%. 
The pace of inflation, which the fed has earmarked as a key driver of future monetary policy decisions, is forecast to cool to a rate of 1.4% this year, but improve to 1.8% next year, compared with prior estimates of 1.5% and 1.7% respectively. Looking ahead to 2023, inflation is projected to reach 2%, though the Fed has reiterated that it would let inflation run above target for some time.
""[T]he Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent,"" the Fed said.
With rates near the zero bound level, the central bank has relied on its bond-buying purchases to steady the economic fallout, buying  $120 billion bonds on a monthly basis. The bond-buying program has seen the Fed's balance sheet rise above  $7 trillion from about $4 trillion just before the pandemic struck in early March, but the Fed appears in no hurry to curb the pace of purchases.
The current pace of bond buying would continue ""until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals,"" the Fed said. ""These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.""
Ahead of the FOMC meeting, some had floated the idea of the Fed adopting a Bank of Canada approach - by trimming bond purchases to target longer duration bonds - but Powell said the view among Fed members on the BoC approach was ""mixed""  and wasn't high on the list of possibilities."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in November, likely weighed down by raging new COVID-19 infections and decreasing household income, adding to growing signs of a slowdown in the economy's recovery from the pandemic recession.
The second straight monthly decline in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday could nudge Congress to agree on another fiscal stimulus package. Still, economists say more money from the government and the rollout of coronavirus vaccines would probably not stop the economy from sharply slowing down and even contracting in the first quarter of 2021.
News of the weak start to the holiday shopping season came as Federal Reserve officials were wrapping up a two-day policy meeting. The U.S. central bank is expected to keep its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero and deliver a playbook for what might prompt the Fed to pump more money into the economy. 
""The economy is hitting a very rough patch,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Although widespread vaccine distribution will support stronger economic growth by mid-2020, conditions will remain soft until then.""
Retail sales dropped 1.1% last month, with receipts declining almost across the board. Data for October was revised down to show sales slipping 0.1% instead of rising 0.3% as previously reported, adding a sting to the report. 
It was the first back-to-back decline in sales since April, when stringent measures to control the first wave of coronavirus cases crippled the economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would decrease 0.3% in November. Sales increased 4.1% on a year-on-year basis. 
The plunge in sales last month was led by motor vehicles, with receipts at auto dealerships tumbling 1.7% after being unchanged in October. Receipts at clothing stores plummeted 6.8%. Consumers also cut back on eating and drinking out. Sales at restaurants and bars dropped 4.0%.
Sales at electronics and appliance stores fell 3.5% and receipts at furniture stores declined 1.1%. There were also decreases in sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. But receipts at food and beverage stores rose, as did those at building material stores. 
Online retail sales rose a modest 0.2%. Some economists said Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s ""Prime Day"" event in October had pulled sales from November. Online retail sales soared 2.4% in October.
""With COVID cases still near peak levels and state and local governments adding further mandates in recent weeks, we expect more weakness from retail sales ahead,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mixed. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
RECOVERY SLOWING
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales declined 0.5% last month after a downwardly revised 0.1% fall in October. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have edged up 0.1% in October.
The United States is struggling with a fresh COVID-19 outbreak, with the death toll from the disease rising above the 300,000 mark on Monday, according to a Reuters tally of official data. Many state and local governments have imposed new restrictions on businesses, while some consumers are avoiding shopping malls, restaurants and bars.
Restaurants moved outdoors over the summer and the arrival of cold weather is also undercutting spending. A separate report from data firm IHS Markit on Wednesday showed business activity slowed in the first half of December.
The reports added to data this month showing the economy, which plunged into recession in February, added the fewest jobs in six months in November. The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits jumped to near a three-month high in the first week of December. 
The situation has been compounded by the loss of a weekly unemployment supplement. More than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief is almost depleted, and at least 9 million unemployed and underemployed Americans are set to lose government-funded benefits on Dec. 26. 
Lawmakers neared a $900 billion deal for another rescue package on Wednesday. But economists said this was insufficient given the shock caused by the pandemic.
""They are trying to get a modest relief package done to help those in need rather than a trillion-dollar mega-package like in March that turned the recession around quickly with a recovery that was V-shaped for a time,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The outlook now for the economy is grim despite the miracle vaccines that are on the way.""
Health experts have cautioned it could take a while for many Americans to be inoculated. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% annualized rate. 
Most economists expect the economy to contract in the first three months of 2021.

The economy grew at a 33.1% rate in the third quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the April-June quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.

Business inventories rose 0.7% in October after increasing 0.8% in September, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. October's rise was in line with economists' expectations. They were down 4.0% on a year-on-year basis in October.
Retail inventories rose 0.9% in October instead of 0.8% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 1.6% jump in September. Motor vehicle inventories advanced 1.0% as previously reported.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.8% instead of 0.7% as estimated last month.
Gross domestic product rebounded at a historic 33.1% annualized growth rate in the third quarter, thanks to more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief for businesses and workers. That followed a 31.4% rate of contraction in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.
Inventories added to GDP growth last quarter after being a drag for five straight quarters. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% rate because of the outbreak in coronavirus infections and the largely expired fiscal stimulus.
Wholesale inventories jumped 1.1% in October. Stocks at manufacturers rebounded 0.2%.

According to IHS Markit, though new orders continued to grow, temporary shutdowns and customer uncertainty weighed on the upturn. It also noted that companies reported a fall in new export sales as renewed lockdowns in key export markets dampened foreign demand. 
Supply chain disruptions remained an issue, ""with delays more prevalent than at any time since comparable data were available in 2007,"" the data firm said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone economic performance far exceeded expectations this month - although it still contracted slightly - as a second wave of coronavirus infections and renewed lockdowns had less of an impact than earlier in the year, a survey showed.
Manufacturers reported strong growth, fuelled by rising exports and a booming performance from Germany, but the services industry remained in decline as social distancing restrictions were kept in place.
IHS Markit's flash composite PMI, seen as a good guide to economic health, soared to 49.8 in December from November's 45.3, just shy of the 50 mark separating growth from contraction. A Reuters poll had predicted a much shallower rise to 45.8.
""The decent rebound in the composite PMI primarily reflects the partial lifting of restrictions in France and provides some hope that euro zone GDP won't fall quite as much in Q4 as feared,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
""But with tougher measures now being imposed in Germany, the big picture is that services activity in the region will remain weak for a while yet, holding back the economic recovery.""
A Reuters poll earlier this month said the economy would contract 2.6% this quarter. [ECILT/EU]
Germany's private sector showed resilience as manufacturing picked up steam and services partly recovered, a sister survey showed, while in France activity unexpectedly returned almost to growth this month as some restrictions were eased.
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders have agreed to shut most stores and schools from Wednesday until at least Jan. 10 and although France's lockdown officially ended on Tuesday cafes, restaurants and cultural venues remain closed and some restrictions in place.
Meanwhile in Britain, which has suffered the second highest COVID-19 death toll in Europe, the economy limped back to growth but hospitality businesses struggled and Brexit disruption hit factory supply chains.
Britain faces the added headache that a post-Brexit transition period finishes at the end of the year and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has so far been unable to agree on a future relationship with the European Union.
A Reuters poll earlier this month said the economy would shrink 2.7% this quarter and take at least two years to reach pre-COVID-19 levels. [ECILT/GB]
SHOT IN THE ARM
The PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry bounced to 47.3 from 41.7, exceeding all expectations in the Reuters poll that had instead predicted a modest increase to 41.9.
With activity still in decline, and restrictions likely to be in place for some time yet, services firms cut headcount again this month, as they have since Europe began to feel the full brunt of the pandemic in March. 
The employment index held below breakeven at 49.4, albeit better than November's 48.2.
Factories have been less affected by lockdown measures as many remained open, and the flash manufacturing PMI jumped to 55.5 from 53.8, its highest since May 2018 and also above all expectations in a Reuters poll with a median prediction of 53.0.
An index measuring output, that feeds into the composite PMI, rose to 56.6 from 55.3.
Strong demand for manufactured goods meant factories built up a solid backlog of work, with the sub-index rising to 56.2 from 54.3, its highest in nearly three years.
And with hopes vaccines being rolled out will allow some return to normality, optimism was at its highest since April 2018. The composite future output index rose to 63.8 from 60.4.
""The recent positive news on the vaccine front have contributed to an improvement in business expectations,"" said Nicola Nobile at Oxford Economics.
""But while we certainly welcome this news, the short term outlook is still clouded with risks, in particular in relation to the extension of the containment measures.""

Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders have agreed to shut most stores and schools from Wednesday until at least Jan. 10 to reverse a tide of COVID-19 infections that lighter restrictions introduced on Nov. 2 have failed to tame.
IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of Europe's largest economy, rose to 52.5 from 51.7 in November.
That beat a Reuters forecast for a decline to 50.4 and was the sixth month in a row that the reading was above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
The flash PMI for activity in the services sector improved to 47.7 in December from 46.0 the previous month. A Reuters poll had predicted a drop to 44.0.
The flash PMI for manufacturing rose to 58.6 from 57.8 in November, beating a forecast for a drop to 56.4. The reading was the highest in nearly three years.
The stronger-than-expected PMI figures suggest the German economy ended the final quarter of the year on a surprisingly solid footing.
Economists have warned that Germany's decision to tighten its second coronavirus lockdown increased the risk of another recession in Europe's largest economy.
IHS Markit's Phil Smith said the survey showed the economy still on a stable platform, at least up until the middle of the month, with the flash data collected from Dec. 4-15.
""However, the impending harder lockdown threatens to put paid to some of the resilience we've seen so far, with more sectors set to be impacted by the new tougher virus containment measures,"" Smith added.

Nonetheless, German manufacturers and their service sector counterparts are positive about the outlook for 2021 in light of the expected rollout of vaccines, he said.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index rose to a four-month high of 49.6 from 40.6 in November, beating by a wide margin the 42.9 expected by economists in a Reuters poll. 
The surprise improvement brought the index almost to the 50-point threshold that denotes an expansion in business activity rather than a contraction.
France began lifting some restrictions this month after imposing its second coronavirus lockdown at the end of October to contain a new wave of infections. 
Though cafes, restaurants and cultural venues remain closed and some restrictions remain in place, the new lockdown officially ended on Tuesday.
Under the second round of restrictions, business activity has generally held up much better than during the first, stricter lockdown as companies have adapted to working with sanitary protocols or staff at home.
""With lockdown restrictions having eased this week and a clearer pathway to immunizing the population ahead, firms can now begin working back up towards pre-coronavirus levels of activity,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said. 
""That expansionary mindset was exemplified by the first increase in employment for 10 months and confidence levels reaching their highest since January,"" he added.
A flash PMI index for the service sector jumped to 49.2 from 38.8 in November, far exceeding expectations for a reading of 40.0.

In the manufacturing sector, where restrictions have had less impact on activity, the flash PMI returned to growth with a reading of 51.1, up from 49.6 last month and beating expectations for a reading of 50.1.

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation slowed by much more than expected in November, possibly reflecting Black Friday discounts as clothing and footwear prices fell by the most in a decade, official data showed on Wednesday.
Consumer prices rose 0.3% in annual terms, after a 0.7% rise in October, the Office for National Statistics said. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 0.6%. 
With investors eyeing a breakthrough in trade talks between Britain and the European Union before the Brexit transition period expires at the turn of the year, the pound dropped only slightly against the dollar after the data, before rebounding.
The figures leave inflation close to the almost five-year low of 0.2% struck in August and a long way off the Bank of England's 2% target. 
The central bank announces its December interest rate decision on Thursday and is likely to note the weakness of inflation after it had predicted inflation last month would come in around 0.5%. 
""Looking forward, there are signs of inflationary pressures building, such as rising global commodity prices, but there is currently too much slack in the UK economy for it to become an issue,"" said Jon Hudson (NYSE:HUD), UK equity manager at fund management firm Premier Miton Investors.
In November alone, the ONS said clothing and footwear prices slumped by 2.7% - the biggest drop for November on record - compared with a 1.0% increase last year.
Compared with a year earlier, clothing and footwear prices were 3.6% lower, the biggest annual decline since January 2010.
""The price fall in November this year reflects increased discounting and there have been media reports that some Black Friday sales may have spread further across the month,"" the ONS said.

Clothing sales have struggled in Britain since the start of the coronavirus pandemic and several major high street clothing retailers have fallen into financial difficulties, putting tens of thousands of jobs at risk.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is expected to keep monetary policy steady on Friday and hope the extension of an existing fund-aid package will give companies enough time to weather the hit from a recent resurgence in coronavirus infections.
A stable yen, rising stocks and rebounding overseas demand have offered some breathing space for policymakers struggling to underpin a fragile recovery with a dearth of ammunition.
But lingering fears over the pandemic have kept service demand weak. Mounting COVID-19 cases forced the government to suspend a discount programme aimed at propping up spending on travel - but criticized for spreading the virus.
With the outlook highly uncertain, the BOJ is likely to decide on Friday to extend a range of steps aimed at easing corporate funding strains as a precaution against the deepening pain from COVID-19, sources have told Reuters.
The central bank, however, is set to keep its interest rate targets steady at the two-day rate review ending on Friday, and maintain the view the world's third-largest economy will improve moderately as a trend.
""Considering the side effects on financial institutions' profits, we believe that digging further into negative interest rate territory will be avoided"" unless the yen breaches the 100 mark against the dollar, said Naoya Oshikubo, senior economist at SuMi TRUST.
The dollar/yen has moved in a tight range recently and stood around 103.50 yen on Wednesday. A move below 100 yen usually triggers verbal warning by Japanese policymakers worried about the impact a strong yen could have on exports.
Under a policy dubbed yield curve control, the BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1% and 10-year bond yields around zero.
The BOJ also created a package of measures to cushion the blow from COVID-19 in March through May, which included an increase in purchases of corporate debt and a creation of a new lending facility to channel money via banks to cash-strapped firms.
Markets widely expect the BOJ to extend the deadline for the package as the resurgence in infections cloud the outlook.
BOJ officials say expanding the programmes will be the first line of defense against additional strains from the pandemic, though they do not rule out rate cuts as among policy options.
Markets are focusing on how BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda would describe risks to growth from the recent resurgence in infections at his post-meeting briefing.
Japan's economy rebounded in July-September from its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter, though the third wave of infections is dampening prospects for a strong recovery.

The government last week announced a fresh $708 billion economic stimulus package to speed up the recovery, bringing the combined value of Japan's pandemic-related spending to about $3 trillion.

(Reuters) - U.S. households across the board built up savings during the pandemic, but low-income households are burning through their cash more quickly than higher-income families and could be out of savings soon if more aid is not delivered, according to a study released on Wednesday. 
By the end of October, the median low-income family spent 64% of the extra cash they accumulated this year compared with last year, leaving them with about $236 in extra cash, according to a report released Wednesday by the JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Institute. In contrast, higher-income households lost just 38% of the cash cushion built up this year, and had a median $810 in savings, the study found.
""If these trends continue, we would expect low-income families to deplete their account balance gains sooner than their high-earning counterparts,"" researchers noted in the report.
(GRAPHIC: Cash piles shrinking - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/rlgpdqoabvo/chart.png) 
The JPMorgan Chase study showed that cash balances appeared steady on average after rising earlier this year, in line with a separate report released by the Federal Reserve last week showing that balances in cash, checking accounts and savings deposits rose over the three months ending in September to a record $13.4 trillion.
But a look at cash balances for the median household - which is not affected as much by households with abnormally high, or unusually low, account balances - showed a more volatile experience. 
The median cash balance for checking account holders studied by JPMorgan Chase rose in the spring when the government distributed cash payments to most households - and balances have been declining since. 
Those households could experience another substantial drop in income and spending at the end of the year when unemployment benefits are set to expire for millions of workers participating in pandemic programs created by the CARES Act, the researchers said. 
Consumers have previously cut spending on non-durable goods by 12% after losing unemployment benefits, and those receiving jobless benefits reduced spending by 14% over the summer after a $600 weekly supplement to unemployment benefits expired at the end of July, the study noted.

Lawmakers have yet to reach an agreement on another round of aid. Some COVID-19 relief measures could be attached to a critical spending measure that must be passed by Friday to avoid a federal government shutdown.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports fell in November, dashing expectations for an end to the two-year run of declines, largely due to weaker U.S.- and China-bound shipments and suggesting a slower pace of recovery for the world's third-largest economy.
The trade data is likely to be of some concern for policymakers counting on solid external demand to boost factory output and broader corporate activity to revive the economy. 
""The risk that Japan's economy will stall in the first quarter is gradually becoming stronger,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""It feels like Japan's economic recovery is somewhat behind that in China and the United States and European countries given the exports trend and state of domestic demand.""
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Wednesday showed exports fell 4.2% in November from a year earlier, defying the economists' median estimate of a 0.5% increase in a Reuters poll.
That marked the 24th straight month of decline, the longest stretch on record based on comparable data going back to 1979, and follows a 0.2% drop in the previous month.
Japan's exports have failed to match the strong recoveries seen in major Asian manufacturing rivals China and South Korea, which have benefited from brisk global demand for technology that enables remote working during the pandemic.
In contrast, analysts said Japanese manufacturers face challenges selling high-value capital goods, such as factory machinery, to overseas markets at a time when growing demand for consumer goods is driving the recovery in many of those economies.
""Goods used in companies' capital spending are seeing the biggest delay, even as cars are being sold well and the rebound in semiconductors has been quite strong,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
Takeda added that a long stretch of import declines, which fell for their 19th straight month in November, pointed to persistent weakness in domestic demand, highlighting Japan's relatively slow economic recovery.
By destination, shipments to the United States contracted for the first time in three months, falling 2.5% in November versus the same month a year earlier, as weak demand for aircraft equipment helped offset higher car exports.
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose at the slowest pace in five months, growing 3.8%, driven by communication devices.
Shipments to Asia fell for the first time in two months, decreasing 4.3%, while those to the European Union dropped 2.6% in November.
Imports shed 11.1% in November compared with the same month a year earlier, versus the median estimate for a 10.5% decrease. Japan's trade surplus narrowed to 366.8 billion yen ($3.54 billion), versus the median estimate for a 529.8 billion yen surplus.
Japan's cabinet on Tuesday approved a third supplementary budget to fund a fresh $708 billion stimulus package, which includes about 40 trillion yen in direct fiscal spending and focuses on investment in new growth areas such as green and digital innovation.
Data last week confirmed the economy rebounded sharply in the third quarter from its biggest postwar slump in April-June. A private-sector survey showed on Wednesday Japan's factory activity came within striking distance of stabilisation in December, adding to signs that the economy is on the mend.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Nine months into the COVID-19 pandemic, women of color in Canada still face far higher unemployment than white women, official data shows, in part because they tend to work jobs in hard-hit sectors and often care for children or relatives.
The unemployment rate for minority women was 10.5% in November, compared with 6.2% for white women, according to Statistics Canada data provided to Reuters. Women of color also had a slightly higher unemployment rate than their male counterparts, who had a jobless rate of 10.0%.
Canada has recouped more than 80% of the jobs lost at the height of the COVID-19 crisis, but many minority women have not returned to work.
""What we're seeing ... is the unequal impact of this pandemic on diverse groups of Canadians,"" said Lynn Barr-Telford, an assistant chief statistician at Statscan, in an interview before the latest data was released.
""These inequities pre-date COVID... but they've been further exasperated by COVID,"" Barr-Telford said. 
Statscan added a question on race to its monthly job survey in July. The first survey found South Asian women had among the highest unemployment rates in Canada at 20.4% and Black women at 18.6%.
Four months later, the unemployment rate for Black women remains one of the highest at 13.4%.
Chinese Canadian women, meanwhile, are the furthest from their pre-pandemic employment levels with a jobless rate of 10.2% in November. 
Indigenous Canadians also face disproportionate negative impacts on employment from the pandemic, with the unemployment rate for Indigenous women averaging 16.8% from June to August, Statscan said in a separate report released in November. 
""We have diversity within diversity, of course. So not all groups are experiencing the labor market shutdown the same,"" said Barr-Telford.
GRAPHIC: Unemployment rates for Canadian women by race - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/EMPLOYMENT/gjnpwkaxkpw/chart.png 
SYSTEMATIC DISADVANTAGES
White women have fared better as ""they tend to be in better paid jobs that are less precarious and they have more resources at their disposal,"" said Wendy Cukier, founder of the Diversity Institute at the Ted Rogers (NYSE:ROG) School of Management.
Women of color, meanwhile, face systematic disadvantages from fewer opportunities for career advancement to less access to basic services like high-speed internet and flexible daycare.
Childcare is one of the issues that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has promised to tackle as part of a major stimulus package pledged to come in next spring's budget.
But with women in racial minorities bearing the brunt of the pandemic slump, more needs to be done to ensure that stimulus is tailored to their needs, with a focus on career and entrepreneurial supports, say advocates.

""We have an opportunity to really rethink what we value,"" said Cukier.

The euro zone's second-biggest economy is set to grow 3% in the first quarter from the current quarter, when it is expected to contract by 4%, INSEE said in its latest economic outlook.
The quarterly growth rate will then moderate slightly to 2% in the second quarter, leaving the economy 3% smaller than it was before the crisis by mid-2021.
The French economy has slumped again this quarter after the government imposed a second lockdown from late October to contain a second wave of infections that has since eased.

As a result, INSEE estimated the French economy will contract by 9% in 2020 overall, in line with forecasts by other institutions but less than the 11% expected by the government.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output increased more than expected in November, boosted by motor vehicle production, though momentum could slow as a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 infections keeps workers at home and temporarily shuts down factories.
Other data on Tuesday suggested that a benign inflation environment could persist for a while, with import prices barely rising last month even as the dollar has weakened against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners. 
Strong production at factories is defying signs of a slowdown in the economy's recovery from the coronavirus recession, underscored by rising layoffs. Retail sales likely declined in November for the first time since April, according to a Reuters survey of economists. November's retail sales report is scheduled to be released on Wednesday.
""COVID-19 containment measures are likely to exert a heavy economic toll over the next few months and the manufacturing sector won't be immune, but it is going to be far less directly impacted than consumer services in big cities,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.
Manufacturing output rose 0.8% last month after surging 1.1% in October, the Federal Reserve said. Factory production remains 3.8% below its pre-pandemic level. Economists had forecast manufacturing output rising 0.3% in November.
Motor vehicle production rebounded 5.3% after declining for three straight months. Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing output increased 0.4% after surging 1.3% in October. 
A shift in demand from services to goods during the pandemic is underpinning manufacturing's recovery. But the relentless crisis also poses a risk. The Institute for Supply Management early this month reported a dip in business sentiment in November, with manufacturers saying the resurgence in coronavirus infections was straining suppliers and that production lines were being shut down due to lack of staff. 
The ISM warned that absenteeism at factories and their suppliers as well as difficulties in returning and hiring workers would continue to ""dampen"" manufacturing until the pandemic ended.
Fed officials were due to start a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Policymakers are expected to keep interest rates near zero and deliver a playbook for what might prompt them to pump more money into the economy.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
BROAD INCREASE 
A separate report from the New York Fed on Tuesday showed its measure of manufacturing conditions in New York state fell to a reading of 4.9 in December from 6.3 in November. 
But manufacturers were optimistic about conditions over the next six months, likely reflecting the arrival of a vaccine for the virus, which has killed more than 300,000 people in the United States. 
""Production will be soft in the near term as record-high COVID-19 cases and a lack of fiscal stimulus weigh on the U.S. economy early next year,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""But activity should pick up by mid-2021 as vaccine distribution leads to stronger overall economic growth.""

The increase in manufacturing output was broad last month, with big gains in the production of primary metals, computers and electronics, aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment. But production of consumer goods and business supplies dropped.
Manufacturing combined with a rise in mining output to lift industrial production 0.4% in November. Industrial output increased 0.9% in October. Production at mines rebounded 2.3% after declining 0.7% in October. Oil and gas well drilling increased 8.3%, rising for a third straight month.
Utilities output fell 4.3% as warmer-than-usual temperatures cut demand for heating. Utilities advanced 1.8% in October. 
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose 0.6 percentage point to 72.6% in November. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector increased to 73.3% from 73% in October. It is 6.5 percentage points below its 1972-2019 average.
Officials at the U.S. central bank tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy - how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.
Muted inflation was underscored by a separate report from the Labor Department on Tuesday showing import prices edged up 0.1% last month after dipping 0.1% in October.
Import prices, which exclude tariffs, decreased 1.0% in the 12 months through November after falling by the same margin in October. Year-on-year import prices have declined for 10 straight months. 
Petroleum prices rose 2.1%. Excluding petroleum, import prices were flat after dipping 0.1% in October. 
Import prices have remained weak even as the dollar has depreciated about 7.4% versus the currencies of the United States' main trade partners since April.

Government data last week showed marginal increases in consumer and producer prices in November. Though the pandemic has boosted prices of some goods because of supply and production constraints, it has weighed on services, leading to overall benign inflation.

""Import prices look set to continue as a restraint on broader price pressures, giving additional support for the Fed's dovish bias,"" said James Watson, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's jobless rate rose again in the three months to October and redundancies reached a record high as companies were hit by new coronavirus restrictions and prepared for the end of government job subsidies that were eventually extended into 2021.
Official data showed the unemployment rate reached 4.9%, up from 4.8% in the three months to September, its highest in more than four years.
However, the increase was smaller than expected by most economists. A Reuters poll had forecast a jump to 5.1%.
The number of redundancies reached a record high of 370,000 in the August-to-October period, although it decreased in October alone, the Office for National Statistics said.
""Overall we have seen a continuation of recent trends, with a further weakening in the labour market,"" said Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics. 
For much of the period covered by Tuesday's data, finance minister Rishi Sunak rejected calls to extend his broad job- retention scheme beyond a scheduled Oct. 31 expiry, raising fears of an acceleration in job losses.
But, as a second wave COVID-19 cases hit, Sunak was forced to extend the scheme until the end of March 2021.
""The ... extension of furloughing will provide a lifeline for many jobs over the difficult winter months, but the big question is what happens after,"" said Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors.
The introduction of vaccines offered some hope, but hiring plans remained stuck in neutral, he said, calling for new measures to help job creation, such as a social security contributions cut.
The Bank of England has forecast that the unemployment rate is likely to peak at nearly 8% in the second quarter of 2021.
The Arcadia fashion group fell into administration late in November putting more than 13,000 jobs at risk, and retail chain Debenhams is closing all its shops, jeopardising 12,000 jobs.
As well as COVID-19, Britain's economy faces the risk of a shock from the end of its post-Brexit transition period on Dec. 31. London and Brussels remain locked in negotiations little more than two weeks before the possible introduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade with the European Union.
Tax office data showed the number of staff on company payrolls slipped by a monthly 28,000 in November, taking the total number of job losses since February, according to the payrolls measure, to 819,000, a third of them in hospitality. 

Job vacancies rose to 547,000 in the three months to November, about 60% higher than during the depths of the pandemic slump but down by about a third from a year earlier.

Investing.com – Chinese industrial output expanded for an eighth straight month in November, with economic recovery in the world’s second largest economy gathering pace as global demand increased.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) earlier in the day showed that industrial production grew 7% year-on-year, against the 7% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and slightly higher than October’s 6.9% growth. Retail sales grew 5% year-on-year, down from the forecast 5.2% growth but up from October’s 4.3% growth.
The unemployment rate was 5.2%, in line with forecasts but slightly down from October’s 5.3% rate.
Strong exports have been a key driver for the economy’s recovery from COVID-19-induced lockdowns in the first quarter of the year. Demand for medical equipment and work-from-home electronic devices have also boosted exports in recent months as many of China’s biggest markets tightened restrictive measures to curb increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases.
Some investors remained positive about the economic recovery.
The data points to fourth quarter growth that’s likely to be better than the previous three months, NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said after the data’s release. The retail recovery is on track and consumption will remain the main growth engine, he said, while also projecting “relatively fast” expansion in 2021.
The improvement in industrial production was “underpinned by robust domestic demand and very strong export … we expect the macro policy stance to shift from expansionary to contractionary, with the overall government deficit declining and monetary policy makers aiming to contain macro leverage,” Oxford Economics’ Louis Kuijs told Bloomberg.
Single’s Day events put on by e-commerce companies such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) in November also saw strong consumer sentiment and further boosted orders for small factories.
The accelerated recovery seen so far in the fourth quarter looks set to continue into 2021, aided by stronger demand, credit growth and stimulus measures.
However, the tighter restrictions implemented in some of China’s trading partners could create shipping bottle necks, in turn increasing transportation costs and capping the speed of China’s recovery."

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory output grew at the fastest pace in 20 months in November, as revived consumer spending and a gradual easing of COVID-19 restrictions in major trading partners lifted demand for the country's manufactured goods.
Industrial output growth quickened to 7.0% in November from a year earlier, data from the National Statistics Bureau (NBS) showed on Tuesday. That was in line with analyst expectations in a Reuters poll and faster than the 6.9% expansion in October.
China's economy has staged an impressive recovery from its COVID-19 paralysis earlier this year, mainly driven by robust exports that have fired up the nation's factories again.
An annual sales promotion extravaganza in November by China's e-commerce giants has also open consumers' wallets in a further boost to orders for small factories.
""China's economy continued to accelerate across all fronts in November. We expect output to remain above-trend in the coming quarters, even as tailwinds from stimulus and exports start to ease,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, of Capital Economics, in a note.
Retail sales rose 5% on-year, just missing analysts' forecast for 5.2% growth but faster than the 4.3% increase in October.
Auto sales saw 11.8% growth and sales of household appliances grew 5.1% in November. Communications equipment sales jumped 43.6%.
Fixed-asset investment rose 2.6% in January-November from the same period last year, faster than a 1.8% increase in the first 10 months of 2020.
Private sector fixed-asset investment, which accounts for 60% of total investment, rose 0.2% in January-November, compared with a 0.7% decline in the first 10 months of the year.
China's economic recovery looks to be accelerating in the fourth quarter, driven by stronger demand, credit growth and stimulus measures expected to provide a strong tailwind into 2021.
Industrial demand surged in November with non-ferrous output hitting a monthly record, as the country kept churning out metals used in manufacturing and construction.
NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said at a news conference in Beijing he expects growth in 2021 to be ""relatively fast,"" although that would be due to a low base this year, rather than any significant changes in the economy.
China could make some policy adjustments as the economy improves, he said.
""We expect 7% GDP growth in 2021 from 1.7% in 2020,"" said Iris Pang, ING's Chief Economist for Greater China, by email.
Factory activity growth hit a more than three-year high in November, an official survey showed earlier this month, as fewer COVID-19 infections boosted consumer confidence.
Exports also surged at their fastest pace in almost three years thanks to demand for personal protective equipment and electronics products for working from home.

More recently, however, tougher measures to contain the coronavirus imposed by the country's trading partners have created shipping bottle necks, pushing up transportation costs and capping the speed of China's recovery.

268,"<span>Dec 14, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Americans remained uncertain in November over how they might fare financially as the U.S. economy heals from the coronavirus crisis, with consumers reporting mixed views on the labor market, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
Expectations for earnings growth over the next year remained flat at 2% for the fifth straight month. But respondents' views on how spending might change over the next year ""rebounded sharply"" to a median 3.7%, the New York Fed said. 
However, consumers remained worried about the labor market, and more people are expecting declines in home prices and the stock market, the survey showed. 
The U.S. economy added 245,000 jobs in November, the fewest in six months. Growth was hindered by a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases that, together with a lack of more government relief money, threatens to reverse the recovery from the pandemic recession.
Fed officials will need to factor in the impact of expiring stimulus against the benefits of upcoming vaccines when they meet this week to set monetary policy and issue economic projections.
Consumers polled by the New York Fed said there was a 40.1% chance, on average, that the unemployment rate will be higher a year from now - the first increase since July. 
The average perceived odds that U.S. stock prices will be higher one year from now dropped by 2.3 percentage points to 38.5% in November, the lowest since August 2019. And expectations for how home prices will change over one year also dropped in November - the first decline since April. 
Median inflation expectations over the next year increased by 0.2 percentage point in November to 3.0% and rose by 0.1 percentage point to 2.8% for the next three years. 

The survey of consumer expectations is a monthly poll conducted on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese business sentiment improved at the fastest pace in nearly two decades in October-December, a key central bank survey showed, a welcome sign for the economy as it emerges from the initial hit of the coronavirus pandemic.
But companies slashed their capital expenditure plans for the year ending March 2021 and a measure of near-term sentiment worsened, as a resurgence of infections reinforces expectations any recovery in the world's third-largest economy will be fragile.
""A stronger-than-expected rebound in factory output mid-year and a recovery in overseas economies, notably China, helped improve manufacturers' sentiment,"" said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.
""But companies likely won't raise capital expenditure much next fiscal year given the renewed rise in COVID-19 cases.""
While Japan avoided the high case numbers seen elsewhere when the coronavirus first hit, infections have risen as winter sets in, hitting a daily record on Saturday.
The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment improved to minus 10 in December from minus 27 in September, the Bank of Japan's ""tankan"" survey showed on Monday, still a negative reading but marking the second straight quarter when companies were less pessimistic about business conditions.
It was better than the minus 15 projected in a Reuters poll and the fastest pace of improvement since 2002, as Japanese car and auto parts makers benefitted from a global rebound in automobile demand, the survey showed.
The tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.
Big non-manufacturers' sentiment also improved to minus 5 from minus 12 in September, roughly matching a Reuters poll of minus 6 and improving at the fastest pace since 2010.
A government campaign offering discounts for domestic travel helped lift sentiment among industries ranging from hotels, restaurants and retailers, a BOJ official told a briefing.
But big firms plan to cut capital expenditure by 1.2% in the current business year to March 2021, bigger than market forecasts for a 0.2% drop, the survey showed.
This was a downgrade from September when they planned to raise expenditure by 1.4%, a sign that slumping profits and the pandemic's resurgence are making firms wary of boosting spending.
Companies expect recurring profits to fall 35.3% this fiscal year as sales are seen slumping 8.6%, the tankan showed.
An index gauging firms' sentiment three months ahead worsened, suggesting that many of them feel conditions won't improve much despite recent progress in vacinne development.
Companies also plan to slash new graduate hiring by 6.1% in the year beginning in April, the survey showed, which would be the most cautious hiring plan since the collapse of Lehman Brothers shook the global economy in 2010.
""Uncertainty over the outlook is weighing on companies' sentiment,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute. ""Unless people feel safe about going out, it would be difficult for government stimulus measures to yield results.""
The data will be among key factors the BOJ will scrutinise at its two-day rate review ending on Friday. The central bank is set to hold off on expanding stimulus, but consider extending a range of steps aimed at easing funding strains.
The government, for its part, announced a fresh $708 billion stimulus package last week to speed up the recovery from the coronavirus-driven slump.

After suffering its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter, Japan's economy rebounded in July-September helped by improved exports and consumption. But many analysts expect a third wave of COVID-19 infections to keep any recovery modest.

Average new home prices in 70 major cities rose 0.1% in November from the previous month, the slowest pace since March when the market was battered by coronavirus-induced lockdown measures, Reuters calculated from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data. That compared with 0.2% on-month growth in October.
Prices rose 4.0% in November from the same month a year earlier, the weakest rate since February 2016. That compared with a 4.3% on-year increase in October.
China's property market has recovered quickly from the COVID-19 pandemic, with home sales and investment growing at a robust pace, prompting the government to step up efforts to deleverage the highly indebted sector to curb financial risk.
However, price rises are uneven and concentrated in clusters in the southern Pearl River Delta and eastern Yangtze River Delta. In the north, some cities have seen demand slump after an initial spurt.
The NBS data also showed the number of cities reporting monthly price increases for new homes fell to 36 out of 70 from 45 in October.

China's banking regulator recently highlighted the property sector as a significant risk to financial stability, calling it the biggest ""grey rhino"" - an obvious yet ignored threat.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's manufacturing industry warned of a potential 'knockout blow' if Prime Minister Boris Johnson is unable to secure a trade deal with the European Union before temporary transition arrangements end on Dec. 31.
Make UK, the trade body for British manufacturers, said it was slashing its growth forecast for the sector in 2021 to 2.7% from 5.1% just three months ago - roughly half the rate of growth it sees for the broader economy.
""Combined with the pandemic, many in industry are feeling like an exhausted boxer in the final round of a bout, with a 'no deal' exit from the EU potentially landing a knockout blow,"" Make UK's chief executive Stephen Phipson said.
Official data last week showed that British factory output in October was 7.1% below its level a year earlier.
British manufacturers will face tariffs on many of their exports to Europe from Jan. 1 without a trade deal, as well as regulatory hurdles.
Imports have already been disrupted due to high volumes of traffic at ports, linked to COVID and Brexit-related stockpiling, prompting carmaker Honda to suspend operations temporarily last week due to parts shortages.
Make UK said its members expected output to stagnate or fall slightly over the coming quarter - better than the record drops seen in previous quarters due to the pandemic, but overall an anaemic picture.

""It is going to be a long haul back, with talk of a 'V'-shaped recovery nothing more than fanciful,"" Phipson said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices barely rose in November, supporting views that inflation would remain benign in the near term as a flare-up in new COVID-19 infections restrains the labor market and demand for services.
While other data on Friday showed a surprise improvement in consumer sentiment early in December, that largely reflected increased optimism among Democrats and Independents following Joe Biden's electoral victory over President Donald Trump. 
That is unlikely to translate into robust consumer spending, given business restrictions related to the coronavirus outbreak and the accompanying job losses. Millions of unemployed Americans are set to lose their government-funded benefits on Dec. 26, with Congress struggling to agree on another pandemic relief package.
""We saw a similar partisan boost to confidence following the 2016 election which was not followed by a spike in consumption, so we doubt this apparent rise in confidence signals a jump in spending either,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.
The producer price index for final demand edged up 0.1% last month after increasing 0.3% in October, the Labor Department said. That was the smallest gain since April. 
In the 12 months through November, the PPI advanced 0.8% after increasing 0.5% in October.
A 0.4% increase in the price of goods accounted for the rise in the PPI. Goods increased 0.5% in October. Services were unchanged after rising 0.2% in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI gaining 0.2% in November and rising 0.8% on a year-on-year basis.
The United States is in the midst of a fresh wave of coronavirus infections, pushing the number of confirmed cases to more than 15 million and deaths to over 289,740 since the pandemic started. New strict stay-at-home orders went into effect in California this week. Other states and local governments have also imposed restrictions on businesses.
Applications for unemployment benefits jumped to their highest level in nearly three months last week.
While the coronavirus pandemic has raised prices of some goods because of supply constraints, it has hurt demand for services like travel and dining out, keeping inflation in check. Millions of people are either underemployed or out of work, limiting wage inflation.
In a separate report on Friday, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index increased to 81.4 early this month from a final reading of 76.9 in November. Sentiment remains well below its pre-pandemic level. Economists had forecast the index steady at 76.5. 
Graphic: Consumer sentiment - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnpwkwmgpw/umich.png
Sentiment improved among Democrats and Independents, but fell among Republicans. Consumers expected inflation to moderate significantly in the year ahead. Inflation expectations over the next five years were steady.
""The trend in inflation in the near term is likely to be subdued given ample excess capacity and renewed pressure on demand from new restrictions to contain a resurgence of Covid-19 outbreaks,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist
at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
BELOW TARGET
Other details of the PPI report were also softer. Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices inched up 0.1%. The so-called core PPI climbed 0.2% in October. In the 12 months through November, the core PPI gained 0.9% after rising 0.8% in October.
Inflation is running below the Federal Reserve's 2% target, a flexible average. The government reported on Thursday that consumer prices increased 0.2% in November. 
""There are no factory inflation pressures building, either due to shortages or to stronger manufacturing demand, that could possibly lead to more inflation at the consumer level,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Despite the soft inflation backdrop, economists do not anticipate a deflation, a decline in the general price level that is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices.
Graphic: PPI - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jznvnqzrwpl/inflation.png
Wholesale food prices rose 0.5% in November after accelerating 2.4% in October. The cost of residential electricity, natural gas and tobacco products increased. But gasoline prices tumbled 1.9%. There were also decreases in the cost of pharmaceutical preparations.
Core goods prices rose 0.2% after being unchanged in October. Margins for final demand trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, fell 0.3%, helping to restrain services.
Healthcare costs rose 0.2%, while portfolio fees were unchanged. That followed October's 0.5% increase. Airline tickets decreased 7.1% after increasing 1.2% in October.
Those airline tickets, healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure.

With the relevant CPI and PPI components in hand, economists are predicting the core PCE price index rose 1.3% in November. The core PCE price index increased 1.4% in the 12 months through October. November's core PCE price index data is scheduled to be released later this month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's big manufacturers became less gloomy in the December quarter compared with the previous three months as a recovery in exports boosted business confidence in the world's third largest economy, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey is expected to show the headline index for big manufacturers' confidence stood at minus 15 in December from minus 27 in September, the poll of 18 economists showed.
That would mark the index's second quarterly rise after hitting an 11-year low in the June quarter when the coronavirus-hit economy suffered its biggest slump on record. 
The sentiment index for big non-manufacturers is also expected to have improved to minus 6 in the three months to December from minus 12 in the previous quarter, the poll showed.
""Exports to China and the United States are recovering, which supported manufacturers' sentiment,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""But rising coronavirus cases have increased caution, which may have weighed on the recovery pace of business sentiment.""
Big manufacturers' business confidence will likely pick up to minus 11 in the coming quarter, the poll found. 
Meanwhile, non-manufacturers' business sentiment is expected to worsen to minus 7 as the services sector continues to be hit by people's reluctance to go out for fear of catching the coronavirus.
Economists expected big companies to cut a capital spending plan by 0.1% for this fiscal year to March 2021 in the survey, having forecast a 1.4% rise in the September survey.
Trade data on Wednesday is expected to show a 0.5% increase in exports in November from a year earlier, the first rise since November 2018, and a 10.5% year-on-year fall in imports last month.
The trade surplus was expected to narrow to 529.8 billion yen ($5.09 billion) as a result from a revised 871.7 billion in October, the poll showed.
Inflation data on Friday would likely show the core consumer prices index saw its biggest year-on-year fall in over a decade in November, weighed down by weak energy prices and a government campaign to boost domestic travel with discounts.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, likely fell 0.9% in November from a year earlier, according to the Reuters poll.
The Bank of Japan meanwhile was expected to keep its policy interest rate at minus 0.1% and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target at around 0% when it holds a policy meeting on Dec. 17-18, the poll showed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits jumped to a near three-month high last week as mounting new COVID-19 infections led to more business restrictions, further evidence that the pandemic and lack of additional fiscal stimulus were hurting the economy.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, followed in the wake of data last week showing job gains in November were the smallest since the recovery started in May. Labor market distress is eroding demand, keeping inflation tame.
""Mass unemployment continues to weigh on economic growth and demand,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""If Congress continues to sit on its hands without voting on a new relief package, the plight of the nation's unemployed is going to grow darker by the hour.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits surged 137,000 to seasonally adjusted 853,000 for the week ended Dec. 5, the highest since mid-September. The weekly increase was the largest since March, when the nation was battered by the first wave of coronavirus infections. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 725,000 applications in the latest week. 
Unadjusted claims vaulted 228,982 to 947,504 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted number because of earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations due to the economic shock caused by the pandemic. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.4 million people filed claims last week.
Jobless claims hit a record 6.867 million in March. They are above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. 
The United States is in the throes of a fresh wave of coronavirus infections, with more than 15 million confirmed cases. Daily COVID-19 deaths reached 3,253 on Wednesday, boosting the U.S. total since the start of the pandemic to 289,740, with a record 106,219 people hospitalized.
New strict stay-at-home orders went into effect in California this week, affecting about three-quarters of the nearly 40 million people in the nation's most populous state. 
Other states and local governments have also imposed restrictions on businesses, which economists expect to lead to layoffs during winter, especially without additional pandemic relief money from the government. 
A deal on another package remains elusive amid proposals and counterproposals. More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief has helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls. The fiscal stimulus has almost dried up.
U.S. stocks were mixed. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
DECLINE IN PAYROLLS?
While some of last week's jump in jobless claims likely reflected the usual noise after last month's Thanksgiving holiday, the increase was broadly in line with other labor market data that have suggested the recovery was ebbing after a burst of hiring during summer. 
With COVID-19 infections raging, economists expect a decline in employment over winter, noting it would take a while to distribute vaccines. Independent data showed consumers are hunkering down at home. 
""We need to be braced for a window of perhaps three or four months where restrictions will weigh on economic activity,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""We see a growing probability that employment declines in coming months and not just in those sectors focusing on consumer service who are most likely to experience direct restrictions.""
The claims report also showed that people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 230,000 to 5.757 million in the week ended Nov. 28. That was the first rise since August. The so-called continuing claims had declined, in part as people exhausted their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states. 
At least 4.533 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended Nov. 21. These benefits, which are funded by the government, are set to expire on Dec. 26 without a new package. About 19 million people were receiving benefits under all programs during that period. Long-term unemployment is becoming acute. Only 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered.
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said its consumer price index rose 0.2% in November after being unchanged in October. But the trend remained soft. In the 12 months through November, the CPI increased 1.2% after a similar gain in October. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI also climbed 0.2% after being flat in October. 
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, was unchanged after rising 0.2%. Rent inflation has been tamed by forbearance agreements between tenants and landlords and a government moratorium on evictions. 
In the 12 months through November, the so-called core CPI advanced 1.6%, matching October's increase. Inflation is running below the Federal Reserve's 2% target, a flexible average. 

""Inflation will remain low in the near term ... there are still huge swathes of excess capacity in many parts of the economy,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""With unemployment elevated, wage pressures are limited.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government posted a $145 billion budget deficit for November, down from $209 billion a year ago, the Treasury Department said on Thursday, but the decline was largely due to calendar shifts of federal benefit payments.
Without these adjustments, Treasury said November receipts would have fallen 6% from November 2019, while outlays would have increased 11%, which would have led to a $207 billion November deficit.
Some $62 billion worth of November benefit payments were shifted into October because November started on a weekend, while the November 2019 data showed $48 billion in December 2019 benefits were paid in November because December started on a weekend.
November receipts as reported totaled $220 billion versus $225 billion a year earlier, a decline of 3%, while November outlays as reported totaled $365 billion, compared to $434 billion a year earlier, a 16% drop.
For the first two months of the 2021 fiscal year started Oct. 1, Treasury reported a federal deficit of $429 billion, compared with $343 billion for the first two months of fiscal 2020.
Treasury officials said this was driven by a 9% increase in outlays to $887 billion due to spending on healthcare and coronavirus rescue programs and on unemployment compensation. Receipts for the year-to-date fell 3% to $457 billion.

The latest Treasury results follow a record full-year deficit of $3.132 trillion for fiscal 2020, which ended Sept. 30, more than tripling the previous year's shortfall due to COVID-19 aid spending.

Investing.com -- The number of people making initial claims for jobless benefits in the U.S. surged to their highest in nearly three months as the latest wave of the Covid-19 pandemic took an increasingly visible toll on the labor market.
The Labor Department said that 853,000 people filed initial jobless claims last week, up from 716,000 a week earlier. Analysts had expected a much smaller rise to only 725,000.
The number of people making continuing claims also rose for the first time since September, to 5.757 million from 5.527 million a week earlier. Continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag.
The numbers come at a time when the coronavirus is running largely out of control in the U.S., with sharp rises in the numbers of deaths and hospital admissions in recent weeks. The U.S. registered over 3,000 deaths from the disease for the first time on Wednesday. Although fatalities are concentrated largely in among (non-working) seniors, more and more parts of the economy are being shut down to protect them and the healthcare system treating them.
The data were released at the same time as other figures showing a slightly larger-than-expected increase in consumer prices in November. Prices rose 0.2% on the month rather than the 0.1% expected, although the annual rate of inflation remained at 1.6%.
Analysts argue that official data are currently understating actual price developments, as prices for food and other high-frequency services are increasing faster, while prices are falling fastest for discretionary services, which are being used less frequently. The rate of rent inflation also continued to fall. 
Reflation ""can only come on the back of a strong economy with rising purchasing power,"" said Julia Coronado, founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives and a former Federal Reserve economist, via Twitter. ""Initial claims point to more pain on that front.""",,,,,

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economic recovery almost ground to a halt in October as a surge in coronavirus cases hammered the hospitality sector, adding to the chances that the economy will shrink over the final three months of 2020.
Thursday's official data showed the economy lost momentum as public authorities in much of the United Kingdom barred people from socialising in pubs and restaurants, ahead of a broader four-week partial lockdown across England in November.
Gross domestic product rose 0.4% in October after expanding 1.1% in September, the Office for National Statistics said, the weakest growth since output collapsed in April during the first lockdown.
A limited rollout of a COVID vaccine began this week in Britain, offering hope for a rebound in consumer spending in 2021. But many businesses will face new headwinds from trade restrictions with the European Union that come into force on Jan. 1 when post-Brexit transition arrangements end.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the EU's chief executive, Ursula von der Leyen, have given themselves until Sunday to seal a new trade pact that would limit some of the damage, after failing to overcome persistent rifts at a meeting on Wednesday. 
""The economy continued to grow in October, but at a snail's pace. And with the COVID-19 restrictions likely to remain in place for some time, the economy is in for a difficult few months yet,"" Ruth Gregory, economist at Capital Economics said. 
Britain has Europe's highest death toll from COVID-19, with more than 62,000 fatalities, and also suffered the biggest economic hit of any major economy after GDP shrank by an unprecedented 19.8% in the second quarter of this year.
Output in October was 7.9% lower than it was in February, before the pandemic struck Britain's economy, and 8.2% weaker than in October 2019, the ONS said.
Government forecasters do not expect the economy to regain its pre-COVID size until the end of 2022 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicted Britain's recovery would be weaker than anywhere bar Argentina.
Although the economy picked up rapidly after the initial shock of the lockdown, it lost momentum as COVID cases started to rise again in September and accelerated in October.
Government restrictions that largely barred Britons from socialising with people they did not live with led to a 14.4% fall in output across the accommodation and restaurant sector.
Most economists think GDP fell outright in November, when the British government imposed a four-week partial lockdown in England, closing non-essential shops and hospitality venues, and similar measures were imposed elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
The decline is expected to be more limited than in the first lockdown, when restrictions were tighter and businesses had less time to adapt.

Economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) forecast a 3% fall in GDP for the fourth quarter, and said they expected the Bank of England to cut rates to zero from their current 0.1% - possibly as soon as next week, if Brexit trade talks collapsed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. job openings increased in October, but many of the help wanted signs could disappear amid widespread restrictions on businesses to slow rapidly spreading new COVID-19 infections.
The month-old Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report from the Labor Department on Wednesday also showed a rise in layoffs, though a chunk reflected the discharge of temporary workers hired for the 2020 Census. 
The United States is in the throes of a new wave of coronavirus infections, with the number of confirmed cases crossing the 15 million mark on Tuesday.
""The labor market remains miles and miles away from the best economy in 50 years in February before the pandemic struck,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
""October job openings are likely to disappear in a hurry relatively speaking by the end of the year with new strict stay-at-home orders issued in California this month, which is the most populous state in the country."" 
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 158,000 to 6.65 million on the last day of October. Vacancies are below their 7 million level in February. There were increases in job openings in the healthcare and social assistance industry. 
State and local government education saw a 23,000 increase in vacancies in October. Surprisingly, local government education has shed jobs in September, October and November. There were education job losses at state governments in September and October.
The overall job openings rate edged up to 4.5% from 4.4% in September. Hiring dipped to 5.81 million in October from 5.89 million in the prior month. That lowered the hiring rate to 4.1% from 4.2% in September. 
Layoffs increased 243,000 to 1.7 million. That included 91,000 layoffs in the federal government, largely due to the departure of the temporary Census workers. The layoffs rate rose to 1.2% from 1.0% in September. 
U.S. financial markets were unmoved by the data.
STEADYING OUT 
""The JOLTS data are consistent with many other labor market indicators that point to steadying out in the job market lately following a period of very strong hiring,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The JOLTS report followed on the heels of news last Friday that the economy created 245,000 jobs in November, the smallest gain in nonfarm payrolls since the jobs recovery started in May and the fifth straight monthly slowdown in employment growth. The economy has recouped only 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April.
Apart from the business restrictions to curb the out-of- control coronavirus infections, the labor market has lost momentum as more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief has almost dried up. 
The stimulus package helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed wholesale inventories surged 1.1% in October, revised up from the 0.9% as estimated last month. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product jumped 1.3% in October.
Congress is negotiating another relief package. Even with a vaccine on the way, economists are warning of a slow and painful recovery for the labor market and the broader economy. 
""Vaccines are on the way but it is important that Congress takes action to support the unemployed and small businesses during the period before sectors that cannot operate in a socially distanced manner can reopen,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 
There were 1.6 unemployed workers for every vacancy in October. 

""Another way to think about this, for every 16 workers who were officially counted as unemployed, there were only available jobs for 10 of them,"" said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. ""That means there were no jobs for 4.2 million unemployed workers. And this misses the fact that many more  weren't counted among the unemployed.""

The Commerce Department said Wednesday wholesale inventories surged 1.1% in October, instead of rising 0.9% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers rose 0.9% in September. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product jumped 1.3% in October.
Inventories fell 2.2% in October from a year earlier.
Gross domestic product rebounded at a historic 33.1% annualized growth rate in the third quarter, thanks to more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief for businesses and workers. That followed a 31.4% rate of contraction in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.
Inventories added to GDP growth last quarter after being a drag for five straight quarters. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% rate because of a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases and the largely expired fiscal stimulus.
Stocks of motor vehicles and parts slipped 0.2% in October after declining 0.4% in September. There were increases in stocks of lumber, electrical equipment, hardware, paper, drugs, groceries and farm products. Motor vehicle inventories fell as did stocks of furniture, petroleum, professional equipment and machinery.

Sales at wholesalers accelerated 1.8% in October after rising 0.4% in September. At October's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.31 months to clear shelves, down from 1.32 months in September.

Investing.com – Chinese factory gate prices saw a slower fall in November, with cautious signs of continued economic recovery from COVID-19. However, consumer prices saw a fall for the first time in over 10 years as food prices fell.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index (CPI) contracted 0.6% month-on-month, below the 0.2% contraction in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 0.3% contraction. The CPI contracted 0.5% year-on-year, below the forecast 0.8% growth and October’s 0.5% growth.
The producer price index (PPI) contracted 1.5% year-on-year, above the 1.8% contraction in the forecasts and October’s 2.1% contraction. The contraction was smaller than expected, indicating that the PPI fell at a slower pace.
Volatile food prices, namely an easing of pork prices from the previous year’s spike after African Swine Fever decimated China’s pig herd, was the main driver behind the CPI’s fall year-on-year. However, November’s core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, remained unchanged from October at 0.5%.
The grim data indicates unevenness in world’s second largest economy, even as other data from November showed a steady economic recovery.
Trade data from earlier in the week showed that exports increased 21.1% year-on-year in November and the trade balance grew to $75.42 billion in November, against the forecast $53.50 billion and October’s figure of $58.44 billion, while imports grew 4.5% year-on-year in November, missing the predicted 6.1% growth and October’s 4.7% growth.
Data from earlier in December showed the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) at 57.8, and the Caixin manufacturing PMI at 54.9 respectively in November. The manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs for November came in at 52.1 and 56.4 respectively.
Some investors warned of the recovery’s unevenness, with the yuan’s appreciation and a sluggish global demand remaining challenges for some sectors. Short-term prospects for global demand remain grim, with California, Germany, South Korea and Hong Kong all announcing tightened restrictive measures to curb upticks in the number of daily COVID-19 cases.
“The CPI deflation is likely to extend into early 2021. A key issue will be how the price trends affect activity more broadly. Factory-gate deflation has been a check on the recent pickup in industrial profits. Now, falling consumer prices could be another risk to earnings. For the People’s Bank of China, this would be a non-negligible consideration,” Bloomberg China economist David Qu told Bloomberg."

The producer price index (PPI) fell 1.5% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement on Tuesday. The index was expected to ease 1.8%, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll, after a 2.1% drop in October.
The consumer price index (CPI) unexpectedly fell 0.5% in November from a year earlier, the first decline since October 2009, after rising 0.5% in October.
Analysts in a Reuters poll forecast no change in consumer prices, and the 0.5% fall was lower than any individual forecast in the poll.
The fall in year-on-year CPI was mostly driven by volatile food prices, which dropped 2% from a year ago in November. Core inflation - which excludes food and energy costs - remained benign last month at 0.5%，unchanged from October.
China has seen a steady recovery since it was hard hit by the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, when authorities imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions to contain the virus.
Recent data showed China's exports grew at the fastest pace in almost three years in November while manufacturing activity also expanded at its quickest rate in more than three years that month.

But some analysts say the recovery has been uneven, with certain sectors struggling with the appreciation of the yuan or with still tepid global demand.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders rebounded sharply in October from the previous month's drop, the government said on Wednesday, a welcome development for an economy emerging from a deep coronavirus slump.
The jump in core orders suggests a modest revival in corporate spending, seen by policymakers as necessary to accelerate the recovery in the world's third-largest economy.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, soared 17.1% in October, recouping the previous month's 4.4% drop.
The increase, the largest month-on-month rise since comparable data became available in 2005, was much better than a 2.8% expansion forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
""The global economy is in quite a weak state aside from China, so it's hard to imagine sharp increases in spending aimed at supporting exports,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
""Domestic production remains in a relatively healthy trend because of a decrease in inventories in April and May.""
By sector, orders from manufacturers rose 11.4%, boosted by non-ferrous metals, including a large order of seven billion yen ($67.22 million), while those from non-manufacturers advanced 13.4%, led by finance and insurance, the Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday.
The government raised its assessment on machinery orders, saying they had stopped falling.
Japan's cabinet on Tuesday approved a fresh $708 billion economic stimulus package to boost the economy.
The package includes about $385 billion in direct fiscal spending, while also targeting investment in new growth areas such as green initiatives and digital innovation.
Japan's economy has been recovering from the shock of the coronavirus mainly thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption in the third quarter.
But some policymakers, including the central bank, are worried about a slowdown in capital spending, which threatens to hurt domestic demand.
A government official cautioned that the month-on-month core machinery orders data was subject to an adjustment based on seasonal factors, potentially leading to a downward revision.
Compared to the same month a year earlier, core machinery orders, which exclude those for ships and electricity, rose 2.8% in October, beating an 11.3% decline expected by economists.
Sera said that rise caught her by surprise, and signalled a gradual recovery in capital spending.

""There's no mistake there was a slight recovery in capital expenditure,"" she said, but warned it was too early to call a sustained turnaround.

The number of permanent staff recruited fell for a second month in a row in November and dropped by its most since July, when Britain had just emerged from its first coronavirus lockdown, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said.
""A lot of demand for permanent staff (is) displaced to January as firms hope the COVID crisis is easing. For now though, temporary work continues to help businesses operate and people find jobs,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.
Britain's government has extended a job furlough scheme until the end of March, due to a resurgence in COVID cases, and government forecasters expect the jobless rate to peak at 7.5% after it ends, the highest since the 2013.
While Britain is now rolling out a vaccine against COVID, there has been less progress in trade talks with the European Union before the end of a post-Brexit transition on Jan. 1.
Some 29% of businesses surveyed by the Institute of Directors in the week to Dec. 7 said they were unsure if they would be ready for the end of the transition, which will require exporters to make customs declarations and potentially face tariffs when they ship goods to the EU.

""Right now, Brexit is a moving target for directors. Trying to prepare, while dealing with the impacts of the pandemic, is a tall order,"" IoD director general Jonathan Geldart said, urging Prime Minister Boris Johnson to reach a deal with the EU.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. worker productivity increased strongly in the third quarter, though the pace of growth was likely overstated as the sharp rebound in output from the COVID-19 pandemic recession has far outpaced employment gains.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 4.6% annualized rate last quarter. The slight downward revision from the 4.9% pace estimated last month followed a 10.6% rate of growth in the second quarter, which was the fastest since the first quarter of 1971.
The economy expanded at a historic 33.1% annualized rate in the July-September quarter, thanks to more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief for businesses and workers. That followed a record 31.4% pace of contraction in the second quarter. Strong productivity explains the divergence between GDP growth and the labor market.
The economy has recouped two-thirds of output lost during the coronavirus crisis, while only about 56% of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April. A wide gap between output and employment is not unusual during recessions, with a similar trend observed during the 2007-09 Great Recession.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast productivity growth would be unrevised at a 4.9% rate in the third quarter. The COVID-19 downturn has decimated lower-wage industries, like leisure and hospitality, which economists say tend to be less productive. 
According to Moodys' Analytics chief economist, Mark Zandi, there has been a shift in economic activity to big companies from small and medium-sized retailers. Zandi also noted that big businesses across industries are taking advantage of the pandemic to aggressively implement labor-saving technology.
""The underlying rate of productivity has not shifted from what it was before,"" said Zandi. ""There is no fundamental shift in productivity growth going forward, but it means it's going to take a while to recover all the jobs lost unless we have good policy in place.""
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
Compared to the third quarter of 2019, productivity increased at a 4.0% rate instead of the 4.1% pace reported last month.
Hours worked rebounded at a 37.1% rate, rather than the 36.8% rate estimated in November. That followed a record 42.9% pace of decline in the second quarter.
Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - plunged at a 6.6% rate instead of an 8.9% rate as previously reported. Unit labor costs rose at a 12.3% pace in the second quarter. They increased at a 4.0% rate from a year ago.
""The big swings in the unit labor costs data in recent quarters make it hard to detect an underlying trend, but overall we think that the shock to the economy coming from COVID-19 should weigh on employee compensation,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

Hourly compensation fell at a 2.3% rate last quarter, instead of a 4.4% pace as previously reported. That followed a 24.3% rate of acceleration in the second quarter. Compensation increased at a 8.2% rate compared to the third quarter of 2019.

Booming car sales drove a stronger-than-expected jump in German industrial output in October, in a further sign that export-oriented manufacturing helped the economy to get off to a solid start in the fourth quarter.
The German government has unleashed an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus measures to help companies and consumers get through the COVID-19 pandemic as unscathed as possible, including incentives to buy electric and hybrid cars.

Eurostat said gross domestic product in the 19-country bloc increased by 12.5% in the July-September period from the second quarter, the largest rise since the agency began collecting data in 1995.
This was a slight downward revision from the 12.6% estimate from November. Year-on-year, this amounted to a contraction of 4.3%, slightly above the previous estimate of a 4.4% drop.
The revision was mostly due to a change in the estimates for the second quarter, when the euro zone economy shrank by a record 11.7% on the quarter, against the figure issued in November of 11.8%.
The summer surge was driven by domestic consumption and exports, Eurostat data showed, as shops and factories reopened following lockdowns.
Consumer spending rose by 14.0% in the third quarter from the second, when it fell by 12.4%. Exports increased by 17.1% after an 18.9% drop in April-June.
Eurostat said household consumption contributed 7.3 percentage points the euro zone growth and exports 7.6 points. Government spending contributed 1.1 points.
Most Mediterranean countries posted GDP rises above the bloc's average, with France, Spain and Italy leading the pack, after record contractions in the previous quarter.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales growth slowed in November when non-essential stores shut as part of a four-week lockdown in England, but online sales were able to fill more of the gap than in the first lockdown in March, industry data showed on Tuesday.
The British Retail Consortium said year-on-year total retail sales growth slowed to 0.9% in November from 4.9% in October, the weakest spending growth since a 5.9% fall in May.
A measure of like-for-like sales - which includes online retail and stores that were able to remain open - rose by 7.7% compared with a year earlier, the biggest gain since June.
""Some retailers were able offset a proportion of lost sales through greater online and click-and-collect sales, ensuring they could still serve their customers,"" Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said.
For others, the coronavirus has proved the final straw. Last week 242-year-old department store chain Debenhams said it would close if it could not find a new owner and Arcadia, which operates many of Britain's best-known high street clothing chains, entered administration.
Britain's economy shrank by a record 20% during the three months to June, which covered most of the first lockdown, but the Bank of England expects a much smaller 2% decline during the final three months of 2020 in response to more recent closures.
Non-essential shops and most hospitality and entertainment venues had to close to the public in England between Nov. 5 and Dec. 2, and there were similar restrictions elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The BRC data covered Nov. 1 to Nov. 28.
Barclaycard, which processes around half of British credit and debit card payments, said consumer spending between Oct. 24 and Nov. 20 was 1.9% lower than a year earlier.
The fall in spending masks big differences between sectors.
Spending at supermarkets was up 24%, and online food shopping was 98% higher than a year earlier, while spending in restaurants and pubs was less than half year-ago levels.
Department stores and clothing retailers, many of whom have struggled to sell online, saw drops in spending of 18% and 13% respectively, Barclaycard said. 

""The big question now is whether Brits will flock to the high street for Christmas shopping after the November lockdown, providing a much-needed boost in December,"" Barclaycard executive Raheel Ahmed said.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The Honduran economy is expected to shrink by a record 10.5% this year due to the combined crisis of the coronavirus and two deadly hurricanes last month, President Juan Orlando Hernandez said Monday, its worst performance in more than six decades.
The contraction was worse than a previous estimate by the country's central bank of between 8% and 9% as the impoverished Central American nation struggled under the weight of the pandemic and hurricanes Eta and Iota.
""This year will be marked in the history of Honduras as the year that three devastating elements hit us,"" said Hernandez, speaking at an event.
""We are hard hit but we are not defeated,"" he added. 
The economic fall for 2020 far exceeds the country's previous record in 1954, when the economy contracted 6.5% due to worker strikes.

The median forecast of 15 analysts surveyed expected inflation to reach 3.42%, down from 4.09% in October.
If the forecast holds, it would mark the lowest consumer inflation rate since the indicator reached 3.33% last June.
The central bank, known locally as Banxico, last month held its benchmark lending rate steady at 4.25% following a 1 1/2-year stretch of rate cuts, saying that lower borrowing costs would help pull inflation closer to its +/- 3% target.
Banxico's next monetary policy meeting is scheduled for Dec. 17. 
Analysts surveyed by the bank separately expect its main interest rate to end the year unchanged at 4.25%, which would be 25 basis points higher than the poll's previous forecast.
In November, prices overall likely rose 0.17% while the core inflation rate, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, fell 0.05%, the Reuters poll found. It also saw annual core inflation at 3.70%.

LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices showed their biggest annual rise since June 2016 last month, as people sought to move into bigger houses following the COVID lockdown earlier this year, mortgage lender Halifax said on Monday.
House prices in November were 7.6% higher than a year earlier, a slightly faster increase than October's 7.5% annual rise and the biggest increase since June 2016, just before Britain voted to leave the European Union.
Halifax said it did not expect the recent pace of price increases to last as the economic outlook was likely to remain challenging, even with the roll-out of coronavirus vaccines.
""With unemployment predicted to peak around the middle of next year, and the UK's economy not expected to fully recover the ground lost over 2020 for a number of years, a slowdown in housing market activity is likely over the next 12 months,"" Halifax managing director Russell Galley said.
Halifax said house prices rose by 1.2% in November alone, compared with a 0.9% increase in October, and that they had risen by 6.5% over the past five months, the most since 2004.

The Bank of England said last week that lenders approved the greatest number of mortgages in 13 years in October, and another mortgage lender, Nationwide, reported the biggest rise in prices in nearly six years at 6.5% for November.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Booming car sales drove a stronger-than-expected jump in German industrial output in October, in a further sign that the export-oriented manufacturing sector helped Europe's largest economy to get off to a solid start in the fourth quarter.
The German government has unleashed an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus measures to help companies and consumers get through the COVID-19 pandemic as unscathed as possible, including incentives to buy electric and hybrid cars.
Industrial output was up by 3.2% on the month after an upwardly revised increase of 2.3% in the previous month, figures released by the Federal Statistics Office showed on Monday.
That was the biggest increase since June and easily beat a Reuters forecast for a rise of 1.6%.
Compared to February, the month before the COVID-19 pandemic reached Germany, industrial output was down by roughly 5%, the office said. In the car industry, Germany's biggest industrial sector, production rose by nearly 10% on the month but was still roughly 6% below pre-pandemic levels.
""Industry had a very good start into the final quarter of 2020. It's an extraordinarily strong increase,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said.
The surprisingly bullish output figures chimed with data released on Friday that showed industrial orders rose more than expected on the month.
Sentiment surveys and high-frequency data such as truck toll mileage have also pointed to relatively strong manufacturing activity in November despite a partial lockdown imposed to slow a second wave of coronavirus infections.
The lockdown measures, which forced large parts of the services sector to close from Nov. 2, are clouding the outlook for the economy which is expected to stagnate or even shrink in the final three months of the year.
But the decline in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter is likely to be less pronounced than in neighbouring European countries thanks to the strong performance of the manufacturing sector, Gitzel added.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports rose at the fastest pace in almost three years in November, as strong global demand for goods needed to ride out the pandemic landed the world's second-largest economy a record trade surplus.
A brisk factory recovery in China from coronavirus shutdowns earlier this year has far outpaced reopenings seen in major trading partners, many of which are still struggling with outbreaks.
Exports in November rose 21.1% from a year earlier, customs data showed on Monday, the fastest growth since February 2018. It also soundly beat analysts' expectations for a 12.0% increase and quickened from an 11.4% increase in October.
The strong exports come despite the yuan hovering near multi-year peaks against the dollar, which would be welcome news for policymakers concerned about the impact of a weakening greenback on China's trade competitiveness.
Imports rose 4.5% year-on-year in November, slower than October's 4.7% growth, and underperforming expectations in a Reuters poll for a 6.1% increase, but still marking a third straight month of expansion.
Analysts say improving domestic demand and higher commodity prices helped buoy the reading.
""We believe China's export growth could remain elevated for another several months due to the worsening COVID-19 situation overseas,"" the note said.
However, they noted some signs that demand for these pandemic-related goods was losing momentum.
The firm shipments led to a trade surplus for November of $75.42 billion, the largest since at least 1981 when Refinitiv records began. It was also wider than the poll's forecast for a $53.5 billion surplus.
China's exports were supported by strong overseas demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and electronics products for working from home, as well as seasonal Christmas demand, Nomura analysts said in a note.
Booming sales of fridges, toasters and microwaves to households across the locked-down world have helped propel China's manufacturing engine back to life, super-charging demand for key metals like steel, copper and aluminium, after a sharp slump early in the year.
In another sign of buoyant trade, China's export surge and the low turnaround rate of containers from abroad have triggered a recent shortage of containers domestically, state media China Daily reported.
A spate of early indicators showed China's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has stepped up, with manufacturing surveys showing new export orders expanding at a faster pace for November.
That comes despite a sharp appreciation in the yuan in recent months, which some fear could hit exporters. Some firms reported that a strong yuan squeezed profits and reduced export orders in November, the statistics bureau said this week.
The yuan has booked six straight months of gains, its longest such winning streak since late 2014, and is trading at 2-1/2 year highs.
The strong exports widened China's trade surplus with the United States to $37.42 billion in November from $31.37 billion in October.
Chinese buyers nevertheless stepped up purchases of U.S. farm produce including soybeans to fulfill China's pledge in the initial trade deal it signed with the United States in January this year.
While a Biden administration is expected to soften some of the rhetoric seen in strained U.S.-China trade relations in recent years, there are no immediate signs the President-elect intends to unwind the punitive tariffs introduced under the Trump administration.
Although China's imports were weaker than expected, volumes continued to rise on a sequential basis, said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics.
""We expect goods imports to grow further into 2021, underpinned by strong domestic demand, with imports of capital goods to be better supported than those of commodities,"" Kuijs said.

China's iron ore and copper imports both fell in November from the previous month, customs data showed. Crude oil imports in rose as customs continued to clear a backlog.

Investing.com – China saw the biggest surge in November exports since February 2018, benefiting from a recovery in global demand. Imports also saw growth.
Data released earlier in the day showed that exports increased 21.1% year-on-year in November, much higher than the 12% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 11.4% growth. The trade balance also grew to $75.42 billion in November, against the forecast $53.50 billion and October’s figure of $58.44 billion.
Meanwhile, imports grew 4.5% year-on-year in November, missing the predicted 6.1% growth and October’s 4.7% growth.
The latest data attests to a continuous Chinese economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Data released earlier in the month showed the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) at 57.8, and the Caixin manufacturing PMI at 54.9 respectively in November. The manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs for November came in at 52.1 and 56.4 respectively.
Virus waves in places such as the U.K., Europe and the U.S. could further increase demand for exports of personal protective gear and work-from-home devices, both key drivers of export growth so far.
However, fresh restrictions could also curb global growth and demand, which will inevitably weigh on exports. “The new lockdown in Europe may bring downward pressures to external demand over time,” UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) economists led by Ning Zhang said in a note ahead of the data release.
As 2020 draws to an end, China also needs to increase its imports from the U.S. in order to meet the terms of the phase-one trade deal between the two countries. However, the latest data indicates that China is nowhere close to meeting the target agreed on in the deal.
U.S. president-elect Joe Biden has said that he would not quickly remove the tariffs imposed by the incumbent Donald Trump administration. Biden will also consult allies before developing a China strategy."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy added the fewest workers in six months in November, hindered by a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases that, together with a lack of more government relief money, threatens to reverse the recovery from the pandemic recession.
The closely watched employment report also showed 3.9 million people had been out of work for at least six months, with many giving up, a sign of lack of confidence in the labor market. The report, which only covered the first two weeks of November, when the current wave of coronavirus infections started, underscored the challenges facing President-elect Joe Biden when he takes over from President Donald Trump in January.
The economy has recouped only 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April. Even with a vaccine on the way, economists are warning of a bleak winter and urged Congress to provide additional fiscal stimulus.
""The recovery is stalling and fragile at best,"" said Sung Won Sohn, finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""The onset of winter and resurgence of the virus could knock the economy into another dip before the vaccine and additional stimulus from Washington come to the rescue.""
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 245,000 jobs last month after rising by 610,000 in October. That was the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and the fifth straight monthly slowdown in job growth. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would increase by 469,000 jobs in November. Hiring peaked at 4.781 million jobs in June.
Job growth last month was held back by further departures of temporary workers hired for the 2020 Census. Local governments continued to shed more workers, especially at schools, causing overall government payrolls to drop by 99,000 jobs, the third straight monthly decline. The private sector added 344,000 jobs.
The retail sector lost 35,000 jobs. Retailers typically embark on seasonal hiring in November, a practice that has been upended by the pandemic. This disruption likely threw off the model the government uses to strip seasonal fluctuations from the data.
But hiring in transportation and warehousing increased by 145,000 jobs, accounting for nearly three-fifths of the payroll gains. Employment also increased in the professional and business services, financial activities and health care industries. Construction payrolls increased by 27,000 jobs and manufacturers added 27,000 positions.
The smaller-than-expected job gains added to reports on consumer spending, manufacturing and services industries in suggesting that the recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression was losing steam.
""At this rate, complete stagnation or job losses in December would not be a huge surprise,"" said Beth Akers, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. ""It's hard to imagine that the remaining jobs we lost early this spring will return until we've successfully distributed a vaccine that would allow businesses to return to normal operations.""
U.S. stocks rose as the jobs report reinforced expectations for more government aid. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
LONG BOUTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT
The United States is in the midst of a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections. Nearly 200,000 new cases were reported on Wednesday and hospitalizations approached a record 100,000 patients, according to a Reuters tally of official data.
A bipartisan, $908 billion coronavirus aid plan gained momentum in Congress on Thursday as conservative lawmakers expressed their support and leaders in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives huddled together.
More than $3 trillion in government COVID-19 relief approved earlier this year helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter. The uncontrolled pandemic and lack of additional fiscal stimulus could result in the economy contracting in the first quarter of 2021.
While the unemployment rate fell to 6.7% from 6.9% in October, that was because 400,000 people dropped out the labor force. It was also biased down by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Without this error, the jobless rate would have been about 7.1%.
(Graphic: Long-term unemployment rises during the pandemic https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvlanrbpb/Pasted%20image%201607030256721.png)
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 61.5% from 61.7% in October. The share of women in the labor force dipped last month. Industries that tend to employ women have been hard hit by the recession.
Many women have also quit jobs to look after children as education departments moved to online learning. Just over half of the 8 million people who left the labor force between February and April have returned.
The number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or more jumped 385,000 in November. These long-term unemployed accounted for 36.9% of the 10.7 million unemployed last month. About 3.743 million people permanently lost their jobs, up 59,000 from October.

Despite the ample slack in the labor market, average hourly earnings rose 0.3% after nudging up 0.1% in October. That left the year-on-year increase in wages at 4.4%. The average workweek was steady at 34.8 hours.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that factory orders rose 1.0% after increasing 1.3% in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders increasing 0.8% in October.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of the U.S. economy, is being supported by a shift in demand towards goods from services because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But there are clouds gathering for the sector. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported this week that its index of national factory activity dropped in November because of the coronavirus.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 0.8% in October instead of 0.7% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, accelerated 2.4%. They were previously reported to have jumped 2.3%. 

Business spending on equipment rebounded in the third quarter, ending five straight quarters of decline. The economy grew at a 33.1% rate in the July-September quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.

Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market weakened dramatically in November, as a fresh wave of the coronavirus put the brakes on hiring across the country.
Nonfarm payrolls grew by only 245,000 through the middle of the month, a sharp slowdown from October. October’s job gains were also revised down to 610,000 from an initial estimate of 638,000.
Analysts had expected an increase of 469,000. 
The sharp slowdown in hiring is likely to put extra pressure on Congress to agree a fiscal relief package during the 'lame duck' session before the inauguration of Joe Biden in January. 
The thought that a weaker-than-expected report could tip Senate Republicans into accepting a bigger stimulus package than the $500 billion proposed by Leader Mitch McConnell helped to support stock futures after the announcement. Dow futures initially spiked higher, but quickly retraced their gains and by 8:55 AM ET (1355 GMT), they were at 30,026 points, some 15 points below where they were immediately before the release. 
The net addition of jobs was the smallest in the six months since May, when an unprecedented wave of layoffs followed the first lockdowns of the pandemic. That will reinforce suspicions that the rebound in the economy since May is running out of steam, as millions of Americans lose their entitlement to enhanced unemployment benefits while companies in the worst-hit sectors step up the pace of layoffs. The retail sector notched a decline of 35,000 jobs in the month, the Labor Department said in its report. 
Anything below the consensus forecast ""would suggest that the best of the jobs market really is behind us,"" Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) strategist John Velis wrote ahead of the report. 
Private payrolls grew by 344,000, roughly in line with ADP’s estimate early in the week, but government payrolls fell by 99,000. The leisure and hospitality industry, by contrast, added 31,000 jobs.
The unemployment rate fell by more than expected nonetheless, to a post-pandemic low of 6.7%. The so-called U6 jobless rate, which measures under-employment across the economy more broadly, edged down to 12.0% from 12.1%.
Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a morning note on Friday that the labor market is caught between two contradicting influences. On the one hand, the downturn was not the result of fundamental imbalances, and should therefore be able to rebound quickly to its pre-pandemic state. On the other, the pandemic has accelerated the pace of structural change, meaning that workers in sunset industries and sectors have been forced into unemployment earlier than would otherwise have been the case. 
That's resulting in a growing mismatch between supply and demand, as millions of older, middle-skilled professionals lose their jobs without having the necessary skills to take such jobs as are being created. Such factors are also slowly starting to be seen in wage developments, where average earnings are steadily running ahead of inflation. Average hourly earnings growth stayed at 4.4% in November, defying expectations of a slowdown to 4.3%."

""Industry is doing well again,"" said Jens-Oliver Niklasch, senior economist at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg. ""The economic weakness resulting from the pandemic is more or less the result of the services sector. And this will not change soon.""
The Federal Statistics Offices said orders for industrial goods rose by 2.9% in seasonally adjusted terms, compared with a Reuters forecast for an increase of 1.5%. September's figure was upwardly revised to an increase of 1.1%. 
Figures from the Economy Ministry showed domestic orders rose 2.4% on the month while orders from abroad were 3.2% higher. Contracts from the euro zone increased by 0.5%.

A breakdown of the data showed that demand for both capital and intermediate goods had increased while demand for consumer goods had contracted.

Demand rose 2.9%, nearly twice as much as predicted by economists. The Economy Ministry said the gain was led by investment goods, which were particularly well-sought outside the euro area.
As a result, orders for machinery rose some 5% above levels recorded in the fourth quarter of last year.
Germany has benefited from a relatively large manufacturing sector that has adapted to the crisis to keep producing goods. Government-imposed curbs across the euro zone to stop the coronavirus spreading have fallen more heavily on services, slamming nations more reliant on activities such as tourism and leisure.
Still, Germany has extended its own restrictions into 2021. Even before that decision, the Bundesbank warned the economy could stagnate or even shrink in the final three months of the year.
The European Central Bank is poised to boost its emergency monetary stimulus next week to help support the regional economy until vaccines are widely rolled out and a recovery looks more robust.

Booming sales of fridges, toasters and microwaves to households across the locked-down world have helped propel China's mammoth manufacturing engine back to life, super-charging demand for key metals like steel, copper and aluminium, after a sharp slump early in the year.

China's trade surplus is expected to have narrowed a bit to $53.5 billion in November from $58.44 billion in October, according to the poll. The data will be released on Monday.
Improving external demand signalled by November U.S. and European factory surveys, and continued strong shipments of face masks and other medical supplies underpinned exports last month, analysts with China Minsheng Bank said in a note.
""The substitution effect of China's exports will continue to increase as supply capacity of emerging economies has not recovered yet.""
China's official and private manufacturing surveys also showed new export orders expanded at a faster pace.
But some analysts cautioned that surging infections and fresh lockdowns in some of its key trading partners could dent demand for Chinese goods.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell last week, but remained extraordinarily high amid widespread business restrictions to slow a rising tide of new COVID-19 infections and lack of additional fiscal stimulus.
The bigger-than-expected decline in weekly unemployment claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday was likely influenced by the Thanksgiving Day holiday, which economists said could have impacted the model the government uses to strip seasonal fluctuations from the data. 
The pandemic and almost depleted coronavirus relief package are hampering the economic recovery, with services industry activity slowing to a six-month low in November, other data showed. Republicans and Democrats in Congress remained unable to reach agreement on another package on Wednesday, with top Republicans pushing what the Senate's top Democrats dismissed as an ""inadequate, partisan proposal.""
""The Thanksgiving holiday can cause issues with the seasonal adjustment process,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Jobless claims continue to signal a struggling labor market recovery.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 75,000 to a seasonally adjusted 712,000 for the week ended Nov. 28. That followed two straight weekly increases. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 775,000 applications in the latest week. 
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, one million people filed claims last week.
A government watchdog on Monday said the claims data was inaccurate as the Labor Department was using traditional estimates, which were not appropriate given the economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Government Accountability Office said state backlogs in processing applications had led to people submitting claims for multiple weeks of retroactive benefits during single reporting periods, inflating the claims data. Unemployment claims hit a record 6.867 million in March and have been stuck above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession.
""Even with some overstatement, millions of individuals are unemployed and receiving jobless benefits,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
The United States is in the midst of a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections, with 4.2 million new cases and more than 35,000 coronavirus-related deaths reported in November, according to a Reuters tally of official data.
More than $3 trillion in government COVID-19 relief helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter. About 13.6 million people are due to lose government-funded unemployment benefits on Dec. 26.
In separate report on Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading 55.9 last month. That as the lowest reading since May when the recovery started and followed 56.6 in October. The second straight monthly decrease pulled the index further below its 57.3 level in February. 
Companies offered mixed views about business conditions and the economy. Restaurants said they continued to struggle with capacity constraints and logistics, while retailers complained they could not access electronics for their stores and employees which had become scarce as more people work from home. 
Construction companies reported strong business, but expected volume to slow during winter.
Economists shrugged off another survey from Markit IHS showing the services sector hitting its highest level in November since March 2015. This survey has a shorter history compared to ISM. The two surveys use different methodologies.
""Risks are to the downside from new restrictions and closures that will weigh on demand and activity going forward,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
LABOR MARKET STAGNATION
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 569,000 to 5.520 million in the week ending Nov. 21. But the decline in the so-called continuing claims was largely because many had exhausted their eligibility, limited to six months in most states. 
A record 4.569 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Nov. 14, up 59,732 from the prior week. At least 20.1 million people were receiving benefits under all programs in mid-November.
The labor market stagnation has been evident in other data.
The ISM reported this week its measure of factory employment contracted in November. The Federal Reserve's ""Beige Book"" report showed employment rising in all districts on or before Nov. 20, but the U.S. central bank noted ""for most, the pace was slow, at best.""
The reports support expectations that job growth slowed further in November. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government's closely watched employment report on Friday is likely to show that farm payrolls increased by 469,000 jobs last month after rising 638,000 in October. 

That would the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and leave employment 9.609 million below its peak in February. Job growth peaked at a record 4.781 million in June.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity slowed to a six-month low in November amid widespread restrictions on businesses to control surging COVID-19 infections, bolstering views that the economy's recovery from the pandemic recession was running out of steam.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading 55.9 last month. That as the lowest reading since May when the recovery started and followed 56.6 in October.
The second straight monthly decrease pulled the index further below its 57.3 level in February. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index dipping to 56.0 in November.
The ISM reported on Tuesday that its measure of national manufacturing activity fell in November, with many industries reporting higher rates of absenteeism, short-term shutdowns to sanitize factories and difficulties in returning and hiring workers because of the coronavirus.
The United States is engulfed in a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections, with 4.2 million new cases and more than 35,000 coronavirus-related deaths reported in November, according to a Reuters tally of official data.
More than $3 trillion in government COVID-19 relief, which helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, has either expired or will lapse later this month. That has combined with the coronavirus resurgence to slow consumer spending. The stimulus led to record economic growth in the third quarter.
A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday proposed a new $908 billion emergency relief package. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been pushing a $500 billion approach that Democrats reject, circulated new draft legislation on the same day. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday President Donald Trump would sign McConnell's proposed package, should Congress approve it.
The economy grew at a historic 33.1% annualized rate in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below 5%. Exploding COVID-19 infections and lack of additional stimulus have left some economists anticipating a contraction in the first quarter of 2021.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry dropped to a reading of 57.2 in November from 58.8 in October. It has declined for a second straight month. Backlog orders and export orders also decreased, pointing to a further moderation in services industry activity in the near term.
But the survey's index of services industry employment rose to 51.5 from a reading of 50.1 in October.
That suggests the labor marker recovery continued in November, though at a moderate pace. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 486,000 jobs last month after rising 638,000 in October.
That would the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May. It would leave employment about 9.609 million below its peak in February. Job growth has cooled from a record 4.781 million in June.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's economy grew in the third quarter by the most on record as the easing of anti-coronavirus lockdown measures triggered a strong rebound in activity across most sectors, especially industry and services, while fixed investment jumped sharply.
The rebound from the worst of the pandemic prompted a 7.7% increase in gross domestic product from the prior quarter, government statistics agency IBGE said on Thursday, less than the 9.0% median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
The rebound means Brazil's economy is now the size it was in early 2017, after the record second-quarter plunge shrunk it to 2009 levels. It is still 7% smaller than at its peak in 2014.
(Graphic: Brazil GDP https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvgzkdrpq/GDPINDEX.png)
The recovery was broad-based: industry grew 14.8%, household consumption 7.6%, fixed investment 11.0% and government spending 3.5%. Services, which account for over two thirds of all activity, grew by 6.3%, IBGE said.
Agriculture contracted slightly in the quarter by 0.5%.
The rebound shows that the economic hit from the COVID-19 pandemic has been lighter in Brazil than in other major Latin American economies. But that is in large part due to the government's income transfers to millions of poor families, which are due to expire at the end of this year.
""If you look at household consumption, it is impossible to separate the recovery from the emergency aid. Impossible. Given that the program was reduced in the fourth quarter ... that will be reflected in the Q4 numbers,"" said Jose Francisco Goncalves, chief economist at Banco Fator in Sao Paulo.
""Next year, there will be no program, and the government, economists and media are underestimating the impact this will have on growth,"" he said.
The Economy Ministry disagreed entirely. In a statement, it said the ""strong recovery"" shown in the latest figures means the economy can continue growing in the first half of 2021 without emergency government support.
""It is important to stress that the resumption of activity and employment in recent months will offset the reduction in aid,"" it said.
The third quarter figures meant Latin America's largest economy shrank 3.9% from the same three-month period a year ago, more than the 3.5% decline forecast in a Reuters poll.
First quarter GDP figures were revised to -1.5% from -2.5%, the second quarter to -9.6% from -9.7%, and 2019 growth was revised up to 1.4% from 1.1%, IBGE said.

In the first nine months of this year, the economy was 5.0% smaller than it was in the same period last year, it added.

Investing.com -- The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell for the first time in three weeks last week, although it remained at a level unimaginable before the pandemic. 
The Labor Department said that initial jobless claims fell to 712,000, from an upwardly revised 787,000 a week earlier. Analysts had expected a drop to 775,000.
The number of continuing claims, which comes in with a one-week lag, also fell by more than expected to 5.52 million from 6.09 million.
The numbers come a day after payrolls processor ADP said that private-sector hiring in the month through mid-November was relatively modest. Private payrolls grew by 307,000, well short of the 410,000 expected. The official government labor market report is due out on Friday and is expected to show a 469,000 increase in nonfarm employment and a jobless rate of 8.9%
Standard & Poor's said on Thursday that it only expects the number of U.S. jobless to return to its pre-pandemic level in 2023.
Separately, the Challenger Job Cuts survey suggested that the pace of layoffs across the U.S. fell to its slowest since the beginning of the health crisis this year, showing just under 65,000 job losses in November, compared to over 80,000 in October. The year-on-year comparison also improved to a rise of 'only' 65% from 80% in October."

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity contracted last month as governments across the bloc re-imposed strict lockdowns to quell a second wave of coronavirus infections, but optimism recovered on hopes for a vaccine, a survey showed.
The euro zone's economy will shrink again this quarter, a Reuters poll predicted, but as a coronavirus vaccine comes closer and with expectations for additional support from the European Central Bank, quarterly growth forecasts for next year were upgraded. 
IHS Markit's composite PMI, seen as a good guide to economic health, sank to 45.3 in November from October's 50.0, the level separating growth from contraction. That was, however, above an earlier flash reading of 45.1.
""There is a sense that after the initial reactions of businesses to the lockdowns, the second half of the month was better than anticipated. It's still bad but not as bad as expected,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant services industry sank to 41.7 from October's 46.9, marking its third month below the break-even mark. That was its lowest reading since May, when the first wave of the virus was sweeping across Europe.
With hospitality venues forced to close, shops to shut and citizens encouraged to stay at home, demand slumped. The services new business index fell to 40.6 from 45.7.
Germany's second lockdown pushed services there deeper into recession, bringing overall private-sector growth in Europe's largest economy to a near halt. French business activity retreated as the already-suffering service sector was hit particularly hard.
Italy's services industry contracted for a fourth month running. Spain's also shrank again.
In Britain, outside the European Union, services shrank less than expected. A four-week partial lockdown in England had a smaller impact on companies than a lockown earlier in the year, but some analysts were cautious. 
""Many businesses that were forced to close last month during the second lockdown will have seen revenues drop to near zero. The PMI, however, merely reflects whether firms’ activity is rising or falling, not by how much,"" said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
""Its past relationship with the GDP data, therefore, is bound to understate the damage caused by the lockdown.""
But overall optimism about the coming year improved and the euro zone composite future output index jumped to 60.4 from 56.5.

""The fact the vaccine is close at hand means there is reason for optimism in 2021,"" Dixon said.

316,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Activity in Britain's services sector fell less than expected in November, as a four-week partial lockdown in England had a smaller impact on firms than measures earlier in the year, and businesses grew more optimistic about the outlook for 2021.
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK services Purchasing Managers' Index of business activity (PMI) fell to 47.6 in November from 51.4 in October. 
This was the first time since June that it fell below the 50 level that divides growth from contraction, but a smaller drop than the decline to 45.8 in an earlier 'flash' estimate or the record-low reading of 13.4 in April.
The composite PMI, which includes manufacturers who enjoyed stronger growth, dropped to 49.0 from 52.1, also the lowest since June but a smaller drop than an initial estimate of 47.4.
""New lockdown measures and tighter pandemic restrictions unsurprisingly tipped UK private sector output back into decline. However, the collateral damage on sectors outside of hospitality, leisure and travel has been far more modest than in the first lockdown period,"" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.
Britain's economy suffered a record 25% fall in output during the first lockdown in March and April, but the Bank of England forecast this month that output would fall just 2% in the final three months of 2020.
While some sectors such as retail - which is not covered by the PMI - and hospitality have been hard hit by the second lockdown, others have found it easier to adapt, IHS Markit said.
News of effective COVID-19 vaccines this month has also boosted business optimism in the services PMI, which rose to its strongest since February's five-year high.
Job losses continued for a ninth consecutive month, however, the longest continuous run since 2010, and unemployment is forecast to rise further during the months it will take to roll out the vaccine to millions of Britons.
November's survey took place from Nov. 12-26, after initial reports of the success of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against COVID. The 'flash' data published on Nov. 23 was based on responses collected up to Nov. 19, before news of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and the University of Oxford's successful vaccine trials.

The improvement in the survey between the flash and the final data was concentrated in the business activity index, with little change in the expectations component.

Restaurants, bars, hotels, gyms and entertainment venues have been closed since Nov. 2 to contain an aggressive second wave of coronavirus infections. Factories and shops remain open with social distancing conditions in place.
IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 46.0 from 49.5 the previous month.
The reading came in lower than a flash estimate of 46.2 and marked the second month in a row that the services index was below the 50 mark dividing growth from contraction.
The main drag came from hospitality and restaurants, but other consumer-focused services were also severely hit by the renewed lockdown measures.
However, the survey suggested a far smaller overall contraction of gross domestic product compared with that seen in spring following the first lockdown, as activity remained solid in those sectors not affected by the partial lockdown.
""The extension of lockdown measures into December means it is going to be a difficult end to the year for the German economy, of course, for some sectors more than others,"" Phil Smith from IHS Markit said.
Progress on COVID-19 vaccines has helped brighten the outlook for many businesses, though it remains a long road to full recovery, Smith added.
The drop in services activity was partly offset again by robust growth in manufacturing in November.

The final composite PMI, which covers both sectors of the economy, fell to 51.7 from 55.0 in October. That was weaker than the flash reading of 52.0.

Investing.com – China’s services sector saw accelerated growth in November, with new business rising at the fastest pace in over ten years and indicating even further recovery in consumer demand in the world’s second largest economy.
The Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for November, released earlier in the day, came in at 57.8, above the 56.5 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 56.8 figure.
The survey also showed that total new business hit the highest level since April 2010 in November, with new export business expanding for the first time in five months. Services firms also hired more workers at a much faster pace for the fourth straight month in November business confidence improved to its highest levels in over nine-and-a-half years.
The stronger demand allowed firms to pass on some of their higher costs to clients by raising output prices, with a sub-index for prices charged rising to the highest level since February 2010.
The survey also caps off a stellar November for China, with the services PMI following positive data released earlier in the week. The Caixin manufacturing PMI came in at 54.9, and manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs came in at 52.1 and 56.4 respectively.
Although the data suggests that China’s overall economic recovery is becoming more balanced and broader based, challenges remain. Scattered COVID-19 cases reported in some parts of the country could dampen consumer activity. The ever-increasing number of global COVID-19 cases globally are also expected to dampen exports.
The Chinese economy is forecast to grow about 2% in 2020, its weakest figure since 1976 but still above the forecasts for other major economies.
However, some investors are hopeful that the recovery momentum will continue for a few more months.
“To sum up, both the manufacturing and service sectors recovered at a faster pace as overseas demand kept expanding and employment saw substantial improvement,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a statement accompanying the data release.
“We expect the economic recovery in the post-epidemic era to continue for several months. At the same time, deciding how to gradually withdraw the easing policies launched during the epidemic will require careful planning as uncertainties still exist inside and outside China,” Wang said, in reference to crisis measures unveiled earlier in the year to support the economy during the COVID-19 lockdown."

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 57.8, the second highest reading since April 2010, from October's 56.8. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Total new business in November hit the highest level since April 2010, with new export business expanding for the first time in five months, the survey showed.
Services firms hired more workers for the fourth straight month in November and at a much faster pace, the survey found, while business confidence improved to the highest in over nine-and-a-half years. 
The strong rebound was largely in line with the findings in an official survey released on Monday, suggesting China's overall economic recovery is becoming more balanced and broader based, despite concerns that scattered COVID-19 cases found in some parts of the country could weigh on consumer activity.
Analysts expect the recovery momentum could run for a few more months. 
""To sum up, both the manufacturing and service sectors recovered at a faster pace as overseas demand kept expanding and employment saw substantial improvement,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in an statement accompanying the data release.

The survey also showed stronger demand enabled firms to pass on some of their higher costs to clients by raising output prices. A sub-index for prices charged rose to the highest since February 2010. 
The services sector accounts for about 60% of China's economy and half of the urban jobs, and includes many small, private companies which had been slower to recover initially from the health crisis than large manufacturers. 
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Thursday, picked up to 57.5 from 55.7 in October, to signal the steepest increase in total Chinese output since March 2010. 

Analysts expect China's economy to grow about 2% in 2020, the weakest since 1976 but still far stronger than other major economies.

320,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 07:40PM ET</span>",,,,,,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Activity in Japan's services sector continued to falter in November, a private sector survey showed, as a resurgence in coronavirus infections weighed on new business and employment conditions.
The world's third-largest economy has been gradually recovering from a virus-induced slump earlier this year, but it is expected to take years before it will return to pre-pandemic levels, especially within the service sector, which contributes nearly 70% of its gross domestic product.
The final Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was little changed from October's reading, edging up to a seasonally adjusted 47.8 from 47.7.
Though the final result was better than a preliminary 46.7 reading, the headline index remained firmly in contraction territory below the 50 neutral level.
Surveyed firms said a third wave of COVID-19 infections had depressed demand and led to more challenging business conditions.
""There were indications that the tentative recovery in the Japanese service sector lost momentum,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""A sharper fall in new business signified that demand remains fragile amid short-term uncertainty surrounding the length of the pandemic.""
The main reading was weighed by a faster contraction of new business, which fell at the quickest pace in three months.
Job market conditions also eased, slipping back into contraction, though the pace of job shedding remained minimal, the survey showed.
A draft of the government's next stimulus package seen by Reuters showed authorities plan to keep setting aside money to promote domestic tourism and dining out, a move that will support an industry reeling under the fallout of the health crisis and the collapse of international tourism.
Still, the PMI survey showed firms remained optimistic about the outlook for the 12 months ahead, in part thanks to an anticipated boost from the delayed Tokyo Olympic Games next year.
The composite PMI including both manufacturing and services was also largely unchanged at 48.1 in November from the previous month's final of 48.0.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased less than expected in November as soaring new COVID-19 infections led to a wave of business restrictions, adding to signs of slowing economic activity as a turbulent year winds down.
The slowdown in private hiring in the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday puts pressure on Congress to agree on additional fiscal stimulus to aid the recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression.
Republicans and Democrats in Congress remained unable to reach agreement on a fresh relief package on Wednesday, with top Republicans supporting what the Senate's top Democrats dismissed as an ""inadequate, partisan proposal.""
President-elect Joe Biden will inherit a struggling labor market and public health crisis when he takes over from President Donald Trump on Jan. 20.
""The rapid spread of the virus across the nation is making it harder to find employment this fall and this puts the entire economic recovery from recession in jeopardy if Congress can't get it together and vote on a new stimulus package before the end of the year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Private payrolls rose by 307,000 jobs last month after increasing 404,000 in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would rise by 410,000 in November. The slowdown in hiring last month was across all industries. 
The leisure and hospitality sector, hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, added 95,000 jobs. Construction employment increased by 22,000 jobs and manufacturers hired 8,000 workers. There were employment gains in financial activities, professional services, education and healthcare sectors. The information industry added no jobs.
The United States has been slammed by a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections, with 4.2 million new cases and more than 35,000 coronavirus-related deaths reported in November, according to a Reuters tally of official data. 
The resurgence in coronavirus infections and expiring fiscal stimulus are hampering consumer spending and production at factories. More than $3 trillion in government COVID-19 relief helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter. 
New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) on Wednesday acknowledged growth was slowing due to the spreading COVID-19 cases and lack of more fiscal stimulus.
That sentiment was also evident in the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts across the nation, which described the economic expansion as ""modest or moderate."" 
The U.S. central bank noted four districts described little or no growth.
U.S. stocks were muted. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
LOSING STEAM
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. Though it has fallen short of the government's private payrolls count since May because of methodology differences, it is still watched for clues on the labor market's health.
""The broad message from the ADP report is consistent with what we expect the government data to show, the labor market continued to add jobs on net in November but the pace of job growth slowed,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The ADP report was released ahead of the government's closely watched, and comprehensive, monthly employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, private nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 589,000 jobs in November after rising 906,000 in October. 
With government payrolls expected to have declined again last month as temporary workers hired for the Census left and state and local government struggle with weakened budgets, overall nonfarm payrolls are forecast increasing by 486,000 jobs after rising 638,000 in October. 
That would the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and leave employment 9.609 million below its peak in February. Job growth peaked at a record 4.781 million in June. 
Authorities across the country have imposed new restrictions on businesses and other places where crowds congregate. While the measures are not as tough as in March when the coronavirus pandemic started in the United States, they have had a chilling effect on the labor market.
First-time applications for unemployment benefits have increased for two straight weeks. Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed a decline in the number of employees working in November compared to October. 
A survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday showed its measure of factory employment contracted in November after expanding in October for the first time since July 2019. Manufacturers cited high rates of absenteeism and difficulties returning people to work and hiring staff due to COVID-19.

The economy grew at a historic 33.1% annualized rate in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below 5%.

“Most Federal Reserve Districts have characterized economic expansion as modest or moderate,” the central bank said in its Beige Book survey released Wednesday in Washington.
The report was based on information collected by the Fed’s 12 regional banks through Nov. 20.
“Four Districts described little or no growth, and five narratives noted that activity remained below pre-pandemic levels for at least some sectors,” the Beige Book said.
The number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. has increased sharply since the end of October. The surge is leading some cities and states to again implement lock down measures. The arrival of colder winter weather in much of the country is also dampening economic activity, as virus-compatible activities like dining outdoors become impossible.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese industrial activity has snapped back to pre-coronavirus growth levels, with factory surveys hitting multi-year highs in November, but the headline expansion masks struggles for smaller firms and looming pressures for exporters.
Readings from the official and Caixin's Purchasing Managers Indexes hit three- and 10-year highs respectively last month, a reflection of the industrial sector's strong overall recovery.
Official data also shows industrial profits for large firms grew at their fastest pace since 2017 in October.
Equipment, electronics and auto manufacturing have performed particularly well, helped by state subsidies targeting consumption of cars and white goods.
But behind the strong headline numbers, many smaller firms, which employ the majority of China's workforce and are traditionally its collective engine of industry, are still struggling, say official data and analysts.
""The recovery is uneven, because it's driven by investment and construction, and mainly for large firms,"" said Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank (China).
""Monetary policy has been tight since June, so small firms face a widespread liquidity shortage.""
Following a string of supportive measures this year, China's central bank has shifted to a more steady stance as the economy rebounds.
After a string of high-profile bond defaults, the PBOC this week unexpectedly injected 200 billion yuan (23 billion pounds) through its one-year medium-term lending facility, in an apparent bid to soothe market nerves.
Official data shows the recovery of factory activity for smaller firms has lagged well behind that of larger ones since the coronavirus stalled industrial activity earlier in the year.
Small firms' factory activity only accelerated in two of the past six months, and at a much slower pace than that of larger ones.
""The recovery of the manufacturing industry is still uneven,"" said Zhao Qinghe, an official of the National Bureau of Statistics, in comments released along with November PMI data.
Certain sectors, such as textiles, have seen factory activity continue to decelerate every month this year, Zhao added.
EXPORT UNCERTAINTIES
Exporters also face uncertainties from the appreciation of the yuan currency and uncertain global demand, say analysts.
The currency started its appreciation trend in June and booked six straight months of gains, its longest such winning streak since late 2014. It has risen nearly 9% against the dollar since late May.
Some firms reported that a strong yuan squeezed profits and reduced export orders in November, said Zhao.
""Now the expectation is RMB will continue to hike and that can wipe out more small export firms,"" said Hang Seng's Wang, referring to the renminbi, another name for the yuan.
China has posted surprisingly strong headline export data for months, helped by strong foreign demand for medical supplies and electronics products and continuing virus-related disruptions of other countries' production.
Surging infections and fresh lockdowns in some key trading partners could dent demand for some Chinese exports. But bringing the virus under control overseas could also reduce its competitive advantage in producing other goods.

""China exports - and profits of export-oriented industrial firms - may face some headwinds if other major economies regain market share,"" said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance.

Germany has ordered restaurants, bars, entertainment venues and gyms to close since Nov. 2 in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19. Schools, factories and shops remain open with social distancing conditions.
Retail sales - a notoriously volatile indicator often subject to revisions - rose 2.6% in October on the month in real terms, the Federal Statistics Office said.
That followed an upwardly revised drop of 1.9% in September and compared with a Reuters forecast for a rise of 1.2%.
On the year, retail sales jumped 8.2%, beating a Reuters forecast for a rise of 5.9%.
Demand was particularly strong for furnishings and household appliances.
Online retailers continued to benefit from shifting consumer habits with a strong jump in sales, which came at the expense of clothing and shoe stores which suffered further losses.
Compared with February, the month before the pandemic started in Germany, retail sales were 5.9% higher in real terms, suggesting that the sector has already put the crisis behind it.
The better-than-expected retail sales data followed bullish job market data which showed on Tuesday that unemployment fell further in November despite the partial lockdown.
But a gloomy consumer sentiment survey released by the GfK institute last week suggests the resilient labour market will not automatically translate into higher household spending at the end of the year.

Economic institutes expect Germany's gross domestic product to shrink by about 1% in the fourth quarter after a stronger-than-expected 8.5% rebound in the third and an unprecedented 9.8% plunge in the second quarter.

The Australian dollar edged up after the report, trading at 73.87 U.S. cents at 11:34 a.m. in Sydney from 73.78 cents before the data.

However, rising COVID-19 cases in the U.S. states have increased the uncertainty over a speedy rebound.
The seasonally adjusted annualized sales pace for light vehicles dropped to 15.55 million units in November, from 16.21 million units in October and 17.09 million units in the year-ago period, according to Wards Intelligence. 
Still, that is nearly double the 8.58 million units marked in April, when the sales pace hit its lowest since December 1970 due to pandemic-led lockdown restrictions.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that construction spending jumped 1.3% in October. Data for September was revised down to show construction outlays declining 0.5% instead of rising 0.3% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would rise 0.8% in October. Construction spending increased 3.7% on a year-on-year basis in October.
Spending on private construction projects advanced 1.4%, fueled by investment in homebuilding amid record-low mortgage rates and a pandemic-driven migration to suburbs and low-density areas. Spending on residential projects shot up 2.9%.
But outlays on nonresidential construction like gas and oil well drilling fell 0.7% in October. The pandemic has crushed oil prices, resulting in a contraction in spending on nonresidential structures in the third quarter. The fourth straight quarterly decline in spending on nonresidential structures bucked a rebound in overall business investment.

Spending on public construction projects increased 1.0% in October.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in November, with new orders retreating from their highest level in nearly 17 years, as a resurgence in COVID-19 cases across the nation kept workers at home and factories temporarily shut down to sanitize facilities.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Tuesday warned that absenteeism at factories and their suppliers as well as difficulties in returning and hiring workers would continue to ""dampen"" manufacturing until the coronavirus crisis ended. 
The softening in factory activity supports expectations for a sharp deceleration in economic growth in the fourth quarter amid the raging pandemic and end of fiscal stimulus. 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday urged Congress to provide more help for small businesses. A bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed a new $908 billion emergency relief package for small businesses and millions of unemployed Americans.
""The feared economic slowdown is starting, but it is pretty slow off the blocks,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The ISM's index of national factory activity dropped to a reading of 57.5 last month from 59.3 in October, which had been the highest since November 2018. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would slip to 58 in November. 
Sixteen manufacturing industries, including wood products, machinery and transportation equipment, reported growth last month. Petroleum and coal products, as well as printing and related support activities industries, contracted.
The United States is in the grip of a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections, with 4.2 million new cases and over 35,000 coronavirus-related deaths reported in November, according to a Reuters tally of official data. The virus is likely to disrupt production at factories. Manufacturing output is still about 5% below its pre-pandemic level, according to the Fed.
More than $3 trillion in government COVID-19 relief has run out. The fiscal stimulus helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter. 
Slowing manufacturing activity followed on the heels of data last week showing consumer spending cooling in October. 
The economy grew at a historic 33.1% annualized rate in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% rate. Exploding COVID-19 infections and lack of additional stimulus have left some economists anticipating a contraction in the first quarter of 2021. 
A second report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed a solid increase in construction spending in October, but outlays in September actually declined instead of rising modestly as was previously estimated.
Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq hitting record highs on hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine would be available soon. The dollar fell to a 2-1/2-year low against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
MIXED VIEWS
Manufacturers last month offered mixed assessments of business conditions. Transportation equipment makers said the flare-up in COVID-19 cases was straining suppliers, with labor the main issue, impacting production. 
In the food industry, factories were ""sending employees home for 14 days to quarantine,"" and ""had to shut down production lines due to lack of staffing."" This led to ""much higher than normal"" production costs, suggesting consumers could soon be paying more at the supermarket at a time when about 13.6 million Americans are due to lose government-funded unemployment benefits a day after Christmas. 
But fabricated metal producers reported strong business and said they expected demand to continue growing in 2021. Machinery manufacturers were also upbeat, though they said the coronavirus remained a concern. 
ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index fell to a reading of 65.1 in November from 67.9 in October, which was the highest reading since January 2004. Manufacturing employment contracted after expanding in October for the first time since July 2019. 
ISM's manufacturing employment gauge dropped to a reading of 48.4 from 53.2 in October. That likely reflects the absenteeism due to the coronavirus as well as layoffs as demand softens. It fits in with economists' expectations that job growth slowed further in November. Manufacturing accounts for more than 10% of private payroll employment.
""Today's news of layoffs in the sector, either planned or unplanned, is a worrisome sign that shows there is not a clear path to winning here for the economic outlook as 2021 approaches,"" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
According to an early Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 495,000 jobs last month after rising by 638,000 in October. Employment growth has cooled from a record 4.781 million new jobs in June. 

About 12.1 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered. The government is scheduled to publish November's employment report on Friday.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's economy notched record growth in the third quarter, with real GDP expected to climb 0.2% in October, Statistics Canada said on Tuesday, though analysts cautioned the rebound would stagnate in coming months amid renewed COVID-19 restrictions.
Canada's Q3 annualized growth soared 40.5%, rebounding from a historic plunge in the second quarter, while September real GDP rose by 0.8%. Both the quarterly and monthly numbers missed analyst expectations.
Despite the gains, total economic activity remains about 5% below February's pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said. 
""We already knew we had a rapid bounce back in economic activity in the third quarter,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at RBC. ""The concern now is how much of that can be sustained with the accelerating virus spread.""
Canada is in the midst of a harsh second wave of COVID-19 infections and a number of provinces have already imposed new restrictions, and in some cases targeted lockdowns, in an effort to stem the spread.
That will likely impact economic growth, said economists, warning activity could contract late this year, leading to a far smaller Q4 annualized gain.
""Much of the focus is now on the fourth quarter and what happens early next year,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, though he added the ""modest growth"" seen for October was encouraging.
""The economy had a bit of momentum going into the shutdowns,"" he said. 
On Monday, Canada's Liberal-led government unveiled a historic C$381.6 billion deficit and pledged up to C$100 billion in stimulus spending to ""jumpstart"" the recovery, once the virus is under control. 

The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% higher at 1.2959 to the greenback, or 77.17 U.S. cents.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 55.8 in November from 55.5 in October. Since July, the PMI has been above the 50 threshold that marks expansion in the sector.
""Latest survey data shows encouraging signs at the Canadian manufacturing sector as it continues to recover from the second quarter downturn,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
The output index stayed solidly in expansion territory, dipping to 55.1 from 55.2 in October, which was its highest in more than two years. The measure of new orders also showed solid expansion, while the employment index rose to 52.5 from 51.2.
Canada's national statistical agency is due to release the November labor force survey on Friday. Canada is in the middle of a second wave of the pandemic and daily cases regularly hit record highs despite increasing efforts by the 10 provinces to clamp down on businesses and curb gatherings. 
""With a resurgence in case numbers, and further lockdown measures announced, the (manufacturing) sector could face softer growth prospects or a second dip in the coming months,"" Patel said.
Material shortages, supplier delays and transportation restrictions linked to the pandemic led to another deterioration in vendor performance during November, IHS Markit said. The suppliers' delivery times index fell to 34.2 from 37.4 in October.

But business confidence showed improvement, with the measure of future output rising to 62.9 from 61.4.

The bank's IMACEC economic activity index encompasses about 90% of the economy tallied in gross domestic product figures. The October figure was the economy's best showing since February, when the economy grew 3.3%, bank statistics show.
But economic activity in Chile remained hobbled by the coronavirus outbreak, the bank said, even though cases of COVID-19 have fallen with the onset the southern hemisphere's spring.
The bank said a drop in the production of goods and services had largely driven the contraction, but added the impact was softened by gains in commerce as quarantines were lifted across much of the nation.
Chile's mining activity also grew by 1.6% in October, the bank said, a persistent bright spot during the pandemic.
Most of Chile's sprawling copper mines maintained output even at the height of the country's outbreak in May and June, a lifeline for an economy that depends on metals exports.

337,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 05:51AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation remained in negative territory for the fourth straight month in November, reinforcing European Central Bank concerns that the dip in prices may be more persistent than feared as deflationary forces intensify amid a deep recession.
Annualised price growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro held steady at minus 0.3%, underperforming expectations for minus 0.2%, as energy prices tumbled and the decline in non-energy industrial goods accelerated as Europe implemented lockdown measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
Perhaps more worrying for policymakers, a narrower core measure, which excludes food and energy costs, remained steady at 0.4%, well below the ECB's target of almost 2%, an objective it has persistently undershot for more than seven years. 
With the euro zone heading back into recession in the fourth quarter, the ECB has already flagged more stimulus at its December meeting, making the case for more emergency bond buys and cheap liquidity to banks, leaving policymakers only to debate the details of the package. 
Policymakers also argued that the task is to keep financing conditions at their current level, rather than to cut them further, a point also made by ECB board member Isabel Schnabel in an interview with Bloomberg. [F9N2GX01C]
While markets expect a six-month extension of emergency bond buys, Schnabel said that a longer extension is also being considered and it was not the ECB's job to deliver on market expectations.
Inflation is likely to be the main discussion in the December meeting as policymakers are increasingly worried that a deep and lengthy recession makes deflationary forces more permanent. 
Indeed, an even narrower inflation measure, which excludes food, energy, tobacco and alcohol, held steady at 0.2%, indicating that there are barely any underlying price pressures. 
""Policymakers had hoped that most of the fall in inflation since the summer was due to temporary factors including the VAT cut in Germany and atypical times of summer clothes sales,"" Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
""But the breadth of the fall in inflation since the summer, which has affected all euro zone countries, and its persistence suggest that these temporary factors are not the whole story.""

The ECB now expects negative inflation readings well into early 2021.

LONDON (Reuters) - British factories recorded their fastest growth in almost three years last month as they stockpiled raw materials and rushed to complete work before new post-Brexit customs rules come into force on Jan. 1, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 55.6 in November from 53.7 in October, its highest since December 2017 and above an earlier flash reading of 55.2, bucking a gloomier picture from other sectors hit harder by COVID.
""The upcoming end to the Brexit transition period ... led to rising levels of input purchasing, stockpiling of raw materials and stronger gains in new export business as EU-based clients brought forward orders,"" data company IHS Markit said.
Britain and the EU have so far failed to agree a deal to allow tariff-free trade from Jan. 1, and even with a deal many exporters fear lengthy delays at ports due to new customs requirements.
""Whether the upturn of manufacturing production can be sustained into the new year is therefore highly uncertain, especially once the temporary boosts from Brexit purchasing and stockbuilding wane,"" IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said.
November saw the biggest rise in purchases of raw materials since March 2019, the biggest rise in export orders since January 2018, and the sharpest boost to optimism since 2014.
Factory output, which is only one component of the total PMI, also accelerated. But it showed slower growth than over the summer as the second wave of COVID cases reduced demand for some consumer goods, where new orders fell by the most in six months. 
The most recent official data showed that factory output in September was almost 8% lower than a year earlier, similar to the rest of the economy.

Manufacturing is also still experiencing job losses, with the PMI showing that factories cut staff numbers for a tenth consecutive month, the longest decline since the 2008-09 recession after the global financial crisis.

IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 53.8 in November from October's 54.8 but was ahead of the 53.6 flash estimate. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
An index measuring output which feeds into a composite PMI due on Thursday that is seen as a good guide to economic health sank to 55.3 from 58.4.
""Although the rate of expansion cooled from October's 32-month high amid new lockdown measures, the sustained expansion should help to soften the economic blow of COVID-19 restrictions, which have hit the service sector hard,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The survey therefore adds to evidence the region will avoid in the final quarter of the year a similar scale of downturn recorded in the second quarter.""
While the manufacturing sector continued to expand, an earlier flash reading of the overall survey showed activity in the bloc's dominant service industry contracted last month as a second wave of the coronavirus swept across Europe.
As most of Europe grapples with a resurgence in infections, the euro zone is on track for its first double-dip recession in nearly a decade, according to a Reuters poll of economists last month. [ECILT/EU]
The PMI showed demand waned and factories cut headcount again last month but optimism did improve amid progress in developing COVID-19 vaccines. The future output index rose to 64.8 from 62.7, its highest since March 2018.
""A brighter outlook is indicated by the upturn in optimism for the year ahead, suggesting the upturn should gather strength again in the coming months as lockdown measures ease and spending, especially investment, picks up in response to the recent news on vaccine development,"" Williamson said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian factories recovered further in November from the COVID-19 crisis, surveys showed on Tuesday, thanks to a boom in economic powerhouse China which has enabled the region to withstand the pandemic better than many of its peers.
China's factory activity accelerated at the fastest pace in a decade in November, a private sector survey showed, a sign the world's second-largest economy is rebounding to pre-pandemic levels.
But a global resurgence in coronavirus infections has made the outlook highly uncertain, keeping governments and central banks under pressure to maintain or ramp up their massive stimulus programmes, analysts say.
PMI surveys for other regions due later on Tuesday are expected to show a continued recovery in factory activity in the euro zone, while U.S. manufacturing activity is seen expanding but at a slower pace.
""There is little sign that large second waves of the virus in the U.S. and Europe have weighed on Asia's export-focussed industry, suggesting that external demand will continue to hold up,"" Capital Economics said in a research note.
China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.9 from October's 53.6, marking the highest level since November 2010. 
The gauge stayed well above the 50-level that separates growth from contraction for the seventh consecutive month. It was also in line with an official survey that showed activity at Chinese factories expanded at the fastest pace in more than three years in November.
A steady recovery in global demand also helped Japan's factory activity move a notch closer to stabilisation in November, and that of South Korea to accelerate at the fastest pace in nearly a decade.
""Overall, it looks likely that Asian industry will remain strong over the coming months, helping economic recoveries to stay on track,"" Capital Economics said.
Asia's performance comes as many countries in the region have had greater success in containing the virus than their U.S. and European peers.
China's economy is seen increasing 1.9% this year, while the U.S. economy is expected to contract 4.3% and euro zone economies by 8.3%, according to the International Monetary Fund's estimate in October.
PATCHY RECOVERY
The surveys on Tuesday showed factory activity also grew in Taiwan and Indonesia, a sign the pick-up in Chinese demand was underpinning the region's economy.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing PMI hit 49.0 in November, up from the previous month's 48.7 and a preliminary 48.3 reading.
South Korea's IHS Markit PMI rose to 52.9 in November from 51.2 in October, the highest reading since February 2011 and marking the second month of activity expansion.
But India's manufacturing recovery faltered in November as coronavirus fears weighed on demand and output, prompting firms to cut jobs for the eighth month in a row.
That underscored the patchy nature of Asia's outlook, with some analysts still cautious on the outlook with global and domestic demand vulnerable to infection trends. 
""Japan's economy likely slowed in July-September but averted a contraction due to a pick-up in exports and the effect of government campaigns to prop up demand,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.

""But the economy may contract in January-March if households hold off on spending again. If service-sector firms suffering from plunging sales cut spending, that could hit jobs and capital expenditure.""

Investing.com – China’s November factory sector activity grew at the fastest pace since November 2010, as the country’s economy continues its recovery towards pre-COVID-19 levels.
Data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) came in at 54.9, above the 50-mark indicating expansion for the seventh consecutive month. It was also above the 53.5 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s figure of 53.6.
The survey also showed that total new orders and factory output reached 10-year highs, although new export orders saw a more modest gain. It also showed a third consecutive month of Chinese factories hiring workers and at a faster pace.
“Manufacturing continued to recover, and the economy increasingly returned to normality as fallout from the domestic COVID-19 epidemic faded,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a note accompanying the survey release.
“Supply and demand improved at the same time. Employment recovered markedly and overseas demand kept expanding.” Input and output prices both rose, with respondents to the survey citing a sharp rise in the cost of raw materials, especially metals, Wang said.
The survey also follows data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday, showing the manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) at 52.1 and the non-manufacturing PMI at 56.4 in November.
The data demonstrates that China continues to see a strong rebound in activity from its COVID-19 lockdown earlier in the year. Strictly enforced virus containment measures, infrastructure-driven stimulus, strong exports of medical supplies, and pent-up demand have also contributed to the rebound.
E-commerce shopping promotions that took place in November, including Singles’ Day, saw strong consumer demand, bolstering small and medium-sized companies’ confidence. Other economic indicators, including trade and producer prices, hinted at a further pick up in the industrial sector.
Although the expected growth in the Chinese economy is the weakest since 1976, the 2% figure is still stronger the growth expected in other major economies.
“We expect the economic recovery in the post-epidemic era to continue for several months. At the same time, deciding how to gradually withdraw the easing policies launched during the epidemic will require careful planning as uncertainties still exist inside and outside China,” Wang said.
However, challenges on the road to recovery remain. Rising numbers of COVID-19 cases and the re-imposition of lockdowns in some of China’s trading partners could put a dent in the demand for Chinese exports.
Investors now await the Caixin services PMI, due later in the week."

Surging infections and fresh lockdowns in some of its key trading partners could dent demand for Chinese exports, which have been surprisingly resilient so far.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) in its latest report highlighted backlogs in processing a record volume of applications among issues behind the flawed data.
In response to the economic shock from COVID-19, the government rolled out three federally funded temporary programs for unemployment insurance (UI), expanding benefit eligibility to people who did not qualify for the regular state UI and enhancing benefits. 
The Labor Department's weekly jobless claims publishes the number of weeks of unemployment benefits claimed by individuals in each state during the period and reports the total as the number of people claiming benefits nationwide.
""DOL officials told GAO that they have traditionally used this number as a proxy for the number of individuals claiming benefits because they were closely related,"" the GAO said.
""However, the number of claims has not been an accurate estimate of the number of individuals claiming benefits during the pandemic because of backlogs in processing a historic volume of claims, among other data issues.""
Economists have complained about the accuracy of the data. In August, the Labor Department changed the methodology it uses to address seasonal fluctuations in the claims data.
The GAO recommended that the Labor Department revise its weekly news releases to ""clarify that in the current unemployment environment, the numbers it reports for weeks of unemployment claimed do not accurately estimate the number of unique individuals claiming benefits."" 
It also said the department should ""pursue options to report the actual number of distinct individuals claiming benefits, such as by collecting these already available data from states from January 2020."" 
The GAO said the department had partially agreed with the recommendations. It did not agree with the retroactive reporting of the data as this could pose challenges to state UI programs in implementing any new reporting requirements, especially retroactively.
""Without an accurate accounting of the number of individuals who are relying on these benefits in as close to real time as possible, policymakers may be challenged to respond to the crisis at hand,"" the GAO said.

Two government-funded UI programs will expire in December, affecting at least 13.6 million Americans.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes fell for a second straight month in October as an acute shortage of properties pushed up prices, though the housing market remains supported by record low mortgage rates.
Other data on Monday showed activity at factories in the Midwest and Texas slowing this month, likely as a nationwide resurgence in new COVID-19 infections curbed new orders and disrupted production. The reports support expectations of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the fourth quarter because of the raging coronavirus pandemic and depleted fiscal stimulus.
""Storm clouds are gathering,"" said George Ratiu, senior economist at realtor.com. ""This winter could pose an unusual challenge for many people across the country, unless Congress takes significant actions."" 
The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, decreased 1.1% to 128.9. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, would rebound 1.0% in October.
Compared to a year ago, pending homes sales jumped 20.2% in October. The monthly decline in contracts suggests a slowdown in sales of existing home sales after they accelerated in October to their highest level since November 2005.
The housing market is being driven by record low mortgage rates. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen at least 21% of the labor force working from home, has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out more spacious accommodation for home offices and schools.
The coronavirus recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners. At least 20 million people are on unemployment benefits. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average 2.72%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
U.S. stocks were trading lower on Monday. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. 
The United States is in the grip of a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections, with more than 4 million new cases and over 35,000 coronavirus-related deaths reported so far in November, according to a Reuters tally. 
The resurgence is happening at a time when more than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief has lapsed. The fiscal stimulus helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter. 
RISING LAYOFFS
Applications for unemployment benefits have increased for two straight weeks and about 13.6 million Americans will lose government-funded jobless benefits a day after Christmas. Another package is expected only after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. President Donald Trump is consumed with contesting his electoral loss to Biden.
A second report on Monday showed the Chicago Business Barometer dropped to a reading of 58.2 in November from 61.1 in October. A reading above 50 in the index produced with MNI indicates expansion in factory activity in the Chicago area. The survey's new orders measure dropped for the first time since May, when the recovery from the pandemic started.
The moderation in factory activity was corroborated by another survey from the Dallas Federal Reserve showing its production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions in Texas, tumbled to a reading of 7.2 this month from 25.5 in October. Factories in the region reported a significant slowdown in new orders, and were less upbeat about the outlook. 
The surveys, together with reports earlier this month showing a cooling in activity in factories in New York and the mid-Atlantic region, suggest national manufacturing moderated in November after accelerating in October. 
The Institute for Supply Management is scheduled to publish its November survey on Tuesday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the ISM national manufacturing index likely fell to a reading of 58.0 from 59.3 in October.
""The manufacturing sector is continuing to recover but remains below pre-pandemic levels,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""The threat now comes from virus outbreaks that could interrupt activity, disrupt supply chains and weigh on demand.""
Robust demand for housing has outstripped supply, boosting home prices out of the reach of many first-time buyers, despite builders ramping up construction. The government reported this month that single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, raced to the highest level since April 2007.
Though homebuilder confidence is at historic highs, builders have complained about shortages of land and materials.
In October, pending home sales edged up 0.1% in the South. They were unchanged in the West. Contracts dropped 5.9% in the Northeast and fell 0.7% in the Midwest.

""We expect a resurging pandemic, faltering recovery, and depleted inventories to weigh on home sales, particularly if no additional fiscal stimulus is forthcoming,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

The National Association of Realtors said on Monday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, decreased 1.1% to 128.9. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, would rebound 1.0% in October.
Compared to a year ago, pending homes sales jumped 20.2% in October. The monthly decline in contracts suggests a moderation in sales of existing home sales after they accelerated in October to their highest level since November 2005.
The housing market is being driven by record low mortgage rates. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen at least 21% of the labor force working from home, has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out more spacious accommodation for home offices and schools.
The coronavirus recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners. At least 20 million people are on unemployment benefits. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average 2.72%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).

Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, fell 0.7% year-on-year after shrinking by 0.5% in the previous month, the Federal Statistics Office said.
November's preliminary data compared with a Reuters poll forecast of a 0.5% decline.
""The inflation rate is influenced, among other things, by the reduction in value-added tax that came into force on July 1, 2020,"" the office said in a statement.
On the month, harmonised prices fell 1.0%. The Reuters consensus forecast was a fall of 0.8%.
The European Central Bank, which has a target of keeping inflation close to but below 2% in the euro zone, is preparing a new stimulus package to help cushion the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
The ECB's chief economist warned last Thursday that accepting ""a longer phase of even lower inflation"" would hurt consumption and investment as well as cementing expectations of low price growth in the future.
The euro zone's central bank has kept the money taps wide open for years and promised to announce further stimulus, probably in the form of even more bond purchases and subsidised loans to banks, at its Dec. 10 meeting.

LONDON (Reuters) - British lenders approved the most mortgages in more than 13 years in October, Bank of England data showed on Monday, suggesting no let-up yet in a post-coronavirus lockdown bounce-back in the country's housing market.
But the figures also underscored a broader wariness about day-to-day borrowing among many consumers - whose spending helps drive the economy - as the country was hit by a second wave of COVID-19 cases.
Mortgage approvals for house purchase hit 97,532, up from 92,091 in September and higher than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Britain's housing market has gone into top gear in recent months, propelled by demand for bigger properties from people who were locked down at home in the spring and an emergency tax cut for buyers that is due to expire in March.
The housing recovery looks increasingly at odds with a renewed slowdown in the economy and a rise in unemployment that looks set to peak only next year.
The BoE data showed net consumer lending fell by 590 million pounds ($786 million) on the month, much of it due to repayment of credit card debt.
Lending to consumers was down 5.6% compared with a year ago, the biggest such drop since monthly records began in 1994.
Household savings rose by 12.3 billion pounds, the biggest monthly increase since May.
""A reduction in the use of consumer credit and another increase in savings suggests many are bracing themselves for further economic uncertainty,"" Alistair McQueen, head of savings and retirement at insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV), said.
As well as a second wave of coronavirus restrictions, Britain's economy is also facing the risk of a trade shock if London and Brussels fail to strike a post-Brexit trade deal by the end of the year.

The increase in mortgages came after real estate agencies started getting enquiries on properties and visits again from June, following a near-standstill for the industry during nearly three months of pandemic lockdown.
Rural and coastal regions like Aragon and Asturias registered 78% and 76% more mortgages respectively year-on-year as people fled urban centres.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in more than three years in November, while growth in the services sector also hit a multi-year high, as the country's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic stepped up.
Upbeat data released on Monday suggests the world's second-largest economy is on track to become the first to completely shake off the drag from widespread industry shutdowns, with recent production data showing manufacturing now at pre-pandemic levels.
China's official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) rose to 52.1 in November from 51.4 in October, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed. It was the highest PMI reading since September 2017 and remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. It was also higher than the 51.5 median forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
""The rise in November manufacturing PMI, with broad-based improvements across the sub-indices, suggest the recovery momentum in the industrial sector has become more certain,"" Zhang Liqun, analyst at China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing.
""But the results also showed inadequate demand is still a common issue facing firms. We need to consolidate the policy support aimed to expand domestic demand.""
China's blue-chip stock market index hit a 5-1/2 year high following the brisk data.
The robust headline PMI points to solid fourth-quarter growth, which analysts at Nomura expect to quicken to 5.7% year-on-year, from 4.9% in the third quarter, an impressive turnaround from the deep contraction earlier this year.
The economy is expected to expand around 2% for the full year, the weakest in over three decades but still much stronger than other major economies that are struggling to bring their coronavirus outbreaks under control.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed the sub-index for new export orders stood at 51.5 in November, improving from 51.0 a month earlier. That bodes well for the export sector, which has benefited from strong foreign demand for medical supplies and electronics products.
Also helping activity in November were strong e-commerce shopping promotions, which unleashed solid consumer demand and bolstered confidence for small and medium firms.
But a surging yuan and further lockdowns in many of its key trading partners could pressure Chinese exports, which have been surprisingly resilient so far.
More companies have reported the impact from currency fluctuations, compared with a month ago, said Zhao Qinghe, senior statistician at the NBS.
""Some firms have flagged that as the yuan continues to rise, corporate profits are under pressure and export orders are declining,"" said Zhao. 
He added the recovery across the manufacturing industry remained uneven. For example, the PMI for the textile industry has stayed below the 50-point threshold, pointing to weak business activity.
CONSUMER COMEBACK
In the services sector, activity expanded for the ninth straight month. The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 56.4, the fastest since June 2012 and up from 56.2 in October, as consumer confidence gathered pace amid few COVID-19 infections. 
Railway and air transportation, telecommunication and satellite transmission services and the financial industry were among the best performing sectors in November.
A sub-index for construction activity stood at 60.5 in November, improving from 59.8 in October, as China steps up infrastructure spending to revive its economy. 
Monday's data also showed the labour market is still facing strains. Services firms reduced payrolls at a faster clip in November, data showed, while factories slashed staff for the seventh straight month, although at a slower pace. 

""The continued recovery reduces the need for further monetary easing, but any shift to tightening is also unlikely given continued labour market pressure,"" said Erin Xin, Greater China economist at HSBC.

Investing.com – Chinese factory activity grew at the fastest pace in more than three years in November, with the services sector also seeing its highest levels in years. The country continues a strong economic recovery, with manufacturing now at pre-COVID-19 levels. China is also poised to become the first to country to completely recover from the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown imposed earlier in the year.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) grew 52.1% in November, higher than the 51.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 51.4% reading. Meanwhile, the non-manufacturing PMI also outperformed, growing 56.4% in November against the forecast 56% and October’s 56.2% figure.
“The rise in November’s manufacturing PMI, with broad-based improvements across the sub-indices, suggest the recovery momentum in the industrial sector has become more certain,” China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing analyst Zhang Liqun told Reuters.
“But the results also showed inadequate demand is still a common issue facing firms. We need to consolidate the policy support aimed to expand domestic demand,” Zhang added.
China currently leads the pack in economic recovery from COVID-19. The economy is expected to grow around 2% for the full year, its weakest level in over 30 years but still ahead of other major economies.
The growth in the manufacturing PMI indicates a bright future for exports, already the beneficiary of strong overseas demand for medical supplies and electronics products. E-commerce shopping promotions, primarily on Singles Day earlier in the month, also saw strong consumer demand and boosted small and medium firms’ confidence levels.
However, a strengthening yuan and trading partners such as Europe and the U.S. introducing fresh lockdowns to curb a second wave of COVID-19 cases, remain challenges to the recovery. More companies have reported the impact from currency fluctuations, compared with a month ago, NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe told Reuters.
“Some firms have flagged that as the yuan continues to rise, corporate profits are under pressure and export orders are declining.” Zhao warned, however, that recovery across the manufacturing industry remained uneven. The PMI for the textile industry stayed below the 50-mark indicating growth, for example.
Meanwhile, the services sector secured a ninth straight month of expansion, the fastest since June 2012, as fewer COVID-19 cases in China increased consumer confidence.
Some of the best performing sectors in November include railway and air transportation, telecommunication and satellite transmission services, and the financial industry.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output rose for the fifth straight month in October and retail sales in the same month grew the most in over a year, signalling the economy was recovering further from the damage caused by the COVID-19 crisis.
The world's third-largest economy rebounded sharply in the third quarter from a pandemic-induced slump, thanks to surging consumption and exports, though some analysts worry about slowing growth ahead due to a resurgence in coronavirus infections.
""There's a possibility China-bound exports and output will be sluggish if the United States gets worse, and that would spread to China,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research.
""But if there will be any impact, it'll be with a bit of a time lag,"" he said, adding that Japanese manufacturers could feel it most strongly in the first quarter of next year.
Official data released on Monday showed factory output jumped 3.8% in October from the previous month, mainly due to strength in general machinery production and motor vehicle manufacturing.
The solid increase beat the median market forecast of a 2.1% rise in a Reuters poll of economists, and was in line with the prior month's 3.9% gain.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to grow another 2.7% in November and decline 2.4% in December.
""The overall figure was quite strong. (Output of) capital expenditure-related machinery such as general machinery production was picking up,"" Tsunoda said.
Inventories across all industries fell 1.6% in October, the seventh straight month of decline, as inventories of inorganic and organic chemicals as well as iron, steel and non-ferrous metals were reduced.
Separate data showed retail sales posted their largest gain since September last year in October year-on-year after consumers sharply curtailed spending in October 2019 following a sales tax hike at that time.
Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year in October to rise for the first time in eight months, matching a 6.4% gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll and turning around from an 8.7% drop in the previous month.
Some analysts worry that the economic recovery will lose steam as a resurgence in coronavirus infections at home and abroad is expected to weigh on demand due to slowing corporate and consumer activity.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga instructed his cabinet earlier this month to compile a package of stimulus measures to speed up the country's economic recovery.
The package is expected to target structural changes, supporting environmental investment and boosting productivity through digitalisation.

Ruling party lawmakers have called for an extra budget worth around 20 trillion yen to 30 trillion yen ($192.05 billion to $288.07 billion), which will fund part of the stimulus package.

""The prospects for Christmas business in this coronavirus year are worryingly poor, especially for many inner-city retailers and especially the fashion houses,"" said HDE managing director Stefan Genth on Sunday.
Around 52% of companies expect significant losses in sales and customers after the extension of the country's partial lockdown into December, the survey found, with 62% of retailers surveyed pessimistic about the further course of Christmas business.
""November and December are normally the strongest months of the year in terms of sales for many retailers. If these sales are now lost, many businesses will be in trouble"".
The survey found that 38% of the retail companies overall and 45% of inner-city retailers see their existence threatened.
Retailers selling household goods, DIY supplies, furnishings and food, however, are reporting satisfactory to very good business, HDE said, while online sales are expected to rise by a third compared to the previous year.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Loan defaults in Brazil fell to historic lows in October, figures showed on Friday, in further evidence of the economy's recovery and that the central bank's steps to loosen financial conditions were working.
Key measures of household and business loan defaults were their lowest since the central bank's data series began in 2011, although lending spreads widened slightly from the previous month's record lows.
A broad 90-day default ratio covering households and businesses fell to 3.1% in October from 3.2% in September, the central bank said, the lowest since the bank's data series began in 2011.
(Graphic: Brazil loan defaults https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopadrqrva/DEFAULTS.png)
The default ratio for non-financial companies fell to a record low 1.5% from 1.6%, while the broad measure of household defaults, including borrowing such as auto loans and overdrafts, also fell to a series low of 4.5% from 4.6% the month before.
Lending spreads, however, widened to 21.5 percentage points from September's record low 21.2 percentage points, the central bank said. That was still significantly down from 29 percentage points in February before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The central bank has made available more than 1.2 trillion reais worth of credit and liquidity to businesses, banks and financial markets to cushion the economic shock of COVID-19.
Central bank president Roberto Campos Neto said this week that these measures are ""here to stay"", although they will be modified. Their implementation marks a ""structural change"", he said.
The government has also provided direct cash transfers to tens of millions of Brazil's poorest people. These measures appear to have helped revive lending and economic activity, and stave off loan defaults.
The stock of outstanding loans in Brazil rose 1.4% in October to 3.9 trillion reais ($730.3 billion), the central bank said. Corporate loans rose 1% on the month to 1.7 trillion reais, and personal loans increased 1.7% to 2.2 trillion reais.
Loan growth over the last 12 months accelerated 14.5%, the central bank said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's unemployment rate rose to a record high 14.6% in the three months to September, official figures showed on Friday, as the easing of COVID-19 social distancing and lockdown measures encouraged people to look for work again.
That was up from 14.4% in the three months to August, although it was lower than the 14.9% economists had expected. The unemployment rate at the end of last year was 11.0%.
The headline 14.6% unemployment rate was the highest since statistics agency IBGE's series began in 2012.
Underlying figures were also weak despite other data recently that showed record formal job growth and the economy continuing to rebound.
The number of Brazilians out of the workforce completely and the underemployment rate remained near record highs, while the number of people with jobs and the share of the working population in work remained near record lows, IBGE said.
The workforce of 96.5 million people was 1 million higher than the three months through August, but still 9.8 million or 9.2% smaller than the same period last year, IBGE said.
The number of people in work was 82.5 million, down 12.1%, or 11.3 million people, from the same period last year.
Only 47.1% of working-age people were working in the three months to September, IBGE said, down 7.7 percentage points from the same period last year.
Some 78.6 million people were out of the workforce completely, down slightly from the three months to August but up 21.2%, or 13.7 million people, from the same period last year, IBGE said.
The number of Brazilians officially out of work rose to 14.1 million, and the number of underemployed was 33.2 million, IBGE said. The underemployment rate was 30.3%.

Figures on Thursday showed that a record net 395,000 formal jobs were created in October. The dominant services sector, which had been hardest hit by social distancing measures, led the charge with a net 157,000 new jobs.

The European Commission's monthly survey showed sentiment in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell to 87.6 points from 91.1 in October, a shade above market expectations of a decline to 86.5 points.
The survey is typically conducted in the first two to three weeks of the month, meaning they relate to the mood after a series of lockdowns were announced, including in the euro zone's two largest economies, Germany and France.
""After the partial recovery of sentiment between May and September and the broad sideways movement in October, the drop is the first one since sentiment fell sharply in the first COVID-19 wave,"" the European Commission said in its report.
The decline of sentiment, it said, was fuelled by diving confidence in retail, services and among consumers. Sentiment in industry and construction, which have been largely spared in lockdowns, suffered only mild declines.
In all cases, the view of future business worsened.
Sentiment in services, the euro zone economy's biggest sector producing some two thirds of gross domestic product, slipped to -17.3 from -12.1. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a fall to -15.5 points.
Sentiment among consumers fell to -17.6 in November from -15.5 points in October, in line with the flash estimate released last week.
The mood in industry dropped to -10.1 from -9.2, just above expectations of a fall to -10.5.
Inflation expectations in industry declined to 0.2 points from 0.7 but rose among consumers to 15.4 points from 13.3 in October. Both were below the average values since 2000.

However, a recent sharp jump in coronavirus cases is clouding the outlook, and expected softness in the job market and declining housing starts indicate a weakening of household purchasing power amid the health crisis.
""Although the economy is picking up, it remains way below the pre-pandemic level,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""As sales declines are prolonged, companies are laying off workers.""

Investing.com – Chinese industrial firms’ profits rose to CNY642.91 billion ($97.78 billion) in October, reflecting the manufacturing sector’s steady recovery from the impact of COVID-19.
Data released earlier in the day from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed a 28.20% increase in Chinese industrial profit year-on-year, a sixth straight month of growth. Profits rose by 10.10% in September.
Profits also rose 0.7% for the year-to-date, up from September’s 2.4% contraction.
Strong exports have driven an impressive recovery in the industrial sector from the lockdown imposed earlier in the year as COVID-19 cases spread. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday that “we expect China’s economy will return to the proper range of development next year.”
“China’s macro policies will remain stable, effective, and sustainable,” Li added.
NBS accredited the growth to a low base in the same period last year and an increase in investment income in November. However, NBS economist Zhu Hong warned that profits could come under pressure going forward.
“We should note that the growth rate of industrial enterprises’ accounts receivable has risen, and the pressure on cash flow has increased, which bodes ill for the continuous recovery of companies’ production and operation,” Zhu said in a statement.
Other investors agreed.
“Looking ahead, we expect profits to remain strong in the coming quarter or two, though the pace of growth may slow. The recovery in household consumption and strong export performance should remain supportive, countering downward pressure from deflation in producer prices,” Bloomberg China economist David Qu told Bloomberg."

Profits at Chinese industrial firms surged 28.2% year-on-year in October to 642.91 billion yuan ($97.79 billion), National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Friday, after rising 10.1% in September versus the previous year.
That was the biggest monthly profit growth since Jan-Feb 2017. The NBS combines the results for January and February to exclude distortions caused by the week-long Lunar New Year.
Zhu Hong, a senior statistician at the NBS, said the sharp jump was helped by rising investment income. It also came from a low base in October 2019, Zhu said. 
China's industrial sector has seen an impressive recovery from the coronavirus fallout, helped by resilient demand for the country's exports. Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday he expects Chinese economic activity to return to a reasonable range next year.
For the January-October period, industrial firms' profits rose 0.7% on an annual basis, after falling 2.4% in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period last year. 
That growth was driven by the equipment manufacturing and the electronic sectors, while the auto manufacturing sector also saw a steady recovery in profits, Zhu said in a statement.
Liabilities at industrial firms rose 6.8% on-year at end-October, versus a 6.6% growth as of end-September.
Earnings at China's state-owned industrial firms were down 7.5% on an annual basis for the first ten months, compared with a 14.3% on-year decline in the January-September period, the statistics bureau data showed. 
Private sector profits grew 1.1% on-year in the January-October period, compared with a 0.5% decline in the first nine months.

The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenue of over 20 million yuan from their main operations.

Industrial profits rose for a sixth straight month, climbing 28.2% in October from a year ago, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Friday. For the first 10 months of the year, profits rose 0.7%.
The acceleration was mainly due to a low base in the same period last year and an increase in investment income this month, the statistics bureau said. Zhu Hong, an economist at the bureau, cautioned that profits may come under pressure going forward.
“We should note that the growth rate of industrial enterprises’ accounts receivable has risen, and the pressure on cash flow has increased, which bodes ill for the continuous recovery of companies’ production and operation,” Zhu said in a statement.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Formal job creation in Brazil surged to a record high in October, figures showed on Thursday, as the dominant services sector roared back to life to account for around 40% of new jobs.
A net 394,989 formal jobs were created in October, the economy ministry said, marking the fourth month in a row of gains and significantly more than the 233,500 forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
The economy ministry chart below shows the scale of job growth in October compared with the same month in previous years.
Graphic: Brazil formal job growth - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovadzagpa/caged.png 
That reduced the net number of formal job losses in the first 10 months of this year to 171,139, the ministry said, also significantly less than 2015 and 2016 when Brazil was last in recession.
Hailing the record figures, Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said that Brazil could end this year not having lost any formal jobs at all as the economic rebound in the second half of the year claws back most of the jobs lost in the first half.
""In this recession ... we didn't lose focus, we got back up, and we are creating jobs at a rapid pace. We can get to the end of the year with zero formal jobs lost. Zero,"" Guedes said, adding that this woulds represent a ""historic year for the Brazilian economy."" 
In October, 1.55 million jobs were created and 1.15 million were cut, the ministry said. Services led the way with a net 156,766 new jobs, followed by trade (115,646) and industry (86,426).
In the first 10 months of 2015 and 2016, a net 818,918 and 751,816 jobs had been lost, respectively, economy ministry figures showed.
The figures also showed that the formal labor market in October consisted of 38.6 million workers, the highest since March this year as discouraged workers returned to look for work.

Official labor market data for the three months to September will be released next week. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to a new series high of 14.9% from 14.4%.

LONDON (Reuters) - The proportion of British workers on furlough has jumped to its highest level since late June following the introduction of a temporary four-week lockdown across England to reverse a second wave of COVID cases, official figures showed on Thursday.
Businesses reported that 15% of staff on average were on furlough between Nov. 2 and Nov. 15, up from 9% in the previous survey which covered the second half of October, the Office for National Statistics said.
Britain's government placed England under a four-week lockdown which started on Nov. 5 which closed restaurants, pubs, non-essential retailers and most other businesses open to the public.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak had intended to terminate the furlough programme at the end of October, but the second wave of COVID cases forced him to extend it until the end of March.
At its peak in May, the programme supported 8.9 million jobs - almost a third of all employees - and it has been the single most expensive part of Britain's COVID economic support programme, costing 43 billion pounds ($57 billion) so far.
On Wednesday, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that take-up in November would rise to 21% of the workforce due to lockdowns in England and other parts of the United Kingdom, before declining to 12% in early 2021 as restrictions eased.
Without the programme, Britain would see a significantly bigger rise in unemployment than the peak of 7.5% pencilled in for next year, the OBR said.

PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - French and German consumer confidence plunged in November as new coronavirus restrictions crushed any prospect of a quick return to normal in the euro zone's two biggest economies, data published on Thursday showed.
Restaurants, bars, hotels and entertainment venues have had to shutter up this month in both countries under new restrictions to contain a new wave of COVID-19 infections.
While retail shops have remained open in Germany, non-essential stores had to close in France. They will be able to reopen on Saturday under strict sanitary protocols.
The latest restrictions leave household demand pent-up heading into the holiday season, pushing back prospects for a consumer-led economic recovery into next year.
In France, which was put back under one the strictest lockdowns in Europe on Oct. 30, consumer confidence fell this month to its lowest level since December 2018, surpassing levels reached in March and April during a first and even harsher lockdown.
France's official stats agency, INSEE, said its consumer confidence index fell four points to 90, worse than the average expectation in a Reuters poll of economists for 92.
Confidence was the lowest since the outbreak of violent street protests against the government during the ""yellow vest"" movement, which forced many shops to board up in central Paris.
Households felt more uncertain about their financial prospects, as concern about future unemployment reached its highest level since mid-2013.
Intentions to make major purchases fell while the number of people who said it was a good time to save kept climbing and sits well above its long-term average, the data showed.
In Germany, consumer morale fell further heading into December as a partial lockdown hit households' income expectations and their willingness to buy, a survey showed.
The GfK institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, dropped to -6.7 in November from a revised -3.2 in the previous month. The reading missed a Reuters forecast for a narrower drop to -5.0.
GfK consumer expert Rolf Buerkl said although retail shops remained open so far, the shutdown of restaurants, bars, hotels and entertainment venues since Nov. 2 clouded consumers' mood. Rising cases of COVID-19 are increasing uncertainty, so Germans are holding onto their money, Buerkl added.
""The hopes for a rapid recovery that arose in early summer have definitely been dashed,"" Buerkl said.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed with leaders of Germany's 16 federal states late on Wednesday to extend and tighten the coronavirus lockdown until Dec. 20, but ease rules over the Christmas holidays to let families and friends celebrate together.
On Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron said France would start gradually easing its lockdown this weekend, though many restrictions will remain.

But some epidemiologists say France may not return to a normal way of life until next autumn, provided that vaccine programmes work.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand recorded its first 1,201 foreign tourists in October since a ban in April aimed at averting coronavirus outbreaks, as the country gradually opens up to a select number of visitors to help its struggling, tourism-reliant economy.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy contracted 6.4% in the third quarter from a year earlier after the second quarter's 12.1% slump as most virus restrictions were eased, but an absence of tourists is limiting the recovery.
The 1,201 foreign visitors in October is a fraction of the 3.07 million arrivals in the same month last year.
Tourism ministry data showed the latest visitors included 471 from China, 231 from neighbouring Cambodia, 178 from Middle East countries and 116 from Europe, all travelling on special 90-day visas that require two weeks of quarantine.
Thailand's entry restrictions have helped keep its coronavirus case tally to less than 4,000. 
It plans to restart talks with China on a travel bubble to boost an economy the government predicts will shrink by 6% this year.
But the country has yet to agree any such arrangements and previous plans were abandoned in August after coronavirus cases in Asia increased.
New outbreaks have seen several other travel bubbles between Asia-Pacific countries aborted or fail to take off, including between New Zealand and Australia, and Hong Kong and Singapore.
In January-October 2020, the number of foreign tourists in Thailand dropped 79.5% to 6.69 million - there were zero tourists recorded in April-September.
The state planning agency has forecast 6.7 million foreign tourists this year after last year's revised record 39.9 million visitors who spent 1.91 trillion baht ($63 billion), or about 11.3% of gross domestic product (GDP).
It predicts only 5 million foreign visitors in 2021.

370,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic recovery stabilized in November, underpinned by solid global demand for exports ahead of the Christmas period and the stock market’s gain to its highest since 2015.
That’s the outlook from the latest aggregate index combining eight early indicators tracked by Bloomberg, which was unchanged from October.
The data indicates China remains well on track to be the only major economy likely to expand this year. With the pandemic under control and consumer spending picking up, authorities are turning their focus to longer-term growth objectives and discussing withdrawing the emergency stimulus injected into the economy earlier this year.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“China’s recovery extended into 4Q, though with a marginal loss of momentum. Investment and exports remained robust. But production growth showed signs of plateauing, and consumption picked up less than expected - even with a boost from a longer-than-usual golden week holiday.”
-- Chang Shu and David Qu, China economists
For the full report, click here.
Housing investment and purchases have rebounded strongly this year after initially falling in the wake of the outbreak of Covid-19 in central China. The value of home sales were flat in the first three weeks of November after rising 8.2% this year through the end of October and helping propel investment and construction.
That recovery is one factor driving metals demand, with the prices of iron ore, copper, and aluminum all hitting multi-year highs. The steady economic growth and good news on vaccines have also boosted stocks, with the main share index closing higher than 5,000 points for the first time in five years this week.
Chinese exports have been one of the driving forces of the economic rebound this year, expanding for the past five months as demand boomed for protective health gear and work-from-home electronics. South Korean exports, which is a leading indicator for Asian and global trade, rose 11% in the first 20 days of November, indicating solid demand for technology products.
Increasing export orders helped smaller companies too, with an index measuring business confidence rising in November.
“Demand remained buoyant, thanks in part to the increase in export orders -- this prompted an acceleration in production activity,” Shen Lan and Ding Shuang, economists at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, which compiles the survey of more than 500 small and medium-sized companies in China, wrote in a note.
“Production and sales are expected to remain resilient for the rest of this year,” although services are still more affected by the lingering effects of the Covid-19 outbreak, they wrote.
Even with the rebound, there seems to be no end in sight for factory deflation. Producer prices fell 1.3% in November, according to Bloomberg’s tracker, an improvement from October’s official reading of a 2.1% drop, but still far away from the inflation needed to boost company profits.
Consumer prices could also turn negative in coming months, which would “weigh on corporate profits -- with potential negative implications for employment and debt repayment capacity,” according to Bloomberg Economics’s David Qu.
Early Indicators
From July, Bloomberg has changed some of the components for the early look at China’s economy, adding home sales in the biggest four cities, weekly car sales and inventories of steel reinforcing, while removing iron-ore prices, sales manager sentiment and property-related stocks.
Bloomberg Economics generates the overall activity reading by aggregating a three-month weighted average of the monthly changes of eight indicators, which are based on business surveys or market prices.

Investing.com - Federal Reserve policymakers mulled a range of options to tweak their bond-buying program, and agreed that while the current pace of purchases was appropriate and an update on guidance was needed ""fairly soon,"" according to the minutes of the central bank's last policy meeting released Wednesday.
At the conclusion of its previous meeting on Nov. 5, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark rate in a range of  0% to 0.25% and pledged to maintain bond purchases at a $120 billion monthly pace.
Fed members debated a range of options on bond purchases to support the recovery, including increasing the pace of purchases or shifting focus to longer duration bonds.      
""Participants generally saw the current pace and composition as effective ... and noted the committee ""could provide more accommodation, if appropriate, by increasing the pace of purchases or by shifting its Treasury purchases to those with a longer maturity without increasing the size of its purchases,"" the minutes showed.
The Fed's bond purchases so far, have lowered longer term borrowing costs for businesses and households, and continue to help steer the economy through the pandemic.  
In recent weeks, the sense of urgency to widen the liquidity spigot has been strengthened after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would allow the central bank's emergency lending programs – rolled out at the height of pandemic in March – to expire at year-end.
""The unilateral decision of Treasury Secretary Mnuchin to allow a slew of Fed emergency lending programs to close to new borrowers on December 31, despite Fed objections, increases the chance that the FOMC will step-up its asset purchases,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note.
The decision from Mnuchin was widely criticized as it comes as a time when another wave of coronavirus cases across the nation has seen parts of the U.S. impose lockdown measures that will slow the recovery.
Most members, however, appear keen to avoid the 'taper tantrum' seen in previous years - when expectations for the central bank to trim its bond purchases triggered a bout volatility in markets - and prefer the Fed to beef up its guidance on bond purchases.
“Many participants judged that the Committee might want to enhance its guidance for asset purchases fairly soon,” the minutes said. ""Most participants judged that the guidance for asset purchases should imply that increases in the Committee's securities holdings would taper and cease sometime before the Committee would begin to raise the target range for the federal funds rate."" 
The lower interest rate environment has allowed the economy to pick up the economic slack, which in turn is expected to ""cause inflation to increase gradually,"" with the fed predicting a moderate 2% overshoot for some time in the years beyond 2023. 
While Fed members agreed the future path of fiscal policy support remained uncertain, hopes for a helping fiscal hand were given a boost on reports that President-elect Joe Biden will nominate former Fed Chair Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary.
During her tenure as Fed Chair, Yellen was viewed as pro-stimulus, and if nominated is widely expected to support fiscal-boosting measures.
Treasury secretaries, however, don’t have direct control over fiscal policy. The former Fed Chair will likely have to contend with a Republican-held Senate that could keep fiscal policy options on a short leash somewhat."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits increased further last week, suggesting that an explosion in new COVID-19 infections and business restrictions were boosting layoffs and undermining the labor market recovery.
Still, the economy got off to a solid start in the fourth quarter, with consumer spending and business investment in equipment topping analysts' expectations in October. Businesses also reported a sharp rebound in profits in the third quarter.
But that is probably insufficient to lift the heavy cloud over the economy. Personal income dropped last month and could decline further with at least 12 million Americans due to lose government-funded unemployment benefits a day after Christmas. 
The benefits, part of a more than $3 trillion government coronavirus relief package which has largely expired, helped contribute to record economic growth in the third quarter. Another package is expected only after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. President Donald Trump is heavily focused on contesting his electoral loss to Biden. 
""There is a two-tier recovery from the pandemic recession where the top of society continues to spend as normal while the bottom-half of the country sits in long lines at food banks with the opportunities for employment few and far between,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 30,000 to a seasonally adjusted 778,000 for the week ended Nov. 21, the Labor Department said. That was the second straight weekly increase in claims and exceeded economists' expectations for 730,000 applications in a Reuters poll.
The weekly claims report, the most timely data on the economy's health, was published a day early because of Thursday's Thanksgiving Day holiday. 
Unadjusted claims jumped 78,372 to 827,710 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted number because of earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations due to the economic shock caused by the pandemic. 
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.14 million people filed claims last week. There were at least 20.5 million people collecting unemployment benefits in early November.
The United States has been slammed by a fresh wave of coronavirus infections, with daily cases exceeding 100,000 since early November. More than 12 million people have been infected in the country, according to a Reuters tally of official data.
The respiratory illness has killed more than 259,000 Americans and hospitalizations are soaring, prompting state and local governments to reimpose a host of restrictions on social and economic life in recent weeks, which could keep claims above their 665,000 peak seen during the 2007-09 Great Recession.
Stocks on Wall Street were mostly lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
EXHAUSTING BENEFITS
Though the claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 299,000 to 6.071 million in the week ending Nov. 14, that was because many have exhausted their eligibility, which is limited to six months in most states. 
A record 4.509 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Nov. 7, up 132,437 from the prior week. These benefits as well as those for gig workers and the self-employed will lapse on Dec. 26. 
That and the ebb in consumer confidence amid the raging pandemic cast doubts on the sustainability of the strong pace of spending. In second report, the Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.5% last month after increasing 1.2% in September. But personal income fell 0.7%, reversing a 0.7% gain in September. Economists had forecast consumer spending rising 0.4%.
""Were it not for recent virus-related developments, it looks like GDP would be on track for a pretty robust fourth quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But given the recent surge in new COVID-19 cases, we think that the data will soften noticeably in November and December."" 
The anticipated slowdown in consumer spending is likely to be blunted somewhat by solid business investment against the backdrop of robust profits, ensuring the economy continues to grow in the fourth quarter, though at a moderate pace. 
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans rose 0.7% in October, the Commerce Department said in a third report.
A fourth report from the department showed after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which corresponds to S&P 500 profits, rebounded at a 36.6% annualized rate in the third quarter after two straight quarterly declines. 
The department also confirmed that the economy grew at a historic 33.1% pace in the July-September quarter. 
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 5% annualized rate. Slower growth was underscored by a fifth report from the Commerce Department showing the goods trade deficit increased 1.2% to $80.3 billion in October. 

Despite encouraging developments on vaccines, spiraling COVID-19 infections and expectations for a smaller stimulus package have prompted economists to sharply downgrade their GDP growth forecasts for the first quarter of 2021.

LONDON (Reuters) - Failure by Britain and the European Union to agree a free trade deal would wipe an extra 2% off the United Kingdom's economic output while driving up inflation, unemployment and public borrowing, official forecasts showed on Wednesday. 
The Office for Budget Responsibility revisited its Brexit forecasts after deciding the prospect of a ""no deal"" exit remained a risk, just over five weeks before Britain fully leaves the world's biggest trading bloc on Dec. 31.
The OBR said the imposition of tariffs under World Trade Organization rules and disruption at borders would hit parts of the economy such as manufacturing that were emerging relatively unscathed from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The independent body had already forecast Brexit would cost Britain 4% of GDP in the long run even if Britain secures a free trade agreement with the EU, compared to it staying in the bloc.
""This (no deal) would further reduce output by 2% initially and 1.5% at the forecast horizon,"" it said.
The initial economic hit would be felt at the start of the following year, and the OBR predicted little of the lost output would be recovered over the next five years.
Unemployment, at 4.8% in the third quarter of 2020, could peak at 8.3% in the third quarter of 2021 if there is no deal -- 0.9 percentage points higher than in its central forecast for that period.
Consumer prices could rise by 1.5% above the OBR's central forecast, and lower tax receipts and higher spending on welfare and other measures could mean borrowing is higher by 10 billion pounds ($13.38 billion) a year on average from 2021-22 onwards, pushing up debt. 

""The imposition of tariffs on EU imports, higher non-tariff barriers, and a drop in the exchange rate all raise consumer prices, leaving them 1.5% higher by the forecast horizon than in our central forecast,"" the OBR said.

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.7% last month. These so-called core capital goods orders surged 1.9% in September.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders increasing 0.5%. Core capital goods orders rose 0.2% year-on-year in October.
Orders last month were supported by demand for electrical equipment, appliances and components, computers and electronic products, primary metals and fabricated metal products. But orders for machinery fell.
Shipments of core capital goods jumped 2.3% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They rose 0.7% in September. 
Business investment on equipment rebounded strongly in the third quarter after five straight quarterly declines. Economists expect slower economic growth after a historic pace of expansion in the third quarter. 
The economy grew at a 33.1% rate in the July-September quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 5% rate. 
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, increased 1.3% in October after racing up 2.1% in September. 

Durable goods orders were lifted by a 1.2% increase in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 3.3% jump in September. Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 3.2%. Orders for civilian aircraft increased 38.8%. There had been no civilian aircraft orders for three straight months.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government cut its view on capital spending in November for the fifth time this year as companies trimmed investment, and said overall economic conditions were still severe due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The world's third-largest economy rebounded sharply in the third quarter from the COVID-19 hit, largely thanks to stronger consumption and exports, but a resurgence in infections at home and abroad is weighing on the outlook.
""The Japanese economy remains in a severe situation due to the novel coronavirus, but it is showing signs of picking up,"" the government said in its November economic report.
The government said the impact from policy measures at home and improvement in activity overseas supported hopes for a continued rebound in the economy.
But it also warned ""full attention"" should be given to further risks from the pandemic, at home and abroad.
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura warned that any increase in coronavirus infections could weigh on consumer sentiment and overseas economies, posing a downside risk to consumption as well as exports and output.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga instructed his cabinet earlier this month to compile a package of stimulus measures to cushion the blow from the pandemic and push forward structural changes in the economy.
""We want to put together measures while carefully watching the (coronavirus) impact, especially on regional economies and everyone working in the tourism sector,"" Nishimura said.
Among key economic elements, the government said business expenditure has been decreasing, slashing its assessment of the component for the sixth time since last upgrading it in September 2018.
Japan has seen relatively low capital spending growth compared to other major countries over the past 15 years, which is a reflection of the expected growth rate of the domestic market, the official said.
Japan needs solid capital spending to offset risks to its export-reliant economy from abroad.
The government upgraded its view on output, saying it was picking up due largely to solid car and transport equipment production.
It left unchanged its assessment of the other remaining components in the report, such as exports and employment conditions.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's balance of payments position with the rest of the world improved in October, figures showed on Wednesday, as a $1.5 billion current account surplus helped narrow the 12-month accumulated deficit to its smallest in two and a half years.
A widening surplus in goods trade, and shrinking deficits in services and primary income again delivered the overall current account surplus, the central bank said, adding that it forecasts a surplus of $1 billion for November.
Revisions to previous months meant that Brazil posted a tiny current account deficit of $10.8 million in June, breaking what would have been a run of seven consecutive surpluses, something not seen since 2006.
October's surplus was more than the $1.3 billion forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, and narrowed the overall deficit in the preceding 12 months to 1% of gross domestic product, the smallest since February 2018.
Goods exports fell 8.6% from the same month last year to $18 billion, the central bank said, while imports fell 26.3% to $13.1 billion, giving a trade surplus of 4.9 billion. So far this year, exports have fallen 7.8% and imports have slumped 15.1%.
The services deficit shrank by 55.2% from a year earlier to $1.6 billion and the primary income deficit shrank by 70.6% to $1.9 billion, the central bank said.
The current account deficit in the first 10 months of the year stood at $7.6 billion.
Foreign direct investment totaled $1.8 billion in October, sharply down from $8.2 billion a year ago, the central bank said, adding that it forecasts FDI of $1 billion in November.
On the portfolio side, Brazil posted an overall net inflow of $5.5 billion into domestic stocks and bonds last month, comprised of $2.8 billion into stocks and $2.7 billion into bonds.

Inflows have returned in recent months, but so far this year a net $21.6 billion has been pulled from domestic markets, the central bank said, and $27.4 billion has been pulled in the last 12 months.

Investing.com -- The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits in the United States rose for a second straight week last week, further exposing the extent of the economy's slowdown as the Covid-19 virus ravages the country again. 
The Labor Department said initial jobless claims rose to 778,000, well in excess of the 730,000 expected by analysts ahead of time. The previous week's number was also revised up by 6,000 to 748,000. Last week had been the first rise in initial claims for over a month. 
Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, fell to a new post-pandemic low of 6.07 million, but this was slightly less than the drop expected.
The figures come at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is running more or less unchecked through much of the U.S., with the number of new infections running at around 170,000 a day over the last week. An average of 1,500 people have died of the disease every day during that time. The number of those hospitalized has leaped to a record 86,000, nearly tripling since the start of October.
The developments have forced the closure of more and more of the country's hospitality sector and other businesses considered non-essential, as state governors try to stop their hospitals from being overwhelmed.
U.S. stock futures were little changed after the news. By 8:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the S&P 500 Futures contract was effectively flat, after hitting a new record high along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday. Markets have increasingly focused on the prospects for a vigorous economic recovery next year in recent days, as three separate pharma companies declared they had an developed effective vaccines against Covid-19.
Additionally, reports that President-elect Joe Biden will nominate Janet Yellen to be his Treasury Secretary have fostered hopes of a big fiscal stimulus package next year - if it can get past a Senate that it still in the hands of the Republican Party.
There was better news from the Commerce Department, which said that durable goods orders had risen 1.3% in October, more than expected. September's rise in orders was also revised higher. However, it left its estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product unchanged at an annualized 33.1%.",,,,,

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Consumer confidence in Brazil fell in November for the second month in a row, a survey showed on Wednesday, reflecting growing concern over the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy, and the looming end of emergency government income transfers.
Government officials have trumpeted the economy's 'V-shaped' rebound from the depths of recession earlier this year and are bullish on next year, which they say could see the economy growing by 4% or even more.
But the Getulio Vargas Foundation's (FGV) consumer confidence index for November suggests consumers are becoming increasingly cautious, with government support due to expire on Dec. 31 and signs the pandemic is creeping back.
The index fell 0.7 points to 81.7 points in November, a second straight decline following a run of five increases from April's record low 58.2, and slipping further back from the pre-pandemic level of 87.8 in February.

""With the probable end of the period of emergency benefits, many consumers who lost their jobs this year are expected to return to the job market at a time when companies will still be postponing hiring or firing, especially in the event of a second wave of COVID-19,"" said FGV survey manager Viviane Seda Bittencourt.
Confidence about conditions fell 0.6 points to 71.8, and future expectations fell 0.9 points to 89.3, FGV said.
The economic expectations sub-index fell 3.8 points to 106.8, the biggest driver of the overall decline in future expectations, FGV said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell more than expected in November amid a widespread resurgence in new COVID-19 infections and business restrictions, reinforcing expectations for a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the fourth quarter.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday followed on the heels of reports this month showing a moderation in job growth and retail sales in October. The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased in mid-November.
The economy is losing speed as more than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief has lapsed. The fiscal stimulus helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and small-to-medium sized companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter.
Another rescue package is expected only after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. President Donald Trump is heavily focused on contesting his electoral loss to Biden. Daily new coronavirus cases in the United States have exceeded 100,000 since early November, according to a Reuters tally. 
The consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 96.1 this month from 101.4 in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to a reading of 98 in November. The index was at 132.6 in February.
The cut-off date for the survey was November 13, before more encouraging news on vaccines for the respiratory illness.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, slipped to a reading of 105.9. from 106.2 in October. The expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions fell to 89.5 from a reading of 98.2 in October.
""Heading into 2021, consumers do not foresee the economy, nor the labor market, gaining strength,"" said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board. ""In addition, the resurgence of COVID-19 is further increasing uncertainty and exacerbating concerns about the outlook.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as the formal go-ahead for Biden's transition to the White House ended weeks of political uncertainty. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, edged up to a reading of 7.2 this month from 7.1 in October. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. It was as high as 38.3 in August last year.
The share of consumers expecting an increase in income was unchanged at 17.6% this month and the proportion anticipating a drop fell to 13.3% from 14.2% last month.
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 5% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 33.1% rate in the July-September quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.
Despite consumer trepidation about the future, the housing market continues to boom. The pandemic has fueled a migration from city centers to suburbs and other lower-density areas as Americans seek more space for home offices and schooling. 

A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index jumped 6.6% from a year ago in September after rising 5.3% in August.

INSEE, the official stats agency, said its monthly business climate index fell to 79 from 92 in October, the lowest reading since June, when France was still emerging from its first lockdown.
French President Emmanuel Macron is due to announce on Tuesday evening a relaxation of the second lockdown following a decline in new case numbers since it was imposed on Oct. 30.
Less stringent than the first lockdown, the latest restrictions have hurt the euro zone's second-biggest economy less, high-frequency data ranging from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) user location history to electricity demand suggest. 
Nonetheless, the dominant service sector has suffered, bearing the brunt of the economic fallout. Already struggling restaurants, hotels and non-essential were forced to shut down for the second time this year.
INSEE's business climate index for services fell to 77 in November from 89 in October, also hitting the lowest level since June.

With factories able to keep operating despite the lockdown, manufacturing fared much better. Its index fell only to 92 from 94 last month, better than economists' average forecast for 91 in a Reuters poll.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global executives see a smaller hit to their investment plans for Europe than they did earlier this year and are somewhat more upbeat about the continent's future appeal, a questionnaire by professional services group EY found.
The survey, conducted in October before a series of COVID-19 vaccine trial breakthroughs, showed that 42% of executives now expect a decrease in their 2020 investment plans and 31% plan to delay them to 2021.
That compared with 66% who expected decreases and 23% who saw delays when asked the same question back in April. This time around, a small number - 10% - even saw an increase to their 2020 investments, something no one did in April.
While that still means a big overall hit to foreign direct investment after 2019's record year, EY noted that 21% of those surveyed believed Europe would be more attractive for investment post-Covid compared to just 8% in April.
""It is promising that investors believe that over the next three years, Europe will become a much more attractive destination for investments than before pandemic,"" EY Area Managing Partner Julie Teigland said.
The findings were based on interviews with 109 global executives across 14 industries in October. 
Upbeat news from vaccine trials are starting to support economic sentiment. The monthly eurozone Purchase Managers Index (PMI) for November saw a rise in its ""future output"" component in November to its highest level since February.

Among the other takeaways from the EY survey, 63% expected faster roll-out of digital customer access to surveys in the next three years (versus 55% in April) but only 37% now saw a reversal of globalisation (versus 56%).

382,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - U.S. business activity expanded at the fastest rate in more than five years in November led by the quickest pickup in manufacturing since September 2014, a survey showed on Monday in an indication the economy keeps making progress at clambering out of the COVID-19 recession even as infections surge.
IHS Markit's manufacturing and services sector purchasing managers' indexes both topped even the most optimistic forecasts in a Reuters poll that predicted both would level off, offering a counterweight to data suggesting economic momentum was slackening after the third-quarter's torrid rebound from an historic plunge last spring.
The readings also offered one of the first pictures of the state of the U.S. economy after a presidential election three weeks ago in which Democrat Joe Biden beat incumbent Republican President Donald Trump.
""The upturn reflected a further strengthening of demand, which in turn encouraged firms to take on staff at a rate not previously seen since the survey began in 2009,"" IHS Markit Chief Business Economist Chris Williamson said in a statement.
Markit's manufacturing index climbed to 56.7 from 53.4 in October, above the median forecast in a Reuters economists' poll of 53. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
The services index, meanwhile, rose to 57.7 - the highest since April 2015 - from 56.9 a month earlier. The Reuters poll had pegged the expectation at 55.0.
Markit's composite index - a blend of the manufacturing and services readings - increased to 57.9 from 56.3 in October. It was also the highest since April 2015.
Markit said its subindex for employment also rose at a record pace as well, potentially welcome news in a U.S. job market that still features more than 10 million people without work who had been employed before the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in the first quarter.
With the election now over and subsequent news of successful COVID-19 vaccine candidates, Markit said survey respondents were the most optimistic about the year ahead since May 2014.
Nonetheless, Markit's survey results about current activity are at odds with a number of other recent readings on the U.S. economy that are far less favorable as a result of a resurgence in COVID-19 that has lead to record after record of new daily infections and rising deaths.
Last week, October retail sales reported from the Commerce Department showed the weakest increase in six months, while the Labor Department reported the first weekly increase in new claims for unemployment benefits in a month.
Meanwhile, a clutch of high-frequency indicators tracked by economists for a real-time reading on activity showed further signs of flattening out.

It is clear the U.S. economy in the fourth quarter will come nowhere close to matching 33.1% annualized growth rate in gross domestic product posted in the July to September period, but just how much it has slowed remains less certain. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's ""GDPNow"" model currently estimates activity in the current quarter expanding at a 5.6% annualized rate.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity contracted sharply this month as renewed lockdowns forced many firms in the bloc's dominant service industry to close temporarily, although news of possible vaccines boosted hopes for 2021, surveys showed on Monday.
The bloc's economy is on track for its first double-dip recession in nearly a decade as a second wave of the coronavirus sweeps across Europe, a Reuters poll suggested last week. But on Monday, Britain's AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) said its vaccine could be around 90% effective without any serious side effects. 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) have also developed apparently effective vaccines and Monday's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed optimism about the year ahead improving to its highest since before the pandemic hit the continent. 
Still, IHS Markit's headline flash composite PMI, seen as a good guide to economic health, fell to 45.1 in November from October's 50.0 - the level separating growth from contraction. A Reuters poll had predicted a shallower dip to 46.1.
""The drop in the composite PMI to well below 50 adds to the evidence that the euro zone economy will post another sizeable contraction in Q4,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics. 
""But with vaccines looking increasingly likely to be rolled out in the first half of next year, the surveys show greater optimism about 2021.""
Vaccine hopes, and expectations of more stimulus from the European Central Bank next month, meant optimism improved. The composite future output index jumped to 60.1 from 56.5, its highest since February.
Shares and oil prices rose on Monday while the dollar softened. 
FACTORIES TO THE RESCUE
Services activity in Germany, Europe's largest economy, contracted faster this month after lockdown measures were introduced while in France the economy shrank at the fastest pace since May, sister surveys showed.
In Britain, which is outside the euro zone and European Union and has suffered the highest COVID-19 death toll in Europe, a new wave of coronavirus restrictions hammered the huge services sector. 
A PMI covering the euro zone's service industry fell to 41.3 from 46.9, its weakest reading since the height of the first wave of the pandemic and well below the 42.5 predicted in a Reuters poll.
With demand drying up despite price cuts and backlogs of work being run down, firms reduced headcount for a ninth month in succession. The services employment index fell to 48.1 from 48.5.
However, manufacturing has fared better as many factories have remained open. Its flash PMI held well above the breakeven mark at 53.6 in November, albeit below October's 54.8. The Reuters poll had predicted 53.1.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, fell to 55.5 from 58.4. Demand also eased - the new orders index sank to 54.0 from 58.7 - indicating that the downward trend may continue.
""The good news is that the fall was cushioned by a strong manufacturing sector. Buoyed by Germany, the manufacturing PMI merely indicated a slowing of output growth, but not contraction,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.

""Still, as the second part of the W-shape has just started, a long and uncertain road to recovery remains ahead.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British business activity has contracted in November as a new wave of coronavirus restrictions hammered the huge services industry, but news of possible vaccines has sharply boosted hopes for 2021, a survey showed on Monday.
An early ""flash"" reading of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a gauge of private sector growth, tumbled to a five-month low of 47.4 in November from 52.1 in October.
It is the first time the index has gone below the 50.0 growth threshold level since June.
The decline was smaller than a slump to 42.5 forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, however, and less severe than the drop in the euro zone.
The forward-looking component of the PMI hit its highest in more than five years, boosted by progress on COVID-19 vaccines.
Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said on Monday he hoped the economy would be ""turning a leaf"" next year, but warned that some long-term damage was inevitable. 
Britain's economy is widely expected to contract in the fourth quarter - albeit by less than it did around the time of the first coronavirus lockdown - after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a four-week lockdown for England.
Other parts of the United Kingdom have also imposed restrictions on businesses, including in hospitality and other face-to-face activities.
Those closures helped to push the services PMI to 45.8 from 51.4 in October.
But manufacturing, which was largely unaffected by the latest lockdown, accelerated, with its PMI rising to 55.2, the joint-highest level since 2018.
""The two-speed nature of the recovery is increasingly clear,"" J.P. Morgan Asset Management strategist Hugh Gimber said. ""The manufacturing sector continues to tick along at a healthy pace, while new lockdowns have slammed the brakes on the nascent recovery in the service sector.""
The approach of a possible trade shock at the end of next month, when Britain's post-Brexit transition deal with the European Union will expire, prompted clients of British factories to increase their orders to build up stocks.
That in turn lead to a sharp lengthening of supplier delivery times because of severe delays at British ports.
Job losses across the private sector accelerated, although some of the reduction in employment was due to companies taking advantage of the government's extended jobs protection scheme.

Separate figures on Monday showed the number of people visiting shops in Britain last week was 55% lower than a year earlier.

IHS Markit's flash services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 46.2 from 49.5 in October, sliding further below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and marking a second straight month of decline. A Reuters poll had predicted a drop to 46.3.
The survey also showed that activity in the manufacturing sector continued to grow, albeit at a slightly slower pace, offering support to an economy otherwise forecast to post its deepest recession this year since World War Two.
Activity in the factory sector eased to a still-healthy 57.9 from 58.2 in October, beating a forecast for a drop to 56.5.
""The resilience being exhibited by the manufacturing sector, which the survey shows is benefiting for growing sales to Asia in particular, supports our view that any downturn in the final quarter is expected to be far shallower than those seen in the first half of the year,"" said IHS Markit's Associate Director Phil Smith.
""The positive news surrounding the development of COVID vaccines has helped lift the spirits among German businesses, many of which are now hoping for a return to normality over the next 12 months,"" he added.

The amount of new space under construction plunged to 2.6 million square feet, taking volumes back to their historical averages after a pre-pandemic boom, Deloitte Real Estate's London Office Crane Survey showed.
The survey also showed a higher-than-average 40% of new construction was pre-let, signalling less speculative building.
At least six speculative schemes were put entirely on hold pending more clarity, with many more postponed until 2021, Deloitte said. 
Developers reported that weak tenant demand was the major obstacle to starting any new project after the pandemic forced many people to work from home, leaving parts of the capital almost deserted. 
The shift to working from home has prompted many companies to consider a longer-term, more flexible approach to office attendance, prompting questions over future demand for tower blocks in the capital.

PARIS (Reuters) - Lockdowns in France and Italy are weighing down public mobility more than in other European countries, according to high- frequency data compiled by Reuters that suggest the two economies will take a correspondingly bigger hit.
Data ranging from use of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) maps apps to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s user location history are proving vital tools for governments, central bankers and investors trying to gauge the economic impact of restrictions, weeks in advance of conventional indicators like consumer spending or industrial output.
The French official stats agency INSEE has found that the data Google can collect on how much time people spend at home is particularly closely correlated with how much an economy has slowed during the crisis.
And while the impact is nowhere near as pronounced as during the first set of more draconian lockdowns this year, that data suggest that people in France, Italy and Britain are currently seeing the biggest increases in the time spent at home.
Paris and Milan have also seen the sharpest reductions in traffic congestion, and Italy the steepest decline in public transport usage, ahead of the Netherlands, UK and France.

Germany's ""lockdown lite"" imposed on Nov. 2 has left indicators of activity holding up much better than in countries that have gone for tougher measures, such as closing all but essential shops and services.
Spain was among the hardest hit in the first wave, but its activity also appears be resisting better after it imposed a six-month state of emergency at the end of October, giving its regions legal backing to implement curfews and restrict travel.
Graphic: Changes in traffic congestion in European capitals - https://graphics.reuters.com/EUROPE-ECONOMY/nmopadyglva/chart.png
Overall, countries are seeing less of a blow to activity than in the first wave of lockdowns after governments calibrated restrictions this time to limit the economic fallout. For comparison, mobility is around the same levels as seen in May.
In a case in point, France has seen a sharp fall in activity since the government was one of the first in Europe to put the country back under a full lockdown on Oct. 30.
However, the drop is not as dire as in March and April with the new French lockdown allowing considerably more flexibility for companies and schools left open.
Graphic: Apple mobility trends in public transport - https://graphics.reuters.com/EUROPE-ECONOMY/jznpnnjolpl/chart.png
Other real-time indicators like electricity consumption also show little impact from the new wave of restrictions across Europe, although colder weather is also fuelling demand heading into the winter.
Meanwhile, governments have largely spared their industrial sectors under the new restrictions, as the service sector bears the brunt of the fallout.
The German official stats agency's truck toll mileage index https://www.destatis.de/EN/Service/EXDAT/Datensaetze/truck-toll-mileage.html, which it says is a bellwether for industrial production in Europe's biggest economy, is currently running at levels on par with those seen before the coronavirus crisis broke out.
While overall economic activity has cooled once again heading into the year end, some traditional indicators of economic health such as unemployment and bankruptcy filings are still not flashing red.

But that is likely to be because of government support measures like subsidised furlough schemes and state-guaranteed bank loans to companies are keeping consumers and businesses afloat - at least for now.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain borrowed a record 215 billion pounds ($285 billion) in the first seven months of the financial year, highlighting the challenge facing finance minister Rishi Sunak as he prepares new spending plans.
Borrowing in October alone came in below all economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll at 22.3 billion pounds, and September's borrowing was also revised sharply lower.
But debt remained only slightly lower than a 60-year high as a share of the economy.
Separate official data published on Friday showed retail sales rose 1.2% in October, and were 5.8% higher than a year earlier, stronger than all poll forecasts. 
However, retailers face a grim November with many shops closed due to the latest restrictions to slow the coronavirus pandemic which has hit Britain harder than other big economies.
The British government is on course to borrow close to 400 billion pounds this financial year, the highest borrowing relative to the size of the economy since World War Two.
""This is the responsible thing to do, but it’s also clear that over time it’s right we ensure the public finances are put on a sustainable path,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
The government's Office for Budget Responsibility will publish new forecasts of borrowing on Nov. 25, and Sunak will unveil spending plans for the next financial year too. 
The government has already said it will approve the biggest increase in military spending since the Cold War. 
But newspapers reported Sunak would freeze the pay of teachers and police, and the government has refused to confirm it will keep foreign aid spending at 0.7% of GDP.
Public debt has surged and stood at 2.077 trillion pounds or 100.8% of annual economic output in October, the Office for National Statistics said.
Stronger growth in the economy in the third quarter meant that as a share of GDP, debt was down slightly from September's peak of 101.2%, the highest level since 1960/61.
The ONS trimmed its estimate for April-September borrowing by 15.9 billion pounds after lower-than-expected spending on the government's flagship job protection scheme and higher-than-expected value added tax receipts.
Britain, for now at least, can borrow cheaply to fund its spending surge, much of which is likely to end once the pandemic passes.
But the Bank of England has warned that some long-term economic damage or scarring is likely.
Last month the International Monetary Fund said Britain would probably need to raise taxes after the pandemic to fill the gap.
EARLY CHRISTMAS SHOPPING
Friday's data show unexpected strength in the retail sector in October, before a four-week COVID lockdown took effect in England this month.
""Feedback from a range of businesses suggesting that consumers had started Christmas shopping earlier this year, further helped by early discounting from a range of stores,"" the ONS said.
Retailers have bounced back strongly from the lockdown, with sales volumes 6.7% higher than before the pandemic. 
Shifts in consumer spending have helped specialist stores such as bicycle and car part chain Halfords (L:HFD).
But much of the gain has been from online sales, and some sectors such as high-street clothes stores are struggling.

Fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger fell into administration on Thursday, putting 4,716 jobs at risk.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits rose last week, likely as new business restrictions to control spiraling COVID-19 infections unleashed a fresh wave of layoffs, which could further slow the labor market recovery.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed at least 20.3 million people on unemployment benefits at the end of October, threatening the recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression.
About 12 million people will lose benefits next month when two government-funded programs expire a day after Christmas. Another rescue package for businesses and the unemployed is unlikely before then. President Donald Trump is heavily focused on disputing his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden, who will inherit the public health crisis and a frail economy when he takes office in January.
""You don't have to warn the jobless that momentum is fading and the risks are high, they are living it every day without a paycheck and with employment opportunities in increasingly short supply,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
""The blame falls squarely on Washington where there is no attempt to fight the virus in a coordinated manner or to fight the recession by renewing and extending the unemployment benefits to the millions of jobless workers in the country."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 31,000 to a seasonally adjusted 742,000 for the week ended Nov. 14. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 707,000 applications for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims rose 18,344 to 743,460 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted number because of earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations due to the economic shock caused by the pandemic. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.1 million people filed claims last week.
Claims have remained above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession for 35 straight weeks. 
Daily new COVID-19 cases in the United States have been exceeding 100,000 since early November, pushing the number of infections in the country above 11 million, according to a Reuters tally. Forty-one states have reported daily record increases in coronavirus infections. The nation's death toll has surpassed 250,000.
Many jurisdictions have imposed restrictions on businesses to try to contain the spread of the virus.
""With more localized restrictions and signs of households hunkering down the past couple of weeks, we expect initial filings to stay elevated,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The ebbing economic momentum was underscored by a survey from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve on Thursday showing manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowing in November as orders moderated. Though factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware hired more workers and increased hours, manufacturers were less upbeat about business conditions and capital expenditure programs over the next six months. 
But the housing market continues to shine. Existing home sales increased 4.3% to a rate of 6.85 million units in October, the highest level since November 2005, the National Association of Realtors said in a third report. 
U.S. stocks were mixed. The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
RECOVERY SLOWING
Unemployment claims dropped from a record 6.867 million in March as about 80% of the people temporarily laid off in March and April were rehired, accounting for most of the rebound in job growth over the last six months.
The latest wave of coronavirus infections and restrictions will weigh heavily on bars and restaurants as well as other businesses in the services sector that attract crowds.
It coincides with the end of more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief, which helped to preserve jobs. 
The government-funded program for people who do not qualify for state benefits and another for those who have exhausted their six months of eligibility will lapse in December, creating what economists have called an income cliff.
""The loss of benefits would lead to a big hit in household incomes and spending, putting the recovery at risk,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The claims data covered the period that the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm payrolls portion of November's employment report. Claims have become an unreliable gauge of job growth because of filing problems. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 638,000 jobs in October, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May. Only 12.1 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered. 
Though the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 429,000 to 6.372 million in the week ending Nov. 7, that was because many have exhausted their eligibility, which is limited to six months in most states.

A record 4.377 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Oct. 31, up 233,458 from the prior week.

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that existing home sales increased 4.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.85 million units last month. Data for September was revised up to a rate of 6.57 million units from the previously reported 6.54 million units. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would fall 1.2% to a rate of 6.45 million units in October.
Existing home sales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, jumped 26.6% on a year-on-year basis in October. Sales increased in all four regions last month and continued to be concentrated in the upper price end of the market.
The housing market is being driven by record low mortgage rates. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen at least 21% of the labor force working from home, has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out spacious accommodation for home offices and schools.
The coronavirus recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners. At least 20 million people are on unemployment benefits. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.84%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
Housing supply has failed to keep up with demand, pushing home prices out of the reach of many first-time buyers, despite builders ramping up construction. The government reported on Wednesday that single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, raced to the highest level since April 2007.
There were 1.42 million previously owned homes on the market in October, down 19.8% from a year ago. The median existing house price surged 15.5% from a year ago to a record $313,000 in October.

At October's sales pace, it would take 2.5 months to exhaust the current inventory, an all-time low. That was down from 2.7 months in September and 3.9 months in October 2019. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

Investing.com -- The number of Americans filing initial claims for state jobless benefits last week unexpectedly rose to 742,000, as concerns mounted that soaring COVID-19 cases will further stifle the recovery in the labor market.
Economists had expected a drop to 707,000. The prior week's figure was revised up to 711,000, according to the Labor Department report. The increase was the first in six weeks. The increase in claims was largest in California and Washington, while Illinois, Kentucky and Georgia all posted falls.
The number of continuing claims fell to 6.372 million, a little lower than forecast.
The number of people hospitalized with the virus rose to a new record high of over 79,000 on Wednesday, while the death count hit its highest since early May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in October as the housing market continues to be driven by record low mortgage rates, but momentum could slow amid a resurgence in new COVID-19 infections that is putting strain on the economic recovery.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also showed building permits unchanged at a 13-1/2-year high. It followed on the heels of data on Tuesday showing the smallest gain in retail sales in October since the recovery from the pandemic started in May. The economy is slowing as more than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief dries up.
Daily new COVID-19 cases have been exceeding 100,000 since early this month, pushing the number of infections in the United States above 11 million, according to a Reuters tally. Several states and local governments have imposed restrictions on businesses, raising fears that the resulting weak demand could unleash a fresh wave of layoffs that could reverberate across the economy and slow the housing market's run. 
""The million dollar question remains how long the recovery in housing can continue as the shocking number of new coronavirus cases is paralyzing commerce in many parts of the country and leading to new restrictions and lockdowns,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Housing starts rose 4.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.530 million units last month. That lifted homebuilding closer to its pace of 1.567 million units in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would rise to a rate of 1.460 million units in October.
Permits for future homebuilding were unchanged at a rate of 1.545 million units in October, the highest since March 2007. 
The densely populated South region accounted for 56.1% of homebuilding last month. Groundbreaking activity also rose in the West and Midwest, but tumbled in the Northeast. 
Homebuilding surged 14.2% on a year-on-year basis.
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, raced 6.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.179 million units last month, the highest level since April 2007.
Single-family starts have increased for six straight months. This segment of the market is being boosted by the pandemic, which has seen at least 21% of the labor force working from home. That has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out spacious accommodation for home offices and schools.
""The South and inland and mountain regions of the West are seeing a huge influx of residents from the large metro areas in the Northeast and West Coast,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Just over 80% of all single-family homes built over the past year have been in the South or West, which means that construction can continue at a much higher pace during the winter months than in prior years.""
A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders rose to an all-time high in November. But builders said ""lot and material availability is holding back some building activity."" 
Single-family building permits climbed 0.6% to a rate of 1.120 million units in October. 
A separate report on Wednesday from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to buy a home increased 4% last week from a week earlier. 
The coronavirus recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners. At least 20 million people are on unemployment benefits.
The PHLX housing index was trading higher, outperforming a mixed U.S. stock market. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries were trading higher.
BIGGER FOOTPRINT
Though the housing market accounts for a fraction of gross domestic product, it has a bigger economic footprint. Its continued strength should help to keep the economy afloat even as GDP growth is expected to decelerate significantly in the fourth quarter after a historic performance in the July-September period.
Homebuilding is being driven by lean inventories, especially for previously-owned homes, and low mortgage rates. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.84%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
Starts for the volatile multi-family segment were unchanged at a pace of 351,000 units. Building permits for multi-family housing projects fell 1.6% to a rate of 425,000 units. It was the third straight monthly decline.
""This is an indication that developers are reining in investment as rental vacancy rates have risen,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York.
According to Wells Fargo Securities' Vitner, rental data also suggest a shift in renter preferences away from urban lifestyle apartments to suburban apartments that offer more outdoor amenities. 

Housing completions fell 4.5% to a rate of 1.343 million units last month. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap. The stock of housing under construction increased 1.2% to a rate of 1.224 million units, the highest since December 2006.

Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro was plus 0.2% month-on-month in October for a 0.3% year-on-year fall, the same annual decline as in September and in line with the initial estimates released at the start of November.
Food, alcohol and tobacco added 0.38 percentage points to the final results, Eurostat said, and services another 0.19 points, but an 8.2% year-on-year plunge in energy prices subtracted 0.81 percentage points from the final number.

Consumer prices rose 0.7% in annual terms, after a 0.5% rise in September, the Office for National Statistics said. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 0.6%.
Unlike last year, food prices rose in October and people stocked up on potatoes and fruit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased less than expected in October and could slow further, restrained by spiraling new COVID-19 infections and declining household income as millions of unemployed Americans lose government financial support.
While other data on Tuesday showed production at factories accelerating last month, output remained well below its pre-pandemic level and the uncontrolled coronavirus outbreak could disrupt production. The public health crisis and frail economy are major challenges confronting President-elect Joe Biden when he takes over from President Donald Trump in January.
Biden on Monday urged a divided Congress to come together and pass another pandemic relief package.
That is unlikely to happen before he is sworn in on Jan. 20, putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to pump more money into the economy, which plunged into recession in February. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that the recovery was slowing, adding the economy would continue to need support from both fiscal and monetary policy.
""It looks like consumer spending is increasingly turning into a headwind for this recovery from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Fed officials are saying they might have to do more and today's data may turn that thinking into a reality."" 
Retail sales rose 0.3% last month, the smallest gain since the recovery started in May, after increasing 1.6% in September, the Commerce Department said. They account for the goods component of consumer spending, with services such as healthcare and hotel accommodation making up the other portion.
Sales were supported by Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) ""Prime Day"" event, with online receipts surging 3.1%. ""Prime Day"" is normally in July and some economists said this could have thrown off the model that the government uses to strip seasonal fluctuations from the data, leading to the modest sales gain.
Consumers bought motor vehicles at a much slower pace than in previous months. There were increases in sales of electronics and appliances, as well as building materials and garden equipment. But households cut back spending on sporting goods and hobbies, clothing, furniture, drinking and dining out.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would gain 0.5% in October. Retail sales rose 5.7% on a year-on-year basis in October and are above their February level, with the pandemic shifting demand away from services to goods.
Stocks on Wall Street were mostly lower. The dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
Daily new coronavirus cases have been exceeding 100,000 since early this month, pushing the number of infections in the United States above 11 million, according to a Reuters tally.
While there have been encouraging developments on experimental vaccines, health experts warn that rolling out the vaccines would be challenging. 
Some state and local governments have imposed new restrictions on businesses. 
Restrictions and consumer avoidance of crowded places like bars and restaurants could undercut spending and trigger another wave of layoffs, further squeezing incomes following the loss of a government weekly unemployment subsidy. 
PROGRAMS LAPSING 
The supplement, which was part of more than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief, has lapsed for millions of unemployed and underemployed workers. 
Millions more will lose benefits next month when government-funded programs for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for regular state unemployment and those who have exhausted their six months of eligibility expire. 
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales gained 0.1% after a downwardly revised 0.9% increase in September. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have risen 1.4% in September.
Economists expect moderate retail sales growth for the rest of the year, which would contribute to slower economic growth after a historic rebound in gross domestic product in the third quarter. A JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) survey of credit and debit cardholders showed a broad decline in spending through Nov. 9, with big drops in states where COVID-19 is spreading most rapidly.
Consumer sentiment ebbed in early November amid worries about finances. 
A separate report from the Fed on Tuesday showed manufacturing output increased 1.0% last month after rising 0.1% in September. Production remains about 5% below its pre-pandemic level. Output was boosted by production of aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment, offsetting decreases in furniture, fabricated metal products, motor vehicles and parts. 
""Manufacturing can only hold up if households keep buying and they need income to do that,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
Mining output fell 0.6% as oil and gas extraction declined. Weakness in oil and gas extraction is likely to continue depressing business spending on nonresidential structures, buttressing forecasts for moderate growth in the fourth quarter.

Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 5% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 33.1% rate in the July-September quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland enacted new COVID-19 health restrictions last month and England began a one-month lockdown on Nov. 5 to curb a second wave of the pandemic that has left the United Kingdom with Europe's highest death toll.
In England, all non-essential shops had to close, along with pubs, cafes and restaurants except to offer takeaway food. People have also been encouraged to work from home if possible.
Springboard said shopper numbers, or footfall, was 64.7% lower year-on-year in UK high streets and 65.7% lower in shopping centres but down 34.3% in retail parks.
It noted that footfall was more resilient than it was in the first complete week of England's first lockdown in March when it plunged by 75.1% across all UK retail destinations.
""The fact that footfall is more resilient may well be a function of the proximity of Christmas, and the concern of shoppers to buy well in advance this year to avoid queues, facilitated by the wide range of non-food products offered in stores selling essential goods,"" said Springboard director Diane Wehrle.

Investing.com – China continued its path towards economic recovery in October, with a faster-than-expected rise in industrial production and investment alongside a steadier uptick in consumer spending.
Data from China’s National Statistics Bureau (NSB) showed that industrial production rose 6.9% year-on-year in October, above the 6.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but unchanged from September’s reading.
Meanwhiles retail sales grew 4.3% year-on-year in October, down from the forecast 4.9% but up from September’s growth of 3.3%. The unemployment rate fell to 5.3% from September’s 5.4%.
The data indicated a continuous recovery from the COVID-19-inspired lockdowns earlier in the year, helped along by resilient exports. With the virus largely under control in the country, consumer spending is slowly starting to increase.
China’s fourth-quarter economic growth will continue to accelerate from the third quarter, Fu Linghui, spokesman of the National Statistics Bureau, predicted at a briefing after the data was released. He aded that consumption prospects are improving, with the services industry showing good recovery momentum.
Although the recovery in consumer spending was slower than in industrial production, it is catching up after receiving a boost from October’s golden week holiday and the various Singles’ Day event that took place during the previous week. However, data revealed that retails sales are still down 5.9% compared to the same period in 2019.
Macquarie Bank Ltd head of China economics Larry Hu expects growth to pick up to 5.5% in the fourth quarter from 4.9% in the previous three months.
“The strong part of the economy (industry, investment and exports) remains strong but is also around the peak,” he said. “The weak part (consumption and capital expenditure) is catching up,” Hu told Bloomberg.
Stimulus policies from the government, including the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) injecting more liquidity into the financial system earlier in the day, are also helping to maintain the economic recovery.
Although PBOC officials recently raised the possibility of withdrawing stimulus, they also added that any withdrawal should not be rushed.
“China continues to move closer to its potential growth … as the growth outlook remains positive, the authorities will prioritize reforms over stimulus,” Australia and New Zealand Banking Group chief economist for Greater China Raymond Yeung told Bloomberg.
Surging COVID-19 cases globally, particularly in Europe and the U.S., alongside rising U.S.-China tensions, are clouding exports’ outlook.
Meanwhile, former Chinese finance minister Lou Jiwei said during the previous week that trade frictions between the United States and China may not ease in the near-term, even under a Joe Biden presidency.
Elsewhere in Asia, Japan also recorded a third quarter GDP growth of 21.4% year-on-year, and 5% quarter-on-quarter."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's economy shrank more slowly in the third quarter, with the contraction limited to 6.4% thanks to a recovery in domestic activity after coronavirus restrictions were eased but an ongoing travel ban has kept most foreign tourists away.
The data released on Monday by the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDB) showed a marked improvement from the June quarter, when the economy suffered a 12.1% decline, the sharpest fall in over two decades.
On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded a seasonally adjusted 6.5% in the September quarter, the fastest pace in more than eight years, after a record contraction of 9.9% in the prior quarter.
Economists in a Reuters poll had forecast the economy would shrink 8.6% year-on-year and grow 3.8% quarter-on-quarter.
As a result, the government raised its 2020 outlook for a contraction of 6.0% from a previous forecast 7.3%-7.8% decline. It now expects exports to fall 7.5% this year, rather than drop 10%.
The upgrade came in amid a slump in tourism, tepid global demand, a strong baht  and months of domestic political protests.
""The Q3 data was quite a surprise but the economic picture has not changed and we expect a decline until the first quarter,"" said Thammarat Kittisiripat, economist of Tisco group.
While Thailand has removed most restrictions as local infections slow, its economy continues to suffer from soft global demand and the absence of foreign tourists. It started last month to let some foreign visitors return.
""A rising trend in the number of COVID-19 cases globally during the Northern Hemisphere winter will subdue the economy for the next two quarters,"" said Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital markets research of Kasikornbank.
On Monday, the NESDC said it expected 6.7 million foreign tourists to come to Thailand this year - between April and early October there were none - after last year's record 39.8 million with their spending accounting for 11.4% of GDP.
It predicts only 5 million foreign visitors in 2021.
The government has supported the economy with a 1.9 trillion baht ($63 billion) stimulus package, while the central bank has slashed interest rates by 75 basis points this year to a record low of 0.50%.
The main stock index (SETI) rose 1.37% at 0340 GMT while the baht  was little changed at 30.14 per dollar.

The upbeat figures came as other Asian powerhouses also climbed out from their pandemic depths with Japan's economy reporting its fastest quarterly growth on record.
China's industrial sector has staged an impressive turnaround from the pandemic paralysis seen earlier this year, helped by resilient exports. Now, with the coronavirus largely under control in China, consumers are opening up their wallets again in a further boost to activity.
""The latest data suggest that the broad-based acceleration of China’s economy continued in October,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics said in a note. 
""Policy stimulus continued to boost investment and industrial output while growth in real retail sales and services activity returned to pre-virus levels.""
Across China, smelters and refineries ramped up production in October with aluminium and crude oil hitting record output levels as the reopened economy stoked demand.
Growth is expected to accelerate in the fourth quarter as the service sector recovery maintains momentum, Fu Linghui, spokesman of the National Statistics Bureau said, told reporters at a briefing.
In the consumer sector, retail sales rose 4.3% on-year, missing forecasts for 4.9% growth but still the fastest growth this year.
The improved appetite for spending was seen with China's auto sales growing 12.5% in October, thanks to surging demand for electric vehicles.
Domestic tourism also saw a strong rebound over the Golden Week holiday last month, although levels were still well short of last year's.
Fixed-asset investment rose 1.8% in January-October from the same period last year, compared with the 1.6% growth forecast and a 0.8% increase in the first nine months of the year.
NOT READY TO TIGHTEN POLICY
China's consistent run of improving data since the second quarter and recent comments from officials have prompted speculation the central bank may start to tighten policy. 
But analysts say policymakers are unlikely to rush winding down existing stimulus amid persistent uncertainties about the pandemic and global demand. 
""Domestic demand remains relatively weak, and any move to tighten policy could hurt the economic recovery,"" said Nie Wen, economist at Shanghai-based Hwabao Trust.
The government has rolled out a raft of measures including more fiscal spending, tax relief and cuts in lending rates and banks' reserve requirements to revive the economy.
Property investment was a key driver of broader spending with October real estate investment up 12.7% from a year ago, the fastest pace since July 2018 and quickening from 12% seen in September, according to Reuters calculations based on NBS data.
Property sales by floor area rose a solid 15.3%, the highest in over three years, while new construction starts expanded 3.5%, improving from last month's fall of 1.9%.
However, government efforts to prevent bubbles in the property sector are gaining traction with Chinese new home prices growing at a slower monthly pace in October amid restrictions imposed in some big cities. 
Private sector fixed-asset investment, which accounts for 60% of total investment, fell 0.7% in January-October, compared with a 1.5% decline in the first nine months of the year.
While China's economic recovery looks to be accelerating, surging coronavirus infections in Europe and the United States have clouded the outlook for exports.
Former Chinese finance minister Lou Jiwei said last week Sino-U.S. trade frictions may not ease in the near-term, even under a Joe Biden presidency.
Analysts believe a Biden administration is likely to maintain a tough political stance on Beijing, keep tight restrictions on China's access to advanced technology, although it could act in a less aggressive and more predictable way than the Trump administration.

China's economy grew 4.9% in the third-quarter from a year earlier, but annual growth could slow to just over 2% for 2020. That would be the weakest in over three decades but still much stronger than other major economies.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew at the fastest pace on record in the third quarter, rebounding sharply from its biggest postwar slump, as improved exports and consumption helped the country emerge from the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
However, analysts painted the sharp bounceback as a one-off from the depths of recession, and cautioned that any further rebound in the economy will be moderate as a resurgence in infections at home and abroad clouds the outlook.
The world's third-largest economy expanded an annualised 21.4% in July-September, beating a median market forecast for an 18.9% gain and marking the first increase in four quarters, government data showed on Monday.
It was the biggest increase since comparable data became available in 1980 and followed a 28.8% plunge in the second quarter, when consumption took a hit from lock-down measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
""The strong growth in July-September was likely a one-off rebound from an extraordinary contraction caused by the lock-down steps,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""The economy may not fall off a cliff. But given uncertainty over the outlook, I would err on the side of caution in terms of the pace of any recovery,"" he said.
The rebound was driven largely by a record 4.7% surge in private consumption, as households boosted spending on cars, leisure and restaurants, a government official told a briefing.
External demand also added 2.9 percentage points to gross domestic product (GDP) growth thanks to a rebound in overseas demand that pushed up exports by 7.0%, the data showed.
But capital expenditure fell 3.4%, shrinking for a second straight quarter in a worrying sign for policymakers hoping to revitalise the economy with private-sector spending.
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said the economy still had over 30 trillion yen ($287 billion) of negative output gap, or spare capacity, part of which must be filled by a new stimulus package now in the works.
""We can't make up for all of the output gap just with public works spending. We also need to spur private investment. But the size (of the output gap) is something we'll look at"" in compiling the new spending package, he told a news conference.
A negative output gap occurs when actual output is less than the economy's full capacity and is see as a sign of weak demand.
Without additional stimulus, Japan may experience a fiscal cliff next year as the effect of two big packages deployed earlier this year - worth a combined $2.2 trillion - peter out.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has instructed his cabinet to come up with another package, which analysts say could be sized anywhere between 10-30 trillion yen.
""Nishimura's remark on the 30-trillion-yen output gap suggests the size of the new package would come by as much,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
The Bank of Japan is also expected to extend its corporate funding programme beyond its March deadline, with a decision expected next month or January, analysts say.
Despite some signs of improvement in recent months, analysts expect the world's third-largest economy to shrink 5.6% in the current fiscal year ending in March 2021 and say it could take years to return to pre-COVID levels.

Germany has shut restaurants, bars and gyms, but schools and shops remain open during this second wave of the pandemic in a much lighter lockdown than that seen in the spring.
The risk of recession in Europe's biggest economy during the November to January period rose to 17.7% from 12.6% in October, the data pre-released to Reuters showed. 
The IMK index, which measures the risk of a recession over a three-month period, factored in weak economic data such as falling foreign orders for industrial goods as well as weaker financial market indicators in the November reading.
Germany's economy saw record growth of 8.2% in the July-September period following an unprecedented slump of 9.8% in the second quarter.

The new IMK data will be published officially on Monday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment fell unexpectedly in early November as households worried about their finances, the resurgent COVID-19 pandemic and the depleted fiscal stimulus, dimming the economy's outlook as the curtain started to close on a challenging year.
The survey from the University of Michigan on Friday also showed Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the Nov. 3 presidential election was weighing on expectations among Republicans, with a slight gain among Democrats.
Daily new coronavirus cases have been exceeding 100,000, with hospitalizations and deaths surging, prompting some state and local governments to impose new restrictions on businesses. Restrictions and consumer avoidance of crowded places could trigger another wave of layoffs and further squeeze incomes following the loss of a government weekly unemployment subsidy.
""The drawdown in sentiment seems to reflect decreased perceptions of household finances, which may be a lagged effect of the dwindling fiscal stimulus,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""More consumers reported lower income than higher income for the first time since 2014.""
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index dropped to 77 early this month from a final reading of 81.8 in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index little changed at 82. The survey's measure of current conditions was steady. Its gauge of expectations fell to 71.3 from 79.2.
A measure of expectations among Republicans declined to 76.4 from 96.4. It edged up to 69.3 from 68.6 among Democrats.
A weekly unemployment supplement, which was part of more than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief, has lapsed for millions of unemployed and underemployed workers. A second rescue package is unlikely before President-elect Biden takes office in January.
Economists expect consumer sentiment will trend lower despite promising developments on experimental vaccines.
""With more and more states starting to impose new restrictions on activity, this highlights the growing downside risks posed by the pandemic for the next few months,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior economist at Capital Economics.
Stocks on Wall Street rose on upbeat results from Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO). The dollar (DXY) dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
VEGETABLE PRICES ROCKETING
Exploding COVID-19 infections and labor market slack are seen keeping a lid on inflation, even as producer prices maintain their steady rise. In a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand climbed 0.3% in October, driven by more expensive food and gasoline, after rising 0.4% in September.
It was the sixth straight monthly increase in the PPI. A 0.5% increase in the price of goods accounted for nearly 60% of the gain in the PPI. Goods rose 0.4% in September.
In the 12 months through October, the PPI advanced 0.5% after rebounding 0.4% in September.
Economists had forecast the PPI would rise 0.2% in October and increase 0.4% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices gained 0.2% in October. The so-called core PPI advanced 0.4% in September. In the 12 months through October, the core PPI increased 0.8% after rising 0.7% in September.
Coming in the wake of data on Thursday showing consumer prices unchanged in October, the PPI report further allayed fears of deflation, a decline in the general price level that is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices.
Economists expect the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates near zero at least through 2021. The U.S. central Bank has a 2% target, a flexible average. Its preferred inflation measure, the core PCE price index rose 1.5% in September
Wholesale food prices jumped 2.4% in October, accounting for nearly three-fourths of the increase in the cost of goods. Food prices were boosted by a 26.8% surge in the cost of fresh and dry vegetables.
Prices also rose for gasoline, meats, chicken eggs, and thermoplastic resins and materials. Prices fell for light motor trucks and passenger cars, resulting in core goods prices being unchanged after rising 0.4%.
The cost of services rose 0.2% after advancing 0.4% in September. Nearly 40% of the broad-based gain was due to a 1.1% increase in transportation and warehousing services. Margins for final demand trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, climbed 0.2%.
Healthcare costs rose 0.3% and portfolio fees increased 0.5%. Airline tickets were up 1.2%.
Those airline tickets, healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index. With the relevant CPI and PPI components in hand, economists are predicting the core PCE price index rose 1.4% in October.

""Inflation is hard to find at the producer level at the moment and with the second wave of coronavirus cases hitting new records nearly every day, producer goods inflation is unlikely to emerge in coming months,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.

The University of Michigan’s preliminary sentiment index for November decreased to a three-month low of 77 from a final October reading of 81.8, data released Friday showed. The median estimate in Bloomberg’s survey of economists called for a reading of 82.
The measure of expectations dropped by nearly 8 points to 71.3, while a gauge of current conditions was little changed at 85.8. Interviews conducted following the election recorded a substantial negative shift in Republicans’ expectations and no gain among Democrats. The survey began Oct. 28 and concluded late on Nov. 10.
“Republicans now voice the least favorable economic expectations since Trump took office, and Democrats have voiced more positive expectations,’’ Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in the report. “In the months ahead, the partisan gap is likely to enlarge, although the gains will be limited until a potential vaccine is approved and widely distributed.’’
Consumers’ views about their current financial situations deteriorated, to well below the pre-pandemic peaks, the report showed. Net declines in household incomes were reported in early November for the first time since March 2014, with the largest decrease among lower income households and older Americans.
Less optimism about the state of the economy may damp prospects for the holiday shopping season against a backdrop of surging new virus infections across the country. The rising caseloads could weigh on sentiment in the coming months as some cities and states reinstate more restrictive measures.
A separate report on Thursday showed that the modest momentum in the labor market’s recovery remains intact, with initial jobless claims falling by the most in five weeks."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's retail inflation may stay elevated for at least three more months after hitting a six-year high in October, as excess rain has damaged standing crops and seedlings, while edible oils that the country imports have become expensive.
The high prices are a particular cause of concern for India's hundreds of millions of poor people, who have already been squeezed by the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on an economy that contracted a record 23.9% in April-June.
Food items such as onions, potatoes, eggs, meat and tomatoes have a nearly 46% weight in India's retail inflation basket. Food inflation shot up to 11.07% in October, the highest in nine months according to data released on Thursday, sending overall retail inflation surging to 7.61%.
""We were expecting a hefty correction in vegetable prices but just before harvesting, excessive rainfall damaged crops,"" said Amol Ghule, a vegetable trader based in the western state of Maharashtra that dominates India's onion and oilseeds production.
Parts of India's richest state was battered by untimely rain last month.
""Many farmers are having to prepare seedlings again for planting and this will delay supplies from the new season crop,"" Ghule said.
HIGH SPENDING
In the past three months, onion prices have more than quadrupled in India, while soyoil prices (NSOc1) have rallied 23%.
International prices of edible oils, meanwhile, have hit record highs due to falling stocks. India imports 70% of its edible oil from countries such as Malaysia, Argentina, Indonesia and Ukraine.
""Palm oil prices have jumped in Indonesia and Malaysia, soyoil in Argentina and sunflower oil in Ukraine,"" said B.V. Mehta, executive director of industry body the Solvent Extractors' Association.
Poultry prices are rising as Indians flock to chicken shops for some extra protein during the pandemic, while production is low because many chicken farms were closed due to India's virus lockdown. 
Also, high vegetable prices have made eggs more affordable for many poorer people, said Uddhav Ahire, chairman of poultry supplier Anand Agro Group.
Economists say the government's extra spending to revitalise the economy could also keep inflation high. This fiscal year ending March 31, the government is likely to overshoot its budgeted spending of $407.80 billion by more than $60 billion.
Worried about stoking inflation further, the Reserve Bank of India has paused its monetary easing since August, after cutting rates by 115 basis points since March.
For 29-year-old Karan Solanki, now the sole earner in his family after his mother lost her job during the pandemic, higher food prices mean watchful purchases of even the most basic items.
""We are unable to buy ration in bulk for a month anymore,"" said Solanki, who runs errands at a private company in Mumbai and lives with his parents and sister.

""We only buy in small quantities for daily use and avoid using expensive vegetables as much as we can.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Economic activity in Brazil rose in September for a fifth month, a central bank survey showed on Friday, more than economists had expected and pointing to a solid recovery in the third quarter from the worst of the COVID-19 shock earlier in the year.
The central bank's IBC-Br index, often seen as a good proxy for broader gross domestic product, rose a seasonally-adjusted 1.3% in September from August, above the median 1.0% forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
It brought the cumulative increase over the third quarter to 9.5%, but still leaves activity 2.5% below its pre-pandemic level in February, the central bank figures show.
(GRAPHIC - Brazil IBC-Br economic activity index: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqoeedpx/IBCBR.png)
It was the fifth monthly increase in a row, but because August's rise was revised up to 1.4% from 1.1%, September's increase was the smallest of them all.
Compared to September last year activity was down 0.8%, and on an accumulated 12-month basis it is down 3.3%, both on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, the central bank said.
By this measure, Latin America's largest economy is still 8.3% smaller than it was at its peak in December 2013.
Brazil's economy is expected to register its biggest ever annual slump this year, with the government forecasting a 4.7% fall. Economy Minister Paulo Guedes insists that Brazil will suffer less and will recover more quickly than many other countries due to government and central bank support.
Retail sales have already reached new all-time peaks, as has manufacturing, according to purchasing managers indices. The economy is also creating net job growth again, according to some indicators.
Guedes reiterated his bullish view of the economy this week, saying it is in a 'V-shaped' recovery and could grow by as much as 4% next year.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said the economic output of the 19 countries sharing the euro surged 12.6% quarter-on-quarter in the July-September period, a downward revision from the 12.7% jump reported on Oct 30.
This meant that year-on-year, euro zone GDP was 4.4% lower in the third quarter, rather than 4.3% reported before.
The quarterly surge in activity was the result of economies re-opening after lockdowns in the first two quarters, imposed to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The rebound in economic activity corresponded with a 0.9% quarter-on-quarter increase in employment, Eurostat said, though year-on-year employment was still 2% lower in July-September.
The single currency area also had a slightly higher than expected external trade surplus of 24.5 billion euros in September, Eurostat said, against expectations of 22 billion, and a 17.0 billion surplus a year earlier.
But the improvement was not due to a rise in trade, but because as exports fell only 3.8% while imports plunged 8.9% year-on-year.
In the first nine months of the year, the euro zone's trade deficit with China increased and its surpluses with the United States and Britain fell, but it had a much smaller trade gap with energy exporter Russia as prices plunged and turned deficits into surpluses with Turkey, Norway and South Korea.
Adjusted for seasonal swings, the euro zone's trade surplus in September was 24 billion, up from 21 billion in August as exports rose 4.1% month-on-month and imports rose only 2.7%.

The third quarter's pace compares with a decline of 9.0% in the previous quarter, and an advance Q3 estimate of a 3.4% contraction.
Activity picked up markedly from a slump early in the year as the government gradually relaxed social distancing measures and people returned to offices and stores.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's central bank provided a rosier growth outlook for 2021 after the economy suffered a smaller contraction in the third quarter, but said it would continue to help households and businesses withstand the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gross domestic product fell 2.7% in July-September, smaller than the 3.2% decline forecast in a Reuters poll and showing a marked improvement on the 17.1% slump in the second quarter.
The trade-reliant economy recovered from its first contraction since the 2009 financial crisis after the government began gradually easing curbs to contain the virus in May.
The central bank said 125 basis points worth of rate cuts this year would support 2021 growth, but that it would continue to make ""policy support and assistance"" available.
""Going into 2021, growth is expected to recover, benefiting from the improvement in global demand and a turnaround in public and private sector expenditure amid various policy support,"" said Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) Governor Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus at a virtual news conference.
""Future monetary policy considerations will continue to be guided by evolving conditions.""
Private consumption eased 2.6% in the third quarter from a year earlier after a 5.6% decline in the previous three months, the central bank said, while manufacturing grew 3.3% after a 18.3% drop in the second quarter. Gross exports jumped 4.4% in the July-September period after a 15.1% fall.
The BNM also revised its 2021 projections, raising the midpoint growth forecast to 7% from an earlier average of 6.75%.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) said it expected the central bank to leave rates unchanged throughout 2021, with a low risk of a 25 basis point cut.
While some economists worried that the reimposition of coronavirus restrictions in October would dampen the recovery in Malaysia in the last three months of the year, the central bank said the risks to global growth from COVID-19 had eased.
""The risk to growth from these resurgences is not expected to be as severe as the magnitude of contractions observed in the second quarter,"" Nor Shamsiah added.
Analysts at Capital Economics said Malaysia's outlook was dependent on how well the government managed to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Total infections tripled to over 43,000 cases since a fresh outbreak in September.
""If Malaysia is able contain the second wave, as others in the region have been successful in doing, the economic impact should be relatively small,"" Alex Holmes, Asia economist at Capital Economics said.

Other key data due next week includes core consumer inflation, which is forecast to show the biggest fall in prices since early 2011 as the impact from a sales tax hike last year fades and private demand remains weak due to the pandemic. 
Exports were seen falling 4.5% in October from a year earlier, slowing from a 4.9% decline in September, the poll of 17 economists showed.
Imports were expected to have fallen 9.0% in October from a year earlier, which would result in a trade surplus of 250 billion yen ($2.38 billion).
""Exports are recovering in volume but the pace of recovery could slow amid uncertainties, such as an increase in coronavirus cases in Europe,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has instructed his cabinet to come up with another stimulus package as the pandemic persists.
The government has so far compiled two packages worth a combined $2.2 trillion to ease the pain from the health crisis.
The finance ministry releases trade data at 8:50 a.m. on Wednesday (2350 GMT Tuesday).
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, is forecast to have dropped 0.7% in October from a year earlier, the poll found.
That would be the fastest decline since March 2011 when the index also fell 0.7%.
The boost to prices from the sales tax hike last year has eased while a national campaign promoting domestic travel is also among factors behind declines in the core CPI, economists say.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government started fiscal 2021 with an October budget deficit of $284 billion, a record for the month, as coronavirus-related outlays spiked sharply from a year earlier and revenues declined, the Treasury Department said on Thursday.
That was 111% higher than the October 2019 deficit of $134 billion and 61% higher than the previous October record of $176 billion in 2009, during the financial crisis and recession.
It follows a record full-year deficit of $3.132 trillion for fiscal 2020, which ended Sept. 30, more than tripling the previous year's shortfall due to COVID-19 aid spending.
Treasury officials said the 2020 deficit was held down partly by far lower outlays and stronger receipts in the early months of that fiscal year before the pandemic closed down large parts of the economy in March.
This year's fiscal deficit could reach $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion if no further coronavirus spending bill is passed by Congress, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States was on track for a $1 trillion deficit in fiscal 2021 because Republican-passed tax cuts in 2017 had reduced revenues. 
""If we don't do another COVID bill, we're headed back to the old, unsustainable deficit path we were on,"" Goldwein said.
But he added that CRFB, a budget watchdog group, is advocating additional targeted spending to sustain workers in hard-hit sectors, communities and health care efforts, including vaccine distribution, which will have positive effects on growth and federal revenues.
Congress remained at an impasse on Thursday in discussions about possible further aid, as Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell voiced his preference for a $500 billion package, far smaller than the $2.2 trillion in spending sought by Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.
U.S. federal revenues for October fell 3% to $238 billion, largely due to lower receipts withheld from paychecks resulting from reduced employment levels and a temporary deferment of Medicare and Social Security taxes ordered by President Donald Trump, a Treasury official said.

Outlays for the month increased 37% to $522 billion, which included large increases for health care, food assistance and unemployment compensation and other coronavirus aid programs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a seven-month low last week, but the pace of decline has slowed and further improvement could be limited by a raging COVID-19 pandemic and lack of additional fiscal stimulus.
The labor market slack is keeping inflation muted, with other data on Thursday showing consumer prices unchanged in October as moderate gains in the cost of food and rents were offset by cheaper gasoline and healthcare. The frail economy is one of the major challenges President-elect Joe Biden faces when he takes over from President Donald Trump in January.
Tepid inflation could allow the Federal Reserve to keep its ultra-easy monetary policy for a long time to aid the recovery from the COVID-19 recession, with the labor market not expected to move back to full employment before 2023. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a European Central Bank forum on Thursday that spreading coronavirus infections posed a risk to the recovery, which he described as slowing. He added it was too soon to assess ""with any confidence"" the impact of promising news on experimental vaccines.
""There are not enough jobs and not enough inflation out there to assuage the worries of Fed officials trying to go it alone to engineer this economic recovery as Washington elected officials dither over providing additional fiscal stimulus,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 48,000 to a seasonally adjusted 709,000 for the week ended Nov. 7. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 735,000 applications for the latest week.
Despite claims dropping to their lowest since March, they remained above their peak of 665,000 during the 2007-2009 Great Recession. Weak demand, especially in the services sector, is forcing employers to shed workers. 
Daily new COVID-19 infections are exceeding 100,000 and hospitalizations are surging as cooler weather draws people indoors, prompting some state and local governments to impose new restrictions on businesses. 
Even without restrictions, many consumers are likely to stay away from places like bars, restaurants and gyms, fearing exposure to the illness. Restaurants and gyms moved outdoors during summer. 
Unadjusted claims, viewed by economists as a better measure of layoffs, fell 20,799 to 723,105 last week. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, at least 1 million people filed claims last week.
""Unfortunately, if we see major containment measures kick in again soon after Thanksgiving those jobless claims numbers will climb once more,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street fell on the rising coronavirus infections. The dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED
Unemployment claims peaked at a record 6.867 million in March. Much of the improvement in the labor market came from businesses recalling laid-off and furloughed workers as companies and the unemployed accessed their share of more than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief. 
But fiscal stimulus has run out, which will make it harder for the economy to generate enough jobs to absorb the millions of unemployed Americans. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 436,000 to 6.786 million in the week ending Oct. 31, partly reflecting many people exhausting their six months of eligibility.
A record 4.143 million people filed for federal government-funded extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Oct. 24, up 159,776 from the prior week. Economists said this figure was understated as Florida and Georgia had yet to report their numbers. These benefits will run out in December.
During that period there were 551,791 people on state extended jobless benefits, which are also capped at 13 weeks.
Under all programs, 21.2 million people were collecting unemployment checks in late October. 
The government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls rose by 638,000 jobs in October, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May. That followed 672,000 jobs added in September. Only 12.1 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered.
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said its consumer price index was unchanged last month following a 0.2% increase in September. A 0.2% rebound in food prices was offset by a 0.5% drop in the cost of gasoline. 
In the 12 months through October, the CPI climbed 1.2% after increasing 1.4% in September. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI was also flat in October after rising 0.2% in the prior month. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.2% after ticking up 0.1% in September. That overshadowed a 0.4% decline in the cost of healthcare.

""As supply shortages are being resolved, sluggish aggregate demand will keep a lid on inflation,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

Investing.com -- The number of Americans filing initial claims for state jobless benefits last week fell by more than expected to 709,000, but remained at levels highlighting concerns over the slowing recovery in the labor market amid resurgence in new COVID-19 cases.
Economists had expected a drop to 735,000. The prior week's figure was revised to 757,000, according to the Labor Department report.
The number of continuing claims fell to 6.786 million, also a little lower than forecast.
While jobless claims are at their lowest level since March, when the first wave of pandemic related layoffs hit the U.S. economy, they are still more than three times the rate that claims had run at before the pandemic began.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said on Thursday that industrial production in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 0.4% month-on-month in September for a 6.8% year-on-year decline.
That compared with the average expectations in a Reuters poll of economists of respectively a 0.7% increase and a drop of 5.8%.
It also marked the fourth consecutive month of declining production growth from 12.5% in May to 5.3% in July, 0.6% in August and now a slip in September.
Output of durable consumer goods, such as televisions and washing machines, has been the strongest component of the previous months' growth, but fell back 5.3% in September. Energy production was also down, by 1.0% in the month.
All other components rose, notably of non-durable consumer goods, such as clothes, by 2.1%.
The steepest monthly declines were in Italy, Ireland and Portugal at respectively 5.6%, 4.7% and 3.8%. Many countries, such as the euro zone's largest economies Germany and France, recorded increases.
Year-on-year, the only euro zone country with higher production was Portugal. The sharpest fall, of 13.6%, was in Ireland, followed by Germany, the Netherlands and France, with declines of greater than 6%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew by a slower than expected 1.1% in September from August, lagging other rich nations as it struggled to recover from the shock of the pandemic even before the latest COVID-19 lockdown.
The slowdown in Thursday's official data cemented expectations that the economy will shrink again as 2020 ends, with uncertainty about the Dec. 31 deadline for a post-Brexit European Union trade deal adding to the coronavirus drag.
Between July and September, gross domestic product grew by a quarterly record of 15.5%. But that failed to make up for its nearly 20% lockdown slump between April and June.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the monthly growth rate to slow less sharply, to 1.5%. 
The economy is being propped up by more than 200 billion pounds of emergency spending and tax cuts ordered by finance minister Rishi Sunak and the Bank of England's almost 900 billion pound bond-buying programme.
Despite those efforts, Britain -- which passed 50,000 coronavirus fatalities on Wednesday, Europe's highest death toll -- has suffered the biggest GDP drop among major economies listed by the Office for National Statistics.
Britain's initial lockdown lasted longer than in other countries and hammered services firms which make up 80% of the economy. 
GDP remained almost 10% smaller than at the end of 2019, twice as big as the falls in Italy, Germany and France and nearly three times the size of the U.S. drop, the ONS said.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said there was still a ""huge gap"" in the economy but news of a potentially effective COVID-19 vaccine would help lift the uncertainty.
""It's encouraging for individuals, it's encouraging for businesses and it's encouraging for the economy,"" he told a Financial Times event on Thursday. 
""I think we have to be cautious because obviously there's still quite a way to go in terms of the trialling.""
Last week, before the news of the vaccine trials, the BoE said the world's sixth-biggest economy was likely to shrink by a record 11% in 2020 before growing by just over 7% in 2021.
""Britain's COVID crisis, and its recovery phase, will take far longer than many people first thought,"" said James Smith, research director of the Resolution Foundation think-tank, urging Sunak not to start reversing his spending surge quickly.
NEW LOCKDOWN
Sunak said steps taken to restrict the spread of COVID-19 were likely to have slowed economic growth since September. 
""Today's figures show that our economy was recovering over the summer, but started to slow going into autumn,"" he said. ""The steps we've had to take since to halt the spread of the virus mean growth has likely slowed further since then.""
The BoE said last week that GDP could shrink by 2% in the October-December quarter.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a new, month-long lockdown for England from last week as coronavirus cases mounted. But this time construction and manufacturing firms can remain open, and so can schools and universities.
The ONS said Britain's services sector grew by a weaker than expected 1.0% in September from August. Food and accommodation fell by more than 8%, hit by the end of August's one-off state subsidies for diners.
Manufacturing inched up by 0.2% while construction grew by nearly 3%, helped by a post-lockdown housing market pickup.

Business investment was 20.5% below end-2019 levels while household consumption remains down 12.4%.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singaporean Jason Chen recently bought a S$1.7 million ($1.26 million) three-bedroom apartment in a swanky condominium, upgrading his home in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic which has triggered the country's worst ever recession.
""I know the price will rise"", said the 32-year-old, who has spent nearly a decade working in real estate.
Undeterred by the economic slump and rising unemployment, Chen is among thousands of locals snapping up property in Singapore and taking a share of the market not seen in a decade as travel curbs thwart foreign investors.
This broad-based buying spree, which has pushed prices and sales to multi-year highs, has some parallels with a housing market boom seen in late 2009 as Singapore emerged from the global financial crisis. That forced the government to initiate several rounds of cooling measures to cap surging prices.
Analysts largely don't expect a repeat this time around as those curbs mostly remain in place. But policymakers last week cautioned buyers against the lure of cheap mortgages given the scale of job losses in the wealthy business hub, which have already seen many foreigners leave and the population shrink.
""Given the labour market uncertainties in the current economic situation, prospective buyers should remain prudent in their property purchase,"" the ministry of national development said last week in a written response to a question made in parliament about the risk of a ""bubble"".
The government is expecting the Singapore economy to shrink 5-7% this year, eclipsing a record 2.2% contraction in 1998 and marking the deepest recession since independence in 1965.

""A GOOD BARGAIN""
Property prices in the city-state rose 0.8% in the third quarter to their highest level since 2013, while sales volumes jumped to a two-year peak, the latest data showed.
Singaporeans bought nearly 81% of all private apartments sold in the third quarter, the highest proportion since early 2009, according to an analysis by property agency OrangeTee and Tie.
Some buyers like Jenny Lin, a 26-year-old accountant, have viewed the pandemic as an opportunity to get on the ladder of the world's third most expensive housing market after Hong Kong and Munich, according to property consultant CBRE. 
""When COVID-19 first started you could really get a good bargain on the property price, as many people were rushing to sell their properties away for quick cash to salvage their main business,"" said Lin, who expedited her purchase of a S$530,000 one-bedroom apartment in May. 
Despite the turmoil of 2020, prices of private homes in Singapore fell only in the first quarter and have risen since.
By comparison, prices dropped for four consecutive quarters between the middle of 2008 and 2009, during the global financial crisis.
The overall price rise in 2020 has been modest at just 0.1%. But for buyers like 36-year-old asset manager Amy Zhang, who recently purchased a S$1.17 million investment property, Singapore real estate is a safe bet compared to volatile stock markets which she has invested in for years. 
The tightly controlled market, long viewed as a safe-haven, does pose some risks.
Droves of expatriates, who tend to rent, are leaving the island-state due to retrenchments and tighter foreign labour curbs, driving the first decline in Singapore's population since 2003 and pushing rents lower.
But Zhang, like many others in a country where the land available to developers is tightly controlled to manage prices, bought off plan and is betting on a stronger rental market when her property is ready in two to three years.
Singapore property has long attracted the super-rich from its less developed Southeast Asian neighbours as well as multi-millionaires from China. https://reut.rs/2GRIihC
Political uncertainty in rival Hong Kong has also helped to galvanise that appeal, analysts say, even if some foreign purchases have been put on hold due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.
""Once all travel restrictions are lifted, there will be an inflow of foreign investments into the property market,"" said Chen.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings increased less than expected in September while hiring fell, suggesting the labor market recovery was petering out even before a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases which is expected to slow momentum.
Though the Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report on Tuesday showed layoffs decreasing to their lowest level in nearly 20 years, there was more than one person competing for a single vacancy. The drop is at odds with significantly high weekly unemployment claims.
The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, marked by tens of millions of Americans on unemployment benefits, is one of the biggest challenges confronting President-elect Joe Biden when he takes over from President Trump next January.
""It's hard to see any signs of backsliding, but there aren't any signs of acceleration in the recovery either,"" said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""In a labor market with 10 million fewer jobs than February, we need to see hiring moving at a faster clip to avoid lasting damage.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, were up 84,000 to 6.4 million on the last day of September. Vacancies remained below their 7 million level in February. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast job openings rising to 6.5 million in September.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasuries fell.
The United States is setting daily records for coronavirus cases, which could force state and local governments to impose new restrictions on businesses like restaurants, bars and gyms.
Even without restrictions, consumers fearing exposure to the respiratory illness are likely to stay away, which would hurt demand and hiring. At the same time, economic growth is slowing after a massive boost from fiscal stimulus, which has run out. The economy plunged into recession in February. 
There were increases in job openings in financial activities, professional and business services, health care and social assistance, and leisure and hospitality industries. Federal government job openings decreased 20,000.
The job openings rate was unchanged at 4.3% in September.
""The virus count is hitting records however so it is questionable, given the new mini-lockdowns in many states, whether as many jobs will be required in the future at bars and restaurants, sporting events, museums and amusement parks,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
STIFF COMPETITION FOR JOBS
Hiring declined 81,000 to 5.9 million, led by a 256,000 decrease in federal government as the 2020 Census winds down. Hiring also fell in retail trade and educational services. The hires rate dipped to 4.1% from 4.2% in August. 
The JOLTS report followed on the heels of news last Friday that the economy created 638,000 jobs in October, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May. Employment remains 10.1 million jobs below its peak in February. Millions of people are experiencing long periods of unemployment.
The JOLTS report showed layoffs fell 200,000 to 1.3 million, the lowest level since December 2000. There were decreases in layoffs in the construction and wholesale trade industries. 
Despite the ebb in layoffs, the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits has remained above its 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. At least 21.5 million people were receiving unemployment benefits in mid-October. 
The layoffs rate fell to 0.9% from 1.1% in August. Even as layoffs moderated in September, job prospects for the 11.8 million estimated to be unemployed in September were rather bleak with only 6.4 million jobs available.
""For every 18 workers who were officially counted as unemployed, there were only available jobs for 10 of them,"" said 
Elise Gould, a senior economist at Economic Policy Institute in Washington. ""That means, no matter what they did, there were no jobs for 5.4 million unemployed workers. And this misses the fact that many more  weren't counted among the unemployed.""
The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs increased 179,000 to 3.0 million. More people quit their jobs in construction, arts, entertainment and recreation as well as in other services. 
The quits rate increased to 2.1% from 2.0% in August. The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence, but it has been distorted during this recession by people quitting to look after children or fearful of contracting COVID-19. 

The labor participation rate for women fell in April to levels last seen in the late 1980s and remains well below levels seen at the start of the year.

426,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 03:40AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory-gate prices fell at a sharper-than-expected pace in October, weighed by soft demand for fuel even as the trade and manufacturing sectors staged impressive recoveries from their COVID-19 slump.
Consumer inflation was also soft, easing to an 11-year low as pork prices snapped a year-and-a-half of steep increases that was fuelled by critical shortages of the popular meat.
While the weaker price gauges largely reflect swings in volatile items, they also show upstream demand for industrial goods remains tepid overall in the world's second-largest economy, despite signs of modest improvement in recent months.
The producer price index (PPI) fell 2.1% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement on Tuesday, the same pace as in September and slightly more than a 2.0% decline tipped by the median forecast from a Reuters survey of analysts.
""We expect both CPI and PPI to be subdued in Q4,"" said Zhaopeng Xing, markets economist at ANZ. ""However, inflation will likely rebound after Q1 2021, thanks to the growing demand post the pandemic.""
Chinese shares fell following the data, defying a global rally in stocks that was driven by news about the development of a coronavirus vaccine.
On a monthly basis, the PPI was unchanged, slowing from a 0.1% increase the previous month.
Oil and gas extraction prices fell 4.9% month-on-month in October while fuel processing costs declined 1.6%, Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician with the NBS, said in a statement.
The weak inflation contrasts with brisk growth in exports and manufacturing activity, seen as signs of a sustained recovery in China's industrial sector.
China's economic growth accelerated to 4.9% from a year earlier during the third quarter as activity extended its recovery from a record slump at the start of the year. 
Analysts expect the economy to post a small gain for all of 2020 and then expand at a more robust pace in 2021, partly on hopes that COVID-19 vaccines will become available globally.
China's consumer price index rose 0.5% from a year earlier, the slowest since October 2009, separate data showed on Tuesday, missing the 0.8% rise tipped by the Reuters poll and a 1.7% rise in September.
Pork prices fell 2.8% year-on-year in October, marking the first decline after 19 months of sharp increases due to supply constraints from the African swine fever. It had risen 25.5% in September.
The core inflation rate, excluding volatile food and energy prices, remained soft, edging up just 0.5%. 
On a monthly basis, CPI fell 0.3% in October. 
""If month-on-month price increases remain muted in the coming months, there is a chance that CPI may fall into deflationary territory,"" said Jingyang Chen, Greater China economist at HSBC. 

""While a gradual recovery in household consumption and lower base may support an upward trajectory in CPI inflation next year, we think the possibility of CPI deflation in the coming months will likely prevent the PBOC from tightening its policy stance by year-end.""

INSEE said the jobless rate jumped to 9.0% from 7.1% in the second quarter, its highest level since the third quarter of 2018.
INSEE said that marked the single biggest quarterly increase on record going back to 1975, but it was largely because the rate had been skewed in the previous two quarters because people were not able to look for work due to a mid-March to mid-May coronavirus lockdown.
The surge risks putting President Emmanuel Macron's goal of reducing unemployment to 7% by the end his term in 2022 out of reach. It he had inherited a jobless rate of 9.5% when he came to office in 2017.
France saw its worst post-war recession in the first and second quarters due to the lockdown, but the economy came back to life in the third quarter - before a second lockdown was imposed on Oct. 30 to contain a new wave of the virus.
The Bank of France said on Monday the country's economic activity was 12% lower than normal this month, after it entered the new lockdown.

In a separate report, INSEE said that industrial production had risen 1.4% in September from August, beating expectations on average for 0.8% in a Reuters poll.

LONDON (Reuters) - British employers made a record number of staff redundant in the third quarter and the jobless rate jumped, according to official data that show the labour market declined rapidly before finance minister Rishi Sunak made a U-turn on COVID support measures.
A record 314,000 British workers were made redundant in the three months to September, 181,000 more than in the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.
The unemployment rate rose to 4.8%, as expected in a Reuters poll of economists and the highest rate since the three months to November 2016.
While the public and investors were cheered on Monday by news that an experimental COVID-19 vaccine from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech was more than 90% effective in trials, the ONS data showed some hard months lie ahead for many Britons.
""September's rise in the unemployment rate from 4.5% in August to 4.8% suggests that the previous scaling back of the furlough scheme took its toll,"" economist Ruth Gregory from the consultancy Capital Economics said.
""And with the second lockdown set to send the recovery into reverse, the unemployment rate may yet climb to about 9% next year.""
Employment fell by 164,000 during the quarter, the data showed - a sharper drop than the Reuters poll consensus of 148,000.
The Bank of England last week forecast that Britain's unemployment rate would reach 6.3% by the end of this year and peak at nearly 8% in the second quarter of next year.
Last week finance minister Rishi Sunak extended his costly coronavirus furlough scheme, which provides 80% of the pay of temporarily laid-off workers, until the end of March and he announced billions of pounds in other forms of support.
Sunak said the figures ""underline the scale of the challenge we're facing"".
""I want to reassure anyone that is worried about the coming winter months that we will continue to support those affected,"" he said in a statement after the data was published.
The BoE expects around 5.5 million employees will need support from this programme during an England-wide lockdown this month, up from just over 2 million in October.

Sunak's critics have said a series of U-turns over employment support policy made it hard for companies to plan ahead at the expense of many jobs.

Investing.com – Chinese factory-gate prices saw sharper-than-expected falls in October, with weak fuel demand counterbalancing recoveries in the trade and manufacturing sectors from their COVID-19-induced slump.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released earlier in the day showed a Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) disappointing expectations. CPI grew 0.5% year-on-year, against the 0.8% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and September’s 1.7%, the slowest growth since October 2009. It contracted 0.3% month-on-month, tumbling below the forecast and September’s 0.2% growth.
The PPI contracted 2.1% year-on-year, missing the forecast contraction of 2.0% but remaining level with September’s 2.1% contraction.
Consumer inflation also slumped to a 11-year low, with pork prices halting a 19-month-long period of increases. The long period of growth is attributable to a shortage of the meat, which is popular throughout the country, due to African swine fever. Prices fell 2.8% year-on-year in October, compared to the 25.5% increase in September.
Oil and gas extraction prices fell 4.9% month-on-month in October while fuel processing costs declined 1.6%, NBS senior statistician Dong Lijuan said in a statement.
Although the weak readings largely reflect swings in volatile items, they also suggest that upstream demand for industrial goods remains weak overall, despite recent signs of small improvements.
However, some investors remained optimistic, with the Chinese economy expected to post a modest gain for the full year, then gather speed in 2021 over cautious hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine will be made available globally by then.
“We expect both CPI and PPI to be subdued in the fourth quarter … however, inflation will likely rebound after Q1 2021, thanks to the growing post-pandemic demand,” ANZ markets economist Zhaopeng Xing told Reuters.
“Consumer price inflation looks set to drop back further in the near-term as pork supply continues to recover from last year’s African swine fever outbreak,” Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note after the data release, striking a more cautious note than Xing.
“Policymakers are likely to look through the volatility in food prices and focus on the recovery in underlying inflation. As such, we don’t think low headline inflation will prevent the People’s Bank (of China) from raising interest rates next year,” the note added.
The data follows Monday’s trade data, which showed that exports rose 11.45% year-on-year and the trade balance rose to $58.44 billion, but that imports rose 4.9% year-on-year, down from the predicted growth of 9.5% and September's 13.2% reading."

Sentiment climbed to 5 points in October from -4 a month earlier, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) Ltd. said Tuesday in a statement. The conditions index -- which measures hiring, sales and profits -- edged up to 1 from zero in September.
“This was likely driven by the fall in Covid-19 case numbers and looming end of lockdown in Melbourne,” said Alan Oster, chief economist at NAB. “Trading conditions and profitability drove the marginal improvement in conditions, but the employment index remains weak at -5 index points, suggesting the labor market is lagging the recovery in activity.”
Australia’s central bank predicts unemployment will peak at just under 8% in the next couple of months from 6.9% at present. It last week unveiled a new monetary stimulus package that saw interest rates cut to 0.10% and added a A$100 billion ($72.8 billion) program to buy longer-dated bonds to the existing three-year yield control target.
The central bank’s efforts are working with substantial fiscal stimulus released in the government’s budget that included income-tax cuts and incentives for business to invest and hire. The economy’s outlook has improved as Victoria state emerges from a sever lockdown to contain Covid, with job ads, sentiment and house prices all improving.
“The survey continues to show that the economy has rebounded from the sharp fall in activity in the first half of 2020 and will likely continue to recover as the economy reopens,” Oster said. “The improvement in confidence is encouraging but remains fragile, and it will likely remain that way until a vaccine is available.”

The regional Fed bank's latest Survey of Consumer Expectations found gradual improvement in optimism about the labor market, with the average expectation that the unemployment rate could be higher one year from now dropping for the third consecutive month. 
The perceived odds of losing a job in the next 12 months also dropped to 15.5% in October from 16.6% in September, but were still above the pre-pandemic level of 13.8% in February. The drop was largest among people with higher levels of education and those earning more than $50,000.
At the same time, consumers across education and income levels said they worried it would be harder to find a new job if they became unemployed. The perceived odds of finding new work dropped to 46.9% in October from 49.9% in September - the lowest level since April 2014. 
Data released by the Labor Department on Friday showed that new hiring continued to slow in October and more people faced long-term joblessness, but the unemployment rate also fell to 6.9%, a bigger drop than expected by analysts, and more people entered the labor force.
The survey of consumer expectations is a monthly poll conducted on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.

In other aspects of their finances, fewer people said they expected their situation to improve over the next year and more said they expected it to worsen. Consumers said they were less worried about missing a minimum debt payment over the next three months, but also felt it would become harder to access credit over the next year.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports rose in October for the fourth consecutive month and at an expectation-beating pace, boosted by surging demand for the island's electronic goods as people work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Exports jumped 11.2% from a year earlier to $32.2 billion inOctober, a record high for any month, the Ministry of Finance said on Monday, and the strongest growth since February. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a modest rise of 4.2% for October.
The ministry attributed the growth to ongoing strong demand for electronics, driven by new technology such as fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications networks and telecommuting, as millions of people are forced to work from home globally.
Healthy demand for electronics ahead of the year-end shopping season, traditionally a busy time for Taiwan's exporters, also boosted export growth, the ministry said.
Exports of telecommuting products - such as wireless keyboards and headphones - rose 20.8% from a year earlier to a record high for any month, while electronic components grew 21.8% and semiconductors rose 22.2%.
The ministry said it saw a ""comprehensive expansion"" in exports to all of Taiwan's major markets. Exports to the United States and Japan both reached record highs by value, growing an annual 21.4% and 4.8% respectively.
Tech powerhouse Taiwan could see November exports rise in the range of a 5% to 8% on year, the ministry said.
However, it said the rebounding pandemic, with renewed lockdowns in some countries, as well as U.S.-China trade tension offered uncertainty going forward.
Taiwan's October imports fell 1%, against economists' expectations for a 2.5% decrease.
Taiwan's manufacturers are a key part of the global supply chain for tech giants such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL).

In China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, exports grew at the fastest pace in 19 months in October, while imports also rose, official data showed on Saturday.

Seasonally adjusted exports rose 2.3% on the month after an upwardly revised 2.9% rise in August, the Federal Statistics Office said. Imports fell by 0.1% after a rise of 5.8% the previous month. The trade surplus expanded to 17.8 billion euros, the Office said.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected exports to rise by 2.0% and imports to increase by 2.1%. The trade surplus was predicted to come in at 15.8 billion euros.
""Looking ahead, exports (and industrial production) could still prevent the economy from falling into a second lockdown depression in the final quarter of the year,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.
""With U.S. President-elect Biden, the threat of U.S. tariffs on European (read German) automotives should disappear,"" he added.
The economy grew by a record 8.2% in the third quarter on higher consumer spending and exports, but an aggressive second wave of infections and a new partial lockdown are now clouding the outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond.
Annual figures showed exports to China rose 10.6% from the previous September. Exports to the United States, which the Office said were particularly affected by the coronavirus pandemic, fell 5.8% on the year and those to the UK fell 12.4%.
A picture is emerging of German industry growing despite the pandemic, while services struggle. Industrial output rose in September, data showed on Friday.
A survey released last Wednesday showed that German services activity shrank for the first time in four months in October.

Germany closed bars, restaurants, gyms, cinemas, theatres and domestic tourism last Monday for a month to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A key Japanese economic indicator improved for the fourth straight month in September, suggesting relief is at hand for an economy still feeling the drag from the coronavirus pandemic.
The index of coincident economic indicators - calculated off a range of data including factory output, employment and retail sales numbers - rose a preliminary 1.4 points from the previous month to 80.8 in September, the Cabinet Office said on Monday.
The government said that the index in September indicated economic activity had stopped contracting, leaving unchanged its August assessment.
The data takes some pressure off the government to speed up the recovery of the economy, which is feeling the drag from weak business and household spending.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is expected to announce a plan for extra stimulus measures to help the economy overcome the COVID-19 crisis, government and ruling party sources told Reuters last month.
The figure also came after the Bank of Japan upgraded its view on the recovery outlook at its policy meeting last month, signalling that it has delivered enough stimulus for now.
The index for leading economic indicators, which is a gauge of the economy a few months ahead and is compiled using data such as job offers and consumer sentiment, soared 4.4 points to 92.9 from August, its biggest rise since a 5.4-point jump in June.

Gross domestic product data for the third quarter due on Nov. 16 is expected to show the economy rebounded from a record slump, thanks largely to a recovery in exports and output.

Investing.com – China continued its economic recovery from the COVID-19 lockdown imposed earlier in the year, but the incessantly rising number of COVID-19 cases globally saw a smaller-than-forecast growth in imports.
Data for October released on Sunday showed that exports rose 11.45% year-on-year, exceeding the 9.3% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and September’s 9.9% reading. The trade balance rose to $58.44 billion, smashing both September’s $37 billion and the forecast $46 billion.
Although imports rose 4.9% year-on-year, down from the predicted growth of 9.5% and September's 13.2% reading, “a second straight monthly expansion suggests a continuous rebound in domestic demand,” according to Bloomberg Economics.
With Europe and the U.S. fighting a second wave of COVID-19 cases, exports benefitted from increased demand from a global rush to secure medical equipment and work-from-home technology as countries such as France, Germany and the U.K. re-enter lockdowns.
However, with the global number of cases now exceeding 50 million as of Nov. 9, with almost 10 million cases in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University, the fight against COVID-19 continues, dampening global demand. Domestically, a case was detected in the city of Tianjin on Sunday.
With Sunday’s confirmation of Democrat Joe Biden’s victory in the U.S. presidential elections, investors widely expect a less confrontational approach to U.S.-China relations from the new administration. Incumbent president Donald Trump has so far refused to concede and continues to pursue legal action.
Inflation and credit reports, including the Consumer Price Index, due to be released tomorrow are also widely expected to indicate stable underlying demand. Investors also await the results of the Singles Day shopping event, involving e-commerce giants such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), on Nov. 11."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Business sentiment of Japanese manufacturers and service-sector firms was the least pessimistic in nine months in November, likely as the world's third-largest economy showed signs of pulling out of a coronavirus-induced recession, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.
But both sectors believed conditions will remain negative over the coming months, highlighting the struggle to completely shake off the drag from COVID-19, according to the monthly Reuters Tankan, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey.
In the poll of 485 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 225 firms responded on condition of anonymity, many complained about the pandemic's lingering impact, and negative comments about business conditions outnumbered positive ones. 
""Conditions haven't returned to what they were before the coronavirus pandemic,"" a manager at a textile maker said in the survey.
The result underscores the challenge Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga faces in boosting domestic demand to assure an economic recovery while keeping the spread of the virus in check.
Suga is expected to announce this month a plan for fresh stimulus to boost activity, government and ruling party sources have told Reuters.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers showed a marked improvement in November, rising to minus 13 from minus 26 in the previous month. But the index remained in negative territory for a 16th straight month.
The service-sector index was also minus 13, up from minus 16 in October, with sentiment among wholesalers weighing on broad business confidence.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are derived by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means that pessimists outnumber optimists.
The results meant both indexes came in at their least pessimistic since February.
The BOJ cut its economic growth and inflation forecasts for the current fiscal year and offered a brighter view on the recovery outlook at its policy meeting last month, signalling that it has done enough on the stimulus front for now.
But it also warned the outlook was highly uncertain as the pandemic weighs on service-sector spending and a resurgence of infections in Europe dampen prospects for a sustained global recovery. 
In the Reuters Tankan survey, a manager at a machinery maker wrote: ""The semiconductor memory market, which had been strong so far, has slowed down somewhat.""

Manufacturers' sentiment was seen recovering further to minus 8 in February, while that of service-sector firms was expected to remain unchanged at minus 13.

Exports in October rose 11.4% from a year earlier, beating analysts' expectations of a 9.3% increase and quickening from a solid 9.9% increase in September.
The surge in exports pushed the trade surplus for October up to $58.44 billion, compared with the poll's forecast for a $46 billion surplus and a $37 billion surplus in September.
China's trade surplus with the United States widened to $31.37 billion in October from $30.75 billion in September.
China's exports have stayed largely resilient amid the COVID-19 global pandemic, as strong demand for medical supplies and reduced manufacturing capacity elsewhere worked in China's favour.
""Exports growth quickened further and significantly exceeded expectations, indicating a relatively strong momentum,"" said Liu Xuezhi, an anlyst at Bank of Communications in Shanghai.
China's exports could stay strong in the rest of 2020 as domestic firms resume production faster than global rivals and sell more COVID-19 related goods such as face masks, Liu said.
However, some analysts said exports could come under pressure in the coming months, as major European economies, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom, went back into lockdown as a second wave of coronavirus cases gathered strength.Factory activity accelerated at the fastest pace in nearly a decade in October, a private survey showed, although the official survey pointed to some slowdown in the expansion. Export orders expanded.
Imports rose 4.7% year-on-year in October, slower than September's 13.2% growth, and underperforming expectations in a Reuters poll for a 9.5% increase, but still marking a second straight month of growth.
Chinese airlines are shunning some deliveries of Airbus (PA:AIR) aircraft, citing fears of coronavirus infection for their staff in the latest tussle over efforts to keep delayed deliveries on track despite the pandemic, industry sources said.
Analysts said the solid trade performance could provide a boost to China's broader economic recovery, which has gained steam after suffering from a deep slump earlier this year.
China's economy grew 4.9% in the third-quarter from a year earlier, but growth could slow to just over 2% this year - the weakest in over three decades but still much stronger than other major economies.
""China has a better recovery from the pandemic and has a comparative advantage, so it has gained a larger market,"" said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore.
""Of course, this advantage is also temporary and may last until the end of the year.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in five months in October and more Americans are working part time, the clearest evidence yet that the recovery from the pandemic recession was slowing as fiscal stimulus ends and new COVID-19 cases explode. 
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed 3.6 million people were out of work for more then six months, underscoring the challenges the next president, whether it is incumbent Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Joe Biden, confronts to keep the economy growing as it heals from the deepest recession since the Great Depression.
Biden edged closer to winning the White House early on Friday as he took a narrow lead over Trump in the battleground state of Georgia. Trump on Thursday alleged fraud without providing evidence, filing lawsuits and calling for recounts in a race yet to be decided since polls closed on Tuesday.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 638,000 jobs last month after rising by 672,000 in September. That was the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and left employment 10.1 million below its peak in February. A 271,000 increase in leisure and hospitality jobs accounted for about two-fifths of the payrolls gain last month.
Employment in professional and business services increased by 208,000, with about half of the job gains in temporary help services. Government payrolls fell 268,000, weighed down by the departure of temporary workers hired for the 2020 Census and further job losses at cash-strapped state and local governments.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls advancing by 600,000 jobs in October. 
A contested election reduces the chances of another coronavirus rescue package from the government this year. Even if more fiscal policy is agreed on, it will likely be smaller than had been anticipated before the election. 
That will shift the spotlight to the Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank kept interest rates near zero on Thursday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market had moderated, noting that the recovery would be stronger with more fiscal support.
U.S. stocks took a breather on Friday after surging more than 7% this week. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
LONG BOUTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT
More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief for businesses and workers fueled a historic 33.1% annualized rate of economic growth in the third quarter. That followed a record 31.4% pace of contraction in the April-June quarter. 
Lack of fiscal stimulus and spiraling new coronavirus infections across the country have put the economy on a sharply slower growth path heading into the fourth quarter. Restaurants and gyms have moved outdoors, but cooler weather and the resurgence in COVID-19 infections could leave many in trouble.
Even if states and local governments do not impose new restrictions on businesses, consumers are likely to stay away, fearing exposure to the respiratory illness. The United States set a one-day record for new coronavirus cases on Wednesday with at least 102,591 infections, according to a Reuters tally.
Though small and medium-sized businesses have suffered most from the pandemic, large corporations have not been spared.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) last month announced 1,900 layoffs in the United States. Boeing (NYSE:BA) said it expected to eliminate about 30,000 jobs, 11,000 more than previously planned, by end-2021.
The unemployment rate fell to 6.9% from 7.9% in September. But it continued to be biased down by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" 
Without this recurring mistake, the government said the jobless rate would have been about 7.2% in October. 
While the unemployment rate has dropped from a peak of 14.7% in April, that is not a true reflection of the labor market's health. The number of people out of work for more than six months surged by 1.2 million to 3.6 million in October.
The number of people working part time for economic reasons increased by 383,000 to 6.7 million, reflecting reduced hours because of slack work or business conditions.

At least 21.5 million people were receiving unemployment benefits in mid-October. Many people, mostly women, have dropped out of the labor force to look after children or because they fear contracting the virus.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy created a net 638,000 nonfarm jobs in the month through mid-October, in a stronger-than-expected start to a quarter that looks set to be overshadowed by the spreading Covid-19 pandemic.
Nonfarm payrolls had been expected to rise by 600,000. As such the actual number represents only a modest slowdown in job creation from an upwardly-revised 672,000 in September. 
The unemployment rate fell by a full percentage point to 6.9% of the workforce.
The report is a sign of the labor market's resilience in the face of rising coronavirus cases, all the more so since 147,000 jobs tied to the 2020 census were lost during the month. Most encouragingly, the labor force participation rate rose to 61.7% of the population, having fallen to a four-month low of 61.4% in September. That may alleviate concerns that the improvement in the headline jobless numbers are due above all to people giving up the hunt for work.
U.S. stock futures responded brightly to the numbers, with Dow Jones Futures rising some 0.5% in the 15 minutes after the release.

The property market has defied a general economic downturn since the virus hit as city dwellers looked to move out of urban centers. The government is also fueling demand with a temporary tax break on purchases and by promising more generous loans for young buyers.
Under the new lockdown that took effect this week, house viewings are still allowed and real estate agents remain open for business.
The boom may be short-lived. Rising unemployment and a new lockdown this month will make it harder for transactions to go through. The Bank of England expanded monetary stimulus Thursday as it lowered forecasts for growth.
“While government support measures have undoubtedly helped to delay the expected downturn in the housing market, they will not continue indefinitely,” said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax. “With a number of clear headwinds facing the housing market, we expect to see greater downward pressure on house prices as we move into 2021.”

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output rose by less than expected in September as the coronavirus crisis held back activity, data showed on Friday, suggesting Europe's largest economy may not have the strength of avoid a double dip.
Industrial output increased by 1.6% on the month, figures released by the Federal Statistics Office showed. A Reuters poll had forecast a rise of 2.7%. 
The rise was driven by a rebound in the auto industry, Germany's largest manufacturing sector, which saw output rise by 10.0% in September after a decline of 10.3% in August.
""The manufacturing sector is gradually fighting back,"" the Economy Ministry said in a statement.
""New orders and the business climate suggest that the recovery process will continue, even if this path will become even more rocky in view of the pandemic,"" it added.
The economy grew by a record 8.2% in the third quarter on higher consumer spending and exports, but an aggressive second wave of infections and a new partial lockdown are now clouding the outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond.
A picture is emerging of German industry growing despite the pandemic, while services struggle.
A survey released on Wednesday showed that German services activity shrank for the first time in four months in October, a sign the economy was struggling even before the partial lockdown was imposed.
ING economist Carsten Brzeski expected industry to give the economy momentum going into the fourth quarter, but said new lockdown measures and weaker demand from other euro zone countries meant ""this positive momentum will in our view not be enough to avoid (a) double dip for the German economy"".
Other recent German data have pointed to a fading recovery.
Industrial orders grew less than expected in September as euro zone orders dropped, data showed on Thursday.Business morale fell for the first time in six months in October due to concerns about rising virus infection rates.
The Ifo economic institute said earlier on Friday that production expectations for Germany's industrial sector have weakened somewhat for the coming months, adding that it was unclear what impact lockdown measures would have.
Germany closed bars, restaurants, gyms, cinemas, theatres and domestic tourism on Monday for a month to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

In October, exports are expected to have risen 9.3% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of a Reuters poll of 20 economists, down slightly from the 9.9% gain in September. 
Imports likely rose 9.5% on year, which economists regarded as a solid increase though it would be slower than in September, when imports rebounded 13.2%.
China's trade surplus is expected to have widened to $46 billion in October from $37 billion in September, according to the poll. 
The forecasts could suggest the recovery in the world's second-largest economy from the initial impact of the coronavirus pandemic remains intact.
China's economy is expected to expand around 2% this year - the weakest in over three decades but still much stronger than other major economies as it emerged faster from the coronavirus crisis, having been the first country to be hit by the pandemic. 
The upward momentum was also evident in China's official manufacturing survey for October, as the new export orders sub-index expanded at a quicker pace.
Analysts at Nomura said in a research note that a pause in the re-opening of some overseas economies due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, and a high base last year would have weighed on October's import growth. They also expected less growth in crude oil imports.
Some analysts also noted there were fewer working days last month compared with same period last year due to the long national holiday, which might lead to a slightly softer reading.
And they said China's trade performance could suffer over the next few months as stringent virus control measures are re-imposed by trade partners due to recent resurgence of COVID-19 infections in Europe and the United States.

Some companies reported that second wave in infections abroad had lengthened procurement periods for imports of raw materials and increased transport costs.

Xi told the Communist Party’s Central Committee last week the economy could double in size by 2035, according to state media. That would imply an annual average growth rate of 4.7%-5%, according to a range of forecasts from economists.
Read more: Xi Says Economy Can Double as China Lays Out Ambitious Plans
The Chinese leader was addressing the party’s top decision makers at a closed-door meeting in which they laid out plans for the economy over the next five and 15 years. Officials didn’t disclose a numerical growth goal, although the economic planning agency has said it’s working on five-year targets. Reuters reported that officials are considering a goal of around 5% growth a year.
“Keeping growth above 4.5% for another 15 years is more ambitious for China than many assume,” Capital Economics Ltd. economists, led by Julian Evans-Pritchard, wrote in a note. With the external environment likely to be even more challenging in the coming decade, and returns to capital accumulation diminishing, China would need faster productivity gains, they said.
China is likely to announce more specific targets when the plan is officially adopted by the national parliament, expected in March next year.
Growth Estimates
When the last five-year plan was released in 2015, Xi’s speech to the Central Committee disclosed a growth goal of at least 6.5% over the period. This year, the only hints economists have are his broad ambition of doubling gross domestic product in 15 years and the plan’s mention of raising GDP per capita to the level of a “medium developed country.”

Haibin Zhu, chief China economist at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. in Hong Kong, says the Communist Party’s commentary so far suggests an annual average growth of 4.73% over the next 15 years, which he breaks down as follows: an 8.7% surge next year from a low base in 2020; an average expansion of 5.3% in 2022-2025, 4.5% in 2026-2030 and 3.7% in 2031-2035.
With China’s potential growth gradually slowing as the economy matures, growth of 4.7%-5% may still be too ambitious. The government’s current aim is to double the size of GDP and income by 2020 from the level in 2010, but doubling it again from a bigger base may be harder to achieve.
U.S. Tensions
The nation also faces an aging population, rising wages and a rapid increase in debt, all of which could hurt its growth potential. That’s not even counting a more hostile global environment as rivals like the U.S. seek to curb China’s trade and technology ambitions.
“It is extremely difficult to project growth 15 years out and, although we view growth of 5%-6% over 2021-2025 as likely, growth above 5% over 2026-2035 appears quite challenging,”  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. economists, led by Ting Lu, wrote in a note.
To overcome some of those challenges, the Communist Party is promising to build the nation into a technological powerhouse and focus on quality growth over speed. Key to that objective is developing a robust domestic market and becoming self-reliant in technology -- especially in chips, the building blocks for innovations from artificial intelligence to fifth-generation networking and autonomous vehicles.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
The five-year plan “outlined a range of areas that need to be tackled to achieve higher-quality development, from strengthening the economic structure with a higher-end industrial base to raising household incomes, environmental standards, education levels and the quality of public services.”
“These would move China’s economy in the right direction. The key, as always, will be effective execution and enforcement.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending slumped in September from a year earlier and real wages slid for the seventh straight month, data showed on Friday, a sign sluggish domestic demand will continue to drag on any recovery in the world's third-largest economy.
The data underscores the challenge authorities face in balancing the need to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and reviving economic activity.
Household spending fell 10.2% in September from a year earlier, marking the fourth biggest drop on record and roughly matching a median market forecast for a 10.7% fall, government data showed. It followed a 6.9% drop in August.
Providing some optimism, however, spending rose 3.8% from the previous month, suggesting households were gradually adjusting to life under the pandemic.
""Spending on services recovered in September as people appear to have become used to dealing with COVID-19,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi life Research Institute.
""We expect consumer spending to pick up gradually, though a possible resurgence in infections is a risk,"" he said.
The year-on-year decline was partly driven by the high base effect from September last year, when consumers rushed to buy goods to beat a sales tax hike in October 2019.
Spending on services continued to fall, though the pace of decline slowed from August for some items such as travel and transportation fees, the data showed.
In a sign sliding income could dent consumption, however, real wages - a key barometer of households' purchasing power - declined 1.1% in September from a year earlier.
Overtime pay and bonuses slumped in September as companies slashed costs to weather the hit to profits from COVID-19.
Japan's economy is bottoming out after suffering its worst postwar slump in April-June, thanks in part to a rebound in exports and output. But weak consumption and capital spending is likely to keep any economic recovery modest, analysts say.
With the Bank of Japan left with little ammunition to spur growth, the onus is on the government to deploy more fiscal stimulus to cushion the blow from the pandemic, they say.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is expected to announce this month a plan for fresh stimulus to help the economy shake off the crisis, sources have told Reuters.

""Overcoming this coronavirus crisis and reviving Japan's economy remain our top priority,"" he told parliament on Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell only slightly last week, adding to signs that the economic recovery was losing steam as the COVID-19 pandemic intensifies and fiscal stimulus ends.
The economy could be plunged into a period of uncertainty following Tuesday's presidential election, potentially undermining business investment and delaying a much-needed second coronavirus relief package from the government. 
Democrat Joe Biden edged closer to victory on Thursday, while President Donald Trump alleged fraud without providing evidence, filing lawsuits and calling for recounts in a race yet to be decided two days after polls closed.
""It looks like a second wave of layoffs is hitting the economy perhaps due to the rising count of virus cases, but it could also mean that many businesses are unable to reopen fully and facing bankruptcy, so they have to let their workers go,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 751,000 for the week ended Oct. 31, the Labor Department said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 7,000 more applications received than previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 732,000 applications in the latest week. Claims remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though they have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March. 
The weekly unemployment claims report, the most timely data on the economy's health, followed on the heels of reports on Wednesday showing private payrolls increasing less than expected in October and activity in the services industry cooling.
With a swift fiscal package unlikely as politics take center-stage, the focus will shift to the Federal Reserve to pump more money into the economy. The U.S. central bank maintained its ultra easy monetary policy stance on Thursday and pledged again to do whatever it can in coming months to sustain the recovery.
Unadjusted claims edged down 543 to 738,166 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted number given earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations because of the economic shock caused by the pandemic. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.1 million people filed claims last week.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as investors bet on a Republican-held Senate that would block any moves by a Biden administration to tighten regulation and raise taxes. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.

More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief for businesses and workers fueled a historic 33.1% annualized rate of economic growth in the third quarter. That followed a record 31.4% pace of contraction in the April-June quarter. 
Lack of fiscal stimulus and spiraling new coronavirus infections across the country have put the economy on a sharply slower growth path heading into the fourth quarter. Restaurants and gyms have moved outdoors, but cooler weather and the explosion of COVID-19 cases could leave many in trouble.
The services industry, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, has been hardest hit by the pandemic, making it difficult to recoup all the 22.2 million jobs lost during the crisis. 
The government's closely watched employment report on Friday is expected to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 600,000 jobs in October after rising 661,000 in September, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would leave employment 10.1 million jobs below its peak in February. 
Though the claims report showed a decline in the number of people on unemployment rolls in late October, that was partly because many people have exhausted their six months of benefits.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 538,000 to 7.285 million in the week ending Oct. 24. A total 3.961 million filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Oct. 17. At least 21.5 million people were receiving unemployment benefits in mid-October.
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 4.9% annualized rate last quarter. Productivity surged at a 10.6% rate in the second quarter, the fastest since the first quarter of 1971. It rose at a 4.1% rate compared to the third quarter of 2019. 
Though productivity was likely distorted by the pandemic, the two straight quarters of strong gains mirror a pattern seen during the 2007-09 recession when the recovery was not accompanied by strong employment growth.
The economy has recouped two-thirds of output lost during the COVID-19 pandemic, while just over half of the jobs that disappeared have been recovered. 

""Though we are on track for GDP next year to recoup all of the drop during the recession, the labor market will take longer,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

Investing.com -- The number of Americans filing initial claims for state jobless benefits last week fell by less than expected to 751,000, in a further sign of the pressure on the labor market as a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections hits the U.S. economy.
Economists had expected a drop to 732,000. Last week's figure was revised upwards by a little under 1% to 758,000, according to Labor Department data released on Thursday.
The number of continuing claims fell by some 560,000 to 7.285 million, also a little higher than forecast.
The initial claims figure is still close to its lowest since late March, when the first wave of layoffs related to Covid-19 lockdowns struck the U.S. economy. However, it's still over three times the rate that claims had run at before the pandemic, and points to ongoing high levels of layoffs, even at the end of the summer in which the economy had recovered strongly from its initial setback.
The total number of people claiming benefits in all programs for the week ending October 17 was 21.508 million, a decrease of 1.15 million from the previous week. While some of that reflects rehiring across the economy, it also reflects an increasing number of people who have lost eligibility for benefits under certain programs, or who have simply left the workforce.
The numbers come against a backdrop of growing evidence that the economy is starting to lose momentum again as the pandemic regains strength at the start of winter. On Wednesday, payrolls processor ADP estimated that only a net 365,000 people found private-sector jobs in the month to October 17, barely half the previous month's job gains. 
""People are cutting their social interactions, hurting the leisure and hospitality sectors quite badly. This is not going to get better anytime soon,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note after the ADP report.
The official U.S. government labor market report for October is due out on Friday at 8:30 AM ET. "

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's construction sector lost momentum in October but suffered less than the most of the coronavirus-hit economy thanks to a buoyant housing market, a business survey showed on Thursday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index for the construction sector dropped to 53.1 in October from September's 56.8, a bigger drop than the decline to 55.0 which economists had forecast in a Reuters poll, and its lowest since May.
However, unlike figures released on Wednesday for the much larger services sector, the gauge remained well above the 50 level which separates growth from contraction.
""The construction sector was a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy month for the UK economy during October,"" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.
House-building was the biggest contributor to growth, reflecting a boom in demand since the end of lockdown, helped by a temporary cut in property taxes which has seen lenders approve the highest number of mortgages since 2007.
New orders in the sector, which makes up about 6% of Britain's economy, rose by the most in five years.
The construction industry is also exempt from the four-week lockdown which started in England on Thursday -- although firms last month were concerned about the potential knock-on effects on demand from rising COVID-19 cases.
""Survey respondents widely commented on renewed economic uncertainty and concerns about the sustainability of the recovery as pent-up demand begins to wane,"" Moore said.

The civil engineering sector continued to report steep declines in activity, while growth in commercial activity was fairly muted.

Industrial orders rose 0.5% in September, less than the 2% analysts had expected, partly because bookings from other members of euro zone fell by 6%, offsetting expansion in both Germany and the rest of the world.
A purchasing managers' survey from earlier this week showed that though manufacturing in the euro zone was booming, it was almost entirely driven by Germany's recovery, highlighting the economic behemoth's vulnerability to its neighbours' economic weakness.
Growth slowed from the previous month, when orders were up a revised 4.9% as the economy recovered from the earlier lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the pandemic.
In September, domestic orders rose 2.3% on the month and those from the rest of the world by 2.7%.
""After a first strong recovery following the lockdown in April, industry continues to fight its way out of the crisis,"" the Economy Ministry said, hailing the data - which showed the fifth expansion in a row - as a positive signal.
Orders were up a full 29.1% in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter, the ministry said. Domestic demand rose 15.5%, euro zone demand 41.0% and demand from the rest of the world 40.4%.

Last week, data showed the German economy grew by a record 8.2% in the third quarter as higher consumer spending and exports helped it recover partly from its worst-ever recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased less than expected in October and activity in the services industry cooled, providing early signs of a slowdown in economic growth as fiscal stimulus diminishes and new COVID-19 infections surge across the country.
The recovery from the coronavirus pandemic could also be impacted over the next few months by political uncertainty following Tuesday's cliffhanger presidential election, which economists warned could cause businesses to be more cautious about spending decisions. 
The election hung in the balance on Wednesday, with a handful of close-fought states set to decide the outcome in the coming hours or days. There are fears of a contested result between President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden, who both still have possible paths to reach the needed 270 Electoral College votes to win the White House.
""This is not a good outcome for the economy since the headwinds from rising Covid cases, troubled state and local government finances and falling incomes as unemployment benefits expire, are growing in strength,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. 
""Animosity and the threat of legal challenges argues against a swift fiscal support package which will be a concern as activity becomes increasingly constrained.""
Private payrolls increased by 365,000 jobs last month after rising 753,000 in September, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would advance by 650,000 in October.
Job gains last month were broad, though they were concentrated in industries directly impacted by the coronavirus crisis, including the leisure and hospitality sector. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases across the country could lead to renewed business restrictions to slow the spread of the respiratory illness as winter approaches. 
Even without new restrictions, Americans are likely to stay away from air travel, hotels, gyms, bars, restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses, worsening already lackluster demand, which has seen the labor market struggling to recoup all the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. Though it has fallen short of the government's private payrolls count since May because of methodology differences, it is still watched for clues on the labor market's health.
It was released ahead of the government's closely watched, and comprehensive, monthly employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, private nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 700,000 jobs in October after rising 877,000 in September. 
With government payrolls expected to have dropped again last month as more temporary workers hired for the Census departed and state and local governments struggle with tight budgets, overall nonfarm payrolls are forecast increasing by 600,000 jobs after rising 661,000 in September. That would leave employment 10.1 million jobs below its peak in February.

Surprisingly, U.S. financial markets were mostly higher despite the political uncertainty. Stocks on Wall Street rose. U.S. Treasury prices were higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. 
""My sense is traders and investors are increasingly comfortable Republicans will hold the Senate and Democrats will hold the House,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""From a markets standpoint, that means whoever emerges with White House control, Trump or Biden, will not be able to do much.""
A survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Wednesday showed its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 56.6 in October from 57.8 in September, falling back below its 57.3 level in February. 
The survey's measure of services industry employment slipped to 50.1 from a reading of 51.8 in September, consistent with views that the labor market was stalling after being boosted by more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief for businesses and workers, which is now gone.
That is consistent with analysts' expectations for a step-down in economic growth in the fourth quarter after a historic 33.1% annualized rate of expansion in the third quarter. The economy contracted at a record 31.4% pace in the April-June quarter.
A third report from the Commerce Department showed the trade deficit fell 4.7% to $63.9 billion in September as food exports jumped to the highest level since July 2012, boosted by shipments of soybeans. Economists had forecast the trade shortfall narrowing to $63.8 billion in September.
Goods exports rose 3.1% to $122.8 billion, also lifted by telecommunications equipment, industrial engines and computer accessories. Exports to China were the highest since March 2018. New COVID-19 lockdowns in Europe could curb export gains.
Goods imports climbed 0.3% to $203.5 billion, the highest level since December 2019. Food imports were the highest on record in September. The nation also imported more capital goods, automotive vehicles, parts and engines. 

Imports from China were the highest since July 2019. The United States imported 157.9 million barrels of crude oil in September, the fewest since February 1992.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain looks on course to enter a double-dip recession this winter, as business surveys show economic growth almost halted last month even before the latest England-wide lockdown was announced, financial data company IHS Markit said.
The IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a four-month low of 51.4 in October from 56.1 in September, closer to the 50 mark that represents zero growth than an initial reading of 52.3.
The composite PMI, which includes stronger manufacturing data released on Monday, sank to 52.1 from 56.5, also weaker than the initial 'flash' estimate.
""October data indicates that the UK service sector was close to stalling even before the announcement of lockdown 2 in England,"" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.
""The UK economy seems on course for a double-dip recession this winter and a far more challenging path to recovery in 2021,"" he added.
The new orders component in the services PMI fell sharply, and businesses shed jobs for the eighth month in a row.
From Thursday all non-essential shops, pubs and restaurants in England will close for four weeks, except where they serve takeaway food.
The restrictions are less wide-ranging than in March and April, but some economists have predicted output in November will fall by as much as 10%, reducing output for the fourth quarter by around 3%.
British gross domestic product slumped by 20% during the longer lockdown in the second quarter of 2020, the biggest decline of any major advanced economy.
The Bank of England looks set to launch another round of bond purchases on Thursday and downgrade its economic forecasts from those it gave in August, when it predicted GDP would be back to pre-crisis levels by the end of 2021.

Since then, COVID-19 cases have risen sharply in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, and Britain's government fears hospitals will be overwhelmed if it cannot slow the disease's spread.

Alongside their peers, Germany and France -- the 19-country bloc's two biggest economies -- have reimposed tough lockdown measures, likely dealing a heavy blow this month as restaurants, gyms and shops remain closed and citizens stay at home.
""With lockdown measures being tightened, it is becoming increasingly hard to see how the euro zone economy will avoid falling back into decline,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at survey compiler IHS Markit. 
""For all countries the outlook has grown increasingly dark.""
The euro zone economy contracted 11.8% in the second quarter but expanded a much-better-than-expected 12.7% in July-September after many lockdown restrictions were eased, official data showed on Friday.
But rising coronavirus cases pose a serious risk to the bloc's recovery, a Reuters poll said last month, and IHS Markit's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good gauge of economic health, dropped to 50.0 last month from September's 50.4, although above a preliminary reading of 49.4. [ECILT/EU]
That was bang on the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction and was dragged down by the services PMI which fell to 46.9 from 48.0, its lowest since May when the first wave of the virus was sweeping across Europe.
""Service providers have been hit especially hard, led by intensifying weakness in consumer-facing sectors such as hospitality, offsetting the brighter news seen in manufacturing during the month,"" Williamson said. [EU/PMIM]
The IHS Markit survey was conducted largely before many of the new restrictions were put in place across Europe but forward-looking indicators were already bleak.
Services firms cut headcount for an eighth month, demand dropped further, backlogs of work were again depleted and optimism waned. The business expectations index sank to 54.2 from 59.2, and it has mostly only ever been lower this year and during the last two financial crises.
To offer support, the European Central Bank committed last week to take new action in December to contain the growing fallout, having already pumped in unprecedented stimulus.
The Bank's policy mandate is to have inflation just below 2% but it registered -0.3% in October, official flash data showed, so policymakers are likely to be disappointed to see firms cutting prices to drum up demand.

Despite input costs rising sharply, the composite output prices index was firmly below breakeven at 49.2, albeit above September's 47.8.

IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.5 from 50.6 in the previous month.
The reading, published on Wednesday, came in higher than a flash estimate of 48.9 but still marked the first month since June that the services index was below the 50 mark dividing growth from contraction.
The biggest drops were reported by hotels and restaurants, which were hit by travel curbs and local curfews in October. Transportation and storage providers also registered weaker activity.
""As many businesses close their doors again during November and virus cases continue to rise, a double dip in economic activity is looking increasingly likely,"" IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said.
Germany entered a partial lockdown on Monday at least until the end of November, forcing bars, restaurants, gyms, cinemas, theatres and domestic tourism to close. Shops can remain open under conditions to guarantee social distancing.
But the drop in services activity was offset, by robust growth in manufacturing in October and the final composite PMI, which covers both sectors of the economy, rose to 55.0 from 54.7 in September. That was higher than the flash figure of 54.5.
The German economy grew by a record 8.2% in the third quarter as higher consumer spending and exports helped Europe's largest economy start to recover from its worst-ever recession, caused by the pandemic.

Economists expect the economy to stagnate or even shrink again in the fourth quarter, however, due to the new lockdown measures.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 47.5 from 48.5 in September, marginally better than a preliminary reading of 47.3.
The index dropped further away from the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction to hit its lowest level since May, when France emerged from a first lockdown to contain the coronavirus outbreak.
""The results point to a worrying trend for business activity, showing that the recent surge in infections and the introduction of new restrictions have already negatively impacted the economy,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.
""Moving through the winter months, the downward trajectory is likely to persist, particularly as declines at service providers begin to spill over onto their manufacturing counterparts,"" he added.
In October, a government curfew aimed at halting a resurgence of new COVID-19 cases met with little success, leading to a new nationwide lockdown last week.
In the face of the new restrictions, the PMI index for the dominant service sector fell to 46.5 from 47.5 in September, unchanged from a preliminary reading.

The weakness offset an improvement in the manufacturing sector, which remained in expansionary mode, according to already published data.

Investing.com – China’s services sector saw a sixth consecutive month of growth in October, with hiring seeing its highest level in a year but overseas demand dropping.
The Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) grew to 56.8 in October, higher than the previous month’s 54.8 reading and above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. The Caixin manufacturing PMI for October, released earlier in the week, rose to 53.6. The manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs, released on Saturday, rose to 51.4 and 56.2 respectively.
Accounting for around 60% of the world’s second largest economy and half of urban jobs, the services sector had trailed behind the manufacturing sector in recovering from the impact of the nationwide COVID-19 lockdowns imposed earlier in the year. Although domestic demand boosted the service sector recovery, which has quickened in the past months, new export business received by Chinese services firms slipped further into contraction in October, the fastest rate since July.
European countries, such as France, Germany and the U.K. have recently re-imposed lockdowns to curb a second wave of COVID-19 cases in Europe and the U.S.
""The second wave of COVID-19 infections in Europe and the third wave in the U.S. have significantly suppressed China's overseas demand,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in comments released alongside the survey.
However, hiring by Chinese firms rose for the third consecutive month and at the fastest pace since September 2019, hinting at the labor market’s continuing recovery from the COVID-19 impact.
Although the sector’s rebound was boosted by recovering pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure expansion and buoyant exports, there were warnings of a dimming global outlook as the fight against COVID-19 continues.
""In the coming months, a continued recovery of the Chinese economy is highly likely, but it is necessary to be cautious about the normalization of monetary and fiscal policies in the post-epidemic period,"" Wang added.
China reported a weaker-than-expected GDP of 4.9% in the third quarter year-on-year in October, and GDP for the full year is projected to grow around 2%, the weakest in three decades."

Quarterly retail volumes advanced 6.5% in the three months through September, after declining 3.5% in the prior quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday. Growth was partly offset by a 4.2% decline in Victoria state, which remained under lockdown in the quarter, while sales in New South Wales soared 11.6%, leading gains in all states and territories.
“The quarterly rise was driven by a recovery in industries that saw sharp falls in the June quarter 2020, as well as continued strength in industries such as food retailing, other retailing and household goods,” said Ben James, director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys at the ABS.
Australia’s economy is showing signs of strengthening as consumer confidence surges, with optimists now exceeding pessimists, job advertisements advancing and house prices rising for the first time in six months. The recovery will receive a boost from the Reserve Bank of Australia‘s new round of stimulus.
The RBA on Tuesday cut its key interest rate, its three-year bond yield target and a bank lending facility rate, all to 0.10% from 0.25%. It also announced a A$100 billion ($71.5 billion) quantitative easing program to spur hiring and investment. At the same time, the central bank said it was upgrading its near-term economic outlook.
“The recent household spending and employment data have been a little stronger than we were expecting,” RBA chief Philip Lowe said in a speech Tuesday.
“It now appears probable that GDP increased solidly in the September quarter despite the lockdown in Victoria,” he said. “And growth over the year to June 2021 is expected to be close to 6%, compared with an expectation of 4% growth when we reviewed our forecasts three months ago.”
Wednesday’s quarterly sales release removes the impact of prices and provides a gauge of the household consumption component of gross domestic product, which accounts for more than half of activity.
The seeming contradiction in delivering more stimulus despite the better economic outlook is explained by expectations that unemployment will remain elevated for an extended period. A separate ABS report Wednesday showed payrolls fell 0.8% in the two weeks to Oct. 17.
On a monthly basis, retail sales slid 1.1% in September, compared with economists’ forecasts for a 1.5% drop.

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 56.8 from September's 54.8, the highest reading since June and staying well above the 50-mark that separates monthly growth from contraction.
The services sector, which accounts for about 60% of the economy and half of urban jobs, had initially been slower to return to growth than large manufacturers, but the recovery has gathered pace in recent months.
Domestic demand drove activity, with the survey showing new export business received by Chinese services firms slipping further into contraction in October, at the fastest rate since July.
""The second wave of coronavirus infections in Europe and the third wave in the U.S. have significantly suppressed China's overseas demand,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in comments released alongside the survey.
But firms hired more for the third month in a row and at the fastest pace since September 2019, indicating a strengthening recovery in a labour market hit hard earlier in the year by measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus. 
Service firms were highly optimistic about business prospects, with a sub-index for confidence in the year rising to the strongest level since 2012. 
The official PMI showed activity in China's services sector expanded at the fastest pace since 2013 in October.
Pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure expansion and surprisingly resilient exports have propelled China's rebound, though the global outlook is dimming as many Western countries battle renewed surges in the virus that causes COVID-19, with some going back into virus lockdowns.
""In the coming months, a continued recovery of the Chinese economy is highly likely, but it is necessary to be cautious about the normalisation of monetary and fiscal policies in the post-epidemic period,"" Wang said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods increased solidly in September, but further gains could be limited amid an anticipated slowdown in consumer spending as government money for businesses and workers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic runs out. 
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that factory orders rose 1.1% after climbing 0.6% in August. Orders were boosted by increased demand for primary metals, computers and electronic products as well as motor vehicles and fabricated metal products. But orders for machinery, furniture and electrical equipment, appliances and components fell.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would rise 1.0% in September.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of U.S. economic activity, has been boosted by a shift in spending from services toward goods as Americans set up home offices and remote classrooms and avoid public transportation because of the coronavirus. 
A survey on Monday from the Institute for Supply Management on Monday showed its measure of national factory activity raced to its highest level in nearly two years in October, with new orders surging to their highest level in almost 17 years. 
But the strong manufacturing sentiment likely overstates the health of the sector. A report from the Federal Reserve last month showed production at factories dropped 0.3% in September and remained 6.4% below its pre-pandemic level.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as investors bet Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden would beat President Donald Trump in Tuesday's bitterly contested election. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief juiced economic growth last quarter, with nearly all segments rebounding strongly, with the exception of government spending and business investment in intellectual property products and nonresidential structures like gas and oil well drilling.
The economy grew at a historic 33.1% annualized rate in the July-September period. That followed a record 31.4% pace of contraction in the second quarter. Output remains 3.5% below its level at the end of 2019. There is no deal in sight for another round of fiscal stimulus. 
Unfilled orders at factories fell 0.2% in September after declining 0.6% in August. Inventories at factories were unchanged for a second straight month, while shipments of manufactured goods rose 0.3%.
The government also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 1.0% in September, as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, rose 0.5%. They were previously reported to have gained 0.3%.

Business spending on equipment rebounded at a 70.1% rate in the third quarter, ending five straight quarters of decline.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity accelerated more than expected in October, with new orders jumping to their highest level in nearly 17 years amid a shift in spending toward goods like motor vehicles and food as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on.
The survey on Monday from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) was the last piece of major economic data before Tuesday's bitterly contested presidential election. But the outlook for manufacturing is challenging.
While the coronavirus crisis has boosted demand for goods complementing the pandemic life, a resurgence in new cases across the country could lead to authorities re-imposing restrictions to slow the spread of the respiratory illness as winter approaches, which could crimp activity. Government money for businesses and workers hit by the pandemic, which boosted economic growth in the third quarter, has dried up. 
""Manufacturing rebounded strongly with fewer restrictions on economic activity and stimulus efforts, but the path forward will be more difficult as the economy continues to cope with the pandemic,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
The ISM said its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 59.3 last month. That was the highest since November 2018 and followed a reading of 55.4 in September. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 55.8 in October.
The jump in activity, however, likely overstates the health of the manufacturing sector. A report from the Federal Reserve last month showed output at factories dropping 0.3% in September and remaining 6.4% below its pre-pandemic level.
Manufacturers and suppliers said last month they ""continue to operate in reconfigured factories"" and with every month were ""becoming more proficient at expanding output."" 
Though sentiment among manufacturers remained upbeat, there were two positive comments for every cautious comment, a slight decrease compared to September. 
The outcome of Tuesday's vote is expected to lead to a brief period of uncertainty. President Donald Trump is trailing former Vice President and Democratic Party candidate, Joe Biden, in national opinion polls.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher following their steepest weekly loss. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

NEW ORDERS SURGE 
Fifteen industries, including apparel, food, furniture and transportation equipment reported growth last month. Textile mills and printing reported a contraction. 
Manufacturing's continued recovery will likely keep the economy floating, with growth expected to slow sharply in the fourth quarter after a historic 33.1% annualized rate of expansion in the July-September period. 
Growth last quarter, which followed a record 31.4% pace of contraction in the April-June quarter, was juiced up by more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief. There is no deal in sight for another round of fiscal stimulus.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending rose a moderate 0.3% in September, slowing after a 0.8% increase in August. [

The coronavirus crisis has pulled spending away from services towards goods that complement the changed life-style. Spending on goods has surpassed its pre-pandemic level.
Makers of chemical products reported ""business continues to be robust."" Food manufacturers said they had ""increased production due to stores stocking up for the second wave of COVID-19."" Manufacturers of computer and electronic products said the coronavirus continued ""to have an effect on supplier support and operations, more from a decreased labor perspective rather than unavailable material.""
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index surged to a reading of 67.9 last month, the highest reading since January 2004, from 60.2 in September. Customers' inventories remained too low for the 49th straight month and order backlogs steadily increased, which bodes well for future production.
""On the upside, social distancing efforts, which have been a factor in consumers pivoting spending away from services and toward goods, is showing no signs of abating, especially as virus case counts are surging again,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""This shift to goods spending should continue to underpin orders, but is unlikely to go on with the same muster as it did earlier when an initial flurry of spending on manufactured goods aimed at setting up at-home offices and remote classrooms boosted goods spending.""
With orders booming, manufacturing employment expanded for the first time since July 2019. The ISM's manufacturing employment gauge rose to a reading of 53.2 from 49.6 in September. That likely supported overall job growth in October.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 700,000 jobs last month after rising 661,000 in September. Employment growth has cooled from a record 4.781 million in June. About 11.5 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic have been recovered. 
The government is scheduled to publish October's employment report on Friday.

IHS Markit's Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose to 58.2 in October, the highest reading since February 2018.
This was higher than a flash reading of 58.0 and surpassed September's 56.4 mark.
Phil Smith, principle economist at IHS Markit, said the recovery was being clouded by rising COVID-19 cases in Europe.
""Less positively and perhaps a sign that growth could be about to slow as more firms get back to pre-COVID levels of output, we saw the first setback to manufacturing expectations for seven months in October,"" said Smith.
""It comes amid rising numbers of coronavirus cases in Europe, and the increased threat of renewed disruption to supply and demand that comes with it,"" he added.
Chancellor Angela Merkel last week announced an emergency month-long lockdown that includes the closure of restaurants, gyms and theatres to reverse a spike in coronavirus cases that risks overwhelming hospitals.

The measure went into effect on Monday and include limiting private gatherings to 10 people from a maximum of two households. Restaurants, bars, theatres, cinemas, pools and gyms will be shut and concerts cancelled. Schools and daycare centres remain open as well as shops under strict conditions.

Investing.com – China continued to see factory activity growth on its path towards economic recovery from COVID-19, but the pace of the growth slowed slightly in October.
The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for October rose to 53.6, beating the predicted 53 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and September’s reading of 53, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released earlier in the day.
The data follows the growth reported in Saturday’s manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs, which rose to 51.4 and 56.2 respectively. Although the manufacturing PMI was slightly down from September’s reading of 51.5, it beat the forecast 51.3 figure. The composite PMI also grew 55.3%, more than the forecast 55.1%.
The positive data, particularly for new export orders (which rose to 51.0, improving from September’s 50.8), is a good indication that the trade figures will also be strong, China Everbright (OTC:CHFFF) Bank analyst Zhou Maohua said in a note. However, the spread of COVID-19 outside China could increase uncertainties for Chinese exports over the next few months, he added.
With Europe and the U.S. battling a second wave of COVID-19 cases, and the U.K. becoming the latest country to re-introduce lockdowns after France and Germany, the dim global outlook could well impact China’s own economic recovery.
Although pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure expansion, and a surprising resilience in exports continue to drive the country’s economic recovery after a COVID-19-induced lockdown earlier in the year, the data showed that smaller firms slipped back into contraction at 49.4 from September’s 50.1 and unemployment continues to hamper the recovery. Employment fell to 49.3 in October from September’s 49.6.
However, some investors remained positive.
“The manufacturing industry overall continues to pick up,” said NBS official Zhao Qinghe, while also noting that small companies face weak market demand.
Some companies reported that the resurgence of the epidemic overseas had lengthened procurement periods for imports of raw materials and increased transport costs, he added in a NBS statement released with the data.
China also continues to deal with re-emerging clusters of the COVID1-19 virus in the country, but the number of cases remain low and daily life in the country is returning to normal.
Investors now await the Caixin services PMI and trade data, including imports and exports, due later in the week."

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) rose to 53.6 from September's 53.0, with the gauge staying above the 50-level that separates growth from contraction for the sixth consecutive month.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the headline reading would remain steady at 53.0.
China's vast industrial sector is steadily returning to the levels seen before the pandemic paralysed huge swathes of the economy early this year, though the global outlook is dimming as many Western countries battle still rising COVID-19 infections and go back into virus lockdowns.
October's PMI reading was the highest since January 2011. 
Pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure and surprisingly resilient exports have propelled the manufacturing rebound. Consumption, although hit hard earlier in the year, has also recovered in the third quarter.
""Recovery was the word in the current macro economy, with the domestic epidemic under control. Manufacturing supply and demand improved at the same time,"" Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, wrote in a note accompanying the survey release.
While the Caixin survey showed total new orders surged to the highest level since 2010, the gauge for new export orders fell from the month before, though it remained in expansionary territory. 
""The second wave of coronavirus infections in Europe and the third wave in the U.S. have significantly suppressed China’s overseas demand,"" Wang said.
The private survey also showed Chinese factories hired workers for the second month in a row, though the increase was slight.
Factory output also rose slightly from the month before, while a gauge of business confidence rose to a multi-year high.
The pandemic has been largely controlled in the world'ssecond-largest economy, although a local outbreak emerged recently in the western region of Xinjiang.
The Caixin survey focuses more on small and export-oriented firms while China's official survey, which was released on Saturday, largely tracks large companies and state-owned enterprises.
The official gauge showed factory activity expanded at a slightly slower pace in October but it was slightly above analysts' expectations.
""There are still many uncertainties outside of China, so policymakers need to be cautious about normalizing post-coronavirus monetary and fiscal policies,"" said Wang.

Analysts expect China's economy to grow about 2% in 2020, the weakest since 1976 but still far stronger than other major economies.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports slipped back into contraction in October, as the Chuseok holiday cut working days, although chip and car sales remained robust, government data showed on Sunday.
Exports slid 3.6% from a year earlier to $44.98 billion, after a 7.6% jump in September - the first expansion since February and the fastest rise in 23 months.
The October decline was less than the 4.0% drop forecast by 15 economists in a Reuters survey.
Average daily exports, however, recorded the first expansion in nine months with a 5.6% rise, adding to recent signs that Asia's fourth-largest economy is seeing a moderate recovery.
South Korea's monthly trade data, the first to be released among major exporting economies, is considered a bellwether for global trade.
A ""negative reading was inevitable due to fewer working days, but the rate of decline was better than expected. ... That shows exports recovery has been resilient at least by October,"" said HI Investment & Securities' chief economist Park Sang-hyun.
The trade ministry said shipments of semiconductors and cars jumped 10.4% and 5.8%, respectively, but those surged 20.9% and 15.9% each in average daily terms.
Shipments to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, dropped 5.7% due to its eight-day National Day holiday, but that rose 3.2% when eliminating calendar effect, the trade ministry said.
Those to the United States and European Union rose 3.3% and 9.5%, but surged 13.1% and 19.9%, respectively, in per-day terms.
Economists are now worried surging coronavirus cases globally and fresh lockdowns in Europe may hurt overseas demand for South Korean goods again.
Given the time lag in export orders, ""shipments to the EU in December-January is the biggest worrisome,"" Park said. ""But exports to China will likely rebound and may offset the sluggish sales to EU.""
October imports fell 5.8%, reversing the previous month's 1.6% rise. This led to a preliminary trade surplus of $5.98 billion, smaller than $8.70 billion in September.

Analysts had expected a 2.1% drop in imports.

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed overall new orders remained steady at 52.8, while new export orders rose to 51.0, improving from 50.8 a month earlier.
But smaller firms continued to struggle. A sub-index for those companies stood at 49.4 in October, slipping back into contraction from September's 50.1.
Companies also shed jobs for a sixth month in a row, and at a faster pace. A sub-index for employment fell to 49.3 from September's 49.6.

China's economy grew a weaker-than-expected 4.9% in the third quarter year-on-year. It is expected to expand around 2% for the full year - the weakest in over three decades but still much stronger than other major economies.
The pandemic has been largely controlled in China, with daily life in much of the country returning to normal, although an outbreak emerged recently in the western region of Xinjiang.

A sister survey on the services sector showed activity expanded for the eighth straight month, hitting the highest level since October 2013, as the removal of restrictions on public gatherings and movement bolstered consumer demand.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy grew 12.0% during the third quarter, largely as expected, making up for much of the record contraction over the previous three months at the height of the coronavirus lockdown, preliminary data showed on Friday.
The seasonally-adjusted jump in gross domestic product (GDP) published by national statistics agency INEGI was fractionally better than the 11.9% expansion predicted by a Reuters poll.
The quarter-on-quarter increase was easily the biggest since current records began at the start of the 1980s, and benefited from massive stimulus spending in the United States.
U.S. demand helped Mexico rack up large trade surpluses during the past four months, as exports picked up speed, especially in the automotive industry. By contrast, domestic demand has lagged, with many businesses still struggling.
Alfredo Coutino, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, said Mexico was still heavily reliant on the U.S. economy, and forecast the recovery would slow in the months ahead.
""The Mexican economy is benefiting from the upturn in the U.S. business cycle, mainly through the U.S. demand for Mexican exports and remittances sent by Mexican migrants working in the U.S.,"" Coutino said in a research note.
Between April and June, at the peak of Mexico's pandemic lockdown, the economy shrank 17.1% from the first quarter.
Mexico has not recovered as quickly as the U.S. economy, which shrank by an annualized rate of 31.4% in the second quarter then jumped by 33.1% in the July-September period.
COMEBACK
Despite the economic chaos of the pandemic, remittances to Mexico have surged this year, and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has forecast they will reach a record $40 billion.
During a regular news conference, Lopez Obrador hailed the GDP figures as evidence the economy was bouncing back.
A breakdown of the data showed primary activities like farming, forestry and fishing advanced by 7.4% compared with the previous quarter. Secondary activities such as manufacturing increased by 22.0%, INEGI said. Meanwhile tertiary activities, which encompass consumer spending and services, climbed 8.6%.
Lopez Obrador was eager to point out that the primary sector, which he has pushed with schemes to boost farming and tree planting, is doing better now than it was a year ago.
Mexico's economy is forecast to shrink almost 10% in 2020, its deepest annual contraction since the Great Depression.
However, primary activities, which make up only a small part of the economy, were up 2.7% in the first nine months of this year compared with the same period in 2019, INEGI said.
The severest months for the Mexican economy were April and May, when much of business activity ground to a halt, leading to the loss of roughly one million formal jobs. By Oct. 28, more than 400,000 jobs had been recovered, Lopez Obrador said.
Compared with the same period last year, Latin America's no. 2 economy shrank by 8.6% in unadjusted terms in the third quarter, just less than the Reuters forecast of 8.7%.

Final third quarter data is due to be published on Nov. 26.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose more than expected in September, but decreasing benefits for millions of unemployed Americans, cooling temperatures and a resurgence in COVID-19 cases across the nation could crimp spending in the fourth quarter.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed inflation remaining muted last month, which could allow the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates near zero for a while to aid the recovery from the COVID-19 recession as fiscal stimulus runs out. More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief, which included a weekly unemployment benefits subsidy, spurred record economic growth in the third quarter.
""This recovery could be at risk without additional stimulus, as households with unemployed workers find themselves stretched financially heading into the holiday shopping season,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Personal income and consumer spending could also take a big hit if the pandemic continues to spread and states re-impose restrictions on economic activity in response.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 1.4% last month after gaining 1% in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending rising 1% in September.
Consumers boosted purchases of goods like new motor vehicles, clothing and footwear. They also lifted spending on healthcare, membership clubs, as well as outlays at sports centers, parks, theaters and museums. Still, consumer spending remains below its level at the start of the year, held back by outlays on services like air travel and hotel accommodation.
Spending has shifted towards goods, indicating the services-driven economy's recovery from the recession, which started in February, would be slower than previous downturns. 
Consumer sentiment was little changed at the end of October from earlier in the month amid fears over rising COVID-19 cases, other data showed on Friday.
U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar dipped versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
DROPPED THE BALL
The spending data was included in Thursday's advance gross domestic product report for the third quarter, which showed the economy rebounding at a historic 33.1% annualized rate. That followed a 31.4% pace of contraction the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
A jaw-dropping 40.7% pace of growth in consumer spending accounted for 76.3% to the bounce back in GDP. The economy remains 3.5% below its level at the end of 2019 and analysts expect the gap to be closed in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Much of the spending last quarter was driven by billions of dollars in government transfers, including a $600 weekly unemployment subsidy and a one-off $1,200 check to households.
Unemployment insurance payments tumbled 42.2% to $364.8 billion last month. The government attributed the plunge to the expiration of the $600 weekly unemployment supplement in July. The decrease was partially offset by a 34.6% increase in other government transfers, including an additional weekly $300 unemployment benefit, which replaced the $600 subsidy. 
Funding for the $300 weekly subsidy mostly ran out in September and there is no deal in sight for another rescue package. The smaller supplement, together with gains in wages and rental income boosted personal income, which rebounded 0.9% in September after falling 2.5% in August. 
""There is clear evidence some people are being left behind,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Congress has dropped the ball and income will fall bigly in the next income and consumption report. Couple that with a COVID resurgence and the fourth quarter will be challenging.""
Americans are also dipping into savings to fund spending. The saving rate slipped to a still high 14.3% from 14.8% in August. It peaked at record 33.6% in April.
Despite the stronger-than-expected jump in consumer spending last month, inflation remained benign. 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.2% after climbing 0.3% in August. In the 12 months through September, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5% after advancing 1.4% in August.
The core PCE index is the preferred inflation measure for the Fed's 2% target, a flexible average. 
The tame inflation environment was underscored by a third report from the Labor Department on Friday showing the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.5% in the third quarter, matching the second quarter's gain. 
That lowered the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.4%, the smallest rise since the second quarter of 2017, from 2.7% in the April-June period. The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes.

""The easing trend in compensation costs suggest that inflation should not rise to a threatening pace anytime soon,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy grew by a record 8.2% in the third quarter as higher consumer spending and exports helped Europe's largest economy to recover partly from its worst-ever recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, data showed on Friday.
The jump in output from July to September was the biggest since the Federal Statistic Office began collecting quarterly growth data in 1970 and was stronger than the 7.3% increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.
The jump followed an unprecedented plunge of nearly 10% in the second quarter, when household spending, company investments and trade collapsed during the first wave of the pandemic.
""The deeper you push a ball under water, the higher it jumps out of it. That also applies to the economy,"" DekaBank analyst Andreas Scheuerle said.
An aggressive second wave of infections and a new partial lockdown to slow down the spread of the disease are now clouding the growth outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond.
The bigger-than-expected rebound in the third quarter was driven by higher private consumption, rebounding investments in equipment and strong exports, the statistics office said.
The preliminary data did not include a lot of details, but car companies and engineering associations have pointed to surprisingly strong demand from China in recent months.
Separately, the German government on Friday revised upwards its estimate for gross domestic product this year. It now expects GDP to shrink by 5.5% in 2020 compared with a previous estimate for a 5.8% decline. Adjusted for calendar effects, it sees the economy shrinking by 5.9%.
The government confirmed its 2021 forecast for the economy to grow by 4.4% despite the second wave of infections and the partial lockdown. Bars, restaurants, cinemas and gyms will close from Monday until end of November. Schools and shops will stay open under certain conditions.
The government is planning to compensate companies affected by the lockdown by paying them up to 75% of their sales from last year's November. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has earmarked 10 billion euros for this new aid package.
The government has since March unleashed massive rescue and stimulus measures, including cash handouts for parents and a temporary value-added tax cut that together seem to have stabilized domestic demand.
But in a sign that some consumers are holding back despite relatively stable employment and income, retail sales fell more than expected on the month in September, separate data showed.

Compared with February, the month before the coronavirus outbreak in Germany, retail sales in September were 2.8% higher.

But on a quarterly, seasonally adjusted basis, the economy grew by 3%, compared with a 0.1% contraction in the previous three months, advance estimates showed.
It is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year contractions for the city, which was hit hard by anti-government protests last year and more recently by the global health crisis and geopolitical tension.

Values climbed 5.8% from a year earlier to an average of 227,825 pounds ($294,000), Nationwide Building Society said Friday. The report comes a day after Bank of England data showed mortgage approvals reached a 13-year high.
In October alone, prices gained 0.8% as a government tax cut fed post-lockdown demand to move. It left values up 3.5% over the past three months, the biggest gain since 2009.
Still, that jump stands in contrast with reports from other parts of the economy, which are already losing steam in their recovery from the initial wave of coronavirus disruption.
With new restrictions to control a resurgence in the virus becoming more severe, Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank said on Friday its measure of U.K. business confidence fell for the first time since May.
The stand-out strength in the housing market is in large part due to a government decision to suspend a tax on home purchases until the end of March. There’s also evidence of pent-up demand following the lockdown, as well as a desire for bigger properties as people work from home more regularly.
Many analysts say gains will reverse next year as unemployment rises and aid packages come to an end. That could be compounded by more severe restrictions to control the spread of the virus.
“The outlook remains highly uncertain and will depend heavily on how the pandemic and the measures to contain it evolve,” said Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist. “Activity is likely to slow in the coming quarters, perhaps sharply.”"

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output rose for the fourth straight month in September as the world's third-largest economy continued to shake off the drag from the COVID-19 crisis largely thanks to improving external demand.
Separate data showed the September jobless rate held steady, while the number of available jobs per applicant fell to the lowest level since late 2013.
Official data released on Friday showed factory output surged 4.0% in September from the previous month, mainly due to strength in car and production machinery manufacturing.
""Overseas economies and especially China are picking up, and Japan's exports are growing,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""The output recovery in the automobile industry and in high-tech components whose production moves closely in line with exports is the overall driving force.""
The jump beat the median market forecast of a 3.2% gain in a Reuters poll of economists, and compared with a downwardly revised 1.0% rise in August.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expect output to rise 4.5% in October and 1.2% in November.
The government kept unchanged its assessment of industrial production, saying it was picking up.
The economy posted its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter due to the coronavirus pandemic but has been gradually recovering. Gross domestic product data due on Nov. 16 is expected to show a return to growth in the three months through September, thanks in part to a rebound in exports and output.
But some analysts warned that capital spending will likely put a drag on third-quarter growth as firms are forced to put off investments due to the heavy impact of COVID-19 on corporate earnings.
""Capital spending usually recovers slower than output,"" said Miyazaki. ""It'll possibly pull down third-quarter growth.""
Output of capital goods, which are an indicator of the health of capital spending, rose just 2.6% from the previous month, following a steep 4.5% fall in August.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will announce next week a plan for extra stimulus measures to speed up the patchy recovery, four government and ruling party sources told Reuters this week.
Although the size of the package has yet to be decided, some ruling party lawmakers have already called for one of about 10 trillion yen ($95.51 billion), including measures to stimulate domestic demand.
Japan's seasonally adjusted jobless rate was steady at 3.0% in September, separate government data showed, beating the median estimate of 3.1%.

After more than a year of weakness in multiple economic indicators, data this week showed exports from the Asian financial hub surged the most in almost two years in September, fueled by a 17% increase in shipments to mainland China. Advance third-quarter economic growth figures to be released today are forecast to show quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.7%, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
That would mark the first time the measure has risen since before the start of anti-government protests last year, as a third wave of virus infections subsided last month. The economy has been in its longest recession since the tumultuous period from 1997 to 1998 that included the handover to China and the Asia financial crisis.
Still, the recovery is nascent and Hong Kong will need more robust commerce and tourism to sustain a return to economic growth, economists say. On a year-on-year basis, the city’s economy is forecast to extend declines for a fifth quarter.
“Hong Kong needs to see its border reopening with mainland China before the city can benefit from the rapid recovery there,” said Tommy Wu, senior economist with Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong is among other economies in Asia including Singapore and South Korea that are starting to recover from months of anti-virus measures. Removing border restrictions with the mainland would benefit industries beyond tourism -- such as trade and finance -- making it the government’s most urgent task alongside containing the virus, said Dong Chen, senior Asia economist with Pictet Wealth Management.
“Opening the border needs to be a government priority,” Chen said.
Hong Kong and Singapore have announced plans to create a travel bubble between the two cities that is targeted to launch next month, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a press briefing. People in both cities would be exempted from compulsory quarantine, replaced by coronavirus testing. The pact joins efforts in several markets in the region to loosen travel restrictions.
In an Oct. 25 blog post Financial Secretary Paul Chan said if the flow of people and commerce between Hong Kong and mainland China is safely restored, the city can be “revitalized substantially” even if the global economy remains constrained.
‘Main Force’
“The sustained rapid economic recovery in the mainland can be said to be the main force supporting the Hong Kong economy,” Chan said. “Only by effectively controlling the epidemic and thoroughly cleaning up local infection cases can we truly create an environment conducive to economic recovery.”
The government is pursuing a law that would make Covid-19 tests mandatory for some groups even as it slowly eases virus-related restrictions, Lam said at the briefing. Hong Kong is ready to re-open the border with China from a technical perspective, but it requires mutual consent, she said.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s efforts to stimulate the economy remain under scrutiny. The city has announced more than HK$310 billion ($40 billion) in relief this year, yet the prolonged recession has led to shuttered storefronts and unemployment at an almost 16-year high of 6.4% as of September. Joblessness is likely to rise further after Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd. last week said it will slash more than 5,000 jobs and close a regional carrier.

Hong Kong, along with the rest of the world, must reckon with the human cost of the pandemic, said Iris Pang, greater China chief economist with ING Bank NV.
“Certainly the economy will benefit from opening the border,” she said. “But the loss of human lives, in terms of economic theory, hurts the long-term growth of an economy.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew at a historic pace in the third quarter as the government injected more than $3 trillion worth of pandemic relief which fueled consumer spending, but the deep scars from the COVID-19 recession could take a year or more to heal.
The 33.1% annualized growth rate reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday, the last major economic scorecard before next Tuesday's presidential election, did not ease the human tragedy inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic, with tens of millions of Americans still unemployed and more than 222,000 dead.
The economy remains 3.5% below its level at the end of 2019 and incomes plunged in the third quarter. Nevertheless, with five days remaining to Election Day President Donald Trump, trailing in most national opinion polls, cheered the report.
""Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""So glad this great GDP number came out before November 3rd.""
Trump's Democratic challenger Joe Biden highlighted the lack of full recovery and the rapidly petering growth spurt.
""We are in a deep hole and President Trump's failure to act has meant that third-quarter growth wasn't nearly enough to get us out of (it),"" said Biden. ""The recovery that is happening is helping those at the top, but leaving tens of millions of working families and small businesses behind.""
According to Christopher Way, an associate professor of government at Cornell University, the report ""will have absolutely zero effect on the election and it is economic performance in the first half of an election year that matters.""
The rebound in gross domestic product followed a 31.4% rate of contraction in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. On a year-on-year basis GDP jumped 7.4% last quarter after sinking 9.0% in the April-June period. The rebound reversed about two-thirds of the 10.1% drop in GDP in the first half. By comparison, the economy contracted 4% peak to trough during the 2007-09 Great Recession. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP expanding at a 31% rate in the July-September quarter. The economy plunged into recession in February.
The government's rescue package provided a lifeline for many businesses and the unemployed, juicing up consumer spending, which on its own contributed 76.3% to the surge in GDP.
But government funding has been depleted with no deal in sight for another round of relief. New COVID-19 cases are spiraling across the country, forcing restrictions on businesses like restaurants and bars.
""We still don't have the level of GDP surpassing the pre-COVID level until fourth-quarter 2021 and closing the output gap will take even more time,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.
Foreshadowing a slowdown in consumer spending, personal income tumbled at a $540.6 billion rate in the third quarter after surging at a $1.45 trillion pace in the prior period. The drop was attributed to a decline in government transfers related to the pandemic relief programs. 
Though savings remain high, the pace at which Americans are stashing away money is moderating. That, together with persistent layoffs and slowing employment growth could restrain consumer spending in the coming months. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
ELEVATED LAYOFFS
A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 40,000 to a seasonally adjusted 751,000 in the week ending Oct. 24. Including a government funded program, 1.1 million people sought unemployment benefits last week.
Though claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March, they remain above their 665,000 peak seen during the 2007-09 Great Recession. About 22.7 million Americans were receiving unemployment benefits in early October, though many have exhausted their eligibility for state aid. 
Just over half of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic have been recouped.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, rebounded at a historic rate of 40.7% in the third quarter, driven by purchases of goods like motor vehicles, clothing and footwear. Americans also boosted spending on recreation, healthcare and dining out. But spending on services remained below its fourth quarter level. 
Spending was boosted by billions of dollars in government transfers, including a $600 weekly unemployment subsidy and a one-off $1,200 check to households. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 5% rate.
""Without further stimulus, the winter may indeed be very painful,"" said Jeff Madrick, senior fellow at The Century Foundation in New York.
The shift toward goods spending pulled in imports, resulting in a widening of the trade deficit. Some of the imports, however, ended up in warehouses. The accumulation of inventory offset the trade hit to GDP growth.
There was also a turnaround in business investment after the second-quarter drubbing, but the bounce could be temporary as demand for goods that do not complement life-style changes brought by COVID-19 remains weak.  Boeing Co  (N:BA) reported its fourth straight quarterly loss on Wednesday.
The pandemic has also crushed oil prices, weighing on spending on nonresidential structures like gas and oil well drilling. Business spending on nonresidential structures contracted for a fourth straight quarter. 

Record low interest rates boosted housing. Government spending fell, pressured by cuts at state and local governments, whose finances have been squeezed by the coronavirus.

478,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes unexpectedly fell in September after four straight monthly increases, but the housing market remains supported by record low mortgage rates.
The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, dropped 2.2% to 130.0. The decreasing was likely due to a shortage of homes available for sale. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, rising 3.4% in September.
Pending home sales increased 20.5% from a year ago. 
The housing market has been one of the economy's star performers even as the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown millions out of work. The unemployment burden has fallen disproportionately on low-wage earners in the services industry, who tend to be young.
There has been a surge in demand for housing in suburbs and low-density areas as Americans seek spacious accommodation in the new work-from-home era. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is averaging 2.80%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). 
Reports this month showed a surge in homebuilder confidence in October, and an acceleration in single-family home construction and sales of previously owned homes in September.

Last month, pending home sales rose in the Northeast. They fell in the Midwest, South and West.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy grew at its fastest rate since records began in the third quarter, reversing much - but by no means all - of the output lost in the second quarter under the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Commerce Department said gross domestic product grew at an annualized 33.1% in the quarter, after contracting by 31% in the second quarter. Analysts had expected an expansion of 31.9%.
U.S. stock futures turned positive on the news, with the Dow 30 futures contract rising 110 points in response, erasing earlier losses for the session. The dollar also strengthened to $1.1706 against the euro, albeit the latter was hit by the European Central Bank signaling after its council meeting that it will likely ease monetary policy again in December.
The figures, while spectacular, are essentially backward-looking and exaggerated by the habit of annualizing GDP data.  They reflect the reopening of many businesses in the summer after government-mandated stay-at-home orders had crippled both manufacturing and services output in the spring.
""The general population judge living standards by their personal experience, not abstract concepts,"" said Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, in a morning podcast.
An arguably better indication of current developments in the economy came from the weekly jobless claims numbers, which were released at the same time.
Initial claims for jobless benefits fell by more than expected to their lowest since March, at 751,000, while continuing claims fell to 7.756 million."

The European Commission's monthly survey showed sentiment in the 19 countries sharing the euro unchanged at 90.9 points this month, beating market expectations of a drop to 89.5 points.
The survey is typically conducted in the first two to three weeks of the month, meaning they relate to the mood before this week's announcements of lockdowns in France and Germany.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German unemployment fell much more than expected in October and demand for job protection schemes kept declining as the labour market in Europe's largest economy continued to recover from the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic.
The surprisingly strong data, released by the Labour Office on Thursday, suggested household spending should support growth in the fourth quarter, though a partial lockdown to break a second wave of infections, which takes effect on Monday, is likely to hurt consumption.
The number of people out of work fell by 35,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.863 million, the data showed, far more than a 5,000 drop forecast in a Reuters poll.
The unemployment rate eased to 6.2% in October from 6.3% in the previous month.
""Unemployment and underemployment fell sharply in October. The use of short-time work continues to decline,"" Labour Office head Detlef Scheele said. But he added that there were still some scars from the first wave of the pandemic and that the new curbs would also weigh.
""This will hit the labour market, but it won't collapse,"" Scheele said.
The number of people on short-time work schemes, which have shielded the labour market from the brunt of the pandemic, dropped sharply to 2.58 million in August - the last month for which reliable data was available.
This compared to more than 4 million in July and a peak of nearly 6 million reached in April, at the height of the pandemic.
The government hopes that its massive rescue and stimulus measures supported a strong recovery over the summer months after the economy plunged by nearly 10% in the second quarter.
Preliminary third-quarter gross domestic product figures are due on Friday, with analysts predicting a rebound with the quarterly output jumping 7.3%.
For the fourth quarter, the Ifo institute on Monday forecast a slowdown in economic growth to 2.1%.
But that was before federal and state governments late on Wednesday announced a partial lockdown that will force restaurants, bars, cinemas, theatres and gyms to close from Nov. 2 until the end of the month. Shops can remain open under strict conditions, and schools and day care centres are to stay open.

LONDON (Reuters) - British lenders approved the highest number of mortgages since September 2007 last month, unexpectedly extending a post-lockdown surge, but there was a record drop in unsecured lending to consumers, Bank of England data showed on Thursday.
Mortgage approvals for house purchase jumped to 91,454 in September from August's already-high reading of 85,530, exceeding all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had instead pointed to a decline.
Activity in Britain's housing market has rebounded sharply since the end of lockdown restrictions and was further fuelled when finance minister Rishi Sunak temporarily suspended property purchase taxes in July.
Earlier this month, mortgage lender Halifax reported a 7.3% annual rise in house prices for September, the biggest increase since 2016.
The rapid rebound in the property market contrasts with a gloomier picture for many other parts of Britain's economy, which shrank by 20% in the three months to June. Output in August was still 9% lower than before the pandemic.
The housing market pick-up is likely to fade, Andrew Montlake, managing director of mortgage broker Coreco, said.
""The post-lockdown bull run is already over,"" he said. ""Lenders have been pulling down the shutters due to ongoing struggles with capacity and concerns over rising unemployment levels, specifically the impact on house price growth.""
Headwinds to the British economy are mounting with a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus cases through September and October, and the risk of higher unemployment as government job support is steadily scaled back.
Unsecured lending to consumers in September was 4.6% lower than a year earlier, the sharpest annual drop since 1994 when the BoE started collecting these figures on a monthly basis.

BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - Asia is starting to see signs of economic recovery as it rides on the back of an upturn in China, which is entering a new expansion phase less than a year after it recorded the world's first cases of COVID-19.
While international attention has been focused on the looming U.S. election and the struggle to halt the spread of the coronavirus in the Americas and Europe, China has quietly been clocking up improvements in several key sectors.
After imposing some of the world's strictest lockdown measures early in the pandemic, China is now the only major economy forecast by the International Monetary Fund to report growth - of 1.9% - this year. 
Official data showed China's economy grew 4.9% in the September quarter from a year earlier, following 3.2% growth in the second quarter and a 6.8% contraction at the start of the year when the domestic coronavirus outbreak was at its peak and lockdowns were imposed.
(Graphic: China's V-shaped recovery? link: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-ECONOMY/GDP/qzjpqaewypx/chart.png)
""The underlying details ... make clear that the new expansion phase China is entering will prove strong and resilient,"" Westpac senior economist Elliot Clarke said. 
""As the world contracts by 4% in 2020, China is set to grow around 2%. And come 2021, a key support for world growth of around 6% will be near-10% growth in China."" 
For China's neighbours, that growth is increasing demand for their exports and supporting activity in their own economies. 
""China remains the only major commodity consumer where industrial production is now higher than pre-COVID levels,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) analysts said. 
China's imports surged 13.2% year-on-year in September, with a 28% rise in semiconductor imports a boon for Taiwan and South Korea in particular. 
The flow-on for Seoul is already evident. Data on Tuesday showed South Korea posted its fastest quarterly growth rate in a decade in the September quarter, expanding a seasonally adjusted 1.9% after a 3.2% contraction the previous quarter. Exports soared 15.6% in the third quarter, the biggest rise since 1986 and largely reversing a 16.1% contraction in the second quarter. 
""Exports rapidly improved on the back of recovery in China and other major economies, which spearheaded our third quarter growth,"" Finance minister Hong Nam-ki said on Tuesday. 
China's early recovery has also been a relief for Japan, as China is the destination for more than 22% of its overall exports, just ahead of the 19% share that heads to the United States. 
Japan's exports to China jumped 14% in the year to September, the biggest rise in more than two years, driven by robust demand for nonferrous metals, chip-making equipment and automobiles. 
That is giving the Bank of Japan some optimism over the domestic outlook, with industry feedback pointing to improving demand from China. 
""Automobile sales in China are increasing from year before levels after economic activity resumed. We're seeing an increase in auto-parts exports to China,"" a transport machinery maker in Nagoya was quoted as saying in the BOJ's quarterly report on the regional economies.
Taiwan is also benefiting, even as political tensions with Beijing remain high. Its exports to China rose an annual 22% in September, and export orders, a key leading gauge for global tech demand, rose 9.9% as Chinese orders jumped by almost one-third. 
RISKS REMAIN
China's renewed growth has been spread across several sectors, including manufacturing, construction, investment and domestic demand.
There are risks to the outlook, however, including the potential that some economies shut down again to tame the coronavirus, a scenario mining giant  Rio Tinto  (AX:RIO) (L:RIO) flagged in a production report.
While Rio noted strong global activity in the third quarter, it also cautioned that a range of data suggested ""the rate of recovery in growth is slowing in most economies, with pent-up demand dissipating, and the rise of renewed lockdowns threatening recovery"".

Further, any escalation of China-U.S trade hostilities or other geopolitical tensions after the U.S. presidential election would also be a risk for Asia's hopes of sustained economic recovery.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States' trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in September and inventories at retailers surged, sealing expectations for record economic growth in the third quarter after the worst performance in at least 73 years.
The data from the Commerce Department on Wednesday added to reports ranging from retail sales, durable goods orders and housing that suggested the economy has regained some footing, though gross domestic product would still likely remain below the department's forecast for the fourth quarter. 
The anticipated surge in GDP was driven by a more than $3 trillion government rescue package early this year, which provided a lifeline for many businesses and the unemployed as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the economy. The fiscal stimulus has since been exhausted, leaving the outlook for the fourth quarter murky amid a resurgence in new coronavirus cases.
The government is scheduled to publish its advance GDP growth estimate for the third quarter on Thursday, five days ahead of the U.S. presidential election next Tuesday.
""We should remember output will be below that of the end of fourth quarter of 2019,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""There is a long way to go before the economy is fully healed and unfortunately the challenges are mounting.""
The goods trade deficit decreased 4.5% to $79.4 billion last month. Exports of goods increased 2.7% to $122 billion, led by a surge in shipments of foods, feeds and beverages. There were also increases in exports of motor vehicles, consumer and capital goods. Exports of industrial supplies fell.
Imports fell 0.2% to $201.4 billion last month, pulled down imports of industrial supplies, consumer goods and other goods.
U.S. stocks fell as spiraling coronavirus cases soured investor sentiment. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
SMALLER TRADE HIT 
September's decrease in the goods trade deficit after two straight monthly increases suggested trade would be a smaller drag on GDP growth than had been anticipated earlier. The trade hit to output could also be offset by accumulation of inventories.
Stocks at retailers jumped 1.6% last month after gaining 0.5% in August. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.9%.
The trade and retail inventory data put a upside risk to the third-quarter GDP growth estimate. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the economy likely grew at a 31% annualized rate in the July-September quarter. 
The anticipated historic growth pace would follow a 31.4% pace of contraction in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947.

""It will still likely take until the third quarter of 2021 for real GDP to regain its level of the fourth quarter of 2019,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Funds in New York.

The aggregate index combining eight early indicators tracked by Bloomberg was unchanged from the previous month.
Small business confidence eased in October, with sub-indices weakening across the board, according to Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, which surveys more than 500 smaller firms each month. As the world’s largest exporter, China is exposed to the deteriorating outlook in the rest of the world amid resurgent virus cases, threatening a domestic recovery that remains otherwise robust.
“The pace of recovery slowed in October,” Standard Chartered’s economists Shen Lan and Ding Shuang, wrote in a report. “The ‘expectations’ sub-index fell to 52.6 in October from an average of 54.7 in the third quarter, indicating a more cautious business outlook toward year-end.”
Home sales, which remained fairly resilient despite the economic downturn this year, started to cool as policy makers tightened their grip on financing to developers.
South Korean exports, a barometer of global trade, also deteriorated in the first 20 days of October -- although the data was affected by fewer working days in the month. Factory deflation likely deepened in the month, weighing on profit growth at industrial firms that face a faster rise in input prices than output prices.
At the same time, car sales improved, registering solid growth in line with the general upward trend seen recently in consumer spending.
The pickup in consumption may help to spur services output, which outperformed manufacturing at smaller firms for the first time since the Covid-19 shock, according to Standard Chartered.
Purchasing managers’ indexes, due in coming days, will also give insight into the recovery. The official manufacturing index looks poised for a small retreat in October, likely because of closures during China’s golden week holiday this year, not a loss of recovery momentum, according to Bloomberg Economics’ Chang Shu.

The consumer sentiment index rose by 12.2 points in October to reach 91.6, the highest since February, the Bank of Korea said in a statement on Wednesday. The monthly increase was the biggest since April 2009.
The increased confidence coincides with stronger-than-expected economic growth last quarter led by exports and investment. The BOK said households’ perceptions of the economy and their finances improved as a summer coronavirus wave eased and the government relaxed social-distancing restrictions.
Biggest Export Jump Since 1986 Fuels Korea Recession Rebound
Among components of the headline index, households’ spending projections contributed the most to the rise, followed by expectations for income and the overall economic outlook. The reading below 100 means pessimism still outweighs optimism.
The sentiment index sank to 79.4 in September after daily infections snowballed to hundreds, prompting authorities to tighten business regulations. The resurgence has since waned, supporting optimism that the economy is set to emerge from the pandemic in better shape than most major economies where the virus is still spreading fast.
To accelerate the recovery momentum, South Korea‘s government is seeking to reinvigorate consumption with campaigns that include a nationwide shopping event in November. Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post Tuesday that the government will step up efforts to put the economy back on a normal track as soon as possible.
For the year as a whole, South Korea’s economy is still expected to shrink with a potential virus flareup at home and abroad a key risk. Its export-reliant rebound means unless the pandemic subsides in major trade partners, strong growth momentum is unlikely to be sustained.

The Conference Board's findings came ahead of next Tuesday's fiercely contested battle for the White House between Trump and Democratic nomineee Joe Biden. Trump is trailing the former vice president in national opinion polls.
Consumer confidence in Florida dropped to a reading of 100.3 this month from 114.4 in September. Though confidence has rebounded after slumping as the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the state, it is near levels seen just before the 2016 election.
In Pennsylvania, consumer confidence tumbled to a reading of 92.0 from 115.5 in September. Consumer confidence in Michigan fell to 119.2 in October from a reading of 124.1 in the prior month. Confidence in the three swing states was dragged by declines in consumers' expectations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased to six-year high in September, wrapping up a quarter of potentially record growth in business spending and the economy, thanks to fiscal stimulus aimed at softening the blow from the COVID-19 pandemic.
But the report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed shipments of these goods rising modestly last month, supporting expectations of slower economic activity heading into the fourth quarter. That was reinforced by a dip in consumer confidence this month. The reports came ahead of next Tuesday's fiercely contested presidential election. 
A more than $3 trillion government rescue package early this year provided a lifeline for many businesses and the unemployed, helping to boost consumer spending and the housing market. But funding has dried up and new coronavirus infections are surging across the country.
""The recovery is now entering a more challenging phase, in which it will face the pandemic crisis without meaningful fiscal support,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 1.0% last month to the highest level since September 2014. These so-called core capital goods orders rose 2.1% in August.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders increasing 0.5%. Though core capital goods orders have pulled above the their pre-pandemic level, they were down 0.5% year-on-year in September. 
Orders last month were lifted by increased demand for primary metals, fabricated metal products and computers and electronic products. But orders for machinery and electrical equipment, appliances and components fell.
 Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), a bellwether for economic activity, on Tuesday reported lower quarterly earnings, but said the pace of decline in sales of its yellow bulldozers, mining trucks and other equipment was moderating.
Separately, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to a reading of 100.9 this month from 101.3 in September amid concerns about the future. The Conference Board said ""there is little to suggest that consumers foresee the economy gaining momentum in the final months of 2020, especially with COVID-19 cases on the rise and unemployment still high."" 
Consumer confidence is now at levels seen in October 2016. There are fears that the outcome of next Tuesday's vote could weigh on business and consumer sentiment, and undercut the recovery from the worst recession in at least 73 years. 
More than four in ten supporters of both President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger and former Vice President, Joe Biden, said they would not accept the result of the November election if their preferred candidate loses, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.
""Consumers are clearly worried about what tomorrow will bring as they have been hit with a second wave of the coronavirus, mounting election uncertainty as voting day grows close, and even the good news of the recovery in the stock market has gone away,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
SHIPMENTS SLOWING
Shipments of core capital goods gained 0.3% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They increased 1.5% in August. 
The three straight months of growth in shipments likely helped to lift overall business investment from a deep hole in the third quarter. But September's small rise could be bad news for the fourth quarter.
Business investment tumbled at a record 27.2% annualized rate in the second quarter, with spending on equipment collapsing at an all-time pace of 35.9%. Investment in equipment has contracted for five straight quarters.
Growth estimates for the July-September quarter are as high as a 35.2% annualized rate, which would recoup roughly two-thirds of the output lost because of the coronavirus.
The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947. The government is scheduled to publish its snapshot of third-quarter GDP on Thursday. 
Manufacturing is holding up. Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, jumped 1.9% in September after rising 0.4% in August. Durable goods orders were driven by a 4.1% rebound in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 0.9% decline in August.
Orders for motor vehicles and parts recovered 1.5% after falling 4.1% in August. But there no orders for civilian aircraft reported for the third straight month.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co lost another three orders for its grounded 737 MAX jetliner in September, and delivered 11 total aircraft to customers, less than half the number from the same month a year ago, the planemaker reported this month. Boeing has struggled with cancellations as airlines grapple with sharply reduced demand for air travel because of the pandemic. 

The 737 MAX jets have been grounded since March 2019 following two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.

China's economic rebound has been gaining momentum following the sharp COVID-19-driven downturn thanks to strong exports, pent-up demand and government stimulus, but slower-than-expected third quarter gross domestic product growth highlighted pockets of weakness for one of the few drivers of global demand.
Profits at Chinese industrial firms in September rose 10.1% year-on-year to 646.43 billion yuan ($96.34 billion), National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Tuesday. 
That marked the fifth month of profit growth albeit slower than a 19.1% increase in August.
Zhu Hong, a senior statistician at the NBS, attributed the slower growth in September to deepening declines in factory-gate prices, rising losses from asset depreciation and increasing raw material costs for auto and electronics sectors.
Factory gate prices, a key barometer of industrial demand, fell at a faster-than-expected pace in September, and consumer inflation slowed to its weakest in 19 months.
""Although industrial profits continued to recover steadily in the first three quarters, cumulative operating income and profit growth have yet to turn positive, while growth rates of accounts receivable and inventory of finished goods are still high,"" Zhu said. 
""The foundation for continued improvements in corporate profits still needs to be consolidated."" 
For January-September, industrial firms' profits fell 2.4% on an annual basis to 4.37 trillion yuan, with the downturn easing from a 4.4% decrease in the first eight months.
Auto manufacturing, non-ferrous metal smelting and processing and ferrous metal smelting and processing industries contributed to the bulk of the profit increases in the first nine months. 
Major mining firms including  Zijin Mining  Group (SS:601899) and Chifeng  Jilong Gold  Mining (SS:600988) reported stronger net profits for the nine-month period.
Profit margins at big industrial firms rose 13.8% in the third quarter from a year ago, compared with a 4.0% fall in the second quarter, while earnings at small industrial firms rose 15.8% in the third quarter, NBS data showed. 

The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenue over 20 million yuan from their main operations.

LONDON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Surging shipments into the United States are fueling record high freight costs and logjams at seaports, but transportation executives say the rally will lose steam with a second wave of COVID-19 restrictions on the cards. 
Container shipping companies, which move goods for customers including Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and Walmart (N:WMT), got stung late last year and early this year when COVID-19 halted trade around the world, and they question whether the U.S. import boom can be sustained.
""Let's not get carried away,"" Rolf Habben Jansen, chief executive of Germany's Hapag Lloyd (DE:HLAG), told reporters. ""This is just a spike that no one has foreseen in an unusual period. There will be a correction to that.""
U.S. consumer confidence ticked up in September, when retail sales accelerated. Still, consumers are eating through savings, layoffs are mounting and the country just set a record for new COVID-19 infections.
""Everything depends on the demand and how the second wave of COVID affects the world economy,"" Aristides Pittas, CEO of shipping company Euroseas (O:ESEA), said at a Capital Link virtual event. 
In recent weeks, the cost of transporting goods from Asia to the United States - one of the world's biggest retail markets – topped $4,500 per 40-foot container unit (FEU), the highest recorded level, data from S&P Global Platts Containers showed. 
""We are sold out. The ships are 100% full. The containers are 100% full. You can't get a container,"" Jeremy Nixon, CEO of Japanese container group Ocean Network Express (ONE), said at a recent International Chamber of Shipping virtual event. 
Total imports to the 10 largest U.S. seaports increased 9.2% in August and 12.4% in September, trade data from Descartes (NASDAQ:DSGX) Systems (TO:DSG) showed. 
U.S. business inventories rebounded in August, as retailers and other companies raced to restock depleted warehouses and distribution centers. 
""Inventories are still quite low and there's a significant need to replenish them,"" said LeAnne Coulter, vice president of freight management at Penske Logistics. 
Data suggests that record volume at the Port of Los Angeles, the busiest U.S. ocean trade hub, could stretch through November. Meanwhile, it is causing backups that could ripple through the supply chain. 

""This will probably taper off in the first or second week of December,"" Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said of the import rush.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes unexpectedly fell in September after four straight monthly increases, but the housing market remains supported by record low mortgage rates and demand for more space as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on.
The decrease in sales reported by the Commerce Department on Monday followed data last week showing single-family homebuilding and permits racing to levels last seen in 2007 in September. Confidence among homebuilders hit a record high in October, while sales of previously owned homes jumped to their highest level in more than 14 years in September. 
""While there could be some ups and downs along the way, we still look for strength in the housing market as low mortgage rates boost activity and earlier pent-up demand for housing is released,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
New home sales fell 3.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 959,000 units last month. August's sales pace was revised down to 994,000 units from the previously reported 1.011 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 12.8% of housing market sales, rising 2.8% to a rate of 1.025 million units.
New home sales surged 32.1% year-on-year. New home sales are counted at the signing of a contract, making them a leading housing market indicator. September's monthly decline could, however, be flagging a slowdown in housing market momentum heading into the fourth quarter.
Applications for loans to purchase a home have dropped for four straight weeks. While homebuilder confidence is at historic highs, shortages of land, labor, lumber and other key building materials are lengthening construction times.
""This month's new home sales figures indicate that the housing market might be finally losing some steam,"" said John Pataky, executive vice president at TIAA Bank in Jacksonville, Florida.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower, setting the Dow for its worst day in more than seven weeks, dragged down by rising new coronavirus cases. The PHLX housing index (HGX) fell. The dollar rose versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
BRIGHT STAR 
Though the COVID-19 pandemic has bruised the economy, it has boosted the housing market as Americans flee from city centers to the suburbs and low-density areas in search of more space for home offices and schooling. Staggering unemployment, which has left 23.2 million people on jobless benefits, has disproportionately affected low-wage workers.
Home sales have been concentrated in the single-family segment and in the higher price ranges. Both first-time and second-home buyers have been active in the market, with bidding wars reported in some parts of the country.
Last month's decline in new home sales did not change expectations that the housing market likely contributed to a sharp rebound in economic activity in the third quarter. Growth estimates for the July-September quarter are as high as a 35.3% annualized rate, which would recoup roughly two-thirds of the output lost because of the pandemic.
The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947. The government is scheduled to publish its snapshot of third-quarter GDP on Thursday. 
Third-quarter GDP growth was juiced up by government money, which has since run out. That together with the resurgence in coronavirus infections has led to projections of a steep slowdown in activity in the fourth quarter.

""The housing sector should remain supportive of growth at least for the next couple of quarters as strong demand drives new construction,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is at an average of 2.80%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). 
In September, new home sales tumbled 28.9% in the Northeast. They fell 4.7% in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, and dropped 4.1% in the Midwest. But sales increased 3.8% in the West. 
The median new house price increased 3.5% to $326,800 in September from a year ago. New home sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000 to $399,000 price range.
There were 284,000 new homes on the market last month, up from 282,000 in August. At September's sales pace it would take 3.6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 3.4 months in August. Just over two-thirds of the homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

""The share of homes sold but not yet started continues to trend upwards,"" said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington. ""This suggests that homebuilders are struggling to keep up with demand.""

Only 12.9% of respondents believe the country’s economy will strengthen in the next six months, the smallest share since early May, telephone polling shows. That left the Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index slightly lower at 51.8. The index has dropped for four straight weeks from a post-pandemic high of 53.2 late last month.
The share of respondents who see the Canadian economy weakening in the next six months rose to 56%, which means pessimists now outnumber optimists about four to one
Weakening sentiment in Canada reflects the new containment measures provinces like Quebec and Ontario have imposed to dampen the second wave of Covid-19. The new lockdown measures include closures of bars, restaurants and gyms as well as limiting the number of people in social gatherings.
As of Sunday, the number of active Covid-19 cases in Canada had more than doubled in the past month to 24,177.
Every week, Nanos Research surveys 250 Canadians for their views on personal finances, job security and their outlook for the economy and real estate prices. Bloomberg publishes four-week rolling averages of the 1,000 responses.
In addition to the Nanos numbers, the impacts of the new restrictions are showing up in high-frequency indicators. Restaurant demand dropped after indoor dining was been banned in several large cities and even outdoor dining was prohibited in parts of Quebec for 28 days, allowing only takeout.
Credit-card spending growth slowed in October after the new measures were implemented, according to reports from Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto-Dominion Bank. The spending weakness is concentrated among restaurant, travel and entertainment merchants.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government will revise upwards its forecast for growth domestic product (GDP) for 2020 when it presents an update to its estimates this week, a source familiar with the government's forecast told Reuters on Monday.
The government now expects GDP to shrink 5.5% in 2020 compared to a previous estimate for a 5.8% decline, the source said.
This means the recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic will be slightly milder than the loss of output caused by the global financial crisis in 2009 when GDP fell by a record 5.7%.
The economy ministry declined to comment and said Economy Minister Peter Altmaier would present the updated forecast on Wednesday.
The German economy contracted by 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investments and trade collapsed at the height of the pandemic.
An easing of lockdown measures, coupled with an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus packages, led to a robust recovery in the third quarter.
But a spike in new coronavirus cases has caused concern activity could slow again, and German business morale fell for the first time in six months in October. [L8N2HH24A]

For 2021, the government is still sticking by its previous forecast for GDP growth of 4.4%, the source said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale fell for the first time in six months in October, weighed down by companies' concerns about rising coronavirus infection rates that are making them more cautious about the coming months, a survey showed on Monday.
The Ifo institute said its business climate index fell to 92.7 from a downwardly revised 93.2 in September. A Reuters poll had foreseen a decline to 93.0.
""Companies are considerably more sceptical regarding developments over the coming months,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement. ""In view of rising infection numbers, German business is becoming increasingly worried.""
The cooling of the sentiment in Europe's largest economy coincides with a survey showing British consumer confidence also falling for the first time in six months. 
An easing of lockdown measures, coupled with an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus packages, led to a robust recovery in the third quarter from a 9.7% second-quarter slump, but a spike in new coronavirus cases has caused concern activity could slow again.
The number of confirmed cases in Germany rose by 8,685 to 437,866, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Monday.
The Ifo survey did not point to another economic slump, said ING economist Carsten Brzeski. ""But as all of Europe is in the second wave of the virus, today's Ifo index definitely marks the end of the rebound and the start of double-dip fears,"" he added.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe forecast fourth-quarter growth of 2.1%, but said that could prove too optimistic if rising infection rates triggered a second lockdown. Rising infections in France, Italy and Spain were also hitting exports, he added.
""The real hit would come if schools and kindergartens had to close,"" he said. ""That would have a massive impact on the economy and industry.""
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to avoid that scenario and on Saturday reinforced her appeal to Germans to curb social contacts and keep travel to a minimum.
Wohlrabe said the auto industry was one bright spot. ""The carmakers are doing really well at the moment.""
Recent German data has been mixed.
Consumer morale fell heading into November as fears about a second coronavirus wave made Germans less willing to spend, a survey showed last Thursday.

A separate survey on Friday showed private sector activity grew for the fourth month running in October. Manufacturing expansion accelerated, but services activity shrank, suggesting the economy is operating at two speeds.

Data firm IHS Markit said on Friday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to a reading of 55.5 this month. That was the highest since February 2019 and was up from 54.3 in September. A reading above 50 indicates growth in private sector output.
It said some manufacturers and service industry companies noted the coronavirus crisis had weighed on demand. The survey found other companies said a number of clients were holding back on placing orders until after the fiercely contested race to the White House between Republican President Donald Trump and former Vice President and Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden.
Growth in foreign client demand also slowed ""notably,"" with manufacturers reporting a renewed contraction in new export orders, IHS Markit said. 
Despite the reported pick-up in business activity, economists are predicting slower economic growth in the fourth quarter after what is believed to have been a record performance in the third quarter, thanks to a more than $3 trillion rescue package early this year for businesses and the unemployed.
But the fiscal stimulus is gone and new COVID-19 cases are rising around the country, which could lead to state and local government restrictions or more people shunning establishments like restaurants and bars, and undercut consumer spending.
The survey's flash composite new orders index dipped to 54.3 this month from a reading of 54.8 in September. 
Still, confidence among businesses is steadily improving.
The survey's flash services sector PMI rose to 56 this month, a 20-month high, from a reading of 54.6 in September.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 54.6 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone economic activity slipped back into decline this month as a second wave of the coronavirus sweeps across the continent, heightening expectations for a double-dip recession, surveys showed on Friday.
Renewed restrictions to control the pandemic forced many businesses in the bloc's dominant service industry to limit operations and nearly 90% of economists polled by Reuters this week said there was a high risk the coronavirus resurgence would halt the nascent euro zone economic recovery. [ECILT/EU]
""The euro zone PMI confirms that the second wave of the coronavirus is weighing more and more on the economy. A double-dip in the fourth quarter is becoming more likely at this rate,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good gauge of economic health, fell to 49.4 from September's final reading of 50.4.
That was below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and only fractionally better than the 49.3 predicted in a Reuters poll.
That headline PMI was dragged down by the service industry's PMI, which sank more than expected to 46.2 from 48.0.
""The further decline in the euro zone Composite PMI in October adds to the evidence that the second wave of infections, and the new wave of containment measures, is taking a heavy toll on the economy,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.
Friday's surveys showed the bloc's economy is running at two speeds, with manufacturing benefiting from strong global demand and services struggling to remain active as lockdowns force consumers to stay home and businesses to close.
Echoing the divide between services and manufacturing, German factories powered ahead this month, while in France activity contracted as a resurgence of the virus hit the euro zone's second-biggest economy.
Outside the currency bloc and now outside the European Union, Britain's economic recovery also lost more momentum as restrictions hit businesses in the hospitality and transport sectors.

WINTER IS COMING
It will likely be a chilling winter for the job market which until now has been shielded by government furlough schemes as the uncertain outlook meant firms reduced headcount for an eighth month.
The composite employment subindex nudged up slightly, but remained in negative territory, while the Reuters poll concluded that the bloc's jobless rate would not peak for at least six months.
With infection rates and the death toll rising, optimism fell. The services business expectations index dropped to 54.6 from 59.2, its lowest since May when the initial lockdowns were being eased.
A 750 billion euro stimulus plan agreed by the European Union in July to support its suffering economies will be delayed, a senior diplomat said on Thursday, which is also likely to have a negative impact on sentiment.
Still, factories fared much better than expected. The flash manufacturing PMI climbed to a 26-month high of 54.4 and was far above the median forecast in a Reuters poll.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, rose to its highest since early 2018.
Strong demand for manufactured goods meant factories were also able to increase their prices for the first time since mid-2019, albeit only slightly.

That will provide some relief to policymakers at the European Central Bank as inflation, which they want close to 2%, has been negative for two months.

An early ""flash"" reading of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a gauge of private sector growth, fell to a four-month low of 52.9 in October from 56.5 in September.
A Reuters poll of economists pointed to a smaller decline to 53.9.
""The pace of UK economic growth slowed in October to the weakest since the recovery from the national COVID-19 lockdown began,"" IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said.
""The weakening is most pronounced in the hospitality and transport sectors, as firms reported falling demand due to renewed lockdown measures and customers being deterred by worries over rising case numbers,"" he added.
The survey added to signs that the economic recovery is fading as COVID-19 cases surge, prompting some parts of the country to reimpose health restrictions that require pubs and restaurants to close early and limit social gatherings.
Britain's economy shrank 20% in the second quarter, the largest decline of any major advanced economy, and official data has shown that the initially rapid recovery was already beginning to falter in August.
Since then COVID cases have risen sharply, and on Thursday finance minister Rishi Sunak was forced to expand support for businesses struggling to pay their staff at a time when he had hoped to wean firms off state support.
New orders across British businesses fell in October for the first time since June, survey compiler IHS Markit said.
The services PMI, which covers the bulk of the economy, fell to 52.3 in October from 56.1 in September, its lowest level since June. The survey pointed to a month of heavy job losses.
The performance of the much smaller manufacturing sector was better, although similarly marked by a sharp drop in employment.

Industrial output is forecast to have risen 3.2% in September from the previous month, the poll of 16 economists showed on Friday, but the pace of increase has been slowing down from a record 8.7% jump in July.
""We expect factory output grew led by autos,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Exports are clearly recovering on a pickup in the economy overseas. So factory output is expected to recover led by exports.""

The trade ministry will announce retail sales data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Thursday, October 29 (2350 GMT Wednesday) and factory output data on Friday. 
The nation's jobless rate probably inched up to 3.1% in September from 3.0% in August, and the jobs-to-applicants ratio, a gauge of the availability of jobs, likely held steady at 1.04.
One analyst said some more people have started looking for jobs, which brings them back into the data but is part of the reason for a slightly higher unemployment rate as they haven't found jobs yet.
Tokyo's core consumer price (CPI) index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, likely fell 0.5% in October from a year earlier led by energy price falls, the poll found. 
The government will publish Tokyo core CPI and jobs data at 8:30 a.m. Japan time on Friday.

Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, slipped to 54.5 in October from 54.7 the previous month.
The reading surpassed the consensus forecast of analysts polled by Reuters, who expected a decline to 53.2, and was well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
Manufacturing proved robust, with the flash PMI rising to 58.0, its highest level since April 2018. The service sector contracted, however, with the flash PMI dipping to 48.9.
Markit economist Phil Smith said the survey data pointed to resilience in the economy in the face of a second wave of coronavirus cases, with the decline in service sector activity quite limited so far while manufacturing remained solid. 
""It's increasingly looking like a two-speed economy,"" he said. ""Manufacturing businesses have been able to continue operating with less disruption from any new restrictions than many of their service sector counterparts, whilst at the same time reaping the benefits of a resurgence in global goods trade.""
""As more manufacturers get back or close to pre-COVID-19 levels of activity, however, sustaining growth is going to become more challenging,"" Smith added.
The German government expects gross domestic product to shrink in 2020 by 5.8% before rebounding by 4.4% next year.

Berlin has since March implemented an array of rescue and stimulus measures, financed with record new borrowing of some 218 billion euros, which it hopes will help consumers and companies get out of the crisis more quickly.

The volume of goods sold in stores and online gained 1.5% from August, the Office for National Statistics said Friday, beating economists estimates for a reading of 0.2%. Sales were 17.4% higher in the third quarter following a lockdown-induced slump in the previous period.
While the report will be welcome for policy makers hoping to support the economy going into winter, there are already signs that rising unemployment and the prospect of a messy divorce from the European Union at the end of the year.
Household confidence was starting to retrench even before the virus flared up again, forcing many areas into renewed restrictions, a report by GfK showed Friday. The number of job cuts jumped the most on record in the June-August quarter.
Nevertheless, retail sales in September were 5.5% higher than in February, before the pandemic struck. They were led by home improvement items and garden centers. Grocery stores also saw an increase, while clothing sales dropped.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales beat expectations last month and grew for a fifth month in a row, capping a record quarter of growth that took total sales volumes to 5.5% above their level before the pandemic.
Retail sales volumes grew by 1.5% in September alone and are 4.7% higher than a year earlier, taking the annual rate above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Strong household demand has been the mainstay of Britain's recovery from the initial shock of the coronavirus lockdown, when output contracted by 20%, more than in any other major advanced economy.
Britain's economy is set to record a rapid rebound for the third quarter, and Friday's retail sales data showed a record 17.4% increase in sales volumes for the period.
However, rising coronavirus restrictions are hurting consumer morale and weighing on the broader economy.
""Total consumer spending will probably start to stutter over the next few months as the furlough scheme ends and unemployment rises, despite the increased generosity of the Job Support Scheme,"" said Thomas Pugh of Capital Economics.

British consumer sentiment fell this month by the most since a slump at the start of the coronavirus pandemic as lockdown restrictions tightened across much of the country, according to a long-running survey published on Friday.

The data release came after the country's official statistics agency released figures showing the inflation rate rose 0.7% in the September-quarter as coronavirus curbs eased, but still falling short of expectations. 

Both measures are closely watched by the RBNZ, which has spent almost a decade trying to get inflation above the middle of its 1%-3% target band.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices slipped for the second consecutive month in September, a sign that a coronavirus-induced demand downturn is piling deflationary pressure on the world's third-largest economy already blighted by recession.
The data is likely to heighten expectations the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will maintain its massive stimulus programme to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic, analysts said.
But analysts mainly blamed the drop on a government campaign aimed at promoting domestic travel, underscoring the tricky task of supporting the economy without pushing inflation further away from the central bank's 2% target.
""The declines in August and September were caused largely by the government's travel discount campaign,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Weak service-sector demand could exert further downward pressure on prices at least until the coronavirus is contained.""
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food but includes energy, fell 0.3% in September from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday. That compared with a median market forecast for a 0.4% decline.
When stripping away the effect of the government's travel discount campaign, core consumer prices were flat in September from a year earlier, the data showed.
The data will be among factors the BOJ will scrutinise at next week's rate review. People familiar with BOJ thinking have told Reuters the bank is likely to slash its economic and price forecasts for the current fiscal year.
Japan's economy suffered its biggest postwar slump in the second quarter of the year, and analysts expect any rebound to be modest due to soft consumption and capital spending.
While demand for durable goods is picking up, social distancing policies and fears over a resurgence in infections continue to weigh on service consumption.

As part of efforts to rescue Japan's ailing tourism sector, the government in July started a campaign offering discounts for domestic travel that is set to last until January next year.
 
"
507,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 08:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s key consumer prices fell at a slightly slower pace in September but failed to log gains for a sixth straight month with economists expecting worse to come over the coming months.
A gauge of prices excluding fresh food fell 0.3% from a year earlier, largely reflecting the impact of government travel subsidies, following a 0.4% drop in August, the ministry of internal affairs reported Friday. Analysts had forecast a 0.4% decline.
The result comes ahead of a meeting next week where the Bank of Japan will give its latest inflation forecasts. While the latest data may help ease concerns of a descent into longer-term deflation for the time being, additional factors are expected to weigh on prices from next month.

The GfK Consumer Confidence Index tumbled to -31 in October, its lowest level since late May and down sharply from a nine-month high of -25 in September, as well as being below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
The six-point fall in the index in the space of a month was the largest since the 25 point decline recorded just after the start of the lockdown in March.
""There's a worrying threat of a double-dip in consumer confidence as concerns for our personal financial situation and even deeper fears over the state of the UK economy drag the index down,"" GfK director Joe Staton said.
The index showed an especially large 12-point decline in households' outlook for the economy over the next 12 months.
Polling took place between Oct. 1 and Oct. 14 - before big cities such as Manchester moved to the highest tier of COVID lockdown - and GfK warned that sentiment risked falling further.
Strong household demand has been the mainstay of Britain's recovery from the initial shock of the coronavirus lockdown, when output contracted by 20%, more than in any other major advanced economy.
Retail sales in July and August were above pre-pandemic levels, and the number of house purchases in September was close to its level a year earlier.
Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said on Thursday that consumer spending had been unexpectedly resilient in Britain, and noted that in the United States a second wave of COVID cases had done little to dent spending there.
But other economists worry that a big part of the rebound has been driven by pent-up demand which is likely to fade, especially if unemployment climbs steeply in the final months of the year like the BoE forecast in August.
Britain's main furlough programme expires at the end of this month, and finance minister Rishi Sunak announced a fresh set of changes to its replacement on Thursday following warnings from business that it did too little to preserve jobs.

GfK conducted the survey on behalf of the European Commission.

Consumer prices rose 1.4% from a year earlier, Statistics New Zealand said Friday in Wellington. That compared with 1.5% in the second quarter, and was less than the 1.7% expected by economists. Prices rose 0.7% from three months earlier, less that the 0.9% forecast.
Inflation is set to weaken markedly next year as a sluggish economic recovery and rising unemployment exert downward pressure on wages and consumer spending. The Reserve Bank in August projected inflation would slow to just 0.3% by the end of 2021, and has signaled it is prepared to provide more stimulus through negative interest rates if needed. It targets inflation of 1-3%.

The companies signed up for $8.7 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, down from $10 billion a year earlier. Borrowings in September rose 24% from the previous month.
""Despite the drop in September year-over-year new business, a look at the data beginning with the advent of the pandemic in February shows that the industry, in general, is holding its own,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said.
""Anecdotal evidence from some ELFA member companies indicates they are enjoying a very strong year.""
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals rose to 72.9% in September from 71% in August.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, but remained very high as the labor market recovery shows signs of strain amid a relentless COVID-19 pandemic and ebbing fiscal stimulus.
While other data on Thursday showed home sales racing to a more than 14-year high in September, economic activity is slowing heading into the fourth quarter. A measure of the economy's prospects increased moderately last month.
The slow and uneven recovery from the worst economic downturn in at least 73 years and uncontrolled coronavirus crisis could cost Republican President Donald Trump a second four-year term in the White House when Americans vote on Nov. 3. Trump is trailing former Vice President and Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden in national opinion polls. 
""There are still millions and millions on the nation's unemployment rolls because many of the jobs lost during the steepest downturn in economic history have not yet returned,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Time will tell if the still-record number of people out of work will act as a brake on the economic recovery or whether the economy's fortunes depend more on the course of the virus."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 55,000 to a seasonally adjusted 787,000 for the week ended Oct. 17. Data for the prior week was revised to show 56,000 fewer applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 860,000 claims in the latest week. California, the most populous state in the nation, resumed the processing of new applications after a two-week pause in late September to combat fraud. 
Unadjusted claims fell 73,125 to 756,617 last week. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state jobless programs, 1.1 million people filed claims last week.

First-time claims have been stuck above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though they have declined from a record 6.867 million in March. A more than $3 trillion rescue package early this year provided a lifeline for many businesses, allowing them to keep workers on payrolls. It also lifted economic activity from the recession, which started in February. 
Though Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are working out details of a new relief package, a deal is unlikely before the Nov. 3 presidential election amid stiff opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate.
With funding depleted, businesses, especially in the transportation industry, are either laying off or furloughing workers as demand remains subdued. More pain lies ahead amid a resurgence in new coronavirus cases around the country, which could lead to state and local government restrictions or more people shunning establishments like restaurants and bars.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
SOFT PAYROLLS NUMBER?
Last week's claims report covered the period during which the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm payrolls component of October's employment report. Payrolls increased by 661,000 jobs in September, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May.
""Elevated initial jobless claims and the unwind of temporary Census hiring means we could get a soft payrolls number,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""A weak figure would probably be a more significant catalyst for politicians to deliver action on fiscal stimulus.""
Though the claims report showed a further decline in the number of people on unemployment rolls in early October, that was in part due to millions exhausting their eligibility for benefits, which are limited to six months in most states.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 1.024 million to 8.373 million in the week ending Oct. 10, the lowest in nearly seven months.
At least 3.296 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Oct. 3, up 509,823 from the prior week. Economists said claims for extended benefits, which expire in December, were understated.
""Today's report does not include 600,000 recipients in Florida listed on the state's dashboard, as well as workers in major states like Washington and Texas who report delays of up to one month between programs,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation in New York. 
A staggering 23.2 million people were on unemployment benefits at the beginning of October.
Unemployment has, however, disproportionately affected lower-wage workers. With many higher-paid employees working from home, there has been a housing market boom, with home sales jumping 9.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.54 million units in September, the highest level since May 2006.

But the housing market's strength is not enough to offset weakness elsewhere. The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators rose 0.7% last month, slowing from a 1.4% increase in August.

That is consistent with economists' projections for slower growth in the fourth quarter after what is believed to have been a record performance in the third quarter.

(Reuters) - Investors have been buying options on eurodollar futures and interest rate swaps to bet on higher rates and falling U.S. Treasury debt prices if lawmakers pass more fiscal stimulus after next month’s presidential election, if not before.
Investors are betting that eurodollars, which reflect shorter-term rate expectations, could fall in price on a growing expectation of a Federal Reserve rate hike as soon as 2023.
This can be seen in increased demand for put options that pay off when prices fall, and higher implied volatility, a key component of options pricing that rises and falls with demand.
“The very front-end has been awoken from its slumber. There are a number of options trades going through, particularly in the eurodollar space, targeting a tightening of policy in 2023/2024,” said Michael de Pass, global head of U.S. Treasury trading at Citadel Securities.
Short-term rate markets have been moribund for months as the Fed commits to holding rates near zero to tackle economic weakness after businesses shut down to try to stem the spread of COVID-19.
“We were coming off an incredibly low base for implied volatility and that’s ticked up a bit over the last couple of weeks,” de Pass said.
The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA MOVE index, a measure of Treasury market volatility, has jumped to around 60, from a record low of 37 reached in September. It remains well below the high of 164 reached at the peak of market volatility in March.
The White House and Democrats in the U.S. Congress are in discussions about pumping trillions more dollars into the economy.
Even if a deal is not reached, investors see a jump in spending as likely after the Nov. 3 election, with a larger bill more likely if Democrats win control of the U.S Senate.
Trading volumes in options on Eurodollar futures have jumped to 7.67 million contracts so far this month, more than were traded in each of August and September, though volumes remain lower than earlier this year, data from the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) show.
Put options make up 63% of October's activity, up from 42% of volumes in June, and 30% in March, CME data show.
Options referencing Eurodollar futures that mature in 2023 and 2024 also make up 36% of October's total options trading volume, up from 16% in June and only 2% in March, CME said. 
Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), said there has also been an increase in bearish trades placed in swaptions, or options based on interest rate swaps. Swaps are exchanges of interest rate payments and are used to bet on or protect against a rate change.
“With the rise in yields people are trying to gauge if perhaps we could see an earlier start to Fed rate hikes than what the market’s currently pricing in,” she said.
The predominance of short positions, however, could lead to investors taking profits during any further bout of weakness, which in turn could cap the extent of yield increases, Rajappa said.
Benchmark 10-year yields hit a four-month high of 0.853% on Thursday and five-year yields reached 0.378%, up from a record low of 0.189% in August.
Analysts caution that ongoing economic weakness and global demand for yield could limit any large increase in bond yields.
The Fed is also expected to shift more of its bond purchases to longer-dated debt if it sees yields rising faster than economic growth warrants.
But options are ""a cheap hedge,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. Yields “tend to move in pretty defined patterns in the sense they tend to grind, grind, grind lower, and then they pop higher on something.”

""It's hard to hedge those types of moves and you are only able to do it in the options market,"" he said.

513,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales surged to a more than 14-year high in September, boosted by historically low mortgage rates, but record high prices amid a shortage of houses could curb further gains.
The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that existing home sales jumped 9.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.54 million units last month, the highest level since May 2006. Data for August was revised down to a rate of 5.98 million units from the previously reported 6 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales increasing 5% to a rate of 6.30 million units in September. 
Existing home sales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, vaulted 20.9% on a year-on-year basis in September. 
Sales increased in all four regions and were concentrated in the upper price end of the market. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a migration to the suburbs and low-density areas as Americans seek more space for home offices and schooling, making the housing market the star of the economy's recovery from the recession, which started in February. Staggering unemployment, which has left 23.2 million people on unemployment benefits, has disproportionately affected low-wage workers, who are typically young and renters.
But housing market activity could slow in the fourth quarter, with applications for loans to purchase of home falling in the past four weeks, likely because of the tight inventory. 
There were 1.47 million previously owned homes on the market in September, the fewest since the NAR started tracking the series in 1982, down 19.2% from a year ago. As a result, the median existing house price soared 14.8% from a year ago to $311,800 in September.
At September's sales pace, it would take 2.7 months to exhaust the current inventory, the shortest since 1982. That was down from 3.0 months in August and 4.0 months in September 2019. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

514,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 09:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The number of Californians who filed for unemployment benefits the week ended Oct. 10 was almost almost a quarter less than previously reported, according to Labor Department figures that show a better trajectory than previously thought for the U.S. labor market because of the state’s size.
For the three weeks spanning late September and early October, federal reports on jobless claims showed California’s number of applications for state benefits stuck at the mid-September level of 226,179 while the state paused processing to whittle down a massive backlog and improve fraud prevention. That skewed the national reading higher because it didn’t reflect the true picture of claims in the most populous state, which is home to one of eight Americans.
A technical note included with Labor’s claims report on Thursday said California completed its pause in claims processing and resumed reporting actual unemployment insurance filings data based on weekly activity. The revised state data showed claims in California at 171,220 for the week ended Sept. 26 and 148,213 for the following week -- both significant drops from the previously reported placeholder number of 226,179. Thursday’s main U.S. report showed 176,083 Californians filed initial claims during the week ended Oct. 10.

Investing.com -- The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits fell to 787,000 last week, the lowest since April, but remained at levels indicating that the recovery in the labor market is struggling for momentum as the coronavirus pandemic enters its first full winter.
Economists had forecast a decline to 860,000. The prior week's figure was revised down to 842,000 from an initially reported 898,000.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, fell sharply for a second straight week to 8.373 million. The previous week's figure was revised down to 9.397 million. Continuing claims are falling in part because many people have exhausted their eligibility for regular state benefits.
The Labor Department said that California had completed its pause in processing of initial claims and had resumed reporting new claims as part of the national total. The report reflected the count for California for the current week and revisions to the two previous weeks. Earlier this month, the state said it needed to suspend data filings in order to reduce its claims processing backlog and implement fraud prevention technology.
""The return of California to the mix with better data revised down the level of claims for previous weeks but not as much as hoped,"" said Grant Thornton chief economist Diane Swonk via Twitter. 
The report comes as talks in Washington over a economic stimulus deal drag on amid doubts over whether the negotiations would continue or pause until after the Nov. 3 election. The number of all people claiming unemployment-related benefits fell by just over 1 million to 23.15 million, as of October 3, the last date for which such data are available.
Grant Thornton's Swonk noted that the number of those applying for extended unemployment benefits increased, which she said was  ""a sign of deeper scarring and an inability to recall more workers.""
""This is starting to look like a more traditional and longer recession, which bolsters the case for more stimulus now,"" Swonk added."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's government borrowing in the first half of the financial year was more than six times higher than before the COVID pandemic, official figures showed on Wednesday, taking public debt to its highest since 1960.
Public borrowing in September alone totalled 36.101 billion pounds ($46.90 billion), above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, although August's figure was revised down by more than 5 billion pounds to 30.113 billion pounds.
The increased borrowing took total public debt further above the 2 trillion pound mark to 2.060 trillion pounds or 103.5% of GDP, its highest on this measure since 1960, the Office for National Statistics said.
Driven by a surge in coronavirus-related spending and a fall in tax revenue after the biggest economic hit since at least the 1920s, borrowing from April to September totalled 208.5 billion pounds, over six times more than for the same time in 2019.
Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility predicted in August that borrowing would reach a record 372 billion pounds by the end of this financial year, equivalent to 18.9% of gross domestic product, the most since World War Two. 
Borrowing to date is below what the OBR pencilled in for this point in the tax year, though the ONS data does not yet include the cost of defaults on government-backed COVID loans which the OBR has factored in.
Spending risks rising again in the second half of the financial year as lockdown restrictions return to much of the United Kingdom, pressuring the government to offer extra support to closed businesses and their workers.
""The OBR's forecast for public borrowing of 372 billion still looks about right,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) downgraded Britain's sovereign credit rating on Friday to the same level as Belgium's and the Czech Republic's, warning that Britain ""effectively has no fiscal anchor"". 
But financial markets have shrugged off rising borrowing, and 10-year government borrowing costs (GB10YT=RR) of around 0.2% are only slightly above an all-time low struck at the start of the pandemic. 
Economists polled by Reuters expect the Bank of England to launch a further 100 billion pounds of bond purchases next month, adding to the 300 billion pounds announced since March.
Britain's government had aimed to set out a three-year plan for public spending next month, but said on Wednesday this would only cover one year due to COVID uncertainty, with exceptions for schools, healthcare and some infrastructure.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak said after the data his ""enduring priority"" would be to protect jobs during the crisis.
""Over time and as the economy recovers, the government will take the necessary steps to ensure the long-term health of the public finances,"" he said.

Separately, the Office for National Statistics said annual consumer price inflation in September rose to 0.5% in September from 0.2% in August, when it had been reduced by a temporary scheme to promote dining in restaurants.

519,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 10:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian consumer spending fell in September, the first back-to-back monthly decline this year, as demand eased in industries like food and household goods that have remained buoyant during Covid restrictions.
Preliminary retail sales slid 1.5% from the previous month, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday in Sydney. All states and territories, bar the Northern Territory, fell in September. Victoria state recorded a small monthly decline, following a large drop in August, the bureau said.
“Food retailing, household goods retailing, and other retailing, which includes online only retailers, recorded falls this month,” said Ben James, director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys at the ABS. “These industries have recorded elevated levels of turnover during the Covid-19 pandemic.”
The data span a period when Victoria remained under hard lockdown to combat a renewed outbreak of coronavirus -- and it remains the only state or territory to be trading below September 2019 levels. While Australian households’ consumption has been constrained by virus-related restrictions, their incomes have risen due to huge government stimulus and central bank easing.
That’s left the savings ratio at the highest level since the 1970s.
Sales of clothing, footwear and personal accessories all fell last month, according to the ABS. This was partly offset by rises in department stores, and cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services, which recorded gains after significant falls in August, the bureau said.
Slump Down Under
While Australia tipped into its first recession in almost three decades due to the coronavirus requiring large tracts of the economy to be shuttered, the hit has been less than in many developed-world peers. Yet, unemployment is tipped to rise further as Victoria reopens and government support programs wind down.
Retail sales have been volatile through the Covid period, posting a record decline in April when national lockdown peaked, before rebounding by a record in May as restrictions were eased. Sales have also benefited from panic buying at supermarkets and households spending on goods for their home.
Australia is now entering the Southern Hemisphere summer, which may provide some respite from the virus. This contrasts with weather conditions in Europe and the U.S., with the former already experiencing a sharp increase in cases.
Consumer confidence Down Under surged further this month, with optimists now outweighing pessimists, following an expansionary budget and greater containment of the virus. The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to ease policy further next month, with the key interest rate currently at 0.25% and a yield target on the three-year government bond at the same level.

Exports fell 5.8% in the first 20 days of the month from a year earlier, according to customs office data released Wednesday. the value of average daily shipments still rose 5.9%, as the period had 1.5 fewer business days compared with last year.
South Korea’s trade data serve as a barometer of global demand. The rise in daily shipments suggests overseas demand is slowly picking up as countries adapt to life with the coronavirus.
South Korea’s memory chips have been among the biggest beneficiaries from the pandemic-driven increase in remote work and schooling arrangements. The country’s exports are also expected to get a boost from a broadening economic recovery in China, its biggest trade partner.
“The rise in Korea’s main products such as semiconductors should help keep the overall exports on the rise,” said Lee Jae-sun, an analyst at Hana Financial Investment Co. “Given China’s speedier recovery than other countries, Korea should see its exports of intermediate goods gradually increasing.”
South Korea’s semiconductor shipments increased 12% during Oct. 1-20, despite the smaller number of working days, while exports to China fell 4.6%.
The country’s national Chuseok holiday fell on Sept. 30-Oct. 2, as opposed to mid-September last year, likely disturbing trade performance at the start of October.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding raced to a more than 13-year high in September, cementing the housing market's status as the star of the economic recovery amid record-low mortgage rates and a migration to the suburbs and low-density areas in search of more room for home offices and schooling. 
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed building permits and housing completions scaling levels last seen in 2007. That could help to ease an acute shortage of homes for sale, which has fueled house price inflation.
The data reinforced expectations that the economy rebounded sharply in the third quarter after suffering its deepest contraction in at least 73 years in the second quarter. But the recovery from the COVID-19 recession has entered a period of uncertainty, with fiscal stimulus depleted.
""It appears the strength in housing is being driven by the first-time home buyer coming off the sidelines and taking advantage of historically low mortgage rates along with the opportunity to purchase a home in a location they might not otherwise consider outside of the current work-from-home environment,"" said Scott Volling, principal at PwC in Atlanta.
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, jumped 8.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.108 million units last month, the highest level since June 2007. That offset a 16.3% decline in starts for the volatile multi-family segment to a pace of 307,000 units. 
Overall, housing starts increased 1.9% to a rate of 1.415 million units last month. Groundbreaking activity rose in the West, South and Northeast, but fell in the Midwest.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts increasing to a rate of 1.457 million units in September. 
Homebuilding advanced 11.1% year-on-year, with single-family starts surging 22.3%. Further gains in single-family home construction are likely, with building permits shooting up 7.8% to a rate of 1.119 million units last month, the highest level since March 2007. 
Builders are taking advantage of the strong demand, lean inventories and low mortgage rates to ramp-up construction. A survey on Monday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders hit a record high in October. 
But builders said constructing affordable homes was becoming increasingly challenging because ""shortages of lots, labor, lumber and other key building materials are lengthening construction times.""
The PHLX housing index was trading higher, outperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. The dollar dipped versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
BRIGHT SPOT
The housing market has been a bright spot in the economy despite 25.3 million people being on unemployment benefits. Unemployment has disproportionately affected low-wage workers, who are typically young and renters. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.81%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
The Commerce Department report suggested a swift turnaround in the housing market in the third quarter after an unprecedented collapse in the April-June quarter. Data last week showed an acceleration in retail sales in September. 
Growth estimates for the July-September quarter are as high as a 35.2% annualized rate, which would recoup roughly two-thirds of the output lost because of the coronavirus. 
The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947. With government money gone, growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been slashed to as low as a 3% rate from above a 10% pace.
""We expect some moderation in the pace of housing starts in the fourth quarter as a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, a slow recovery and a weak labor market take a toll on the resilient housing sector,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""However, in the immediate term, the risk may be for further upside surprises.""
Overall permits for future homebuilding increased 5.2% to a rate of 1.553 million units in September, the highest since March 2007. Multi-family building permits slipped 0.9% to a rate of 434,000 units.
""The relative strength of single-family construction compared to multifamily units could partly reflect a shift in housing demand away from multifamily structures in more densely populated cities and towards single-family units in suburbs and less populated areas,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""This trend would also be consistent with softer rents but resilient house prices recently.""
Housing completions vaulted 15.3% to a rate of 1.413 million units last month, the highest since August 2007. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap. The stock of housing under construction was unchanged at a rate of 1.209 million units.

""We expect housing starts for the year to total around 1.4 million units,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""This is one of those very rare periods when starts will rise during a recession year.""

Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a tiered system of restrictions on parts of England, including shutting pubs in the worst affected areas, to curb an acceleration in infections.
Springboard said total shopper numbers, or footfall, fell 3.1% in the week to Oct. 17 versus the previous week. It was down 2.8% on high streets, down 3% in retail parks and down 3.5% in shopping centres.
“The additional COVID tiered restrictions had an immediate impact on footfall in retail destinations last week with an across the board week on week decline,"" said Springboard director Diane Wehrle.
Footfall in the north of England and Yorkshire region fell 5%, reflecting the tighter restrictions there.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economic recovery accelerated in the third quarter as consumers shook off their coronavirus caution, although the weaker-than-expected headline growth suggested persistent risks for one of the few drivers of global demand.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 4.9% in July-September from a year earlier, official data showed on Monday, slower than the 5.2% forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll but faster than the second quarter's 3.2% growth.
""China's economy remains on the recovery path, driven by a rebound in exports. Consumer spending is also headed in the right direction, but we cannot say it has completely shaken off the drag caused by the coronavirus,"" said Yoshikiyo Shimamine, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo.
""There is a risk that the return of lockdowns in Europe and another wave of infections in the United States will hurt consumer spending and trigger more job losses, which would be a negative for China's economy.""
The weaker-than-expected headline figures weighed on China's yuan  and mainland stock benchmarks (SSEC) (CSI300) and capped broader market gains in Asia.
The world's second-largest economy grew 0.7% in the first nine months from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
Graphic - China's V-shaped recovery? https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-ECONOMY/GDP/qzjpqaewypx/chart.png
Policymakers globally are pinning their hopes on a robust recovery in China to help restart demand as economies struggle with heavy lockdowns and a second wave of coronavirus infections.
China has partially emerged from a record slump caused by coronavirus shutdowns in the first months of the year.
NBS spokeswoman Liu Aihua warned that growth remained patchy.
""Internally, the economy is still in the process of recovery,"" she told a briefing in Beijing. ""Some or most of the indicators have not returned to the normal growth level, and some of the cumulative growth rate has also declined.""
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP rose 2.7% in the third quarter, the NBS said, compared with expectations for a 3.2% rise and an 11.5% rise in the previous quarter.
But despite the headline disappointment, analysts were encouraged by a broader upturn in consumption and continued factory strength.
Retail sales grew 3.3% in September from a year earlier, speeding up from a modest 0.5% rise in August and posting the fastest growth since December 2019. Industrial output grew 6.9% after a 5.6% rise in August, showing the factory sector's recovery was gaining momentum.
Fixed-asset investment rose 0.8% in the first nine months from a year earlier, returning to year-to-date growth for the first time this year.
In the property sector, investment rose 12% in September from a year earlier, the fastest pace in nearly 1-1/2 years, providing a key support for broader investment.
The government has rolled out a raft of measures including more fiscal spending, tax relief and cuts in lending rates and banks' reserve requirements to revive the coronavirus-hit economy and support employment.
While the central bank stepped up policy support after widespread travel restrictions choked economic activity, it has more recently held off on further easing.
The International Monetary Fund has forecast an expansion of 1.9% for China for 2020, which is close to the central bank's own projection of 2%.
That would make China the only major economy expected to report growth in 2020, albeit at the slowest annual pace since 1976, the final year of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. 
CONSUMERS STEP UP
China's retail spending has lagged the comeback in factory activity this year as heavy job losses and persistent worries about infections kept consumers at home, even as restrictions lifted.
However, recent indicators suggest consumer activity is now turning around.
In the travel sector, domestic passenger flights in September beat their COVID-19 levels, a sign that that segment of the market is approaching a full recovery, even as international borders remain largely shut.
Auto sales marked a sixth straight month of gains in September while  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) China vehicle sales jumped 25% in the third quarter from a year earlier.
The breakdown of GDP showed final consumption accounted for 1.7 percentage points growth, while capital formation accounted for 2.6 percentage points and net exports contributed 0.6 percentage points, NBS said.
The coronavirus outbreak, which caused China's first contraction since at least 1992 in the first quarter, is now largely under control in the country, although there has been a small resurgence of cases in the eastern province of Shandong.
""The single most important thing for the Chinese economy in the coming months is whether service consumption can catch up,"" said Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Capital in Hong Kong.

Investing.com – Chinese quarterly growth data for the third quarter showed a continuing economic recovery from the impact of COVID-19. However, overall growth missed forecasts, indicating that challenges remain in the road ahead for the country.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics released earlier in the day showed that GDP grew 4.9% year-on-year, smaller than the 5.2% predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but larger than the second quarter’s 3.2% growth. The GDP’s quarter-on-quarter growth stood at 2.7%, which also missed the forecast 3.2% growth and much smaller than the second quarter's 11.5% growth.
Industrial production grew 6.9% year-on-year in September, beating the forecast 5.8% growth and August’s 5.6% growth. Retail sales grew 3.3% year-on-year in the same month, also beating the forecast 1.8% and August’s 0.5% growth. The unemployment rate was 5.4%, down from the previous quarter’s 5.6% reading.
“The rebound in Q3 GDP was less strong than expected, but was still a decent 4.9% year-on-year … September data beat expectations, suggesting a pickup in momentum towards the latter part of the third quarter ... The pickup in momentum was broad-based, which bodes well for the fourth quarter outlook,” Westpac head of macro strategy for Asia Frances Cheung told Reuters.
However, as the number of  COVID-19 cases continues to rise globally and new restrictive measures in Europe and the U.S. revive fears of fresh lockdowns, the data comes as a disappointment to investors who were expecting the data to show a robust recovery.
China has seen a steady recovery from the economic impact of the lockdowns seen during the first quarter to curb the spread of COVID-19, and the uptick in retail sales also pointed to increasing consumption in the third quarter. The government has also rolled out measures, including increased fiscal spending, tax relief and cuts in lending rates and banks’ reserve requirements, to aid the economic recovery and support employment. China is the only country forecast to report growth in 2020 by the International Monetary Fund, with the country expected to report a 1.9% expansion for the full year.
However, persistently high unemployment and feats of a fresh COVID-19 outbreak has been China’s Achilles’ heel on the road to recovery. Premier Li Keqiang warned earlier in the month that China needs to make arduous efforts to achieve its full-year economic goals.
Meanwhile, the country continues to monitor a new outbreak of cases in the city of Qingdao, with 13 cases reported for Oct. 17."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell in September at the slowest pace in seven months as U.S.-bound vehicle shipments rose from lows brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating easing pressure on the world's third-largest economy.
Exports fell 4.9% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, more than the 2.4% economists forecast in a Reuters poll. Still, the pace followed six months of double-digit decline, including a 14.8% drop in August.
Fewer exports of iron to Taiwan and ships to Panama left September marking the 22nd consecutive month of export decline, the longest run since the 23-month stretch through July 1987.
To help the economy through the health crisis, the government should compile a third extra budget for the current fiscal year, economists told Reuters last week. The two earlier budgets helped fund $2.2 trillion in economic stimulus, such as cash payments to households and small business loans.
Indeed, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga plans to order his government to compile another stimulus plan as early as November, to support consumer sentiment at risk from a new wave of COVID-19 infection, local media reported.
Still, the slowing decline in exports adds to other signs of gradual economic recovery such as a pickup in factory output.
""Production has recovered substantially, but as that's mostly a rebound after sharp falls, the recovery pace will probably slow,"" likely after year-end, said chief economist Yuichi Kodama at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.
Moreover, a recovery in exports would likely have limited impact on the size of any further stimulus package given the focus will likely be on helping firms suffering from weak domestic demand, Kodama said.
By destination, shipments to the United States rose 0.7%, the first increase in 14 months, driven by stronger demand for electrical power machinery as well as passenger cars, whose numbers jumped 18%.
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 14.0%, the sharpest rise since January 2018. Those to Asia as a whole fell 2.0%, their slowest pace of decline since February.
Imports shed 17.2% versus the 21.4% median estimate of economists polled by Reuters, resulting in a trade surplus of 675.0 billion yen ($6.41 billion).
Marcel Thieliant, Japan economist at Capital Economics, said imports of goods and services may return to pre-virus levels until the end of 2022.

""The upshot is that after knocking three percentage points from GDP growth in Q2, net exports will support growth over the coming quarters.""

530,"<span>Oct 18, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic recovery from the depths plunged during the Covid-19 pandemic is providing support for a world economy suffering its deepest recession since the Great Depression.
Third quarter data due at 10 a.m. in Beijing Monday is expected to show gross domestic product climbed 5.5% from the same period a year earlier, according to the median of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Retail sales, investment and industrial production are all forecast to pick up in September, suggesting the recovery is broadening.
If the numbers meet expectations, that’ll mean the world’s second-largest economy -- and the first to suffer from the virus shock -- will have regained all the ground it lost in the first half.
Underpinning the recovery has been an aggressive containment of the deadly coronavirus that has allowed factories to quickly reopen and capitalise on a global rush for medical equipment and work-from-home technology -- a dynamic that helped exporters win record market share in the seven months to July.
Shoppers have been more cautious, but robust spending through the recent Golden Week holidays suggest they too are starting to open their wallets again.
The recovery has come with relatively restrained government borrowing and central bank easing compared to China’s peers. Instead, the government has focused on targeted support for business, a contrast to how it responded to the global financial crisis.
“China is supporting the world in a different way from what it did after 2008,” said Shen Jianguang, chief economist of e-commerce giant, JD (NASDAQ:JD).com. “A slowing economy means it could not afford another stimulus in 2020. Instead, it did its job by serving as the ‘supplier of last resort.’”
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“The path of industrial production is the most relevant for China’s production-based GDP growth data. Based on production growth in July and August and our projection for September, we estimate GDP growth at 5.3% year on year for 3Q, though recent signs point to some upside to the projection.”

Analysis of International Monetary Fund data shows the proportion of worldwide growth coming from China is expected to increase from 26.8% in 2021 to 27.7% in 2025, according to Bloomberg calculations.
The IMF says Chinese growth is virtually the only reason it expects global output to be 0.6% higher by the end of 2021 compared to the end of 2019.
But the recovery isn’t without its holes. The economy is still forecast to be only 0.7% larger in the nine months through September than it was in the same period in 2019. At the start of the year the government expected full-year growth of around 6%.
And consumers have been slow to spend as they once did. Even with the virus under control, shoppers have spent about 9% less in the first eight months of the year compared to the same period last year.
It’s also unclear how durable the recovery will prove to be given domestic pressures from unemployment and rising corporate and household debt. China Evergrande Group, the world’s most indebted developer, has rattled investors amid fears for its financial health.
Much will also depend on how relations with the U.S. evolve after November’s presidential election. Any worsening of trade frictions could throw a spanner in the export revival. At the same time, the resurgent virus in Europe and the U.S. will complicate the global rebound and could impair China’s own recovery.
Getting the economy quickly back on its feet is crucial to China’s global ambitions. They were hammered home last week by President Xi Jinping during a tour of tech-hub Shenzhen, where he doubled down on calls to take the global lead in technology and other strategic industries.
Urging an “unswerving” commitment to technological innovation in a period of “changes unseen in a century,” Xi again promoted a need to become more self reliant, a policy that is expected to be a central part of a new 5-year economic plan that will be discussed at a Communist Party gathering expected later this month.

That focus on driving growth in new economy sectors like consumption, technology and services means investment there is outstripping that in old sectors, making this cycle different from the credit and construction boom post 2008, noted Cui Li, head of macro research at CCB International Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong.
“An industrial cycle led by the economic upgrade and the absence of a large credit expansion will make this growth recovery more sustainable,” she said. “The Chinese recovery will sustain.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. budget deficit hit a record $3.132 trillion during fiscal 2020, more than triple the 2019 shortfall due to massive coronavirus rescue spending, the U.S. Treasury said on Friday.
The deficit more than doubled the previous record of $1.416 trillion in fiscal 2009, when the United States was battling a financial crisis.
At the start of the 2020 fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the U.S. government had been forecast to rack up a $1 trillion deficit before coronavirus lockdowns began in March, shutting down large portions of the travel, retail and small business sectors of the economy.
Outlays for fiscal 2020 jumped $2.105 trillion from 2019 to a total of $6.55 trillion, with the increase made up almost entirely from coronavirus aid programs: increased healthcare costs, stimulus checks and unemployment compensation, along with the cost of small business and corporate rescue programs approved by Congress.
As a result of programs that kept paychecks flowing to laid off workers through September, receipts for the full year fell only about 1% or $43 billion from fiscal 2019, totaling $3.42 trillion.
The final fiscal 2020 deficit numbers come as the Trump administration and Congress have been unable to agree on a new round of coronavirus stimulus, with many Senate Republicans calling for fiscal restraint in another package.
A joint statement from the U.S. Treasury and the White House Office of Management and Budget emphasized an ""incredible comeback"" of economic activities as businesses reopened over the summer months.
""The administration remains fully committed to supporting American workers, families, and businesses and to ensuring that our robust economic rebound continues,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.
In September, the year's final month, the U.S. budget deficit was $125 billion, compared with an $83 billion surplus in September 2019, the Treasury said.

September receipts totaled $373 billion, just $1 billion below a year earlier as higher Federal Reserve earnings and excise tax collections made up for lower personal and corporate income tax receipts. September outlays rose by $206 billion from a year earlier to $498 billion, due to COVID-19 related spending.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales accelerated in September, rounding out a strong quarter of economic activity, but the recovery from the COVID-19 recession is at a crossroads as government money runs out and companies continue to layoff workers.
New coronavirus cases are also surging across the country, which could lead to restrictions on businesses like restaurants, gyms and bars, and undercut consumer spending. The economy is already shifting into lower gear. Other data on Friday showed an unexpected drop in output at factories last month.
""Although sales growth is strong, it will slow through the rest of this year and into next year,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""The slowing will be even larger if Congress does not pass another stimulus bill. Unemployment remains pervasive throughout the U.S. economy.""
Retail sales jumped 1.9% last month as consumers bought motor vehicles and clothing, dined out and splashed out on hobbies. That followed an unrevised 0.6% increase in August.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would rise 0.7% in September. Some said September's surge was likely exaggerated by difficulties stripping seasonal fluctuations from the data after the shock caused by COVID-19. Unadjusted retail sales fell 2.8% after dropping 1.0% in August.
Retail sales have bounced back above their February level, with the pandemic boosting demand for goods that complement life at home, including furniture and electronics. An aversion to public transportation has boosted motor vehicle purchases. Retail sales rose 5.4% on a year-on-year basis in September. 
They account for the goods component of consumer spending, with services such as healthcare, education, travel and hotel accommodation making up the other portion. 
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, sales increased 1.4% last month after a downwardly revised 0.3% drop in August. 
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have dipped 0.1% in August.
Economists have attributed the strength in retail sales to fiscal stimulus, especially a weekly subsidy paid to tens of millions of unemployed Americans. September's robust sales reinforced expectations for record consumer spending and economic growth in the third quarter.
Growth estimates for the July-September quarter are as high as a 35.2% annualized rate. That would recoup roughly two-thirds of the output lost because of COVID-19. The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947.
U.S. stocks bounced from three straight days of losses on the retail sales data and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s announcement that it could apply for emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate as early as November.
BROAD SALES GAINS 
Last month, sales at auto dealerships surged 3.6%. Receipts at restaurants and bars increased 2.1%. Receipts at clothing stores jumped 11.0%.
""Some of the gain may have reflected increased demand from back to school sales, but with most schools remote learning the reported strength seems dramatic and likely unsustainable,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.
Even with September's gains, sales at bars, restaurants and clothing stores remain well below their pre-pandemic levels. 
Purchases at electronics and appliance stores fell 1.6%. 
Online and mail-order retail sales rose 0.5%. Furniture store sales gained 0.5%. Sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores rebounded 5.7%. These categories notched big year-on-year increases in September, which economists said showed the uneven impact of the recession.
""It's further evidence of how many top earners have managed to dodge the pandemic by working from home, while most lower- paid workers have been forced to choose between jobs putting them at risk, when they can find them, and unemployment,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York.
The White House and Congress are struggling to reach a deal on another rescue package for businesses and the unemployed. The government reported on Thursday that new claims for unemployment benefits increased to a two-month high last week.
Last month's jump in retail sales set consumer spending on a higher growth path heading into the fourth quarter, which will likely ensure that the economy continues to expand, though at a moderate pace. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been slashed to as low as a 3% rate from above a 10% pace. 
Some economists believe that historic savings could cushion consumer spending in the absence of more financial aid from the government. Others, however, caution that rising COVID-19 infections and job losses could encourage some consumers to hunker down and conserve savings.
A survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumer sentiment edging up in early October. 
Consumers, however, worried about current economic conditions because of ""slowing employment growth, the resurgence in COVID-19 infections and the absence of additional federal relief payments.""
They were less enthusiastic about buying household appliances. The share who believed it was a good time to buy a car was the lowest in nine years.

(Reuters) - Democratic consumers gained ground on their Republican counterparts in their assessment of the economic outlook in early October as the race for the White House that appears increasingly to favor their candidate enters its final stretch.
Overall U.S. consumer sentiment inched up to a seven-month high in early October, led by an uptick in optimism for the future, according to the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers sentiment index.
But the gain largely came on the back of consumers identifying as Democrats who grew markedly more optimistic, while confidence in the future among those identifying as Republicans increased just negligibly. 
Readings for economic expectations hit their low-water marks for consumers from both parties in May - after two straight months of nationwide business shutdowns to contain COVID-19 tanked the economy. Since then, optimism for the future among Democrats has rebounded sharply, even as their assessment of current conditions has barely improved, an improvement that dovetails with the trajectory of polls showing a widening lead for Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden over the incumbent Republican president, Donald Trump.
In fact, the University of Michigan's expectations index for Democratic consumers has improved by 44% off May's low versus a gain of just 15% among Republican consumers.
Throughout Trump's presidency, Republicans have been more inclined to have a brighter economic outlook than Democrats, just as Democrats tended to have a rosier view throughout the eight years of Barack Obama's term in the Oval Office. But that Republican margin of optimism now stands at its narrowest of Trump's presidency.
Among all households in the survey, 52% now expect a Biden win versus 48% in July, August and September, while those seeing a Trump victory dropped to 45% from 47% over the same period. That represents a net gain of six percentage points for Biden.
Moreover, fewer Republican consumers now expect Trump to win next month than they did in the previous three months, while Democratic consumers have become more confident in a Biden win, the University of Michigan data showed. 
""While self-identified Democrats and Republicans heavily favored the candidate from their own party, that proportion grew by 8 points among Democrats and shrunk by 5 percentage points among Republicans,"" Surveys of Consumers Chief Economist Richard Curtin said. 
Still, he said, all may not be lost for Trump because independents see him winning by a narrow margin.

""Most elections are decided by those who are non-aligned with either party,"" Curtin said. ""The views of Independents remained unchanged and nearly equal, giving Trump a slight advantage of 2 or 3 points.""

Business inventories rose 0.3% in August after edging up 0.1% in July, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Inventories, a key component of gross domestic product, increased in July after six straight monthly declines.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast business stocks rising 0.4% in August.
Retail inventories increased 0.4% in August instead of 0.8% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 1.2% rebound in July. Motor vehicle inventories rose 0.3% rather than 0.6% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.5% instead of 0.9% as estimated last month.
An inventory drawdown contributed to GDP declining at a record 31.4% annualized rate in the second quarter. Inventories subtracted 3.5 percentage points from GDP, the most since the first quarter of 1988. They have been a drag on GDP for five straight quarters. The economy fell into recession in February.
Businesses are rebuilding inventories with imports, which led to the goods trade deficit surging to a record high in August. With most of the imports going to replenish inventories, the wider goods trade deficit will likely make a small dent in GDP growth in the third quarter. Trade contributed to GDP growth in the last three quarters.
Wholesale inventories rose 0.4% in August. Stocks at manufacturers were unchanged.

Business sales increased 0.6% in August after surging 3.4% in July. At August's sales pace, it would take 1.32 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.33 months in July.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose to a two-month high last week, stoking fears the COVID-19 pandemic was inflicting lasting damage to the labor market.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed at least 25 million were on jobless benefits at the end of September. It reinforced views the economy's recovery from the recession, which started in February, was slowing and in urgent need of another government rescue package.
The economic hardship wrought by the coronavirus crisis is a major hurdle to President Donald Trump's chances of getting a second term in the White House when Americans go to the polls on Nov. 3. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's candidate, has blamed the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic for the worst economic turmoil in at least 73 years.
""The increase in initial claims is disturbing,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN in New York. ""It is difficult to see it and not think the recovery is vulnerable."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 53,000 to a seasonally adjusted 898,000 for the week ended Oct. 10. Data for the prior week was revised to show 5,000 more applications received than previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 825,000 applications in the latest week. The surprise increase came even as California processed no claims. California, the most populous state in the nation, suspended the processing of new applications for two weeks in late September to combat fraud. It resumed accepting claims last Monday. 
Graphic: Jobless claims https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xklpymgympg/joblessclaims.png
Unadjusted claims rose 76,670 to 885,885 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted number given earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations because of the economic shock caused by the pandemic. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.3 million people filed claims last week.
Seven months into the pandemic in the United States, first-time claims remain well above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though below a record 6.867 million in March. With new COVID-19 cases surging across the country and the White House and Congress struggling to agree on another rescue package for businesses and the unemployed, claims are likely to remain elevated.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday he would keep trying to reach a deal with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, before next month's election.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
MILLIONS EXHAUST BENEFITS
About 3.8 million people had permanently lost their jobs in September, with another 2.4 million unemployed for more than six months. Economists fear those numbers could swell. 
Though the claims report showed a decline in the number of people on unemployment rolls in early October, economists said that was because many people had exhausted their eligibility for benefits, which are limited to six months in most states.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 1.165 million to 10.018 million in the week ending Oct. 3.
About 2.8 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Sept. 26, up 818,054 from the prior week. That was the largest weekly gain since the program's launch last spring. These benefits are set to expire on Dec. 31. 
Tens of thousands of airline workers have been furloughed. State and local government budgets have been crushed by the pandemic, leading to layoffs that are expected to escalate without help from the federal government. 
""Risks to the labor market outlook are weighted heavily to the downside,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The increased spread of the virus across much of the country could result in an even larger pullback in business activity than expected.""
Though economic activity rebounded in the third quarter because of fiscal stimulus, the stubbornly high jobless claims suggest momentum ebbed heading into the fourth quarter.
Other reports on Thursday showed mixed fortunes for regional manufacturing in October. A survey from the New York Federal Reserve showed its business conditions index fell seven points to a reading of 10.5 this month. Companies reported continued gains in new orders and shipments, though unfilled orders maintained their decline. Factory employment rose modestly, but the average workweek increased significantly. 
Separately, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index jumped to a reading of 32.3 from 15.0 in September. Measures of new orders and shipments at factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware rose. A gauge of factory employment fell, but manufacturers increased hours for workers. 

Third-quarter GDP growth estimates are topping a 32% annualized rate. The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been cut to as low as a 2.5% rate from above a 10% pace.

Investing.com -- The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased to 898,000 last week, its highest since late August, compounding fears that the recovery in the labor market is stalling.
Economists had forecast a decline to 825,000. The prior week's figure was revised up to 845,000 from an initially reported 840,000.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, decreased by over 1 million 10.018 million, a bigger fall than expected. The previous week's figure was revised up by 200,000 to 11.183 million. Continuing claims are falling in part because many people have exhausted their eligibility for regular state benefits.
In the week to September 26, the last for which data are available, just under 800,000 signed off from the regular state rolls, while 818,000 joined the rolls for Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation. the federal program that  provides up to 13 extra weeks of benefits for such people. The overall number of people claiming benefits linked to unemployment fell by some 215,000 to 25.29 million in the last full week of September.
The report comes a day after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin quashed hopes for additional aid to support the faltering economic recovery before the election.
The weekly claims data have been distorted recently by the suspension of data filings from California, which had cited a need to address fraud and other administrative issues in its numbers. California's number is still frozen at the last level registered before the pause, even though the two-week suspension has now actually ended.

Investing.com – China saw annual factory gate prices fall at a faster-than-predicted pace, while consumer prices rose at their slowest pace in 19 months, highlighting the challenges facing the nation in its economic recovery from COVID-19.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the consumer price index gained 1.7% year-on-year in September, down on the predicted 1.8% rise and August’s 2.4% growth. The index gained 0.2% month-on-month, against the forecast 0.3% rise and August’s 0.4% gain.
Meanwhile, the producer price index fell 2.1% year-on-year, more than the forecast 1.8% fall and the 2% fall reported in August.
The data also showed that core inflation minus volatile food and energy prices stood at 0.5% year-on-year in September, unchanged from August and gross domestic product grew 3.2% year-on-year in the second quarter.
The data follows Tuesday’s mixed trade data, showing that exports were up 9.9% year-on-year, up from August’s 9.5%, imports were up 13.2% year-on-year, higher than August’s 2.1% slump, and a trade surplus of $37 billion, down from August’s $58.93 billion surplus and missing the $58 billion surplus predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
The Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released during the previous week, rose to 54.8 in September.
The world’s second largest economy continues to recover from a grim first quarter which saw country-wide lockdowns to curb the spread of COVID-19, as September saw a faster-than-expected growth in factory activity. However, the rise in consumer prices was the slowest since February 2019.
Producer prices also saw a slowdown which could renew deflation concerns and lead to the government unrolling more aggressive stimulus measures, some investors warn. Producer prices are uses to measure industrial demand, which drives investment and profit.
Premier Li Keqiang also warned on Monday that China needs to make continuous efforts to achieve the country’s full-year economic goals."

The producer price index (PPI) fell for an eighth straight month on an annual basis while consumer prices grew more slowly than expected.
The world's second largest economy has seen a steady recovery after being hard hit by the coronavirus in the first quarter. But a sustained fall in producer prices, seen as a gauge of industrial demand, may rekindle worries about deflation and prompt authorities to provide more support, analysts said.
""The PPI has not rebounded strongly despite the improving trend, pointing to continued weakness in industrial demand. It is unlikely to return to positive territory this year,"" said Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank.
""It is possible that the economic recovery in the fourth quarter may not be as strong as it has been in the third quarter.""
The PPI fell 2.1% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the index to decline 1.8% after a 2.0% drop in August. On a monthly basis, PPI rose 0.1%, after increasing by 0.3% in August.

Pork price inflation slowed year-on-year as hog production rebounded and as the government increased sales of frozen pork from state reserves, said Dong Lijuan, senior statistician at the NBS. Pork prices surged this time last year as the African swine fever decimated China's pig herd.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in September amid a surge in the cost of hotel and motel accommodation, leading to the first year-on-year gain since March.
But the report from the Labor Department on Wednesday, which also showed a jump in the price of iron and steel scrap, did not change the view that overall inflation was cooling amid excess capacity at industries. It, however, confirmed that fears of deflation, which dominated when the COVID-19 pandemic started in the United States, were misplaced. 
Deflation, a decline in the general price level, is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices. Economists expect the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates near zero at least through next year. 
""The prices of some producer prices are climbing, but factories are not back to normal yet,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Fed officials will remain cautious on the inflation outlook until producer price pressures heat up further.""
The producer price index for final demand rose 0.4% last month after advancing 0.3% in August. A 0.4% increase in the cost of services accounted for nearly two-thirds of the gain in the PPI last month. Services increased 0.5% in August. 
In the 12 months through September, the PPI rebounded 0.4% after falling 0.2% in August.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would gain 0.2% in September and rise 0.2% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices rose 0.4% in September. The so-called core PPI had increased by 0.3% for three straight months. In the 12 months through September, the core PPI climbed 0.7%. The core PPI gain 0.3% on a year-on-year basis in August.
U.S. stocks were trading largely flat. The dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly higher.
CONSIDERABLE SLACK
The government reported on Tuesday that consumer prices increased 0.2% in September, with a 6.7% jump in prices for used cars and trucks accounting for most of the gain.
Business closures to slow the spread of the coronavirus caused bottlenecks in the supply chain, pushing up prices of some goods. Though supply chain disruptions have eased, weak demand and slack in the labor market are limiting businesses' ability to raise prices.
The Fed is now more focused on the labor market and has embraced flexible average inflation targeting, which in theory could see policymakers tolerate price increases above the U.S. central bank's 2% target for a period of perhaps several years to offset years in which inflation was lodged below that goal.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 1.6% in the 12 months through August. September's core PCE price index data is scheduled to be released at the end of this month.
With new coronavirus infections surging across the United States and the recovery from the downturn, which started in February, showing signs of stress, inflation could remain tepid. At least 25.5 million people are on unemployment benefits.
The third straight monthly increase in services in September was driven by a 3.9% jump in prices for hotel and motel accommodation. There were also increases in the costs of hardware, building materials and supplies. Margins for final demand trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, increased 0.2%. 
Hospital inpatient care rebounded 0.4%, leading to a 0.2% rise in healthcare costs. Portfolio fees shot up 1.4%. Prices for airline tickets rebounded 2.5%. 
Those airline ticket, healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index. With the relevant CPI and PPI components in hand, economists are predicting the core PCE price index increased by between 1.6% and 1.7% in September.
Some, however, cautioned that used motor vehicles were a wild card. Used cars and truck prices surged in August and September, driving consumer prices in each of the two months. 
Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), noted that there has been ""an unusual relationship between PPI data and PCE data related to used vehicles in recent months.""
Wholesale goods price inflation also picked up last month, boosted by a 14.7% surge in the cost of iron and steel scrap. Prices for goods accelerated 0.4% after edging up 0.1% in August. 
Food prices rebounded 1.2% following three straight monthly declines, but the cost of wholesale gasoline fell 2.8%. 
Excluding food and energy, wholesale goods prices increased 0.4% after climbing 0.3% in August. The fourth straight monthly increase in core goods prices likely reflects a weaker dollar. The greenback has dropped 2.8% against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners since July.

""Goods inflation will remain healthy over the coming months,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Washington.

(Reuters) - Florida is one of the five best states in the nation in which to do business, according to a new survey. It’s also one of the five worst, according to the same survey, thanks to COVID-19.
Every three years, Development Counsellors International, an economic development marketing firm, surveys executives to rank business climates in the various U.S. states. For the first time since they began doing the survey in 1996, a single state landed in the top five in both categories: Florida. The DCI report was released on Tuesday.
“The rationale for Florida being on both the best and worst lists was entirely due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Julie Curtin, president of DCI’s economic development practice. “In our follow-up questions to corporate executives about the states they selected, the majority of the corporate executives who selected Florida said that the state’s handling of the pandemic had negatively affected their perception of the state’s business climate.”
Because of how the survey is structured, however, other executives were still able to cite Florida as a good place to do business because of things like low taxes and access to skilled workers.
Florida has been a hotspot for the pandemic. So far, 15,552 have died in the state, according to a Reuters tally. Only four other states, New Jersey, New York, California, and Texas, have had more deaths.

The once-every-three-year ranking is usually quite predictable. California has ranked as the worst state to do business in seven of nine surveys. New York took that distinction the other two years. Texas ranks as having the best business climate in this year’s survey, as it did in seven of the last eight surveys.

While that easing pressure on pinched consumers might offer a benefit to Republican President Donald Trump's reelection prospects against Democratic challenger Joe Biden, it does come with a big ""on the other hand"" caveat: It is the latest sign of fading momentum in the rebound from this spring's record-setting economic slump.
A bit of inflation typically is an indication of strengthening demand, an encouraging signal that consumers have reliable sources of income allowing them to contribute to growing an economy that hinges extensively on their spending. But with roughly 11 million still out of work and desperate for a new round of COVID-19 relief from Washington, September's modest uptick in prices is no such signal.
Here's Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) chief financial economist Aneta Markowska's take: ""After several months of above-trend gains, price pressures are finally normalizing. Both headline and core CPI increased by just 0.2% (month-to-month) in September, with the underlying details painting an even weaker picture.""

In fact, she notes prices would have been unchanged but for one thing: The largest monthly increase in used car and truck prices since 1969. And with cash-strapped consumers increasingly reliant on their own transport to get to an on-site job, that's no welcome development. 
Food price increases, too, are moderating after a big run up in the spring, but where you eat makes a big difference. 
If eating at home, as millions without work have no choice but to do, then food prices were lower for a third straight month.
If eating out, though, as more consumers are doing as restaurants continue to reopen around the country, prices shot up by the most in 12 years last month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased for a fourth straight month in September, with the cost of cars and trucks rising by the most since 1969, but inflation is slowing amid excess capacity in the economy as it gradually recovers from the COVID-19 recession.
Though the benign report from the Labor Department on Tuesday will have no direct impact on monetary policy, it should allow the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates near zero for a while and continue with massive cash infusions as it nurses the economy back to health. 
The U.S. central bank is now more concerned about the labor market and has embraced flexible average inflation targeting, which in theory could see policymakers tolerate price increases above its 2% target for a period of perhaps several years to offset years in which inflation was lodged below its goal.
""Price gains are modest as supply chain disruptions have eased and weak demand and excess capacity in many parts of the economy have limited firms' pricing power,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""As long as inflation remains below 2% the Fed will keep providing stimulus to the economy.""
The consumer price index rose 0.2% last month after gaining 0.4% in August. The CPI advanced 0.6% in both June and July after falling in the prior three months as business closures to slow the spread of the coronavirus weighed on demand.
A 6.7% jump in the prices of used cars and trucks again accounted for most of the increase in the CPI last month. That was the biggest gain since February 1969 and followed a 5.4% advance in August. The strong increases likely reflect a shortage of used motor vehicles amid an aversion to public transportation because of fears of contracting COVID-19. 
New motor vehicle prices rose 0.3%. There were also increases in the costs of recreation. But prices for motor vehicle insurance, airline fares and apparel fell.
In the 12 months through September, the CPI increased 1.4% after rising 1.3% in August. Last month's inflation readings were in line with economists' expectations.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI climbed 0.2% after rising 0.4% in August. The so-called core CPI gained 1.7% year-on-year, matching August's increase. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 1.6% in the 12 months through August. September's core PCE price index data is scheduled to be released at the end of this month.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
WEAK DEMAND
Inflation is likely to remain muted at least through 2021 amid signs the economy's recovery from the downturn, which started in February, is showing signs of fatigue without more money from the government. At least 25.5 million people are on unemployment benefits. The slack in the labor market has left workers with limited power to bargain for higher wages.
High unemployment makes it harder for landlords to raise rents. The pandemic has also fueled a migration to suburbs and other low-density areas from urban centers, which over time could result in higher vacancy rates for apartments and restrain rent growth. Wages and rents are the biggest inflation drivers.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, ticked up 0.1% in September after a similar gain in August. That led to an annual gain of 2.5%, the smallest since February 2014.
Gasoline prices edged up 0.1% after rising 2.0% in August. But electricity prices shot up 0.9%, the largest increase since October 2018. 
Food prices were unchanged after nudging up 0.1% in August. The cost of food consumed at home fell 0.4%, declining for a third straight month. Prices for nonalcoholic beverages fell 0.8%, the most since December 2010. Dairy products, meat and fruits and vegetables were also cheaper last month. 
The cost of food away from home rose further, gaining 0.6%. Prices for limited service meals jumped 0.9%, the largest increase since the series started in 1997. Restaurants have raised prices to cover costs related to social-distancing measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. 
The cost of recreation rose 0.2% last month. Apparel prices decreased 0.5% after rising for three consecutive months. The cost of motor vehicle insurance declined 3.5%. Airline fares dropped 2.0% after increasing in each of the last three months. 
Healthcare costs were unchanged after gaining 0.1% in August. Costumers paid more for hospital services, but less for doctors' services and prescription drugs. 
Education prices fell 0.3% after dropping by the same margin in August, which was the first decline since the series started in 1993. Many schools and universities have shifted to online classes because of the pandemic.

""We expect inflation to remain below its pre-pandemic trend as the demand backdrop remains generally weak, especially for services,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

551,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - U.S. consumers in September became slightly less worried about losing their jobs and more optimistic about their earnings, though the effects of the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic lingered, according to a survey released on Tuesday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
The average perceived chance of becoming unemployed over the next year dropped to 16.6% in September from 18% in August but was still well above the pre-pandemic level of 13.8% in February. The drop was driven by an improvement in sentiment among people above age 60 and those with household incomes below $50,000. 
While the U.S. labor market continues to heal from the damage caused by the pandemic, data released by the Labor Department earlier this month shows the recovery is slowing. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 661,000 jobs in September, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May. 
The Fed survey suggested that some consumers think the worst of the pain in the labor market has passed. Expectations that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher in a year dropped to an average 36.4% in September from 39.1% in August. 
Consumers reported feeling better about their pay and their ability to spend. The median expectation for household income growth increased to 2.3% in September, up 0.1 percentage point from August but still below the 2019 average of 2.8%. Median expectations for household spending growth increased to 3.4% in September, from 3% in August, reaching the highest level since May 2019. 
The survey of consumer expectations is a monthly poll conducted on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.

Median inflation expectations for the next year remained unchanged at 3% at the one-year horizon and expectations for the next three years dropped by 0.3 percentage point to 2.7%.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's imports grew at their fastest pace this year in September, while exports extended strong gains as more trading partners lifted coronavirus restrictions in a further boost to the world's second-biggest economy.
Exports in September rose 9.9% from a year earlier, customs data showed on Tuesday, broadly in line with analysts' expectations and up from a solid 9.5% increase in August.
The strong trade performance suggests Chinese exporters are making a brisk recovery from the pandemic's hit to overseas orders. 
As the global economy restarts, Chinese firms are rushing to grab market share as their rivals grapple with reduced manufacturing capacity.
""The big picture is that outbound shipments remain strong, with easing demand for COVID-19 related goods such as face masks being mostly offset by a recovery in broader demand for Chinese-made consumer goods,"" Capital Economics Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said.
""A jump in imports suggests that domestic investment spending remains strong.""
China's factory activity has also picked up as international trading gradually resumes.
But some analysts warn exports could peak soon as the demand for Chinese-made protective gear recedes and the base effect of this year's massive declines wears off. 
Imports surged 13.2% in September, returning to growth from a fall of 2.1% in August and much stronger than expectations for a 0.3% increase. The import strength was broad based for almost all of China's main trading partners.
Imports from Taiwan surged 35.8% in September from a year ago, while purchases from the United States rose 24.7% on-year. Imports from Australia, however, fell 9.5%.

RECOVERY AT HOME
Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank, said the data showed government support for the economy has kicked in as the epidemic comes under control.
""This has boosted domestic demand, especially investment-led demand, which buoyed imports,"" Wang said, adding that the yuan's recent appreciation was positive for imports and people's spending power. 
The Chinese yuan  rose to a 17-month high against the dollar on Friday.
The rise in imports pushed the trade surplus for September down to $37 billion, compared with $58.93 billion in August and lower than an expected $58.00 billion.
Across products, China bought more soybeans, grains, semiconductors, copper and steel products in September, customs data showed. Analysts expect imports to stay on an improving trend, underpinned by strengthening domestic demand.
Zhang Jun, chief economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Huaxin Securities, said higher purchases of U.S. agricultural and energy products as China implemented the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal, and the resumption of logistics services in the United States and Europe contributed to China's import strength.
Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials reaffirmed their commitment to a Phase 1 trade deal in a telephone call in August.

China's trade surplus with the United States narrowed to $30.75 billion in September from $34.24 billion in August.

Investing.com – Chinese imports saw their fastest growth in 2020, and exports extended strong gains in September as more countries loosened COVID-19 restrictions and world’s second-largest economy continued its economic recovery. However, the country’s trade surplus with the United States narrowed in the same month.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics earlier in the day showed that exports were up 9.9% year-on-year, up from August’s 9.5%, and that imports were up 13.2% year-on-year, higher than August’s 2.1% slump.
The trade surplus stood at $37 billion, down from August’s $58.93 billion surplus and missing the $58 billion surplus predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. Exports also missed their predicted 10% growth, while imports more than surpassed the predicted 0.3% growth.
The trade performance data suggested that Chinese exporters are continuing to recover from COVID-19's impact on overseas orders. They are also grabbing the opportunity to increase their market share as the global economy slowly restarts and other countries struggle with reduced manufacturing capacity.
Factory activity also saw an uptick, with data released during the previous week showing that the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 54.8 in September.
However, exports could soon peak as the demand for Chinese-made protective gear starts to decline, and the base effect of the huge declines seen during the beginning of the year starts to wear off.
U.S.-China tensions are also expected to continue escalating ahead of the U.S. Nov. 3. presidential election. Despite U.S. and Chinese trade officials reaffirming their commitment to their phase 1 trade deal in an August phone call, China continues to lag on its pledge, made in February, to increase its purchases of U.S. goods. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue also expressed doubt earlier in the month about the probability of China purchasing enough U.S. agricultural products as agreed to in the phase 1 deal, saying that China may fail its commitments due to “non-agricultural trade issues”.
With the number of COVID-19 continuing to rise and China reporting a new cluster of COVID-19 cases in the port city of Qingdao on Monday, the road to recovery could have additional bumps yet."

Credit card provider Barclaycard said spending rose at the fastest rate since the country was hit by the coronavirus lockdown.
Separate data from retailers showed sales values at major store chains jumped by the most in nearly 11 years, excluding distortions caused by the timing of Easter. 
Consumer spending has been a rare bright spot for Britain's economy which posted a record drop during the second quarter, although mounting job losses are expected in the coming months.
Barclaycard said its measure of spending rose 2% year-on-year in September, driven by purchases of essentials and representing an acceleration from August's 0.2% increase. Pubs and bars also saw strong spending.
A quarter of consumers polled by Barclaycard said they had stockpiled last month in case of shortages of goods, as they did in the run-up to the coronavirus lockdown in March.
""While the nation's confidence in the UK economy has improved slightly, many are still cautious about the upcoming winter months, and the subsequent uncertainty it may bring has caused some to start stockpiling once more,"" said Raheel Ahmed, head of consumer products at Barclaycard.
A separate survey from the British Retail Consortium also pointed to strong spending.
Retail sales values at major store chains rose 5.6% in annual terms last month, the biggest increase since December 2009 when excluding distortions caused by the changing timing of Easter holidays. 
The BRC said there were signs that consumers had brought forward some of their Christmas shopping.

""The industry is beginning to recover, however, forced store or warehouse closures during any future lockdowns could put paid to this progress,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The pessimism hanging over Japan's manufacturers lifted slightly in October, suggesting businesses were emerging from the coronavirus pandemic's heavy blow to activity and earnings but at a glacial pace.
Some sub-manufacturing sectors, however, believed conditions would stabilise in the next few months, according to the monthly Reuters Tankan, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey.
The result underlines the daunting task Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who rose to power last month, faces in reviving growth and bringing corporate and consumer sentiment back to levels seen before the COVID-19 crisis.
In the poll of 485 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 251 firms responded on condition of anonymity, many complained about the slow pace of recovery from the economic crisis, reporting weakening orders and capital spending.
""The recovery in manufacturing is delayed,"" a manager at a chemicals maker wrote in the survey.
A textile maker wrote: ""Auto sales are stagnating globally, while private consumption within Japan is growing only slowly.""
The Reuters Tankan index readings are derived by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means that pessimists outnumber optimists.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers in October rose for the fourth straight month, coming in at minus 26 from minus 29 the previous month. The index has been in negative territory for 15 straight months.
The service-sector index stood at minus 16, up from minus 18 in September, with sentiment among wholesalers, transport and utilities weighing on broad business confidence.
The BOJ's latest ""tankan"" survey released on Oct. 1 showed Japanese business sentiment improved in July-September from a 11-year low hit three months earlier, in a sign economic activity was gradually recovering, though it also remained deeply negative.
The central bank will hold its first policy review since the release of those figures on Oct. 28-29. 
In the Reuters Tankan survey, a manager at a chemicals producer said conditions in the domestic market remained poor, while those in Asian markets were showing signs of a pickup in recovery.
""Private capital spending is stalling,"" a manager at a construction firm wrote in the survey.
Manufacturers saw conditions recover to minus 17 in January, the survey showed, with machinery and transport equipment makers as well as processed food producers expecting conditions to stabilise or move close to stabilisation.

Non-manufacturers especially expected the mood to approach stabilisation, with sentiment seen rising to minus 10 in January.

Exports have not been as severely affected by the global slowdown as some analysts had feared, due in part to record shipments of medical supplies and robust demand for electronic products, adding to hopes for a sustained economic recovery.
In September, exports are expected to have risen 10% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of a Reuters poll of 24 economists. Imports likely rose 0.3% on year, improving after back-to-back decline in July and August.
Exports in August rose a solid 9.5% year-on-year, the strongest gain since March 2019. 
Stronger exports could signal a faster and more balanced recovery for the Chinese economy, which is rebounding from a record first-quarter slump thanks to domestic stimulus measures.
A manufacturing survey showed total new orders in September recorded the strongest increase since January 2011, and a gauge for new export orders--which were hit hard by the global outbreak of the coronavirus--rose at the fastest pace in over three years.
""We expect both export and import growth to accelerate further in September. Global growth has continued to recover and strong global housing activity in recent months should support Chinese exports of furniture and appliances,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said in a research note last week.
""Import growth may improve in September as well on the back of the solid expansion of domestic activities,"" they said.
However, external demand could suffer if virus control measures are re-imposed by trade partners due to a resurgence in infections.
China is meanwhile looking to reduce its reliance on overseas markets for development as U.S. tensions and the pandemic increase external risks that could hamper long-term progress.
Already heightened U.S.-China hostilities are expected to escalate ahead of the U.S. presidential election next month.
U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue earlier this month warned China may fall short of annual agricultural product purchasing commitments made in its Phase 1 trade deal with the United States.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese wholesale prices fell 0.8% in September from the same month a year earlier, data showed on Monday, marking the seventh straight month of year-on-year declines and heightening the risk the country will slide back into deflation.
Squeezed mostly by soft global demand for commodities and Japanese machinery goods, the weakness in wholesale prices highlights the challenge Tokyo faces in cushioning the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the world's third-largest economy.
The 0.8% fall in the corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, was bigger than a median market forecast for a 0.5% drop. It followed August's 0.6% year-on-year decrease.
Wholesale prices also slid 0.2% in September from August, marking the first on-month drop in four months, the data released by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) showed.
""With the global economy still reeling from the pandemic's pain, the pace of its recovery remains modest. That will weigh on Japan's wholesale inflation,"" a BOJ official told a briefing.
The drop in wholesale prices adds to headaches for the BOJ, which frets that sluggish consumption, particularly for services, will push consumer inflation further away from its 2% target.
Core consumer prices - the BOJ's key inflation measurement - fell 0.4% in August from a year earlier, marking their fastest year-on-year drop in almost four years.
The slew of soft price data may increase the chance the BOJ will cut its inflation forecasts at this month's rate review, when it also conducts a quarterly review of its projections.
Japan suffered its biggest economic slump on record in the second quarter as the pandemic crippled demand. Analysts expect any rebound to remain modest as fears of a second wave of infections weigh on consumption.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories increased 0.4% in August, instead of rising 0.5% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers fell 0.2% in July. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product was unchanged in August.
August inventories were down 5.2% from a year earlier.
Gross domestic product declined at a record 31.4% annualized rate in the second quarter, with inventories subtracting 3.5 percentage points, the most in 32 years. GDP is expected to bounce back strongly in the third quarter but growth is seen slowing substantially in the last quarter of this year.
Stocks of motor vehicles and parts rose 4.3% in August.

Sales at wholesalers increased 1.4% in August after rising 4.8% in July. Economists had forecast a 2.0% rise in sales. At August's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.31 months to clear shelves, down from 1.32 months in July.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy struggled to grow in August, setting back its recovery from the coronavirus lockdown, and finance minister Rishi Sunak was due to announce more help to slow a rise in jobs losses as a second wave of COVID-19 infections hits.
Gross domestic product rose by 2.1% from July, official data showed, not even half the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and the slowest increase since the economy began to recover in May from a record slump.
Much of what growth there was in August was down to a one-off government restaurant subsidy programme. 
Finance minister Rishi Sunak was due to announce later on Friday a plan to support jobs in businesses that may be ordered to close to slow a resurgence of COVID-19 infections. Economists said the data also raised the chance of more stimulus from the Bank of England.
""The sharp slowdown in growth indicates that the recovery may be running out of steam, with output still well below pre-crisis levels,"" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce said.
""The increase in activity in August largely reflects a temporary boost from the economy reopening and government stimulus, including the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme, rather than proof of a sustained 'V'-shaped recovery.""
More than half of the economy's growth in August came from accommodation and food, where output surged by 71.4% thanks to the government's one-month meals subsidies, more people taking holidays in Britain and the easing of lockdown restrictions.
JOBS PLAN
Kate Nicholls, head of the UK Hospitality trade body, said new COVID-19 restrictions introduced in September had weighed on the hospitality sector again. 
""Today's figures show our economy has grown for 4 consecutive months, but I know that many people are worried about the coming winter months,"" Sunak said.
""Throughout this crisis, my single-focus has been jobs – protecting as many jobs as possible, and providing support for people to find other opportunities where this isn't possible. This goal remains unchanged.""
Sunak's new jobs plan would subsidise two thirds of the wages of workers in pubs, restaurants and other businesses forced to close to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the Times reported.

Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Thursday that risks to the economy were ""very much on the downside"" and the central bank was ready to use its policy firepower.
Dean Turner, an economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said recent surveys had pointed to the economy slowing in September which could be made worse by local COVID-19 restrictions on activity.
""Sluggish progress is likely to encourage the Bank of England to increase its bond buying program at its November meeting,"" he said. 

Britain is also facing the risk that it fails to secure a trade deal with the European Union with negotiations still ongoing ahead of the Dec. 31 expiry of the country's post-Brexit transition period.

Investing.com – China returned from a week-long holiday with a bang, with the services sector remaining positive for a fifth consecutive month in September, helped by continuous recovery from the impact of COVID-19 in domestic supply and demand.
The Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released earlier in the day, rose to 54.8 in September, against August’s reading of 54. The Composite PMI for September also signaled continued growth, though not at last month's rate, having dropped to 54.5 from the previous month’s 55.1 figure.
Both indexes stayed above the 50-mark indicating growth, but the sector recorded the sharpest rate of expansion in three months, with the rate among the quickest recorded over the past decade.
“The services sector’s post-epidemic recovery showed signs of speeding up … domestic supply and demand in the services sector continued to recover at a faster pace, while overseas demand remained subdued. Both the business activity index and total new business expanded for the fifth straight month, and at a faster pace than the previous month, causing the gauge for outstanding business to break back into expansionary territory,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said.
“Companies remained confident about the economic outlook. In September, the gauge for business expectations rose further into expansionary territory. Companies remained positive about the ongoing economic recovery and the effective control of the epidemic,” he added.
However, employment remains a roadblock on the Chinese path to recovery. The rate of job creation remained marginal overall, despite firms expanding their workforces for the second month in a row in the wake of the sustained economic recovery.
With COVID-19 numbers continuing to rise globally and dampening overseas demand, new export businesses remained has been in contractionary territory for seven of the past eight months.
“In the near term, there will still be uncertainties from COVID-19 overseas and the U.S. election, and the development of ‘dual circulation’ in the domestic and international markets will continue to face challenges,” warned Wang.
The services PMI corroborated the official manufacturing and no-manufacturing indices, as well as the previous week's Caixin manufacturing PMI, which remained firmly in the growth zone for the seventh consecutive month.
The manufacturing PMI and the non-manufacturing PMI remained above the 50-mark, with readings of 51.5 and 55.9 respectively. The Caixin manufacturing PMI, released on the same day, fell slightly to 53 in September from August’s 53.1 figure, but remained above the 50-mark."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending fell for an 11th straight month in August and real wages marked half a year of declines, as consumers struggled to return to their pre-pandemic purchasing habits.
Analysts see the economy picking up from the slump caused by the coronavirus but weak spending and wage figures highlight the challenges new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga faces as he works to revive the economy.
Household spending declined 6.9% in August from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, matching a median forecast in a Reuters poll. 
A year-on-year decline in the household spending in August would mark the 11th straight of falls, the longest period of contraction since a 15-month stretch to May 2017.
However, the pace of decline has slowed after hitting a record 16.2% in May, when people stayed at home to prevent the virus infection under the nationwide shutdown.
The government lifted the emergency measures in late May and business activity has gradually resumed.
Compared with the previous month, household spending rose 1.7% in August after a 6.5% decline in July.
""We expect the overall economy including consumer spending will pick up as the economic activity restarts,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.
""But people remained cautious about risks to get the virus infection and wages are expected to worsen further, so the pace of recovery in consumer spending will likely be limited.""
Separate data on Friday showed the nation's inflation-adjusted real wages fell 1.4% in August from a year earlier, down for the sixth straight month, reflecting a big drop in overtime.

The economy tumbled deeper into recession in the June quarter as the coronavirus jolted global demand and analysts say it will take time for pre-pandemic levels of activity to return.

Labour ministry data showed real wages, a key barometer of households' purchasing power, dropped 1.4% in August from a year earlier, following a downwardly revised 1.8% decline in July.
Wage earners' nominal total cash earnings fell 1.3% to 273,263 yen ($2,578.68) in August from a year earlier, the fifth consecutive month of declines.
The drop in overtime pay and summer bonuses added to a modest decline in regular pay as the economic blow from the coronavirus crisis prompted companies to cut costs.
Overtime pay, a key gauge of strength in corporate activity, dropped 14.0% in the year to August, following a downward revision to a 17.1% drop and down for a full straight year.
Regular pay - or base salary, which makes up most of total cash earnings - slipped 0.1% in August, down for the first time since June 2019.

(Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits inched down last week, signaling the U.S. labor market is making little fresh headway in getting millions of people back on the job after being out of work due to COVID-19 disruptions.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 840,000 for the week ended Oct. 3, compared with an upwardly revised 849,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 820,000 applications in the latest week.
While last week's level of new claims was the lowest since March, they have stalled at historically high levels after dropping below 1 million in August as the government changed the way it strips seasonal fluctuations from the data. They are above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though filings have dropped from a record 6.867 million at the end of March.
The data on new claims for the past two weeks has been distorted by California taking a two-week hiatus in reporting its numbers because of problems with a backlog of filings and indications of fraud. 
""With California pausing initial claims for two weeks, the change in initial claims ... is a hollow metric,"" AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, said in note. ""Headline number aside, the report points to a wounded economy that’s not in good shape for winter."" 
The number of people continuing to draw benefits after their initial claim for assistance fell to 10.976 million in the week ended Sept. 26 from 11.979 million the week before. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast continuing claims at 11.4 million.
A wider measure of those drawing assistance under measures enacted by Congress earlier this year showed 25.5 million people receiving benefits in the week ended Sept. 19, a decrease of about 1 million.
On Wall Street, stocks were higher for a second day as investors clung to the hope that the elevated claims data might be a catalyst for a new round of federal pandemic relief. The S&P 500 (SPX) was up 0.5% at a one-month high.
Labor market gains from the reopening of businesses are fading. Last Friday's employment report for September - the last one before the Nov. 3 presidential election - showed the fewest number of jobs created since the labor market began recovering in May. Roughly half of the 22.2 million people who lost their jobs in the early days of the pandemic remain out of work.
Economists are predicting a further slowdown in hiring through the rest of 2020 and into 2021, especially without another federal pandemic assistance package. 
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said talks with Congress had restarted on targeted fiscal relief. Earlier this week, Trump cut off negotiations with Democrats on new aid, shortly after being released from Walter Reed Medical Center, where he had been treated for COVID-19.
Meanwhile, progress containing the coronavirus remains elusive, with cases rising across much of the country and a surge expected in the fall, which could lead to the reimposition of restrictions on businesses in the hard-hit services sector. 

""Putting a damper on forecasts for broad, near-term economic improvement are the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and the dim prospects for further substantial federal relief legislation,"" Bankrate.com Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick said in a note. ""Many Americans are still facing the prospect of layoffs, and businesses of all sizes are facing the threat of failure, reduced sales and or capacity.""

Investing.com -- The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits ticked down to a post pandemic low of 840,000 last week, but remained at levels indicating that the recovery in the labor market is losing momentum as the coronavirus pandemic lingers.
Economists had forecast a larger decline to 820,000. The prior week's figure was revised up to 849,000 from an initially reported 837,000.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, decreased to 10.576 million, a drop of over one million for the week. The previous week's figure was also revised down to 11.979 million. 
The report highlighted the urgent need for more fiscal stimulus to help the economy recover from a recession triggered by the pandemic. The U.S. economy added 661,000 jobs in September, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May, after advancing 1.489 million the previous month. Continuing claims are now falling more steeply than new payrolls are rising, suggesting that many are leaving the workforce rather than looking for new work.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector sentiment rose in September to the highest level in 2-1/2 years, government data showed on Thursday, suggesting that the economy is gradually recovering from the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
A survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff - called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends - showed their confidence about current economic conditions grew 5.4 points from August to 49.3 in September.
It was the highest level since April 2018 and the fifth straight month of increase, boding well for the government's efforts to prevent a pandemic-driven recession from deepening.
""While conditions remain severe due to the pandemic's fallout, sentiment is improving,"" the government said on the survey. ""While there are concerns over the pandemic, sentiment is likely to continue recovering,"" it said.
A separate private survey showed the flood of money pumped out by the government and central bank is keeping companies afloat for now, despite the hit to sales from the pandemic.
The number of corporate bankruptcies totalled 3,956 cases in the first half of the fiscal year that began in April, down 5.2% from the same period last year and the lowest level in nearly 16 years, private think-tank Teikoku Databank said on Thursday.
Total liabilities for firms that went under stood at 601.25 billion yen ($5.67 billion), the second-lowest level on record, the report from Teikoku Databank showed.
The Bank of Japan has ramped up stimulus twice so far this year and created a lending facility to channel funds via banks to cash-strapped smaller firms.
The government also deployed two massive spending packages, and offered cheap loans backed by state-affiliated lenders to help companies weather the hit from the health crisis.

Japan suffered its biggest economic slump on record in the second quarter as the pandemic crippled demand. Analysts expect any rebound to remain modest as fears of a second wave of infections weighed on consumption.

Investing.com - Federal Reserve policymakers agreed that current monetary policy measures were appropriate to support the economic recovery as the risks to the outlook remained tilted to the downside,  the minutes of the Fed's September meeting showed on Wednesday.
""Fiscal policy measures, along with the support from monetary policy and the Federal Reserve's liquidity and lending facilities, were expected to continue supporting the second-half recovery, al­though the recovery was forecast to be far from complete by year-end. The staff's forecast assumed the enactment of some additional fiscal policy support this year; without that additional policy action, the pace of the economic recovery would likely be slower.""
At its previous meeting, the Fed held interest rates steady in the range of 0% to 0.25% and signaled no hikes through 2023.
The minutes of the meeting showed there was a consensus among members to keep policy accommodative until the economy has achieved maximum employment and inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time. The minutes noted, however, that inflation is not expected to meet the central bank's target any time soon.  ""With the more-accommodative monetary policy assumed in the current forecast, which reflected the recent consensus statement, inflation was projected to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023.""
The minutes come a day after hopes that U.S. lawmakers will roll out broad-based stimulus sooner rather than later were dealt a blow.  President Donald Trump on Tuesday rejected U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's $2.4 trillion stimulus proposal, though vowed to pass a ""major"" stimulus should he emerge victorious in the upcoming election.  Trump, however, said he was ready to sign separate stimulus packages. 
Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday warned Congress over the economic fallout of delivering a stimulus package that was too small.
""Too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses,"" Powell said in a speech at a virtual annual meeting held by the National Association for Business Economics. ""Over time, household insolvencies and business bankruptcies would rise, harming the productive capacity of the economy, and holding back wage growth.""
The Fed's September meeting also marked the central bank's adoption of its new inflation measure allowing prices to overshoot its 2% target for a period of time. Fed members supported the shift outcome-based guidance, though some raised concerns the enhanced forward guidance could limit the central bank's flexibility and pressure yields.
""Several participants noted that while they agreed it was appropriate to incorporate key elements of the consensus statement into the postmeeting statement, they preferred to retain forward guidance similar to that provided in recent FOMC statements. These participants judged that it would likely be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of policy for some time in order to foster outcomes consistent with the Committee's revised consensus statement,"" the minutes noted.
But with longer-term interest rates already very low, there did ""not appear to be a need for enhanced forward guidance at this juncture or much scope for forward guidance to put additional downward pressure on yields."" These participants were concerned that forward guidance that involved the target range for the federal funds rate remaining at the effective lower bound until employment and inflation criteria were achieved could limit the Committee's flexibility for years,"""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government upgraded its assessment of the economy on Wednesday for the first time since May 2019 after a key indicator improved for August, pointing to a gradual recovery from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The index of coincident economic indicators, which measures a range of data including factory output, employment and retail sales numbers, rose a preliminary 1.1 points from the previous month to 79.4 in August, the Cabinet Office said on Wednesday. 
Based on the index data, the Cabinet Office said that showed economic activity in the world's third-largest economy had stopped contracting, an upgrade from its previous view that the economy was ""worsening"" in July.
""There is a possibility that the index will grow further this year as there is room for exports, notably auto shipments, and consumer spending to recover,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""The economy overall has been picking up after hitting the bottom around May and a gradual recovery is expected to continue.""
The data offers some relief for new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who has pledged to contain the coronavirus outbreak and revive Japan's battered economy.
The report follows the release last month of more upbeat economic outlook from the Bank of Japan, suggesting that no immediate expansion of stimulus was needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
Also on Wednesday, the Cabinet Office reported the index of leading economic indicators, which is a gauge of the economy a few months ahead and is compiled using data such as job offers and consumer sentiment, grew 2.1 points to 88.8 from July.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Orders for German-made goods rose 4.5% in August, more than expected, boosting hopes for a robust third-quarter in Europe's largest economy after the coronavirus shock.
The increases were driven by demand from the euro zone, the Federal Statistics Office said on Tuesday, suggesting companies are making good progress back to pre-crisis levels. A Reuters forecast had predicted a 2.6% gain on the previous month. 
""The catch-up process for new industry orders is continuing at a remarkable pace,"" the economy ministry said in a statement.
Order intake was now only 3.6% lower than in February, before lockdown measures were imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the office said.
Economists applauded the strong data, but cautioned that rising infection rates across Europe were increasing the risk of setbacks.
""It is difficult to imagine how German manufacturing could escape another round of lockdown measures with important trading partners,"" said ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski.
""Nevertheless, today's industrial order data suggest that full order books - at least in the near future - could help the manufacturing sector to overtake the service sector.""
Official figures released last week showed German retail sales rose much more than expected in August and unemployment fell further in September, boosting hopes that household spending would power a recovery.
Figures from the statistics office showed that orders from abroad increased by 6.5%, boosted by a 14.6% surge in orders from the rest of the euro zone. Domestic orders rose by 1.7% on the month.
The German economy contracted by 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investments and trade collapsed at the height of the pandemic.
An easing of lockdown measures, coupled with an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus packages, has led to a robust recovery in the third quarter, but a spike in new COVID-19 cases has caused concern that activity could slow again.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Monday its non-manufacturing activity index rose to a reading of 57.8 last month from 56.9 in August. That put the index just above its 57.3 level in February. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index slipping to 56.0 in September.
The improvement in services industry activity fits in with expectations for a record rebound in economic growth in the third quarter after a historic plunge in gross domestic product in the April-June period. The economy got a boost over the summer from fiscal stimulus. 
Growth has, however, shifted into low gear as businesses exhaust government loans to help them with expenses like wages and funding for a weekly unemployment subsidy for millions runs out. New coronavirus cases are rising, with a surge expected in the fall, which could lead to some restrictions being imposed on businesses in the services sector.
The ISM reported last week that factory activity slowed in September as new orders retreated from a more than 16-1/2-year high. The government reported on Friday the economy added 661,000 jobs in September, the fewest since the jobs recovery started in May, after creating 1.489 million in August.

Monday's purchasing managers' surveys showed services activity, which accounts for around two-thirds of the bloc's GDP, slammed into reverse after sister surveys last week suggested factories was enjoying something of a revival.
There was also a split between the currency union's member countries. While Germany's service industry barely grew in September, strong manufacturing helped the private sector in Europe's largest economy remain on track for a solid recovery.
But French business activity fell for the first time since June and in Spain the services sector sank deeper into the red as travel restrictions ravaged the summer tourism season.
Italy's services industry contracted for the second month running with no sign of recovery on the horizon.
""The recovery in industry had been lagging but does seem now to have been catching up whereas services really is bearing the brunt of tighter restrictions,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
""In Spain and France in particular, and elsewhere in the euro zone, there has been a tightening up. Fears of a resurgence are adding to consumer caution,"" Hinds said.
Meanwhile, Britain's economy, outside the currency union, proved more resilient than initially thought last month, despite a tightening of lockdown restrictions and an end to a temporary government subsidy for businesses such as restaurants and bars.
EXTRA SUPPORT
Euro zone retail sales were much stronger than expected in August due to a sharp surge of online purchases and increased clothing sales amid the pandemic, although July sales were revised downwards, official data showed on Monday.
""These sales numbers are almost too good to be true, with worries about unemployment rising and consumer confidence at historically low levels,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. 
""Current levels of spending cannot be maintained for more than a few months at best, and are likely to be reversed sooner.""
To support the bloc's economy, the European Central Bank plans to make 1.35 trillion euros of additional pandemic-related asset purchases and the European Union has announced a 750 billion euro recovery fund due to kick in next year.
But that didn't stop IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index, combining services and manufacturing surveys and seen as a good barometer of overall economic health, falling to 50.4 in September from August's 51.9, close to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
Suggesting any pick up may take some time, however, demand for services fell in September and firms cut headcount for a seventh month. 

Still, optimism about the coming year improved to levels not seen since before Europe felt the full brunt of the pandemic. The composite future output index rose to its highest level since February.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy proved more resilient than initially thought last month, despite a tightening of lockdown restrictions and an end to a temporary government subsidy for businesses such as restaurants and bars, a major survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the services sector - which does not cover retailers - dropped to 56.1 in September from August's five-year high of 58.8, but the decline was smaller than an initial ""flash"" estimate of 55.1.
Readings above 50 indicate that a majority of businesses reported growth in activity.
The composite PMI, which includes manufacturing data released last week, fell to 56.5 from August's six-year high of 59.1, again a smaller drop than first reported.
""The UK service sector showed encouraging resilience in September, with business activity continuing to grow solidly despite the government's 'Eat Out to Help Out' scheme being withdrawn,"" IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said.
""Many other consumer services activities showed a similar slide back into contraction as renewed lockdown measures were introduced,"" he added.
The PMI data painted a more upbeat picture than most other business surveys. 
The British Chambers of Commerce said on Thursday that many more firms reported falls in sales during the third quarter than saw an increase, and said its data did not point to a sharp, 'V'-shaped recovery. [nL8N2GS5KG]
Britain's economy shrank by a record 20% in the second quarter when lockdown measures were tightest, and performed worse than any other major advanced economy in the first half of the year. [nL8N2GR3AE]
However there has been a fairly rapid - though uneven - recovery and economists polled by Reuters forecast on average that August gross domestic product data, due on Friday, will show output was around 7% below its year-ago level.
Last week the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he expected output in September to be just 3-4% below year-ago levels, and said many commentators had underestimated the strength of the rebound. [nL8N2GR2P3]
Nonetheless, a sharp rise in COVID cases in Britain in September - following similar surges in France and Spain - has led to new restrictions on socialising at home or outside, though schools and workplaces remain open.
IHS Markit said confidence about the future remained positive, but was its weakest since May in both the services and the composite data.

Businesses also cut jobs for a seventh month in a row in September - the longest run since 2010. The reductions, though, were at the slowest pace since March despite the imminent end of a government job support programme this month.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its purchasing managers index, covering the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 48.5 from 51.6 in August, unchanged from a preliminary reading.
The index dropped below the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction for the first time since June, after France emerged from a nearly two-month coronavirus lockdown the previous month.
IHS Markit's PMI index for the services sector also fell into contraction territory at 47.5. 
Already published data for the manufacturing sector, much less client-facing than services, showed that activity picked up slightly there.
""Rising COVID-19 infection rates contributed to a downturn in private sector business activity at the end of third quarter,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.

""Panellists commented that their clients were hesitant to commit to future work while the prospect of tightening restrictions loomed large,"" he added.

IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.6 from 52.5 in the previous month.
The reading, which came in higher than a flash reading of 49.1, marked the third month in a row that the services index was above the 50 mark dividing growth from contraction.
The final composite PMI covering both the services and manufacturing sectors rose to 54.7 from 54.4 the previous month. That was higher than the flash figure of 53.7.
IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said coronavirus infections in Germany had been rising to a smaller extent than in other European countries, so the impact on actual services activity had been smaller than in the likes of Spain and France.
""While the service sector is close to stalling, growth in Germany has been buoyed by a reviving manufacturing sector, which means the economy carries at least some momentum heading into the final quarter of the year,"" Smith said.
Germany is doing also better than most of its euro zone peers in terms of shielding the labour market from the brunt of the pandemic as there was some hiring across the service sector and a slowdown in factory job cuts, he added.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz have since March unleashed an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus measures to help companies and consumers recover as quickly as possible from Germany's deepest recession on record.
The packages include unlimited liquidity aid for struggling companies, a massive job protection scheme to shield workers from sudden unemployment as well as cash handouts for parents and a temporary value added tax cut to boost domestic demand.
The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investments and trade collapsed at the height of the pandemic.

For the third quarter, the Ifo institute expects 6.6% output growth which is seen slowing to 2.8% in the fourth quarter.

Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of services companies, which account for around half of the country's economic output, fell to 42.4 in September from 47.7 in August. The 50 line separates growth from contraction.
The indicator had briefly surpassed 50 in June and July when the country emerged from a three-month lockdown. But new outbreaks of the coronavirus and travel restrictions imposed by various European countries have ravaged the summer tourism season.
""September’s services data highlights how the recovery from the most severe impacts of COVID-19 earlier in the year is faltering,"" said Paul Smith, economics director at IHS Markit.
A sister survey of Spanish manufacturing activity on Thursday showed a pick up to 50.8 in September from 49.9 in August.
After the lockdown ended in late June, Spain's economy gradually revived in July.
The Spanish economy contracted 17.8% in the second quarter, the biggest fall on record and one of the deepest downturns in the region.

Even though the economy is expect to rebound in the third quarter, ""the PMI data showcase that the recovery is unlikely to be sustained at anywhere near strong enough rates to help close the considerable output gap,"" Smith said.

The final Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to its highest in eight months, coming in at a seasonally adjusted 46.9 from 45.0 in the previous month. 
The headline index, while still below the 50 neutral level, was higher than a preliminary reading of 45.6, suggesting conditions were moving closer to stabilisation.
""Overall, there are signs of improvement in the sector, however recovery is far from secure,"" said Shreeya Patel, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Demand across the country remains subdued, with tourism and travel restrictions impeding new work volumes across the service sector.""
The main reading was pulled down by an accelerated decline in new orders from abroad, with surveyed firms citing depressed demand conditions in export markets as well as the closure of clients' businesses.
However, the survey also showed strong optimism in companies' outlook for the 12 months ahead on hopes of a recovery in demand, pushing the business expectations sub-index to its highest level of the year.
While job shedding continued for a seventh month, the pace of staff cuts was more modest and neared a neutral level.
The results echo a key Bank of Japan survey from last week that showed business sentiment improved in the third quarter from a 11-year low hit three months earlier, in a sign of a gradual economic turnaround.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, rose to 46.6 in September from the previous month's final of 45.2.

National Australia Bank's (AX:NAB) index of business conditions rose 6 points to 0 from -6 in August.
The index has come a long way since hitting a trough of -34 in April at the height of the pandemic though it is still nowhere close to the long-run average of +6.
The survey's measure of business confidence picked up too, but stayed in negative territory, climbing to -4 from -8 in August.
The improvement in conditions was driven by a rise in all three sub-components with trading and profitability in positive territory, likely reflecting improving activity as the economy opens up.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment growth slowed more than expected in September and over 300,000 Americans lost their jobs permanently, dealing a potential blow to President Donald Trump ahead of the fiercely contested Nov. 3 presidential election. 
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday underscored an urgent need for additional fiscal stimulus to aid the economy's recovery from a recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The slowdown in hiring compounds problems for Trump, who announced overnight that he had tested positive for coronavirus.
Just over half of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic have been recouped. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party nominee, blames the economic turmoil on the White House's handling of the pandemic, which has killed more than 200,000 people and infected over 7 million in the nation.
""The jobs report adds to Trump's woes,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""Betting odds signal a diminished chance he will win re-election and a much higher probability of a Democrat clean sweep.""
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 661,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May, after advancing 1.489 million in August. Every sector added jobs with the exception of government, which shed 216,000 positions because of the departure of temporary workers hired for the Census and layoffs at state and local government education departments as many school districts shift to online learning.
Employment in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 318,000, accounting for nearly half of the gain in nonfarm employment. Payrolls are 10.7 million below their pre-pandemic level. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 850,000 jobs were created in September. Employment growth peaked in June when payrolls jumped by a record 4.781 million jobs.
(Graphic: Nonfarm payrolls - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/azgvoaeqevd/nfpr.png)
The unemployment rate fell to 7.9% in September as 695,000 people left the labor force from 8.4% in August. The jobless rate was again biased down by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" 
Without this error, the government estimated that the unemployment rate would have been about 8.3% in September. There were 3.8 million people who had lost their jobs for good, up 345,000 from August. More experienced long bouts of unemployment, with the number of people out of work for more than 27 weeks surging 781,000 to 2.4 million. 
The slowing labor market recovery is the strongest sign yet that the economy has shifted into lower gear heading into the fourth quarter. Growth got a boost over the summer from fiscal stimulus. Third-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates are topping a 32% annualized rate, which would reverse a historic 31.4% pace of contraction in the April-June quarter. 
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been cut to around a 2.5% rate from above a 10% pace.
""The virus is in the driver's seat in controlling the speed of the recovery and right now the economy is in the slow lane unless Congress and the White House can settle their differences and provide additional stimulus,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
WOMEN LEAVING LABOR FORCE
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on Thursday approved a $2.2 trillion rescue package. Objections from top Republicans are likely to doom the plan in the Senate.
New coronavirus cases are rising, with a surge expected in the fall, which could lead to some restrictions being imposed on businesses in the services sector. Trump's positive coronavirus test added to political uncertainty that could extend beyond the election, and make businesses cautious about hiring.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. said this week it would lay off roughly 28,000 employees in its theme parks division. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines, two of the largest U.S. carriers, said they were beginning furloughs of more than 32,000 workers on Thursday, absent government assistance.
With many enduring long spells of joblessness, economists believe the unemployment rate will not see its pre-crisis level of 3.5% until mid-2024 and it could take a year to regain the lost jobs. This could further widen the income inequality gap.
The COVID-19 crisis has disproportionately affected the lower-income population and women, who have dropped out of the labor force to look after children. 
(Graphic: Labor market participation - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnpwjzqrvw/lmparticipation.png)
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 61.4% from 61.7% in August. The participation rate for women dropped to 55.6% from 56.1%. It was little changed for men.
""It may very well be the case that more home schooling is putting incremental downward pressure on the labor force participation rate, which fell meaningfully more in September for women,"" said Robert Rosener, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.
Though people worked more hours, a proxy for take-home wages declined on a year-on-year basis for a sixth straight month.

""This along with reduced fiscal support will temper consumer spending in the coming months,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that factory orders rose 0.7% after accelerating 6.5% in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would increase 1.0% in August.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of U.S. economic activity, is recovering from its pandemic lows as businesses replenish inventories. The pace of expansion, however, is slowing as the coronavirus crisis lingers and the boost from fiscal stimulus ebbs.
The Institute for Supply Management reported on Thursday that its measure of national factory activity fell in September as new orders retreated from more than a 16-1/2-year high.
Unfilled orders at factories dropped 0.6% in August after falling 0.7% in July. Inventories at factories were unchanged, while shipments of manufactured goods rose 0.3%.
The government also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, rose 1.9% in August instead of increasing 1.8% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, increased 1.5% as previously reported.

Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market's recovery weakened in September, with the economy adding only 661,000 new nonfarm jobs through the middle of the month, less than half of what it created in the month through mid-August.
The number was well below expectations for net gains of 850,000. However, August's numbers were revised up by 118,000 to 1.47 million.
Kit Juckes, a macro strategist for Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), said via Twtter that the data ""suggest (the) jobs recovery is ongoing but slowing a bit.""
The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 7.9% of the workforce, from 8.4% in August. Analysts had expected a rate of 8.2% ahead of time. The broader 'U6' measure of underemployment also fell, but stayed at the historically high level of 12.8% of the labor force. Participation in the workforce fell again, to 61.4% from 61.7% in August.
The shortfall in job gains was accounted for entirely by government employment, which fell by 216,000 in the month. Private payrolls expanded by 877,000, even more than expected after ADP flagged a gain of just under 750,000 earlier in the week. 
Financial markets were nonetheless disappointed by the news, which followed only hours after President Donald Trump's positive test for the Covid-19 virus for once upstaged what is normally the world's most important economic data release of the month. By 8:55 AM ET (1455 GMT), Dow Jones Futures were down 1.6% after being down only 1.2% immediately before the release, while S&P 500 Futures were down 1.7%.
The last two months' data have been distorted to a degree by hiring for the 2020 census. On a slightly longer view, it now appears that the economy has clawed back just over half of the jobs that it lost in first wave of the pandemic in spring. 
However, the pace of improvement has slowed markedly from nearly 4.8 million new jobs in June to less than one-fifth of that in September. In addition, there are increasing signs of companies finally resorting to layoffs as the level of government support for the economy ebbs in the absence of a new fiscal support package. Walt Disney  (NYSE:DIS), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) between them confirmed some 60,000 job cuts this week alone, while insurer Allstate  (NYSE:ALL) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also announced they would shed positions.
""Today's jobs report will not change perceptions that (the) U.S. labor market is stressed,"" wrote Marc Chandler, managing director of Bannockburn Global Forex. ""Yesterday, we learned 837,000 people filed initial unemployment benefit and another 650,000 sought emergency assistance.""

596,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation fell deeper into negative territory last month, raising pressure on the European Central Bank to add stimulus, as an ongoing recession will keep price growth below its target for years to come. 
Annual inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell to minus 0.3% in September, its lowest in more than four years, from minus 0.2% a month earlier. That fell short of expectations for an unchanged reading, data from Eurostat showed on Friday.
More worryingly for ECB policymakers, underlying inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, fell to 0.4% from 0.6%, far from the ECB's target of almost 2%. Services inflation slowed further and the cost of imported industrial goods fell.
Although the ECB has unleashed unprecedented stimulus this year to combat a pandemic-induced economic shock, rising unemployment, surging savings, widespread restrictions on travel and plummeting business investment have proved an exceptional drag on prices.
A second wave of the coronavirus is likely to add to the gloom, which torpedoes confidence and weighs on prices further, economists say.
While the ECB held fire last month, it kept the door wide open to more stimulus. Board member Fabio Panetta made a clear case for preemptive action, arguing that the cost of doing too much is smaller than the cost of inaction.
His argument is further supported by a tumble in an even narrower core inflation reading, which also excludes alcohol and tobacco prices, to 0.2% from 0.4%.
Still, no ECB move is likely in October. Policymakers have long said that more data, particularly on 2021 fiscal policies, will be needed before they can take a fresh decision.
They have also prepared markets for bad inflation readings, arguing that price growth could stay negative for the rest of the year before a steady acceleration next year.
But more stimulus is increasingly likely in December. The ECB is expected then to extend and expand its 1.35 trillion-euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, used to soak up government and corporate debt to keep borrowing costs down.
The ECB could also improve the terms of its super cheap loans to commercial banks so they will keep lending to the real economy.

Some 83,529 people left the ERTE furlough scheme in September, leaving 728,909 workers still enrolled, the data showed. That is 76% lower than the April peak, when more than 3 million people were supported by the programme.
Some 84,013 net jobs were added in September, an increase of 0.45% from August and the fifth consecutive month of job creation.
Over the same period, the number of people registering as jobless fell by 0.69%, or 26,329 people, leaving 3.8 million people out of work, according to the Labour Ministry.
Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz said it was the largest drop in jobless numbers recorded in September since 1996.
""These data show a positive trend in a still uncertain pandemic scenario,"" she tweeted. 
Unemployment had risen by 0.79% in August as new outbreaks of the coronavirus and travel restrictions imposed by other countries began taking a toll after months of timid recovery from an initial lockdown.

Analysts say the economy is rebounding gradually after suffering its worst post-war contraction in the second quarter, but the jobs and wage situation remain weak. 
New COVID-19 cases in Japan have been on a general downward trend recently but appear to be levelling off.
Household spending likely fell 6.9 % in August from a year earlier, the poll of 14 economists showed, after a 7.6 % fall in July. 
Compared with the previous month, household spending is forecast to have risen 3.2% in August from a 6.5% decline, the poll found.
""As the coronavirus cases resurged in Japan, people's self-restraint stance towards spending on entertainment and tourism persisted,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Wage pressures such as lower summer bonuses are expected to result in lacklustre consumer spending for some time, he added.
The government will announce household spending data at 8:30 a.m. on Oct. 9 (2330 GMT, Oct. 8).
The government is continuing to urge restaurants and shops to take measures to prevent infections, such as giving enough distancing and good ventilation to customers. 
Other data next week is expected to show the current account balance was in a surplus of 1.98 trillion yen ($18.74 billion) in August, up from 1.47 trillion yen in July, partly helped by a pickup in exports on the back of the global economic recovery, analysts said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's unemployment rate rose in August to its highest in over three years and job availability fell to a more than six-year low, government data showed on Friday, indicating damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic persisted through the month.
The figures come after new prime minister Yoshihide Suga pledged to protect jobs, keep companies in business and help the economy recover from the impact of measures taken to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
They also dull any optimism brought by recent data such as factory output and business sentiment which offered signs of economic recovery.
""The government's special employment subsidy to support firms hit by the coronavirus has helped to rein in the jobless rate, which could have risen much higher,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Research Institute.
""People have started to seek jobs but the labour market is not strong enough to absorb them. The pace of recovery in the jobs market is likely to slow and the unemployment rate could rise further.""
Japan's seasonally adjusted jobless rate rose to 3.0% in August, the highest since May 2017, labour ministry data showed. The result met analysts' median forecast of 3.0%.
The data showed about 2.06 million people lost their jobs in August, 490,000 more than in the same month a year earlier, and marking the seventh consecutive month of increase.
Compared with the previous month, however, the number of employed workers rose by 110,000 people in seasonally adjusted terms - the fourth straight month of gain.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio fell to 1.04, matching a level last seen in January 2014. It compared with 1.08 in July, and a median forecast of 1.05.
Worsening conditions in the jobs market is likely to add pressure to the government to offer further support for small and mid-sized firms to help prevent further job losses.

""Economic conditions remained exceptionally weak in the third quarter,"" BCC economist Suren Thiru said.
The BCC's quarterly economic survey - the largest of its kind in Britain - showed that 46% of firms surveyed reported that sales had fallen over the quarter, compared with 73% who reported a decline in the second quarter.
Just 27% of the 6,410 businesses surveyed between Aug. 24 and Sept. 14 reported higher sales than three months earlier.
The hospitality and catering sectors - which still face significant COVID restrictions on the size of events - were the most likely to report a further fall in sales. 
""While the declines in indicators of activity slowed as the UK economy gradually reopened, they remain well short of pre-pandemic levels with little sign of a swift 'V'-shaped recovery,"" Thiru said.
Britain's economy shrank by an historic 20% in the second quarter of 2020 after output collapsed in April, and the most recent official data show output in July was 11% below last year's level.
Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane estimated on Wednesday that output at the end of September was just 3%-4% below pre-crisis levels, and said those who took a less upbeat view risked undermining the recovery.
Some 41% of businesses in the BCC survey expected sales to improve over the next 12 months, compared with 35% who expected a decline.
However the BCC said rising coronavirus cases and more widespread local lockdowns since the survey concluded raised the danger that recent gains would go into reverse.

""Economic scarring already caused by the pandemic (is) starting to crystallise,"" Thiru said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week but remained at recession levels, while personal income dropped in August, underscoring the need for another government rescue package for businesses and the unemployed.
The decline in initial claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday likely reflected a decision by California, the most populous state in the nation, to suspend the processing of new applications for two weeks to combat fraud. Factory activity slowed in September, other data showed.
Economists are warning that the economy and labor market recovery from the COVID-19 slump could sputter without an infusion of new money from the government. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are working toward a bipartisan agreement for another fiscal package.
""The recovery's wheels are spinning in the sand,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""It's going to be a slow return to normal for the economy.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 36,000 to a seasonally adjusted 837,000 for the week ended Sept. 26. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 850,000 applications in the latest week.
California is using the two-week pause to reduce its claims processing backlog and implement fraud prevention measures. The Labor Department acknowledged the suspension could result in ""significant"" week-to-week swings in initial claims ""unrelated to any changes in economic conditions."" 
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.4 million claims were filed last week.
Though filings have dropped from a record 6.867 million at the end of March, they remain well above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession. 
Labor market gains from the reopening of businesses are fading and economists are predicting a slowdown in hiring through the rest of this year and into 2021.
New coronavirus cases are rising, with a surge expected in the fall, which could lead to some restrictions being imposed on businesses in the services sector. In addition, political uncertainty is rising and could extend beyond the Nov. 3 presidential election, and make businesses reluctant to hire.
Several months after operations resumed, demand has remained poor, especially in the services sector, leading some establishments to permanently shut down and keeping job cuts elevated. Walt  Disney  Co. (N:DIS) said this week it would lay off roughly 28,000 employees in its theme parks division.
American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL), two of the largest U.S. carriers, said they were beginning furloughs of more than 32,000 workers on Thursday, without government funding.
""Likely more than one in three initial claims being filed are among people reopening a claim after initially going back to work and off of unemployment,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation in New York. ""The other two-thirds represent the continued undertow of layoffs.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as investors remained hopeful of fiscal stimulus. The dollar (DXY) dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED 
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 980,000 to 11.767 million in the week ending Sept. 19. But economists cautioned that part of the decline was probably due to people exhausting their 26-week eligibility for benefits.
At least 1.8 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Sept. 12, up 196,725 from the prior week. There were 26.5 million people receiving unemployment benefits during that period.
The government will publish its closely followed employment report on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 850,000 jobs in September after rising by 1.371 million in August, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would leave employment 10.7 million below its level in February.
Employment growth peaked in June when payrolls jumped by a record 4.781 million jobs. 
A separate report on Thursday from the Commerce Department showed personal income dropped 2.7% in August, reflecting a decrease in unemployment insurance benefits. A $600 unemployment subsidy ended in July and was replaced by a $300 supplement, whose funding is running out. Income increased 0.5% in July. 
The unemployment subsidy has helped to anchor consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, putting the economy on track for record growth in the third quarter after a historic plunge in the April-June period. 
Consumer spending increased 1.0% in August after rising 1.5% in July. Consumption remains 4% below its pre-pandemic level. Economists saw little boost from savings, which totaled $2.43 trillion in August. 

""There is enormous potential for economic growth in savings, but the fact Americans saved 14% of their income in August despite the loss of pandemic aid suggests the kind of caution that can limit an economic rebound,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Those who have income to save are in no rush to spend it.""

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that construction spending jumped 1.4%. Data for July was revised higher to show construction outlays increasing 0.7% instead of edging up 0.1% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending gaining 0.8% in August. Construction spending shot up 2.5% on a year-on-year basis.
Spending on private construction projects surged 1.9%, fueled by investment in homebuilding amid record-low mortgage rates and a pandemic-driven migration to suburbs and low density areas. Spending on residential projects accelerated 3.7%, eclipsing a 0.3% drop in outlays on nonresidential construction projects such as manufacturing and power plants.

Spending on public construction projects nudged up 0.1%.

605,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly slowed in September as new orders retreated from a more than 16-1/2-year high, in line with expectations of a moderation in economic growth after a fiscal stimulus boost over the summer.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 55.4 last month from 56 in August, which was the highest level since November 2018. Despite last month's dip in the index, September marked the fourth straight month of growth. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 56.3 in September.
The slowdown in manufacturing activity last month supports views that the recovery from the COVID-19 recession is losing steam as government money to help businesses and millions of unemployed runs out. In addition, new coronavirus cases are rising and infections are expected to accelerate in the fall. 
Gross domestic product is forecast topping a record 32% annualized rate in the third quarter after plunging at a historic 31.4% pace in the April-June period. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been cut to around a 2.5% rate from above a 10% pace. 
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index decreased to 60.2 from a reading of 67.6 in August, which was the strongest since January 2004. The survey's measure of order backlogs at factories, however, rose as did orders for exports.
Factory employment continued to improve last month, but remained in contraction territory. The ISM's manufacturing employment gauge rose to a reading of 49.6 from 46.4 in August.
Coming on the heels of a report on Wednesday showing private payrolls increased more than expected last month, the improvement in hiring at factories bodes well for employment growth in September.

The government's closely followed employment report to be released on Friday is expected to show 850,000 jobs created in September after adding 1.371 million in August, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would leave nonfarm payrolls about 10.7 million below their pre-pandemic level.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 56.0 in September, its highest level since August 2018, from 55.1 in the prior month. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
It was the fifth straight month that the index has climbed. It bottomed at a record low of 33.0 in April, when businesses were closed to help contain the coronavirus pandemic.
""Overall, the health of the Canadian manufacturing sector continued to strengthen in September, as has been the case throughout the third quarter,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
A strong increase in workforce numbers suggested ""a commitment towards expanding production schedules in the months to come,"" said Patel.
The employment index rose to 54.3 from 53.8 in August, while the measure of new orders was at its highest level since June 2018 at 57.7, up from 55.0. New export orders expanded for the second straight month.
Still, the pandemic continued to disrupt supply chains. The index of suppliers' delivery times edged up to 38.0 from 37.4 in August, holding well below the 50 threshold.
Canada has seen a resurgence of coronavirus cases in recent weeks. But economists expect activity to suffer a smaller hit than earlier this year, as provinces strive to avoid broad-based lockdowns and take targeted measures to deal with outbreaks.

Data on Wednesday showed that gross domestic product continued to rebound in July and August but was still about 5% below pre-pandemic levels.

Investing.com -- The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell by slightly more than expected last week but, at 837,000, still reflected abnormally high levels of layoffs six months into the coronavirus pandemic.
The number of continuing jobless claims, fell much more clearly, by nearly 1 million, to 11.767 million. Continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag to initial ones. 
The figures come with an important caveat: California has temporarily suspended reporting its data as it struggles to clear a backlog of unprocessed and modified claims. The state has put in place a "" two week reset period that will help expedite new claimant payments, reduce fraud and tackle backlog issues,"" according to the Californian Employment Development Department. 
Figures for the overall number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits, including Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, come with a lag of another week. They showed a rise of 454,000 to 26.53 million.
The data come a day after payrolls processor ADP reported that the private sector hired nearly 750,000 people in the month through mid-September, suggesting that workers are finding it easier to get rehired after the initial round of pandemic-related layoffs. 
Separately, fresh data showed the further erosion of consumers' willingness, or ability, to spend as a result of the pandemic. Personal incomes fell 2.7% in August, their third decline in four months, while personal spending  growth weakened to 1.0%, from a downwardly-revised 1.5% in July. The spending numbers showed that the personal consumer expenditure basket of prices, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, rose to 1.6%, above expectations for 1.4%.
The trajectory of both income and spending point to Americans dipping into their savings more to cover current expenses. The August savings rate of 14.1% was down from 17.7% in July, Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), said via Twitter although she noted this was still well off the crisis high of over 33%."

The layoffs reported by global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday were up 2.6% from August and boosted total job cuts so far this year to a record 2.082 million. The previous all-time annual high was 1.957 million in 2001. Job cuts totaled 497,215 in the third quarter, down 59.8% from second quarter.
Companies announced 929,860 hiring intentions last month, bringing the total this year to 2.673 million. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) announced it would add 260,000 jobs as it reopens restaurants. 
""We are setting new records for job cuts even though things have improved since the earliest days of the pandemic,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray.
The rise in layoffs comes as companies have burned through government loans to help with wages. Funding for a reduced subsidy for the unemployed is also close to running out. Economists have warned that the labor market and broader economic recovery could sputter without another rescue package.
Companies attributed the planned layoffs last month to market conditions, weak demand, restructuring and COVID-19.
There were 32,099 job cuts at bars, restaurants, hotels and amusement parks in September, an 86% jump from August. That brought the total this year to 831,150. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) said on Tuesday it would lay off roughly 28,000 employees in its theme parks division. 
The aerospace/defense announced 18,971 layoffs last month. There were 16,628 cuts in the transportation sector.
""Especially if another relief package fails to pass, employers are going to enter the fourth quarter hesitant
to invest or spend,"" said Challenger.

The Labor Department will publish its closely watched, and broader, monthly employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased 850,000 by jobs in September after rising 1.371 million in August.

LONDON (Reuters) - The recovery in euro zone manufacturing activity gathered pace last month but it was largely driven by strength in powerhouse Germany, and rising coronavirus cases across the region may yet reverse the upturn, a survey showed.
While the manufacturing sector is enjoying something of a revival, most market watchers and policymakers will focus on a survey for the bloc's dominant service industry, which accounts for around two-thirds of GDP, due on Monday. 
Its preliminary reading returned to contraction territory last month, suggesting renewed coronavirus-led lockdown restrictions were having an impact.
""If you look across the region, the fact is large numbers of services firms may no longer be viable in a world where we have a significant amount of COVID-19 restrictions in place and that means there could be a big employment shake out,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).""
Factories also cut headcount in September, albeit at a shallower pace than the previous month, and official data showed unemployment across the region rose to 8.1% in August.
As the pandemic raged across Europe governments imposed tough lockdowns. But as infection rates fell, many of those controls were removed. 
However, a resurgence in cases has meant some restrictions have now been reimposed.
That resurgence is the biggest threat to the recovering euro zone economy, according to a Reuters poll of economists last month, who said growth and inflation are more likely to create negative surprises over the coming year than positive ones. [ECILT/EU]
""Second wave effects carry a lot of uncertainty about the growth environment though. A new round of more national lockdowns could have a serious impact on the labour market again, which is not our base case, but cannot be ruled out either,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
Still, surging demand after the initial relaxation pushed IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index to 53.7 in September from August's 51.7, in line with an earlier flash reading and its highest level since August 2018. 
Anything above 50 indicates growth.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI due on Monday and is seen as a good guide to economic health, bounced to its highest since February 2018.
Earlier figures showed factory output in Germany, Europe's largest economy, was booming - in contrast to modest production growth in France and Spain and slightly slower growth in Italy.
Without Germany, output growth would have weakened to the lowest since June, IHS Markit said.
Growth also slowed in Britain, outside the currency union, and the pace of the bounce-back is expected to weaken further in coming months as the government scales back its job subsidies and seeks to clamp down on rising COVID-19 cases. [GB/PMIM]
But with overall demand at a 2-1/2-year high, euro zone factories built up a backlog of work. Meanwhile, optimism about the coming 12 months climbed to a level not seen since before the U.S.-China trade war escalation in early 2018. 

The future output index rose to 63.8 from August's 61.5.

The IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 54.1. That was down a touch from a preliminary reading of 54.3 and below August's two-and-a-half-year high of 55.2, but well above the 50.0 threshold denoting growth.
""Output and new orders increased as new work intakes improved from both domestic and overseas markets,"" IHS Markit said, pointing to more companies reopening after the lockdown and staff returning to work from temporary layoffs.
Britain's economy is recovering from its COVID-19 lockdown more quickly than predicted by the Bank of England and other forecasters, although it probably remains as much as 10% smaller than before the pandemic, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey has said.
The pace of the bounce-back is expected to slow in the coming months as the government scales back its job subsidies and seeks to clamp down on rising COVID-19 cases.
But Thursday's PMI survey for the manufacturing sector - which accounts for about 10% of Britain's economy - showed little sign of a slowdown in September.
The steepest increase in output was in intermediate goods, typically a sign that companies are investing in more equipment, and confidence was close to July's 28-month high. 
""However, there were also increased numbers of firms noting uncertainty about the path ahead, particularly regarding COVID-19 and Brexit,"" Markit said.
Jobs were lost for the eighth month in a row but at the slowest pace since February.

As demand picked up and raw materials became more expensive, the cost of inputs rose at the fastest pace in 21 months, leading manufacturers to raise their selling prices again.

That was lower than a flash estimate of 56.6 but far higher than August's reading of 52.2.
Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit, said both orders and output were rising all across the manufacturing sector, helped by growing export demand.
""Even investment goods producers, who have generally underperformed in the recovery up to now, enjoyed a much better month in September,"" Smith said.

The survey showed that manufacturers' output and new orders from clients improved in September while confidence rose further despite a surge in new coronavirus cases to record levels.
IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said that the the good momentum could be derailed if infection rates continued to climb, triggering further restrictions.
""With the winter months approaching, we may yet see a renewed tightening of restrictions which would severely hinder the progress of many firms in the manufacturing sector,"" he said.

Job vacancies jumped a whopping 59.4% in the three months to August after a record 43.2% slump between March and May, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed. There were 4.5 unemployed people per vacancy over that period, down from 7.1 in the three months to May.
Vacancies were well below pre-pandemic levels in the state of Victoria, which is in a coronavirus lockdown, as well as in New South Wales, which saw a spillover of infections from Victoria's second wave of the novel coronavirus.
In contrast, vacancies were higher than pre-pandemic levels in Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia, and Northern Territory, signalling a rapid rebound in labour demand as mobility curbs to contain the virus eased.
Economists said interstate border restrictions could also have affected the ability of companies to fill positions.

The private sector was harder hit by the pandemic, with vacancies in there surging 65.4% in the three months to August after falling 44.9% in the three months to May. Public sector vacancies, meanwhile, increased 22% over that period, after a 29% fall the previous three months.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese business sentiment improved in July-September from a 11-year low hit three months ago, a key central bank survey showed, in a sign the economy is gradually emerging from the devastating hit from the coronavirus pandemic.
The data offers some hope for new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's efforts to achieve an economic revival from the crisis and pave the way for hosting next year's Tokyo Olympic Games.
But factory activity remained shaky and corporate capital expenditure plans were at their weakest since the 2009 global financial crisis, underscoring the challenge of pulling the world's third-largest economy sustainably out of its slump.
As the pandemic's pain persists, a ruling party heavyweight signalled Japan's readiness to compile a ""large-scale, bold"" additional spending package.
The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment improved to minus 27 in September, off a 11-year low of minus 34 in June but worse than a median market forecast of minus 23, the Bank of Japan's closely watched ""tankan"" survey showed on Thursday.
While it showed many firms remain downbeat, it was the first sign of improvement in nearly three years.
""The big manufacturers' index turned out a little weaker than expected, reflecting an uneven recovery,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Capital expenditure may weaken in coming months as companies put off non-urgent spending plans amid slumping profits,"" he said.
Big non-manufacurers' sentiment also recovered to minus 12 from minus 17 in June, worse than a Reuters poll of minus 9 but the first improvement in five quarters.
Both manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect conditions to improve three months ahead, giving new premier Suga some breathing space.
But some sectors fared better than others in a sign of the patchy nature of the recovery. While carmakers and restaurants saw demand pick up as lockdown measures were eased, machinery makers continued to suffer from sluggish orders.
Big firms plan to raise their capital expenditure by just 1.4% in the current business year to March 2021, lower than a 3.2% increase projected in June.
Total spending plans by companies of all size and industry for the current fiscal year fell 2.7%, the biggest drop marked in any September survey since fiscal 2009, the tankan showed.
""With uncertainty over the pandemic looming, it's doubtful whether corporate sentiment will recover medium- to long-term,"" said Yuichi Kodama, chief analyst at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.
""The economy may stagnate after the effect of various government stimulus measures run their course,"" he said.
Factory activity posted its longest streak of declines on record in September, a separate private survey showed on Thursday, underscoring the huge toll the health crisis has taken on the manufacturing sector.
Japan suffered its biggest economic slump on record in the second quarter as the pandemic and anti-virus measures crippled demand, and analysts expect any rebound to remain modest as fears of a second huge wave of infections weigh on consumption.
The BOJ has kept monetary policy steady since ramping up stimulus in March and April to cushion the economic blow.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said the central bank stands ready to loosen policy further if Japan's recovery is derailed. But many analysts expect the central bank to stand pat for the time being given its limited tool-kit to prop up growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in September, but diminishing government financial assistance and a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases in some parts of the country could slow the labor market's recovery from the pandemic.
Other data on Wednesday confirmed that the economy suffered its sharpest contraction in at least 73 years in the second quarter because of the disruptions from the coronavirus. Record growth is predicted in the third quarter, buoyed by fiscal stimulus and the resumption of many business operations. 
But without another rescue package, rising coronavirus infections and political uncertainty that could extend beyond the Nov. 3 presidential election, gross domestic product estimates for the fourth quarter are being slashed.
""With economic momentum cooling, fiscal stimulus expiring, flu season approaching and election uncertainty rising, the main question is how strong the labor market will be going into the fourth quarter,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Private payrolls increased by 749,000 jobs this month after rising 481,000 in August, the ADP National Employment Report showed. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would rise by 650,000 in September. Employment gains were spread across all industries and company size.
Manufacturing payrolls increased by 130,000 jobs and employment at construction sites rose 60,000. Hiring in the services industries advanced 552,000, with trade, transportation and utilities leading the gains.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. Though it has fallen short of the government's private payrolls count since May because of methodology differences, it is still watched for clues on the labor market's health. 
The ADP report is based on active and paid employees on company payrolls. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) counts workers as employed if they received a paycheck during the week that includes the 12th of the month.
When businesses were shuttered in mid-March, millions of workers were either laid off or furloughed. Economists say the return of furloughed workers when most businesses reopened in May boosted the payrolls numbers reported by the government.
New weekly applications for jobless aid have stalled at higher levels after dropping below 1 million in August as the government changed the way it strips seasonal fluctuations from the data. Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed fewer employees at work in September relative to August.
New daily COVID-19 cases started spiking last week for the first time in eight weeks. Infections are expected to rise in the fall, which economists believe will lead to some restrictions being imposed on businesses in the services sector.
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar declined against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
EASY GAINS OVER
""The big gains from business re-openings are fading,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Job growth will slow through the rest of 2020 and in 2021."" 
The government is scheduled to publish its closely followed employment report, which includes public workers, on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls probably increased by 850,000 jobs in September after rising 1.027 million in August. 
With government employment expected to be held back by the departure of some temporary workers hired for the 2020 Census and coronavirus-related budget challenges at state and local governments, nonfarm payrolls are forecast advancing by 850,000 in September after increasing 1.371 million in August.
That would leave employment 10.7 million below its level in February. Employment growth peaked in June when payrolls jumped by a record 4.781 million jobs. 
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said GDP plunged at a 31.4% annualized rate last quarter, the deepest drop in output since the government started keeping records in 1947. That was revised up from the 31.7% pace reported last month and reflected a less sharp collapse in consumer spending than initially estimated.
The government also published data on contributions to GDP by industry, which underscored the havoc wreaked by the virus. 
Private goods-producing industries contracted at a 34.4% rate, while services tumbled at a 33.1% pace, and government decreased at a rate of 16.6%. 
After-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment dropped at a revised rate of 10.5%. Profits were previously estimated to have declined at a 11.7% pace. When measured from the income side, the economy contracted at a 33.5% rate in the second quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) was previously reported to have declined at a 33.1% pace.
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, decreased at a 32.5% rate last quarter. That was revised from the 32.4% rate estimated last month.
Third-quarter GDP growth estimates are topping a 32% rate as evidenced by a strong housing market and turnaround in business investment.

Growth estimates for the October-December quarter have been lowered to around a 2.5% rate from above a 10% pace.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian economy continued to expand in July and August, clawing back from a steep drop due to the coronavirus pandemic, though the pace of growth slowed through the summer, Statistics Canada data and estimates showed on Wednesday.
Real GDP rose 3.0% in July, in line with analysts' expectations, but below June gains of 6.5%, as all 20 industrial sectors posted increases. 
August GDP, meanwhile, is expected to increase by 1.0%, Statistics Canada said in a preliminary flash estimate. 
The economy still remains below pre-pandemic levels and a recent uptick in COVID-19 cases is raising concerns over fresh containment measures. 
The Canadian dollar  was trading 0.2% higher at 1.3366 to the greenback, or 74.82 U.S. cents, after the data. 
""While there may be some disappointment with the August growth estimate of 1%, decelerating momentum should be fully expected,"" said Benjamin Reitzes, Canadian rates and macro strategist with BMO Capital Markets, in a note.
""Perhaps the bigger concern is that a second wave of COVID cases could prompt another round of shutdowns, or a broader slowing in activity, when the economy still faces a deep hole to dig out of,"" he added.
Canada reported 1,660 new COVID-19 cases on Sept 29, taking the total to 156,961. Canada's two largest provinces, where new infections have surged to spring levels, pledged measures this week to slow the second wave.
July's GDP gains included big increases for the accommodation and food service sectors, which benefited from summer travel, patio service and restaurant reopenings.
All 20 industrial sectors posted increases in July, with the goods-producing industries gaining 3.2%, while the service-producing industries grew by 3.0%.
With the summer gains, third-quarter annualized GDP growth is on track to increase at more than 40%, said Nathan Janzen, senior economist with RBC Economics, in a note.
""But the level of activity overall was also still running almost 5% below pre-shock levels,"" he added.

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, jumped 8.8% to an all-time high of 132.8 last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, rising 3.4% in August.
Pending home sales increased 24.2% from a year ago. The housing market has pressed ahead even as the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown millions out of work. The unemployment burden has fallen disproportionately on low-wage earners in the services industry, who tend to be young. 
There has been a surge in demand for housing in suburbs and low-density areas as Americans seek spacious accommodation in the new work-from-home era. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is averaging below 3%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Reports this month showed a surge in homebuilder confidence in September, and an acceleration in single-family home construction and sales of both new and previously owned homes in August. 

Last month, pending home sales rose in all four regions.

U.S. gross domestic product shrank at a 31.4% annualized rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department’s third estimate showed Wednesday. Twenty of 22 industry groups contributed to the decrease in output during the period. The category of arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food services plummeted an annualized 91.5% and subtracted about 6.6 percentage points from GDP.
Covid-19 and the measures taken to curb its spread catapulted the U.S. economy into the deepest contraction since at least the 1940s. Retail sales and housing are among some areas of the economy that have since rebounded, surpassing pre-pandemic levels and setting up third-quarter economic growth to be the strongest on record.
The MNI Chicago Business Barometer on Wednesday jumped in September to the highest reading since the end of 2018, underscoring a resurgence in manufacturing. Orders and production grew at faster rates than a month earlier.
The labor market, however, still has a long way to go. The total value of economic output will likely remain below pre-pandemic levels when the government issues its first GDP estimate for the July to September period on Oct. 29.
A separate report from ADP Research Institute on Wednesday showed companies added 749,000 jobs in September, more than forecast. Still, ADP’s measure of private employment is more than 10 million below its pre-pandemic level.
Transportation and warehousing, which includes airlines, suffered an almost 65% annualized decline in output during the second quarter, while manufacturing dropped at a 36.6% pace. Retail trade decreased 31.2%, education and health care fell nearly 47%, and business services were down about 30%. Other service-related business excluding government declined an at a 58.8% annual rate.
Private service providers subtracted 23.5 percentage points from second-quarter GDP while goods producers subtracted 5.9 percentage points.
Only the federal government and finance and insurance industry added to GDP.

Investing.com -- The U.S. private sector added 749,000 jobs in the month through mid-September, according to a report by payrolls processor ADP, a bigger-than-expected number that strengthened hopes that the labor market can hold up in the face of a seasonal increase in Covid-19 cases.
Analysts polled by Investing.com had expected the private sector to have added 650,000 jobs.
“The labor market continues to recover gradually,” said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute.
“In September, the majority of sectors and company sizes experienced gains with trade, transportation and utilities; and manufacturing leading the way. However, small businesses continued to demonstrate slower growth.”
August's figure was revised to show job gains of 481,000 from the gain of 428,000 that was initially reported.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German retail sales rose much more than expected in August and unemployment fell further in September, boosting hopes that household spending in Europe's largest economy will power a strong recovery in the third quarter from the coronavirus shock.
The upbeat data, released by the Federal Statistics Office and the Labour Office on Wednesday, came as rising infection numbers were clouding the growth outlook for the fourth quarter.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz have since March unleashed an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus measures to help companies and consumers recover as quickly as possible from Germany's deepest recession on record.
The packages include unlimited liquidity aid for struggling companies, a massive job protection scheme to shield workers from sudden unemployment as well as cash handouts for parents and a temporary value added tax cut to boost domestic demand.
There had been some doubt whether the VAT cut, valid from July 1 to Dec. 31, was actually working, as some companies seemed not to be passing it on to consumers.
But figures released by the Federal Statistics Office on Wednesday showed retail sales jumped by 3.1% on the month in real terms in August after an upwardly revised drop of 0.2% in July. This easily beat a Reuters forecast of only 0.5%.
Retail sales rose by 3.7% in real terms from a year ago, after an upwardly revised increase of 5.0% the previous month.
Compared with February, the month before the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany, retail sales in August were 5.8% higher, suggesting the sector has already put the crisis behind it.
Demand was particularly strong for furnishings and household appliances with year-on-year increase of 8%.
Online retailers continued to benefit from shifting consumer habits with a 23% jump in sales, which came at the expense of clothing and shoe stores which suffered a 10% drop.
Business associations have warned that the pandemic is accelerating a structural transformation in retailing as consumers move online and away from small stores in cities.
GHOST TOWNS
""Politicians urgently need to take countermeasures at all levels, otherwise we will see that large areas of our city centres will turn into ghost towns,"" said Stefan Genth from the HDE retail association.
HDE said last week it expected nominal sales to grow by 1.5% this year despite the pandemic, a sharp upward revision from its previous estimate of a 4% drop. It pointed to booming online sales and the government's stimulus measures.
In a further good sign for household spending, unemployment fell for the third month in a row in September, separate labour office data showed.
The number of people out of work fell by 8,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.907 million and the unemployment rate eased to 6.3% from 6.4% in the previous month.
The number of people on short-time work schemes, which have shielded the labour market from the brunt of the pandemic, dropped to 4.24 million in July from its April peak of nearly 6 million.
The German economy contracted by 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investments and trade collapsed at the height of the pandemic.
The Ifo institute expects 6.6% output growth in the third quarter, then slowing to 2.8% in the fourth quarter.

The government expects the economy to shrink by 5.8% this year, which would translate into a calendar-adjusted decline of 6.1% and the sharpest contraction since World War Two.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain suffered a record collapse in economic output in the second quarter of 2020 when COVID-19 lockdown measures were in full force, though the decline was slightly smaller than first estimated.
Gross domestic product shrank by 19.8% in the three months to June, the Office for National Statistics said, slightly less than the initial estimate of a quarterly 20.4% crash but still more than for any other major advanced economy.
The fall was the biggest since the ONS records began in 1955. Other data has suggested Britain is on course for its biggest annual fall since the 1920s.
Britain's economy had already shrunk by 2.5% in the January-March period as the country entered lockdown in late March.
Output has rebounded in recent months but the recovery looks to be fading with rising coronavirus cases and forecasts of a jump in unemployment as the government scales back job support.
""The renewed COVID-19 restrictions will probably mean that GDP stagnates in Q4, leaving economic activity marooned 5.5% short of its pre-crisis level,"" Ruth Gregory of consultancy Capital Economics said.
""And the risk now is that renewed containment measures send the recovery into reverse,"" she added.
Households saved a record 29.1% of their income, up from 9.6% in the first quarter, as they were unable to spend in many shops and restaurants during the lockdown, while incomes were supported by a government job programme which ends next month.
HEAVY TOLL 
Britain has suffered Europe's highest death toll from COVID-19, with more than 42,000 fatalities.
Compared with a year earlier, Britain's second quarter output tumbled 21.5% - the same as in Spain - while France reported a 19.0% drop.
The statistics office said differences in how countries estimated public sector activity - especially whether they focused on money spent or used the ONS's approach of looking at the extent of disruption to normal services - complicated international comparisons.
Nonetheless, it said Britain's economy shrank more than any other Group of Seven economy in the first half of 2020.
There have been some bright spots in the recovery.
Retail spending exceeded pre-pandemic levels in July and August - driven by a boom in online shopping, groceries and home improvement - and figures on Wednesday showed the biggest annual rise in house prices in more than four years.
However, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has warned the expansion is likely to lose pace, with unemployment set to rise to 7.5% later this year, some parts of the economy facing new COVID restrictions and headwinds from a fresh jump in cases.
Britain's current account deficit - normally one of its weak spots - shrank sharply to 2.8 billion pounds ($3.6 billion), or 0.6% of GDP, reaching its smallest in nine years as a result of the slump in global trade caused by the pandemic.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's economy shrank by 7% in the second quarter, a sign of how deeply the new coronavirus hit both the oil and non-oil sectors, official data showed on Wednesday.
The world’s largest oil exporter is facing a deep recession after the COVID-19 pandemic curbed global crude demand and measures to contain the coronavirus hurt domestic activity.
""The private sector and the government sector recorded a negative growth rate of 10.1% and 3.5%, respectively,"" said the General Authority for Statistics.
In the first quarter, Saudi Arabia posted a 1% economic contraction, but that only captured part of the oil price collapse and the pandemic impact, which escalated in March.
Back then, the oil sector slumped by 4.6%, while the non-oil sector posted a positive growth rate of 1.6%.
But the coronvirus-driven lockdowns were bound to impact the Saudi economy hard in the second quarter.
The non-oil sector, which is the focus of Saudi reforms aimed at diversifying the economy away from crude revenues, shrank by 8.2%, while the oil sector declined by 5.3%, the statistics authority said.
""No surprises in the pace of decline. Non-oil GDP was going to be hit harder with the lockdowns. Oil contraction instead was partly limited by the marked ramp up in oil output in April,"" said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.
""More important is going to be the ongoing impact of Covid and the continued low oil price. Fiscal retrenchment and tightening will result in a weak domestic economic backdrop and a weak outlook for private sector job creation for nationals,"" she said.
Saudi Arabia tripled a value-added tax in July to boost non-oil revenues, but that is limiting domestic demand, dampening economic recovery.
Consumer spending fell 5.5% year on year in August, as the VAT hike kicked in, said Arqaam Capital, citing August central bank data. Inflation meanwhile spiked to 6.2% in August, due to the VAT increase.
The tax hike ""weighs on disposable income, and largely offsets the benefit of travel restrictions that drive local demand,"" Arqaam said in a research note, referring to expectations of higher domestic demand as Saudi Arabia's borders were shut to contain the virus outbreak.

LONDON (Reuters) - Claire Tomlinson dreams of buying a three-bedroom house in the leafy northern English town of Sandbach but now finds herself priced out of the market, a story that is becoming all too familiar in Britain in the pandemic era.
The 28-year-old e-commerce worker and her partner were saving diligently while renting in Sandbach so they could buy their own home this year, an ambition that has been thwarted by forces beyond their control.
A post-lockdown stampede for bigger houses outside of urban areas in the new work-from-home age has sparked a fresh boom in Britain's housing market - especially in areas like Sandbach, a small country town surrounded by the rolling Cheshire Plains.
While this dash for the countryside is not a phenomenon unique to Britain, its decision to suspend taxes on residential property purchases till April 2021 has turbocharged the market. 
Now house prices have risen to record highs, some 3-4% above their pre-pandemic level - a stark contrast to the battered economy which may be on course for its biggest annual contraction in around 100 years.
The housing market has been one of the starkest manifestations of social and wealth inequality in Britain for many years, and first-time buyers like Tomlinson already faced a daunting task to haul themselves onto the property ladder.
Now, the intensifying competition and rising prices during the pandemic, which coincide with an imminent reduction in a longstanding state support scheme for first-time buyers, make it all but impossible for many people to afford to own their home.
""It's so disappointing,"" said Tomlinson. 
""You try to follow the advice, be financially responsible and save enough money for a deposit. But when you actually try to buy somewhere, you realise the system is broken.""
Last week property website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said average asking prices for homes with three or four bedrooms hit a record high across Britain during September.
""Needing more space has always been the most popular reason for moving house, but now there's a new urgency for extra space to be able to work from home,"" said Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data.
""Buyers (are) competing for the same type of property."" 
HAVES VS HAVE-NOTS
Britain's housing market has long been a story of winners and losers. Now the coronavirus pandemic is likely to deepen the sector's role as a driver of inequality.
The rate of home ownership among people aged 25 to 34 has fallen sharply over the last few decades, from 67% in 1991 to around 40% today, according to government data.
Six years ago, Britain sought to boost home ownership via the state-backed equity loan programme, called Help to Buy, for newly built houses worth up to 600,000 pounds ($770,000).
Tomlinson looked seriously at using Help to Buy, but found that the scheme was due to be scaled back significantly next March, when the 600,000-pound price cap will be cut to just 224,400 pounds for the northwest of England.
Since the average price of a new-build house in Cheshire East stands at around 330,000 pounds, the chances of finding a home in Sandbach eligible for the scaled-back support looked slim.
As it stands, homebuyers are increasingly likely to come from already well-off families.
Recent research from insurance company Legal and General showed 33% of Britons who are likely to buy a house in the next five years plan to do so with their parents' financial backing - up from 19% in 2019.
    Neil Wilson, chief executive at Legal and General, said this was a ""symptom of our broken housing market"".
""Unfortunately, we don't have the luxury of relying on wealthy parents to help buy a house,"" Tomlinson said.
Property website Zoopla said the share of homes purchased by first-time buyers fell in September for the first time in five years, probably reflecting how lenders started to withdraw high ""loan-to-value"" mortgage products, which require lower deposits, in early June.
UNCERTAIN FUTURE
The outlook for the housing market next year is tough to predict, given the vast uncertainties surrounding COVID-19.
But a surge in unemployment is clearly underway. Britain's official jobless rate rose slightly to 4.1% in the three months to the end of July, and the Bank of England has forecast it will hit 7.5% by the end of this year after furloughs are ended.
Previous spikes in joblessness during the early 1990s and then the financial crisis prompted hefty drops in house prices, and there is little reason to think it will be a different story this time round.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) pencilled in a 7% drop in house prices next year while a Reuters poll published on Tuesday showed analysts expected this year's rise to turn into stagnation of prices in 2021.
However, a fall or a levelling out of house prices would not necessarily make for a more equal and accessible market.
Many workers in the food, accommodation and cultural sectors are likely to be left unemployed soon - industries that are more likely to hire younger people on lower wages, many of who already struggled to buy a house.
For now, prospective homebuyers like Tomlinson face a long wait to buy their own home.
""It looks like we'll be renting for some time to come,"" she said.

Investing.com – The Chinese economy continues its path toward recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but nagging unemployment and rising U.S.-China tensions could prove to be roadblocks to that recovery.
Data released earlier in the day by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that official purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) for September remained above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. The manufacturing PMI was 51.5, beating the forecast 51.2 and August’s 51 readings and the non-manufacturing PMI was 55.9 against August’s 55.2.
A private survey released on the same day also showed the manufacturing sector remaining in the growth territory. However, the Caixin manufacturing PMI of 53 was slightly under the forecast 53.1 and August’s 53.1 figures.
“The recovery in manufacturing has maintained its momentum in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic, with both the supply and demand surging,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a note accompanying the Caixin survey release.
The growth in factory activity was boosted by exports, which returned to growth after seeing several months of shrinking sales from the economic paralysis brought on by COVID-19 in the beginning of the year.
“The sharp rise in overseas demand has complemented the domestic market,” Wang added.
Despite the positive news, some investors warned that there could be bumps ahead as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on.
""Although overall manufacturing demand has improved, the industry has recovered unevenly,"" NBS official Zhao Qinghe, noting weak demand particularly for clothing and wood processing manufacturing.
""In addition, COVID-19 has not yet been fully and effectively controlled, and there are still uncertain factors in China's imports and exports,"" Zhang added.
Unemployment remains a critical issue in the recovery, with a sub-index for employment for September standing at 49.6 against August’s 49.4. But with the index remaining in contraction, the government could dole out more support measures.
“... The job market remains worrisome, as the improvement in employment relies on a longer-term economic recovery and a more stable external environment. In the near future, great uncertainties remain about the overseas pandemic and the U.S. presidential election,” Caixin’s Wang said.
Simmering tensions with the U.S. over issues such as trade, technology, Taiwan and Hong Kong could undercut the economic recovery, with the tensions widely expected to escalate further ahead of the presidential election in November.
Forecasts also predict that China's economy, which grew 3.2% in the second quarter year-on-year, will reduce that growth to 2.2%, the weakest in over three decades, in 2020."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity extended solid growth in September, twin surveys showed, as the nation's crucial exports engine revved up on improving overseas demand and underlined a steady economic recovery from the coronavirus shock.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 in September from 51.0 in August, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Wednesday, remaining above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the seventh month.
Analysts had expected it to pick up slightly to 51.2.
A private survey, also released on the day, painted a similar picture of the manufacturing sector gaining momentum backed by stronger overseas demand. 
China's vast industrial sector is steadily returning to the levels seen before the pandemic paralysed huge swathes of the economy, as pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure expansion and surprisingly resilient exports propel a recovery.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, also showed the sub-index for new export orders stood at 50.8 in September, improving from 49.1 a month earlier and snapping eight months of declines.
The signs of stronger overseas demand were also highlighted in the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI), which focuses more on small and export-oriented firms. Its gauge for new export orders rose at the fastest pace in over three years.
Recently, economic indicators ranging from trade to producer prices have all suggested a further pick up in the industrial sector. Profits at China's industrial firms extended robust growth in August to the fourth month, official data showed on Sunday.
Domestic demand also shows signs of broadening, with industrial output accelerating the most in eight months in August and retail sales growing for the first time this year.
Adding to the demand recovery from the coronavirus-induced slump, the official PMI showed activity in China's services sector expanded at a faster pace in September.
"" (W)e are entering a period of above trend growth, which should help absorb the remaining slack in the labour market and allow for some policy tightening next year,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
CHALLENGES AHEAD
Yet, even as China emerges from the pandemic in fairly stable shape, many expect the road ahead to be bumpy. 
China's economy, which grew 3.2% in the second quarter year-on-year, is set to expand 2.2% this year - the weakest in over three decades.
A sub-index for employment in the official PMI improved slightly but remained in contractionary territory. It stood at 49.6 in September from 49.4 the month before, indicating the pressure on jobs and keeping policymakers primed for more support measures. 
Moreover, a growing rift between China and the United States over trade, technology and a range of other issues have analysts warning about risks to the outlook. Tensions between the two countries are expected to escalate further ahead of the U.S. Presidential election in November, which some China observers say could undercut the recovery.
""Although overall manufacturing demand has improved, the industry has recovered unevenly,"" said Zhao Qinghe, an official at the NBS, in comments accompanying the data, noting weaknesses in demand for clothing and wood processing manufacturing in particular.

""In addition, the global epidemic has not yet been fully and effectively controlled, and there are still uncertain factors in China's imports and exports.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. house prices will continue to surge well into next year and beyond, outpacing inflation and the overall economy, a Reuters poll of property analysts found, making it a bright spot against an otherwise gloomy economic backdrop.
In a stark reversal, the U.S. housing market - at the epicenter of the global financial crisis more than a decade ago - was expected to extend a helping hand to an economy severely battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Buoyed by record-low interest rates and strong pent-up demand from a segment of the workforce largely unaffected by pandemic-induced job cuts, house prices will continue to rise over the next two years, the Sept. 15-29 poll of over 40 analysts showed. 
U.S. house prices were predicted to rise 4.0% this year and by an average 3.5% in 2021 and 2022. That suggests the trend since 2013 of house price rises outpacing consumer inflation would continue for the next three years at least, according to current inflation expectations. 
Underscoring the view that the latest data showing a surge in house prices was not just a blip, over 60% of analysts, or 24 of 39 who responded to an additional question, said that trend would continue to hold for at least another year. The remaining 15 said less than a year.
""Three factors support relatively high home prices - undersupply after a decade of underbuilding, single-family housing attractiveness in a socially distancing world, and most importantly low interest rates,"" said Nathaniel Karp, chief U.S. economist at BBVA (MC:BBVA). 
""However, economic uncertainty remains elevated and the recovery after the pandemic could take time, which are the risks to the current valuations.""
U.S. house prices outlook: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/xlbvgjmgepq/Reuters%20Poll-U.S.%20house%20prices%20outlook.PNG
Already tight inventory levels have been squeezed to record lows after construction activity came to a grinding halt because of the coronavirus pandemic, and with no policy relief expected, home buyers may outbid each other and crank up prices.
Existing home sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 million units in August, the highest since the tail end of the previous housing boom in 2006, and were expected to average around 5.5 million units in the coming year.
""A surge in demand has put further strain on an already tight inventory. The latest supply of existing homes dropped below three months (of inventory) for the first time since records began in 1982, and that implies sales will ease back toward the end of the year,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics.
When asked to rate the affordability on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 as extremely cheap and 10 as very expensive, the poll gave a median of 7, up from 6 in the previous poll when predictions were for house prices to rise at a slower pace than currently expected.

""U.S. home prices are not yet at a level that is concerning,"" said Matthew Gardner, chief economist at Windermere Real Estate. ""That said, we need significant growth in the number of new homes built to meet current demand. If more units are not provided, we could see unsustainable upward price pressure in the resale market.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output rose for the third straight month in August, in a positive sign for manufacturers as economic activity gradually recovered further from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Demand among Japan's global trading partners, and especially China, has come off lows seen earlier this year when the virus crisis forced governments to impose lockdowns that hurt global trade and production.
Separate data showed retail sales posted their sixth straight month of declines in August as consumers turned to saving instead of spending largely due to worries over a fragile economic recovery.
Official data released on Wednesday showed factory output increased 1.7% in August from the previous month, boosted by rising production of automobiles and car parts as well as iron, steel and non-ferrous metals.
August's rise, which was slower than the previous month's record 8.7% gain, came in largely in line with the median market forecast of 1.5% growth in a Reuters poll of economists.
Manufacturers expect output to rise 5.7% in September and 2.9% in October, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said.
""If September's forecast is realised, manufacturing output would rebound by 10% quarter-on-quarter this quarter,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics in a note.
""Both gross domestic production and manufacturing activity still have plenty more lost ground to make up.""
The government raised its assessment of industrial production a notch to say it was picking up.
In a sign of Japan's struggle to shake off weak consumer demand, retail sales fell 1.9% in August from the previous year, declining for the sixth month, separate data showed on Wednesday.
The fall was not as sharp as a 3.5% drop seen by economists in a Reuters poll, and followed a 2.8% drop in July.
The world's third-largest economy posted its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter as the COVID-19 crisis paralysed business and consumer demand.
It had already slipped into contraction late last year as consumer sentiment slumped after the government last October raised the nationwide sales tax to repair its extremely heavy public debt burden.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rebounded by the most in 17 years in September amid an improvement in labor market views, but it remained below levels that prevailed before the COVID-19 pandemic struck the nation early this year.
The surge in confidence reported by the Conference Board on Tuesday came despite a resurgence in new coronavirus cases in some parts of the country and government help for businesses and the unemployed drying up. Consumers also appeared to shrug off growing uncertainty ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election and signs the economy's recovery from the recession was slowing.
""While today's figure is on the face of it a fantastic result, we have to remain a little cautious given the mixed evidence from other sources,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index increased 15.5 points to a reading of 101.8 this month. That was the largest gain since April 2003. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index edging up to a reading of 89.5 in September. The index was at 132.6 in February.
The cutoff date for the survey was Sept. 18. The jump in the Conference Board's confidence index is at odds with a modest increase in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge. Economists said the rise in the Conference Board measure was driven by higher-income households, who have been least affected by unemployment during the pandemic.
""High confidence today reflects reopened activity but also policy's success in ring-fencing the impact from the loss of activity. This is not the moment to open the gates,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at TS Lombard in New York. ""It underscores the recession's narrow impact.""
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, increased to a reading of 98.5 from 85.8 in August. The expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions jumped to 104.0 from a reading of 86.6 in August.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, improved to a reading of 2.9 this month from -2.2 in August. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. It has dropped from as high as 38.3 in August last year.
Consumers were upbeat on their income prospects. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower ahead of the first presidential debate. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

New daily COVID-19 cases started spiking last week for the first time in eight weeks. Government programs to help businesses with wages have almost lapsed, and tens of thousands of airline workers are facing layoffs or furloughs in October.
A $600 weekly unemployment benefits supplement ended in July and was replaced with a $300 weekly subsidy, whose funding is already running out. 
""Households are becoming more optimistic on the labor market and income front, which should support consumer spending in the coming months,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""However, the possibility that increased unemployment benefits could expire serves as a strong countervailing force."" 
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed the trade deficit in goods widened in August, with imports surging as businesses rebuild inventories which were depleted early in the pandemic.

That, however, did not change expectations for a record jump in gross domestic product in the third quarter after output plunged in the April-June period at its steepest pace since 1947. The economy, which slipped into recession in February, received a boost over the summer from the reopening of businesses and fiscal stimulus from the government. 
The goods trade gap increased 3.5% to a record $82.9 billion last month. Imports of goods rose 3.1% to $201.3 billion, eclipsing a 2.8% increase in goods exports to $118.3 billion. 
The rise in imports was led by consumer goods, which jumped 7%. There were also strong gains in imports of food, capital and consumer goods. But imports of industrial supplies fell 4.6%.
Exports of consumer goods, industrial supplies and food rose. But capital goods and motor vehicles and parts shipments fell. Trade could be a drag on growth in the third quarter for the first time since the second quarter of 2019. 
But with much of the imports going to replenish inventories, the hit to GDP growth could be modest.
The Commerce Department also reported that retail inventories increased 0.8% in August after rebounding 1.2% in July. Motor vehicle and parts inventories gained 0.6%.
Retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles and parts, the component that goes into the calculation of GDP, shot up 0.9% after climbing 0.6% in July.

Wholesale inventories rebounded 0.5% in August after dipping 0.1% in the prior month. Inventory accumulation is expected to contribute to GDP growth in the third quarter after subtracting from output for five straight quarters.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's government posted a primary budget deficit of 96.1 billion reais ($17 billion) in August, the Treasury said on Monday, as the coronavirus crisis continued to necessitate huge emergency spending.
The deficit, excluding interest payments, was slightly less than the 98.7 billion reais deficit economists in a Reuters poll had predicted. The shortfall, excluding interest payments, expanded in the first eight months of the year to 601.3 billion reais.
That compares with an accumulated deficit of 52.1 billion reais in the same period last year, Treasury said.
In the 12 months to August, the deficit totaled 647.8 billion reais, or 9% of gross domestic product, Treasury said. The government's 2020 forecast is for a record-busting primary deficit of 871 billion reais, or 12.1% of GDP, assuming the economy shrinks this year by 4.7%.
Net revenues in August rose nearly 6% in real terms from the same month last year to 102.1 billion reais, mainly due to the partial reversal of certain tax deferrals, Treasury said.
Spending in August was 74% higher at 198.1 billion reais, Treasury said. This included 93 billion reais on crisis-fighting measures, including 45.3 billion on emergency transfers to millions of Brazil's poorest people and 15 billion reais support for local governments.
Gross government debt may reach 94% of GDP this year, well above the average across emerging countries of 62% of GDP projected for this year, Treasury said.
""The crisis facing the country could turn into a promising moment for advancing reforms, focusing on fiscal consolidation and productivity in the economy,"" Treasury said in a statement.

""Only the continuity of the reform agenda can maintain an economic environment that will attract investment, with low interest rates and inflation under control, allowing sustainable growth, which is fundamental .... to control (the) public debt,"" it said.

638,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany’s inflation rate fell further below zero as the pandemic curtailed demand, adding to the case for more monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank.
Consumer prices declined 0.4% in September, the steepest pace in more than five years. Europe’s largest economy is suffering a double blow from tepid consumption and a sales-tax cut the government introduced earlier this year to bolster the economy.
The drop that exceeded all but one forecasts in a Bloomberg survey follows a report showing consumer prices in Spain slid for a sixth straight month. It also suggests inflation in the euro area might come in below the -0.2% expected by economists. September data for the 19-nation bloc are due on Friday.
While the trend won’t surprise the ECB -- President Christine Lagarde has flagged such declines for the coming months -- some policy makers have started sounding the alarm.
Executive Board member Fabio Panetta has argued that the risk of providing too much stimulus is smaller than being “too shy,” and Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said weak price pressures show there is “no room for complacency.” Lagarde and many of her colleagues, including ECB chief economist Philip Lane, will speak during a conference on Wednesday.
According to the ECB’s own forecasts, inflation is unlikely to reach its target of just under 2% for the foreseeable future, with a stronger euro an additional burden.
Economists expect the ECB to boost its 1.35 trillion ($1.6 trillion) emergency bond-buying program later this year, most likely in December when new forecasts become available.

Mortgage approvals jumped to 84,700 from 66,300 in July, hitting their highest level since October 2007.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected about 71,000 approvals. 
Mortgage lending rose by a weaker-than-expected 3.1 billion pounds ($4.0 billion) in July.
But consumer borrowing - a key driver of economic growth - increased by only around 300 million pounds in August from July compared with a median forecast for a 1.45 billion pound increase in the Reuters poll.
Alistair McQueen, head of savings and retirement at insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV), said many households were likely to start saving more in anticipation of further economic turmoil caused by the reintroduction of stricter local lockdown measures.
""This will dent consumer spending, which will curb the UK’s economic recovery.”

The European Commission's monthly survey showed sentiment in the 19 countries sharing the euro rising to 91.1 points this month from 87.5 in August, beating market expectations of an improvement to 89.0 points.
The gains were mainly a result of sentiment in services, the euro zone economy's biggest sector producing some two thirds of gross domestic product, improving to -11.1 from -17.2. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise to only -15.7.
Optimism in industry rose to -11.1 from -12.8, falling short of expectations of a rise to -10.0 and consumer sentiment was in line with expectations rising to -13.9 from -14.7.

Inflation expectations in industry improved to -0.6 from -2.1 but continued to fall among consumers, easing to 12.5 from 16.9 in August.

INSEE's consumer confidence index held at 95, after a single point upwards revision for the month of August, beating the average forecast of 94 in a Reuters poll.
Household confidence about personal finances edged higher, rising above the long-term average for the first time since February, when the coronavirus epidemic first began sweeping across France.
There was also a slight increase in those prepared to make big purchases. However, the number of people who said it was a good time to save jumped higher for a fifth straight month. 
Household concerns about unemployment inched higher. France has avoided a major spike in permanent unemployment as companies put workers on state-subsidised furloughs en masse.

The government wants to convince consumers to spend a 10 billion euro mountain of additional savings built up during the coronavirus crisis to help fuel a recovery after France's worst post-war recession in the first half of the year.

Short-time work is a form of state aid that allows employers to switch employees to shorter working hours during an economic downturn to keep them on the payroll. Its use is intended to stop immediate shocks such as the coronavirus crisis from turning into mass unemployment.
Ifo said 21% of the workforce in the manufacturing sector remained on the programme compared with 12% in the service sector. Only 1% of construction workers were working on the reduced hours scheme.

Ifo said the numbers were based on its own calculations and estimates.

The value of U.S. goods bought by China declined from the previous month, led by a slowdown in energy products, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Customs Administration data. By the end of August, China had purchased about 32.8% of the full-year target of more than $170 billion -- meaning it must buy about $115 billion of goods in the remaining four months of the year to comply with the agreement signed in January.

Purchases of energy products fell by 24% in August from the previous month, hitting about 14% of the full-year target. While China’s crude oil imports from the U.S. dropped substantially from a record high in July, they are likely to rise in coming months as purchases of American crude rose before the August review of the trade deal.
The U.S. and China reaffirmed their commitment to the phase-one trade deal in August, demonstrating a willingness to cooperate even as tensions rise over a range of issues.
China cut its pork imports from the U.S. by nearly 40% in August from a month earlier, while increasing its purchases of cereals, the data showed. Imports of soybeans, one of the key products in the trade deal, rose almost 300% from a month earlier and are likely to trend higher as the U.S. harvest picks up.

In July, the unemployment rate was 5.4%, the statistics agency said. In March, the last period for which the survey was published, the rate was 2.9%.
Mexico's economy was gradually reactivating in August following a relaxation of measures to contain the coronavirus, resulting in 608,000 people joining the workforce, the statistics agency INEGI said.
Of 12 million people who lost work in April, 7.8 million were back at work by August, the agency said.

INEGI cautioned that some elements of the survey could be less precise than previous editions because of lower participation by interviewees.

Sixty percent of business owners said they will be able to remain open for more than a half-year, up from 46% in April, according to the poll, conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ). The survey firm questioned owners and decision makers at 600 small and midsize firms from Aug. 26 to Sept. 4.
As prospects of a new stimulus deal remain slim after negotiations stalled in the U.S. Congress, small-business advocates have warned that the nation is on the precipice of widespread business failures and bankruptcies amid the Covid-19 pandemic. While it’s premature to say whether that will happen, a significant minority, 28%, indicated they may not make it through the next few months without additional government relief.
Among other findings in the survey, hospitality and accommodations businesses are the least confident in their longtime survival prospects, with 47% expecting to operate beyond six months if conditions don’t improve. The most optimistic respondents were in the property and real-estate industry, with 78% expecting to survive even under present conditions.
While the survey didn’t ask business owners about their political preferences, 58% indicated the presidential election would have a significant impact on the U.S. economy. However, only 22% said the election would significantly affect their own job security and only 28% said it would significantly affect their business’ financial security.
Among the new round of stimulus proposals that are in limbo in Congress is an extension of the Paycheck Protection Program that ended last month. The program offered low-rate government loans that are forgiven under certain conditions.
A second survey released Monday by the community revitalization group Main Street America suggests that most small businesses are loathe to take on additional debt to fund operations during the pandemic. More than 60% expect to tap existing sources of revenue rather than to seek a new bank loan, line of credit or government loan, according to the survey of more than 2,000 small-business owners.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports likely grew for the first time in seven months in September due to more working days than a year earlier and heavy shipments of microchips as China's Huawei Technologies stockpiled ahead of U.S. sanctions, a Reuters poll showed.
Going forward, economists surveyed by Reuters expected South Korea's exports to suffer as major overseas markets have been hit by second waves of coronavirus, which will keep global demand subdued.
September shipments were seen rising 2.0% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of 18 economists, the first growth since February and rebounding sharply from a 10.1% plunge in August.
""Exports will likely post growth for the first time since the COVID-19 outbreak due to more working days, pre-orders ahead of Chuseok holiday and Huawei's chip stockpiling,"" said Park Sang-hyun, Hi Investment & Securities' chief economist.
There are 23 working days this month, 2.5 days more than a year earlier, as the Chuseok holiday fell in mid-September last year.
Economists have attributed export growth in preliminary data to stockpiling by Huawei ahead of U.S. sanctions which kicked in on Sept. 15.
Analysts also see local chip makers benefiting from the United States' new exports restrictions on China's biggest chip maker SMIC (HK:0981).
But economists worry that the virus resurgence at home and abroad may put a brake on exports recovery.
""The (exports) recovery ahead is unlikely to be smooth. The rebound in global demand will be buffeted by second waves of the coronavirus and the economic hangovers from dealing with the pandemic,"" said Alex Holmes, economist of Capital Economics.
South Korea on Friday said it would impose tighter restrictions during the Chuseok autumn holiday weeks when people traditionally reunite with families, after infections at a church and political rally in August sparked a new wave of coronavirus outbreaks.
It reported a total 23,661 cases and 406 deaths as of Sunday midnight, though the number of new cases at 50 was the lowest since the resurgence of the disease in August.
Meanwhile, 16 economists predicted industrial output in August would decline by a seasonally adjusted 1.5% month-on-month, compared with a 1.6% growth in July.
Fifteen economists also estimated consumer prices in September would rise a median 0.7% year-on-year, unchanged from the previous month.

The contraction was far below the 4.8% growth forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll, and a sharp dip from the 3.1% rise in July.
Imports in August shrank by 6.5% from a year earlier, slowing from the 8.7% decline in the prior month, data from the International Trade and Industry Ministry showed. Analysts had expected a fall of 4.3%.

648,"<span>Sep 27, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic rebound showed signs of plateauing in September, weighed down by lackluster home and car sales, a weaker stock market and worsening business confidence.
That’s the assessment from the earliest available indicators, which showed China’s recovery is losing pace. The aggregate index combining eight indicators tracked by Bloomberg this month slipped into contraction, compared to accelerated expansion in August.
China has staged an uneven recovery, initially driven by strong industrial output yet with recent data showing signs that consumption has started to catch up. A strong and broad spurt in spending is needed for a more meaningful economic rebound.
New home sales in China’s four biggest cities slowed in the first three weeks of September, reversing August’s pickup. Small-business confidence eased marginally after rising for six straight months, while a gauge of expectations rose further into growth territory.
The pace of economic expansion moderated marginally for small businesses in September, despite continued recovery, according to Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, which surveys more than 500 smaller firms each month. The growth momentum indicator eased from a month ago and the “current performance” reading retreated for the first time since March.
“This suggests that the recovery continued uninterrupted, despite signs that the V-shaped rebound is losing momentum,” according to economists Shen Lan and Ding Shuang, who published the results. “SMEs’ new orders slowed in September” and the pace of expansion of banks’ credit to SMEs also eased, they said.
Purchasing manager indexes due Wednesday are expected to show September manufacturing improved slightly while non-manufacturing moderated from August’s level.
Exports for smaller businesses remained resilient, according to Standard Chartered, with export-oriented SMEs performing better than domestically focused ones in the month.
The outlook for global trade remains more encouraging, with Korean exports in the first 20 days of September up 3.6% from a year earlier, the first rise in early trade data since March. Average daily shipments from South Korea, however, offered a less optimistic picture, falling by 9.8% as the period had two more working days compared with last year.
South Korea’s exports serve as a barometer of global trade as its companies are closely linked to global manufacturing-supply chains, and it releases data quickly.
Early Indicators
From July, Bloomberg has changed some of the components for the early look at China’s economy. It added home sales in the biggest four cities, weekly car sales and inventories of steel reinforcing, while removing iron-ore prices, sales manager sentiment and property-related stocks.
Bloomberg Economics generates the overall activity reading by aggregating a three-month weighted average of the monthly changes of eight indicators, which are based on business surveys or market prices.

China's recovery has been gaining momentum as pent-up demand, government stimulus and surprisingly resilient exports propel a rebound.
Industrial firm profits grew 19.1% year-on-year in August to 612.81 billion yuan ($89.8 billion), the statistics bureau said.
That compares with a 19.6% increase in July and is the fourth straight month of profit growth.
However, industrial firms' profits still face external pressures as rising tensions between Washington and Beijing cloud the global trade outlook.
Raw material manufacturing profits increased by 32.5% in August, up from 14.7% in July, according to Zhu Hong, an official at the statistics bureau. This was driven in part by a rebound in the prices of international commodities such as crude oil and iron ore, he added.
Meanwhile, profits of the general equipment manufacturing sector notched up 37% in August on-year, with electrical machinery up by 13.3% over the same period.
Economic indicators in August, ranging from exports to producer prices and factory output, all pointed to a further pickup in the industrial sector.
However, factory activity grew at a slower pace with smaller firms facing sluggish market demand and financial strains.
The country has introduced a slew of measures to kick-start the economy, from tax and fee reductions to grace periods for the calling in of debt.
China's economy may stagnate if it fails to rise up the value chain, as it faces increasing competition from countries with advanced technologies and lower labour costs, economists warned.
Authorities have pledged to boost investment in strategic industries including core tech sectors such as 5G, artificial intelligence and semiconductors, and accelerate new material development to ensure stable supply chains.
For January-August, industrial firms' profits fell 4.4% from a year earlier to 3.72 trillion yuan, better than the 8.1% decrease in the first seven months. 
Liabilities at industrial firms rose 6.6% on-year at end-August, edging higher than the 6.5% at end-July.
Earnings at state-owned industrial firms were down 17% on an annual basis for the first eight months of the year, versus a 23.5% decline in the first seven months.
Private-sector profits fell 3.3% in January-August, narrowing from January-July’s 5.3% fall.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in August and shipments raced to their highest level in nearly six years, suggesting a rebound in business spending on equipment was underway after a prolonged slump.
The show of confidence by businesses in the report from the Commerce Department on Friday also bolstered expectations for a sharp turnaround in economic activity in the third quarter, thanks to government money, after it was hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of the year. 
But fiscal aid is running out and new coronavirus cases are rising in the country, clouding the fourth-quarter picture. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week stressed the need for more fiscal stimulus, telling lawmakers on Thursday that it could make the difference between continued recovery and a much slower economic slog. Another rescue package appears unlikely before the Nov. 3 presidential election.
""The recovery in capex is not screeching to a halt,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Equipment spending will be a key contributor to the third-quarter's bounce back in GDP.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 1.8% last month to the highest level since July 2018. Data for July was revised up to show these so-called core capital goods orders increasing 2.5% instead of 1.9% as previously reported. Core capital goods orders are now above the their pre-pandemic level.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast orders for these goods gaining 0.5% in August.
Core capital goods orders last month were boosted by increased demand for machinery, primary metals and computers and electronic products. But orders for fabricated metals products and electrical equipment, appliances and components fell.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
STRONG THIRD QUARTER EXPECTED
Shipments of core capital goods increased 1.5% last month to the highest level since September 2014. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
They advanced 2.8% in July. The two straight months of strong growth in shipments are likely to lift overall business investment from a deep hole in the third quarter.
Business investment tumbled at a record 26% annualized rate in the second quarter, with spending on equipment collapsing at an all-time pace of 35.9%. Investment in equipment has contracted for five straight quarters.
Economic activity rebounded sharply over the summer as businesses reopened after mandatory closures in mid-March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. 
Gross domestic product is expected to rebound at as much as a record 35% annualized rate in the third quarter after tumbling at a 31.7% rate in the April-June period, the worst performance since the government started keeping records in 1947.
But the economy is far from being out of the woods. Government loan programs to help businesses and income supplements for the tens of millions of unemployed have either lapsed or are close to expiring. 
New claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, businesses activity appeared to ebb in September and retail sales slowed in August. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday cut its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 3% rate from a 6% pace, citing ""lack of further fiscal support.""
""Decelerating from the reopening-induced, artificially high pace is something everyone is expecting,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.
""The question is how fast do we slow? The September numbers will start providing some answers.""
For now the industrial side of the economy pressing ahead.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, rose 0.4% in August after jumping 11.7% in July. Durable goods orders were supported by a 0.5% rise in orders for transportation equipment, though demand for motor vehicles and defense aircraft eased.

Orders for motor vehicles and parts dropped 4.0% after accelerating 21.7% in July. There were no orders for civilian aircraft reported for the second straight month in August. 
Boeing (N:BA) has struggled with cancellations as airlines grapple with sharply reduced demand for air travel because of the pandemic. The grounding of Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX jets since March 2019 after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia has also weighed on the company. 

There was a continued drawdown of durable goods inventories last month, which bodes well for future production, though unfilled orders declined further.

LONDON (Reuters) - British public borrowing surged again in August to a record high, driven by huge outlays to combat the coronavirus pandemic, with the budget deficit so far this tax year overtaking its full-year peak during the global financial crisis.
The government has now borrowed 173.7 billion pounds ($221.8 billion) in the five months since the start of the financial year in April, outstripping the previous record of 157.7 billion pounds set in the 12 months ending March 2010.
Government budget forecasters have warned the deficit could hit 372 billion by the end of the tax year, raising borrowing as a share of gross domestic product to 18.9%, a level not seen since World War Two -- far above long-term sustainable rates.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Thursday that now was the time to focus on restoring growth, not reducing borrowing, but tough decisions would be needed in the longer term.
Despite this, he has cut support for people whose work remains jeopardised by the pandemic. 
Sunak said that from November the government would only subsidise ""viable"" jobs, where people were working at least a third of their normal hours, ending a programme where the government had paid up to 80% of furloughed employees' wages.
Many economists and trade unions fear this could lead to a big rise in unemployment for people in sectors such as hospitality, arts and entertainment that continue to bear the brunt of government coronavirus restrictions.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists said Sunak may need to reverse course and provide extra support.
""We think the risks to the deficit are to the upside, with the Chancellor likely to provide additional support if restrictions tighten further, or unemployment surprises,"" Jacob Nell and Bruna Skarica wrote.
Borrowing in August alone jumped to 35.9 billion pounds -- just below economists' average forecast of 38 billion in a Reuters poll -- while July's figure was revised down by 11 billion pounds to 15.4 billion pounds.
Britain's Office for National Statistics said the revisions partly reflected difficulties assigning government spending to specific months.
The Office for Budget Responsibility said borrowing so far this year was about 34 billion pounds lower than in its most recent forecast published on Sept. 8, largely due to a smaller decline in tax revenue than it had expected.
But it said government schemes allowing tax deferral, plus the general economic uncertainty, made it hard to know exactly how large the deficit would be at the end of the year.
Public sector net debt in August reached 2.024 trillion pounds, or 101.9% of GDP, the highest as a share of the economy since the 1960-61 financial year.
Britain suffered the biggest economic hit of any G7 economy from the coronavirus during the second quarter of this year, with output collapsing by 20%, and the Bank of England estimates third-quarter output will be around 7% below pre-crisis levels.
Despite heavy borrowing, the British government's interest costs on financial markets are near record lows, due to global gloom about the economic outlook and a long-term fall in interest rates.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy is preparing to raise its budget deficit goals for this year and next and target public debt at around 156% of national output in 2021 because of the coronavirus crisis, two government sources told Reuters on Friday.
The Treasury will raise the target for the 2020 deficit to about 12.8% of gross domestic product from an 11.9% goal set a month ago. The 2020 debt should be near 160% of GDP, up from a previous estimate of 157.6%.
The new forecasts, still to be set as talks continue in the ruling coalition, will be published next week in the Treasury's Economic and Financial Document (DEF), which forms the framework of the 2021 budget.
The DEF will target the deficit in 2021 at 7% of GDP compared with a previous projection of 5.7% set in April, the sources said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Italy has approved 100 billion euros ($116 billion) of extra borrowing this year in an effort to limit the damage done by COVID-19 to on its already fragile economy, now mired in its worst recession since World War II.
The DEF will forecast a 9% contraction in GDP this year, the sources said, revised from a -8% projection set in April. 
It will pencil in growth of 6% for 2021, with the government expecting that a raft of expansionary measures to be financed by the European Union's Recovery Fund will boost economic output.
Rome will get some 209 billion euros by 2023 in cheap loans and grants from the Fund, designed to help the EU nations hardest hit by COVID-19.
The growth performance of heavily indebted Italy has consistently underperformed its European partners over the past two decades, with a long tradition of missed GDP targets.
In a paper published this month, the government said Europe-funded projects could help the country double its average growth rate, narrow its north-south divide and even increase its birth rate - one of the lowest in the world.

Industrial output is expected to have risen 1.5% in August from the previous month, the poll of 17 economists showed. It had jumped a revised 8.7% in July, the fastest on record, as domestic and global demand began to slowly recover from coronavirus-induced slumps.
""We expect broad gains in the production, including electronic parts and devices, and transport machineries,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.
""But the level of recovery in the factory output will still be about a half of losses caused by the coronavirus outbreak."" 
A business survey released this week showed factory activity continued to contract in September amid subdued demand, but new orders were falling at a much slower pace and manufacturers were more confident in the outlook.
The Reuters poll also found retail sales probably fell 3.5% in August from a year earlier, which would mark a sixth-straight month of decline, as fears of contracting the virus kept consumers at home.
The trade ministry will release both factory output and retail sales at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Wednesday, September 30 (2350 GMT Tuesday).
Analysts forecast the jobless rate edged up to 3.0% in August from 2.9% in the previous month and the jobs-to-applicants ratio, or availability of jobs, likely worsened to 1.05 last month from 1.08 in July. 
""After the economic activity restarted from late May, some people are returning to work but the pace of recovery is slow,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Deflationary pressures are expected to persist. Tokyo's core consumer price (CPI) index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, likely fell 0.3% in September from a year earlier, the same rate of decline seen in August, the poll showed.
Weak energy prices such as electricity and gas weighed on consumer prices, analysts said.

658,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 05:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s largest agricultural commodity traders are making the most money in years exporting everything from soybeans to corn and wheat from American ports. And it’s mostly thanks to China.
The Asian nation has been on a buying spree, snapping up record amounts of American corn and holding at the start of the season the biggest soybean-import commitments for the time of year in almost three decades. The rush to guarantee loading space -- at a time when a key Gulf Coast terminal owned by Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. is offline -- is sending export margins soaring.
The fat profits are a turnaround for an industry that had got used to thin margins and lower exports due to President Donald Trump’s trade war with China, the world’s top buyer of soybeans. With China still pledging to meet its commitments under the phase one trade deal, ADM expects record U.S. exports of agricultural products in the fourth quarter, helping boost earnings for its traditional agricultural services unit that had struggled for years.
“The big export sales of corn and soybeans on the books, of which half or more are to China, along with an ADM export terminal being closed for repair until early 2021 have combined to push Gulf elevation margins to close to the highest levels in the last five years,” said Thomas Meierotto, a commodity risk manager at Chicago-based brokerage R.J. O’Brien & Associates LLC.
Agriculture traders measure export profits by looking at the price difference for crops loaded onto ships at Gulf ports and the cost of a barge delivered to New Orleans. The so-called elevation margins -- which refer to elevators used to load the grain onto ships for export -- for soybeans are at the highest since at least 2016, according to Bloomberg calculations using Commodity3 data, which puts profits at more than 60 cents a bushel. Traders estimate it at about 50 cents.
Export profits are, in some cases, higher than in 2016, when the U.S. shipped a record 36 million tons of soybeans to China. That’s because the Asian nation is also buying a lot of corn, which competes for space in terminals across the country. China is also counting on more U.S. soybeans since Brazil has run out, and on American corn with Ukraine set for a smaller harvest this season.
“Exporters are using about every facility available at the Gulf, including Texas, as well as Pacific Northwest, the Great Lakes and the East Coast,” said John C. Baize, an independent consultant who advises the U.S. Soybean Export Council. “In addition, the mid-river barge to ship transfer terminals are being used for corn and soybeans. All are operating at near full capacity.”
China’s buying spree has sent soybean futures rallying to pre-trade war levels of more than $10 a bushel in Chicago, while gains in corn were more modest with supplies ample after the coronavirus slashed demand for ethanol. Still, high prices have already started to cool China’s appetite, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture reporting smaller daily sales.
“The next few weeks are looking pretty favorable for the export window to get these crops from the fields into the river, but just the total volumes that we’ve seen here have been very supportive to prices,” Erin Fitzpatrick, an analyst at Rabobank in St. Louis, said in a webinar this week. “These current price levels appear to be kind of slowing some of the demand.”
ADM is positive on the performance of its agriculture services unit as volumes and margins progressively improve through the year, with the fourth quarter expected to be the strongest, Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said in a virtual event earlier this month. Agriculture giants including Cargill Inc. and  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) Ltd. are also set to benefit, as are Andersons Inc., CHS Inc. and Gavilon, all of which have export capacity from the U.S.
“I look back at where the previous high watermark was and that was 36 million tons for the year back in marketing year 2026-17,” said Jim Sutter, USSEC’s chief executive officer. “We seem to be setting ourselves up for a very similar year as that.”

659,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Consumer confidence in South Korea slipped for the first time in five months as a jump in virus cases and tighter social restrictions made households more pessimistic about the economy’s outlook.
The consumer sentiment index fell to 79.4 in September from 88.2 the previous month, the Bank of Korea said in a statement Friday. The 8.8 point decline was the largest since March when the country was reeling from the first wave of the pandemic.
South Korea’s economy showed signs of recovery at the start of the quarter, but the early momentum lost steam as daily virus case counts soared to hundreds in August. While the government has avoided imposing an economy-wide lockdown and instead opted for targeted restrictions, the flareup is still expected to have a significant impact on consumption and services.
The virus resurgence was a key factor when the central bank slashed its economic outlook for this year to a 1.3% contraction in August, from an earlier forecast for a 0.2% decline in May.
While South Korea has since managed to bring down daily caseloads to a little over hundred from the peak of more than 400 in August, health officials warn the upcoming Chuseok holiday could reignite infections with increased gatherings.
Among components of the headline index, households’ spending projections dragged most, followed by expectations for income and their assessment of the current state of the economy. Inflation expectations for the next year rose 0.1 percentage point to 1.9%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased last week, supporting views the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was running out of steam amid diminishing government funding.
The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed 26 million people were on unemployment benefits in early September. The faltering labor market recovery and a recent rise in new coronavirus infections has piled pressure on Congress and the White House to come up with another rescue package. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday reiterated the need for more fiscal stimulus, telling lawmakers that it could make the difference between continued recovery and a much slower economic slog. New fiscal relief is looking increasingly unlikely before the Nov. 3 presidential election.
""The high level of joblessness shows that the country isn't out of the woods yet and it won't be if the pleading of Fed officials for more stimulus isn't heard by government officials down in Washington,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The economy is running on empty."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 870,000 for the week ended Sept. 19. Data for the prior week was revised to show 6,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 840,000 applications in the latest week. 
Unadjusted claims increased 28,527 to 824,542 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted claims number given earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations because of the economic shock caused by the coronavirus crisis.
Six months after the pandemic started in the United States, jobless claims remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though applications have dropped from a record 6.867 million at the end of March. 
While the reopening of businesses in May boosted activity, demand in the vast services sector has remained lackluster, keeping layoffs elevated. Job cuts have also spread to industries such as financial services and technology that were not initially impacted by the mandated business closures in mid-March because of insufficient demand.
A total 630,080 applications were received for the government-funded pandemic unemployment assistance last week. 
The PUA is for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs. PUA applications could fall in the coming weeks after California last Saturday suspended the filing of new claims for two weeks to combat fraud. 
Altogether, 1.5 million people filed claims last week.
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar was lower against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
STALLED PROGRESS
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 167,000 to 12.58 million in the week ending Sept. 12. 
Economists believe the so-called continuing claims are declining partly as people exhaust their eligibility for benefits, which are limited to 26 weeks in most states. 
Indeed, just under one million workers exhausted their first six months of state unemployment benefits in August. At least 1.6 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Sept. 5, up 104,479 from the prior week.
The continuing claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for September's unemployment rate. The decline in mid-September implied a further decrease in the jobless rate from 8.4% in August.
""Only faster progress against the virus itself will assuage the unemployment struggles of so many workers in fields like entertainment who can't return to their jobs until social distancing restrictions are relaxed ,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation in New York. 
The Fed has cut interest rates to near zero and vowed to keep borrowing costs low for a while, and has also been pumping money into the economy. Government money to help businesses has virtually dried up. Tens of thousands of airline workers are facing layoffs or furloughs next month. 
A $600 weekly unemployment benefits supplement ended in July and was replaced with a $300 weekly subsidy, whose funding is already running out. 
The ebbing fiscal stimulus is already restraining the economy after activity rebounded sharply over the summer. Gross domestic product is expected to rebound at as much as a record 35% annualized rate in the third quarter after tumbling at a 31.7% rate in the April-June period, the worst performance since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
But retail sales and production at factories moderated in August. Business activity cooled in September, reports have shown. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday cut its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 3% rate from a 6% pace, citing ""lack of further fiscal support.""

Despite the economy's fading fortunes, the housing market continues to shine, with new home sales near a 14-year high in August.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Foot traffic to U.S. restaurants and stores showed little improvement last week, high frequency data show, and signs emerged of deepening stress for small businesses as economists worry the recovery from coronavirus lockdowns continues to slow.
After steady growth over the summer, estimates of seated diners at restaurants maintained by booking site OpenTable https://www.opentable.com/state-of-industry fell for the second week. They remain at about 60% of levels in early March before a national state of emergency was declared to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

Employee records on 55,000 small businesses maintained by Homebase https://joinhomebase.com/data showed the number of people working declined for a second week in a row. 
Data from cellphone tracking firm Unacast https://www.unacast.com/covid19/covid-19-retail-impact-scoreboard shows that the gradual return to restaurants, gyms and other ""close contact"" businesses has largely stalled following improvement over the summer.

Many U.S. businesses tapped federal programs for help early in the pandemic, but with the health crisis now likely to extend into next year, the stress may be too much.
Recent surveys from small business networking group Alignable and online review site  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) both suggested a looming jump in small firm failures. 
""The impact has been too deep for too long. And it's taking its toll,"" Alignable spokesman Chuck Casto said, after the group's poll of more than 6,300 small businesses, released Wednesday, found more then 40% expect they won't earn enough revenue through the end of the year to stay in business.
That finding is consistent with recent U.S. Census surveys of small businesses showing a decline in September in the percentage of firms that had enough cash on hand for more than a month of operation. 
The fate of the United States' roughly 6 million small businesses will shape the broader contours of the recovery and the economy that emerges after the pandemic.
It will be particularly critical to sustain job growth. U.S. firms with fewer than 500 workers employed around 60 million as of 2017, according to Census data.
Some economic policymakers worry that the larger-than-expected job gains from May through August will mark the high point of the recovery. The economy clawed back about half of the 22 million positions lost in the spring's pandemic shut down, but few expect that pace to continue. Jobless claims unexpectedly increased https://ca.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idCAKCN26F249 for the week ending Sept. 19, Labor Department data released Thursday show. 
After hitting a pandemic-era high of 14.7% in April, the unemployment rate fell to 8.4% in August. But at the most recent Federal Reserve meeting even the most optimistic policymaker projected slower improvement, with the rate still 6.5% by year's end. The median projection called for less than a percentage point improvement from here. 
New weekly job postings aggregated by economic consulting firm Chmura http://www.chmuraecon.com/blog from online employment firms and company websites have remained at roughly 90% of their pre-pandemic level in recent weeks - a sign of steady but not surging momentum in hiring.
By some high frequency measures, however, the economic rebound continues apace. Data from cellphone tracking firm Safegraph https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard/covid19-commerce-patterns showed foot traffic at retail locations overall is near its March level. 
Sectors including manufacturing and housing have made steady progress. Data from time management firm UKG https://www.kronos.com/about-us/newsroom/update-us-workforce-activity showed that shifts worked across a variety of industries grew an average of 1.1% weekly so far in September after that figure dipped as low as 0.5% in August. 
But that data also showed a divided recovery. Shifts worked at manufacturing firms for the week ending Sept. 20 were just 1% below the average from January through March. Retail firms were down by 10%. 
Larger firms are ""starting to dramatically outpace smaller businesses,"" in terms of labor pickup, said Dave Gilbertson, vice president of strategy and operations at UKG, with firms above 5,000 workers adding shifts at a rate of 3% per week, while growth among firms with fewer than 100 employees was less than 1%.
Measures of the broader national recovery have shown no clear direction for several weeks. An Oxford http://blog.oxfordeconomics.com/topic/recovery-tracker economics index combining health, economic and social data for the last four weeks has remained at about 80% of January's level. 
(Graphic: Oxford Economics Recovery Index - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/OXFORDINDEX/rlgpdlnyepo/chart.png)

The Commerce Department said on Thursday new home sales rose 4.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million units last month, the highest level since September 2006. New home sales are counted at the signing of a contract, making them a leading housing market indicator. 
July's sales pace was revised upward to 965,000 units from the previously reported 901,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 14% of housing market sales, slipping 1% to a rate of 895,000-units.
The report followed on the heels of data this week showing sales of previously owned homes near a 14-year high in August.
The housing market is being powered by record-low mortgage rates and a pandemic-fueled migration to suburbs and low-density areas in search of more spacious accommodation as many people work from home. Unemployment has disproportionately affected low-wage workers in the services sector, who are typically young and renters.
In August, new home sales rose 5.0% in the Northeast. They jumped 13.4% in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions. But sales fell 1.7% in the West and decreased 21.4% in the Midwest. The median new house price fell 4.3% to $312,800 in August from a year ago. New home sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000 to $499,000 price range.

There were 282,000 new homes on the market last month, down from 291,000 in July. At August's sales pace it would take 3.3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 3.6 months in July. About 71% of the homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) monthly retail sales balance rose unexpectedly to +11 in September from -6 in August. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of -10.
""The latest results suggest that the recovery in retail spending over the summer months has continued into September, which is welcome news, but retailers appear cautious over the near-term outlook,"" said Ben Jones, principal economist at the CBI.
Despite the surge in activity, the CBI said sales were around 8% lower than they would have been without a pandemic. The official measure of retail sales volumes has already surpassed its pre-pandemic peak.

BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Business morale in Germany and France improved for the fifth month in a row in September, boosting hopes that the euro zone's two biggest economies had enjoyed a solid recovery from the coronavirus shock suffered in the first half of the year.
The surveys, published on Thursday by Germany's Ifo institute and France's statistics office, suggested that both countries are set for strong growth in the third quarter, though the outlook is clouded by rising infections and new restrictions to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Ifo institute said its business climate index rose to 93.4 from a downwardly revised 92.5 in August. That was the highest reading since February, when the index stood at 95.9.
""The German economy is stabilizing despite rising infection numbers,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said.
The German economy contracted by 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investments and trade collapsed at the height of the pandemic. The government has since March unleashed an array of rescue and stimulus measures, financed with record new borrowing, to cushion the impact.
In a sign that Berlin's response to the crisis seems to be paying off, business morale in manufacturing improved considerably on upbeat export expectations, the survey showed.
In the service sector, however, sentiment fell for the first time in five months as morale in tourism and hospitality deteriorated due to rising infections in recent weeks.
For the third quarter, Ifo now expects the German economy to grow by 6.6% on the quarter and then growth to slow to 2.8% in the fourth quarter, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
The survey shows that the easy part of the recovery is over. Infections are on the rise in many countries that are important trading partners for German manufacturers, KfW chief economist Fritzi Koehler-Geib said.
In France, the business confidence index rose to 92 from August's 90, reaching its highest level since February, before France went into a two-month lockdown to contain the outbreak, plunging the economy deep into recession.
The index for the industrial sector improved particularly sharply, jumping to 96 from 92, exceeding the average expectations in a Reuters poll for a reading of 95. The index for the bigger services sector rose to 95 from 93.
The improvement comes even though the French government has had no choice but to increase restrictions on gatherings in the face of a surge in new COVID-19 cases to record levels.

The data also contrasted with surveys from IHS Markit, which showed that private sector activity in Germany and France slowed in September on weaker-than-expected services activity.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Months after China brought its coronavirus epidemic under control, its consumers are slowly opening their wallets again - but the hard days of lockdowns still weigh on many shellshocked lower-income households, who prefer to hold on to their cash.
While China's recovery from a record first quarter contraction is well ahead of most other countries, it has been uneven. Lingering weakness in consumption could complicate President Xi Jinping's push to curb the country's dependence on volatile overseas markets.
Factories rebounded relatively quickly from paralysing lockdowns, but consumer confidence has picked up only gradually in the world's second-largest economy.
It took until August before retail sales finally returned to growth, rising 0.5% on-year. Sales for the first eight months were 8.6% lower than the same period last year.
But while spending on luxury goods like Prada (OTC:PRDSY) bags (HK:1913) quickly shook off the virus shock, consumption of daily necessities and services is recovering more slowly. Extra caution from lower-income households is a key reason why, say analysts.
""We live on savings but it's difficult, we tried to buy only the necessities,"" said Zhou Ran, a self-employed decorator in central Henan's Xinxiang city who couldn't work for four months earlier this year amid lockdowns. 
Sales of clothing and shoes remain down 15% over the first eight months, while fuel and other petroleum product sales are down 17.3%. Incomes from food and beverage sales fell over 26% in this period.
SHOCKED SPENDERS 
Analysts will be closely watching data and company sales reports from China's ""Golden Week"" holidays on Oct. 1-8 to gauge how quickly consumers' mood is improving.
Though Zhou returned to work in May, business was hard to find. ""Many people prefer to keep cash for now so they delay renovations,"" he said. 
""It is difficult for everyone this year,"" said Zhou, whose wife takes care of their three children and doesn't have an income.
A quarterly report issued jointly by the research arm of Alibaba-backed Ant Group and Southwestern University of Finance and Economics showed the vulnerability of low income families to the epidemic. 
Most households with annual incomes below 100,000 yuan ($14,800) reported their wealth declined in the first and second quarters. Those with incomes above 300,000 yuan reported consistent gains.
""Higher-income households have probably built up savings, because of the forced reduction in consumption during lockdown, and could now be ready for a spending spree,"" said Wei He, an analyst at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, in a note.
""It is lower-income households that face a longer slog of normalizing their finances,"" he said. 
JD (NASDAQ:JD).com data shows that consumption growth in lower-tier cities and low-income groups was weaker than in major cities and high-income groups in June, reversing the usual trend, according to Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD Digits, the Chinese e-commerce giant's fintech arm.
This is likely because the small and medium-sized enterprises which employ many lower-income people were affected more by the epidemic, Shen said in an article published August. 
The impact on consumption could be considerable. Some 600 million Chinese people earn a monthly income of barely 1,000 yuan, according to Premier Li Keqiang, speaking in May. That would be over 40% of the country's population. 
Beijing has issued a slew of policies to stabilize jobs and support spending over the last months. Local authorities and companies have, for instance, handed out billions of yuan in shopping vouchers.
ANY PORT IN A STORM
To be sure, China's recovery, as imbalanced as it is, is still a bright spot in global consumption as other major economies battle a second wave of infections and in some cases impose fresh curbs on activity. 
Many in China's vast export-oriented sector have turned to the domestic market as foreign orders dry up, with enthusiastic government support.
An app from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Holding Group Ltd which helps manufacturing suppliers sell directly to domestic consumers has seen 1.2 million companies sign up since its launch in March. Nearly half were export-focused previously, according to an Alibaba spokesperson.
Domestic orders now make up 40% of total orders for Tu Xinye, the manager of a company that makes toothbrushes in southern Jiangsu province. 
That's up from just 10% in the past, and overall sales volume has returned to 90% of pre-COVID levels, he said. 
But while Chinese consumers made up for the company's shrinking overseas orders this year, they also create new challenges, said Tu.
Competition is fiercer at home than in the bigger ""blue ocean"" export market, and Chinese buyers also like different kinds of toothbrushes - with softer bristles and smaller handles.
Tu's company's relative success has been an outlier in his town. Many smaller companies there have collapsed, and Tu is now in the process of acquiring a competitor.

""Times of crisis are also times when there's some economic reshuffling,"" he said.

The majority of firms are recovering far more slowly than those in wealthier areas around Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong, said a report from China Beige Book International (CBB).
While revenue and profits for the third quarter saw steep declines year-on-year across China, many interior provinces also saw output, domestic orders, and sales prices falling from the second quarter as well, according to a quarterly survey of thousands of Chinese firms by the U.S.-based consultancy.
For instance, sales revenues increased 41% quarter-on-quarter for Shanghai and the wealthy eastern provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, but fell by 10% in the more remote western regions of Tibet, Gansu, Qinghai and Xinjiang, it said.
""For the corporate elite – large firms and those based in the Big 3 coastal regions – the economy is accelerating ... But the rest of China – most firms in most regions – are seeing a far more muted recovery,"" said Derek Scissors, chief economist at CBB, in comments issued with the survey.
In August, China's industrial output accelerated the most in eight months, while retail sales grew for the first time this year, suggesting the economic recovery is gathering pace as demand starts to improve more broadly from the coronavirus crisis.
Regional divergences were also visible in credit, according to the consultancy, with a far higher proportion of firms in the wealthy areas around Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong accessing capital.
""Borrowing levels stayed flat or fell outright in 4 of 5 non-coastal regions,"" it said in the report.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's unemployment rate jumped to 13.1% in the second quarter of the year as the country was swiped by the coronavirus pandemic, the official statistics agency said on Wednesday, the highest since 2004 and up from 10.4% in the previous quarter.
Argentina imposed a strict lockdown in mid-March, hitting an already shaky economy in recession since 2018 and leaving many businesses struggling to survive. The country now has over 650,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19.
""The (unemployment) numbers largely reflect the impact on labor market dynamics from the COVID-19 pandemic and from the restrictions on certain activities and movement,"" Argentina's INDEC statistics body said in a report.
The agency said the sectors hardest hit included construction, hotels and restaurants and domestic services.

The South American grains producer, which is just emerging from default on its foreign debt, needs to revive its economy and get people back to work to stave off a sharp increase in poverty and to refill depleted government coffers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business activity cooled in September, with gains at factories offset by a retreat at services industries, suggesting a loss of momentum in the economy as the third quarter draws to a close and COVID-19 lingers.
The economy's recovery from the pandemic recession is losing speed as government financial help to businesses and the unemployed dries up. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that Congress and the U.S. central bank needed to remain focused on supporting the recovery.
""We need to stay with it ... the recovery will go faster if there is support coming both from Congress and the Fed,"" Powell said.
Data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, slipped to a reading of 54.4 this month from 54.6 in August. A reading above 50 indicates growth in private sector output. Though the private sector continues to expand, this month's dip in the index was in line with views that the economy's momentum was ebbing. 
Gross domestic product is expected to rebound at as much as a record 32% annualized rate in the third quarter after tumbling at a 31.7% rate in the April-June period, the worst performance since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
The coronavirus crisis wiped out more than five years of growth, and economists are calling for another aid package from the government to help the fragile recovery. The economy slipped into recession in February. 
""The question now turns to whether the economy's strong performance can be sustained into the fourth quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, noting that the uncertainty over the Nov. 3 presidential election had also risen. ""Risks therefore seem tilted to the downside for the coming months, as businesses await clarity with respect to both the path of the pandemic and the election.""
Moderation in business activity was not confined to the United States. Euro zone business growth ground to a halt this month amid a renewed downturn in the dominant services sector, a separate survey from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.
Six months after the COVID-19 pandemic started in the United States, coronavirus cases remain high, with the death toll in the country exceeding 200,000 on Tuesday - by far the highest number of any nation.
The survey's services sector flash PMI fell to 54.6 this month from a reading of 55.0 in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 54.7 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. The services industry has been hardest hit by the virus and remains below its pre-pandemic level. 
A measure of service industry employment slipped this month.
In contrast, manufacturing firms signaled an acceleration in activity. The flash manufacturing PMI increased to 53.5 this month from 53.1 in August. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11% of the economy, holding at 53.1 this month. A measure of new orders received by factories edged down to a reading of 54 from 54.1 in August.
""The shift from a few months with large increases across PMI components to more mixed results looks broadly consistent with many economic indicators that point to a loss of momentum lately following a period with widespread and robust gains as the economy started recovering from the virus-related shock,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
STRONG HOUSING MARKET
While the overall economy is showing signs of slowing, the housing market is pressing ahead, driven by historically low mortgage rates and a pandemic-fueled migration to suburbs and low-density areas in search of more spacious accommodation as many people work from home. 
The strong demand for housing has not been matched by an increase in supply, boosting house price inflation. A separate report on Wednesday showed the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) house price index rose a seasonally adjusted 1.0% in July after a similar gain in June. House prices jumped 6.5% on a year-on-year basis in July. That was the biggest annual gain since June 2018 and followed a 5.8% increase in June.
The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). A report from the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday showed house prices surged 11.4% in August from a year ago.
""We expect demand from buyers fleeing urban areas to taper off, while the weakening recovery in the labor market will pose headwinds to housing activity,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 

""Sparse inventory, particularly of existing homes, will keep a solid floor under home prices even if demand softens from its recent level.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's recovery from the coronavirus lockdown lost some momentum this month, a business survey showed, as consumer-facing sectors suffered from the end of a government subsidy to support restaurants and more general COVID-related worries.
The IHS Markit/CIPS flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to a three-month low of 55.7 in September after hitting a six-year high of 59.1 in August, a slightly larger drop than economists had forecast in a Reuters poll.
The preliminary survey, published on Wednesday, still showed strong growth in Britain's services and manufacturing sectors, but reflected a slowdown in new orders and the weakest confidence about future output since May.
British gross domestic product fell more than 20% during the second quarter, the biggest drop of any G7 economy, and the Bank of England expects third-quarter output to be around 7% below its level before the crisis.
""The drop in the (PMI) suggests that the recovery has already started to flatten out,"" said economist Thomas Pugh at Capital Economics.
British businesses performed better than those in the euro zone, where PMI data on Wednesday showed growth ground to a halt in September due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Britons on Tuesday to work from home where possible and ordered restaurants and bars to close early to tackle a fast-spreading second wave of COVID-19, with new restrictions lasting probably six months.
""Reinstating restrictions on business opening hours and encouraging people to work from home again could cause the recovery to stall completely in Q4,"" Pugh said. 
Businesses in the survey said they were reducing staff numbers for a seventh consecutive month -- the longest such run since 2010 and one which bodes poorly for many workers when government job support measures expire at the end of next month.
Britain's central bank forecast last month that unemployment would jump to 7.5% in the final three months of this year from 4.1% during the three months to July.
The change in the government's approach, less than a month after it was offering half-price incentives for people to dine in restaurants and discouraging working from home, comes after a big rise in new COVID-19 cases, also seen elsewhere in Europe.
Testing capacity has come under strain since schools in England reopened at the start of September.
IHS Markit said the weakening in growth was concentrated in sectors that relied on consumer demand, and services activity slowed more than manufacturing.

""The restaurant sector in particular saw demand fall sharply as the Eat Out to Help Out scheme was withdrawn,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 48.5 in September from 51.6 in August, falling short of expectations for 51.9 in a Reuters poll of economists.
That brought the index below the 50-point threshold demarcating growth in activity from a contraction and was the lowest since May, when France emerged from a two-month coronavirus lockdown that plunged the economy into recession.
France has seen new infections spiral higher in recent weeks to record levels, leading to the imposition of some new restrictions to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus and reduce the number of intensive care admissions.
""The rise in case numbers has been accompanied by fresh restrictions, but has also caused hesitancy among businesses due to fears of a second round of temporary business closures,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.
""For now, at least, firms remain optimistic towards the year ahead outlook, but should the current trajectory of infection rates persist, that confidence is likely be tested in the coming months.""
The survey showed confidence falling in particular in the services sector, where a flash PMI fell to 47.5 from 51.5 in August, hitting the lowest level since May and falling short of expectations for a stable reading at 51.5.

In contrast, the smaller manufacturing sector saw a slight improvement, with its index rising to 50.9 from 49.8, slightly exceeding expectations on average for a reading of 50.5.

The GfK institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, edged up to -1.6 heading into October from an upwardly revised -1.7 in the previous month.
The reading missed a Reuters forecast for an increase to -1.0 and followed an unexpected drop in the previous month.
GfK consumer expert Rolf Buerkl said the German consumer climate had stabilized despite a recent rise in new coronavirus infections and the growing risk of another round of lockdown measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.
""It seems as if the massive stimulus packages for consumers and companies are the right measures to help Germany get out of the worst recession in post-war history,"" Buerkl said.
Since March, Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government has implemented an unprecedented array of stimulus measures, financed with record new borrowing of some 218 billion euros ($256.15 billion), to cushion the impact of the pandemic.

But Buerkl added that a further improvement in consumer morale was depending on the development of the pandemic and the labour market.

BENGALURU, India (Reuters) - Business sentiment among Asian firms rebounded in the third quarter as easing coronavirus restrictions lifted sales but lingering uncertainty over the pandemic thwarted a return to business-as-usual, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed.
Asian firms' outlook for the next six months tracked by the Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index <.TRIABS>  jumped to 53 in the third quarter from an 11-year low of 35 in the second, according to the survey of 103 companies across 11 Asia-Pacific countries.
It was also higher than the 50-point mark, which indicates a positive outlook.
The survey comes as the easing of coronavirus restrictions across Asia has reduced pressure on hard-hit economies, though the experience has varied across the region, with some still in recession and others, like China, seeing a steady recovery.
More than two-thirds of the companies polled said they saw the pandemic, or a fresh spike in COVID-19 cases, as a top risk. About 14% said a global recession was their biggest concern, while the rest flagged uncertainty over the upcoming U.S. election in November and other risks.
""We're recovering with a large dose of uncertainty,"" said Antonio Fatas, an economics professor at global business school INSEAD in Singapore.
""If it was just because of Asia, I think the numbers would be more positive but the reality is the world is not just Asia,"" he said, pointing to greater uncertainty in Europe and the United States.
The United States has reported the greatest number of COVID-19 fatalities, while rising numbers in Europe are now threatening to shut down parts of the continent again.
Some 28% of companies in the third quarter were positive about their outlook, the survey showed, up sharply from 7.6% in the second quarter. About 60% of the firms polled said they did not hire or lay off people this quarter, in contrast to the second quarter's survey in which 63% said they had cut jobs. 
Companies polled included Australia-listed Oil Search (AX:OSH), Indian motorcycle maker  Hero MotoCorp  (NS:HROM) and Japanese car maker Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269).
The survey was conducted between Aug. 31 and Sept. 14.
CHINA OPTIMISM
While countries in Asia have had mixed success in containing the coronavirus and its fallout on their economies, the Asian Development Bank expects output in the region to shrink for the first time in nearly six decades this year. 
China, where the coronavirus was first detected, has largely managed to contain its spread and South Korea and Japan have kept case numbers relatively low by global standards despite all three countries seeing a second wave of infections. 
But elsewhere in the region the outbreak is worsening. India, for instance, has reported the second-highest number of cases globally.
Indeed, some investors are shunning Asia's riskier, high-yielding markets, despite the ample liquidity pumped into the financial system by central banks globally this year.
Satish Shankar, the Asia-Pacific managing partner of business consultancy Bain & Company, said many companies in the region would ""need to fundamentally transform their business models"" to survive.
But he added that Asia's economic rebound would be ""strongly linked"" to the recovery in the Chinese economy.
China expanded 3.2% in the second quarter, and looks set to grow this year.
Some China-based firms in the survey said the upcoming U.S. election was their primary worry alongside COVID-19.
The U.S. government is threatening to delist Chinese companies that do not meet U.S. accounting standards while Washington has cracked down on Chinese tech firms amid worsening relations between the world's two largest economies.
Grant Pan, chief financial officer of Chinese wealth manager Noah Holdings (N:NOAH), which is listed in the United States, said the firm was looking at ""possible alternatives as a safety net, including the Hong Kong and Chinese capital market"". Noah Holdings was among the companies surveyed.

The New York-based bank looked at the costs of lost wages, less access to home and small business loans and limited access higher education. Over the past 20 years, GDP lost about $16 trillion because of race-based inequalities, the firm estimated in a study released Tuesday.
Citigroup concluded the costs of racism are greater than did a 2019 McKinsey study, which estimated that the racial wealth gap would cost the U.S. economy $1.5 trillion through 2028, but both agree the status quo is a drag on growth.
“What this report underscores is that this tariff is levied on us all, and particularly in the U.S., that cost has a real and tangible impact on our country’s economic output,” Citigroup Vice Chairman Raymond J. McGuire said in the report. “We have a responsibility and an opportunity to confront this longstanding societal ill.”
Citigroup also concluded that closing the wage gap two decades ago could have freed up $2.7 trillion in income for consumption and investment, and fair lending to Black entrepreneurs could have generated $13 trillion in business revenue over the same time period.

The report from the National Association of Realtors confirmed home sales had recovered after slumping when the economy almost ground to a halt as businesses were shuttered in mid-March in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. 
Demand for housing is being fueled by record-low mortgage rates and a pandemic-fueled migration to suburbs and low-density areas in search of more spacious accommodation as many people work from home. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a congressional panel on Tuesday that the economy has shown ""marked improvement"" since plunging into recession in February, though the path ahead remains uncertain.
""The housing market has continued its remarkable recovery amidst an otherwise fraught economy that has been battered by the pandemic,"" said John Pataky, executive vice president at TIAA Bank in Jacksonville, Florida. 
""However, we should continue to be paranoid about the sustainability of sales. With lack of housing supply, there is an upward pressure on home prices which threatens to detract the benefits accrued from low mortgage rates."" 
  Existing home sales increased 2.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 million units last month, the highest level since December 2006. August's increase in homes sales, which marked three straight months of gains, was in line with economists' expectations.
The median existing house price jumped 11.4% from a year ago to a record $310,600 in August. Sales last month were concentrated in the $250,000 to $1 million and over price range, with transactions below the $250,000 price band down sharply.
Existing home sales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, jumped 10.5% on a year-on-year basis in August. 
The PHLX housing index increased more than 1.5%, outpacing a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were down.
TIGHT INVENTORY
Though the coronavirus crisis has left nearly 30 million people on unemployment benefits, joblessness has disproportionately affected low-wage workers in the services sector, who are typically young and renters.
Home sales rose in all four regions last month. Demand for housing was skewed toward single-family homes as people sought larger spaces for home offices and schooling. The NAR reckons the migration to suburbs from city centers could become permanent even if a vaccine is developed for the respiratory illness.
Single-family home sales advanced 1.7% in August. While multi-family home sales increased 8.6%, they accounted for 10.5% of sales, down from the 12% that is considered the norm for the housing market. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.87%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). A persistent shortage of homes for sale and August's double-digit house price inflation growth are red flags.
The shortage is concentrated in the single-family housing segment. Though single-family builders' confidence hit a record high this month and permits for single-family home construction jumped in August to their highest level since May 2007, the supply squeeze is unlikely to ease as fires in the West have boosted lumber prices. 
There were 1.49 million previously owned homes on the market in August, down 18.6% from a year ago. At August's sales pace, it would take 3.0 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.1 months in July and 4.0 months a year ago. 
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
""The 11% gain in prices is far above income growth and threatens overall affordability especially for first-time buyers,"" said Joel Kan an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington. ""It's clear that more inventory is needed to keep home prices from rising too quickly."" 
Last month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 22 days, matching July, but down from 31 days in August 2019. Sixty-nine percent of homes sold in August were on the market for less than a month. According to the NAR, realtors were reporting multiple bids for houses on the market.

First-time buyers accounted for 33% of sales in August, down from 34% in July 2020, but up from 31% in August 2019. Individual investors or second-home buyers, who account for many cash sales, bought 14% of homes in August. All-cash sales accounted for 18% of transactions.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Europe appears to have weathered a pandemic-induced recession better than many feared, a slew of indicators suggested on Tuesday, but prospects for a second wave of infections and a hard Brexit are once again raising talk of more stimulus.
Having shrunk by over a tenth last quarter, the euro zone economy is quickly regaining strength on the back of relatively resilient consumption, supported by job subsidy schemes, tax cuts and lavish stimulus from the European Central Bank. 
Indeed, consumer confidence in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose to -13.9 this month from -14.7 in August, the European Commission said, a reading below its long-term trend but easily beating market expectations.
Adding to the positive news, the Ifo Institute upgraded its forecast for Germany, expecting GDP in the euro zone's biggest economy to shrink 5.2% this year, a big improvement on its last projection for a 6.7% drop or the Bundesbank's 7.1% forecast.
The figures suggest that unprecedented fiscal and monetary support have insulated the bloc from an unprecedented recession and households began to spend once again as most restrictions were lifted during the summer months.
Unemployment in the region has barely risen compared to some other major economies and, at 7.9%, has still not moved far from the more than 10-year low of 7.2% hit earlier this year.
Germany's HDE retail association now expects nominal sales to grow by 1.5% this year, a sharp upward revision from its previous estimate for a 4% drop, helped by a surge in online sales and stimulus measures that have included a temporary VAT cut and cash handouts for parents.
UNSUSTAINABLE? 
But the good news may be unsustainable. 
Investors are growing increasingly worried about surging coronavirus infections in countries like France and Spain, increasing the risk of lockdowns, a factor not captured by Tuesday's indicators. 
""We doubt this (confidence rise) will be sustained,"" Melanie Debono at Capital Economic said in a note. ""Further restrictions are being imposed and look set to cause consumer confidence, and perhaps household spending, to drop back in the fourth quarter.""
Worries over a hard Brexit merely compound the troubles and European stocks tumbled this week as markets are now pricing a more protracted recovery with more frequent interruptions. 
Indeed, many euro zone countries have reintroduced travel restrictions, forcing airlines to scale back passenger services after a relatively quick run up over the summer.
But most governments appear keen to avoid the type of hard lockdowns seen in early spring and instead opt for localised, targeted measures that allow people to maintain ordinary activities as much as possible. 
Mortality is also not following the surge in infections, supporting government efforts to limit disruptions.
Still, the outlook is sufficiently murky for the ECB to make the clearest case yet for even more stimulus, perhaps as soon as the fourth quarter. 
""Faced with such a sizeable downward skew (in risks), there is a strong case for our reaction function to be asymmetric, as the risks of a policy overreaction are much smaller than the risks of policy being too slow or too shy to react and the worst-case scenarios materialising,"" ECB board member Fabio Panetta said.
He added that while the ECB has done a lot, the inflation outlook is not yet satisfactory as price growth is ""uncomfortably"" below the ECB's aim of close to 2%.

""If we encounter shocks that compress demand and pose additional threats to price stability, our reaction function is clearly spelled out: a policy response is necessary and forthcoming,"" he said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's economy likely contracted around 20% year-on-year in the second quarter of the year, hit by the coronavirus pandemic and a nationwide lockdown imposed in March, economists polled by Reuters estimated ahead of the official data release on Tuesday.
That would be the worst quarter since at least the 1980s, according to official government data, and a sharper drop than any period during Argentina's major economic crisis in 2002, when the steepest quarterly fall was 16.3%.
The South American grains producer, in recession since 2018 and just emerging from default on its sovereign debt, has been hit hard by the pandemic despite a tough early lockdown. It has over 640,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and nearly 13,500 deaths.
The government imposed the lockdown on March 20, and while it has been eased it remains in place until at least Oct. 11, with Argentina still at its peak in terms of daily case numbers. The country recorded over 400 deaths in 24 hours on Monday.
""The key is in lockdown; restriction on supply and the blow it had on demand pummeled economic activity in the second quarter of 2020,"" said consultancy Ecolatina.
A Reuters poll of 14 local and foreign analysts gave a forecast for a 19.9% average contraction for the April-June period and a median estimate of a 19.6% drop. Predictions ranged from drops of 19.4% to a steepest 21.1% fall.
""The strong isolation restrictions imposed from the second half of March and that lasted until August had a significant economic cost for the entire country,"" said economist Natalia Motyl, from consultancy Libertad y Progreso.
Motyl added that services, construction and manufacturing had been the hardest hit, while the important farm export sector had been less affected by the lockdown, that had taken a hit from global commodities prices.
Argentina's economy, which declined 5.4% in the first quarter of the year, is estimated to contract around 12% this year, according to a central bank poll and government forecasts.

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturers reported the sharpest drop in orders for three months in September and said they expected production to remain weak for the remainder of the year due to the impact of COVID-19 and Brexit worries.
The Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) monthly industrial order book balance fell to -48 in September from -44 in August, bucking expectations in a Reuters poll of economists for a small improvement and remaining well below its long-run average.
""As manufacturing firms continue to battle against headwinds from a resurgence of the virus, weak global demand and uncertainty over our trading relationships, the government must step up its support,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.
Britain's government is tightening coronavirus restrictions - including bringing in early closing for pubs and restaurants - and has reversed calls employees to return to work in offices.
Many businesses are also concerned about the end of a job support scheme next month that has paid them to keep staff on furlough until demand picks up.
""The recovery in the manufacturing sector appears to be losing momentum. Strong growth in output over the summer likely was partly due to firms shifting work backlogs that had amassed during the lockdown,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultants Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The CBI said it wanted a replacement for the furlough programme, as well as progress on a trade deal with the European Union before transition arrangements end at the end of the year.
""Firms across the country are facing considerable uncertainty as the end of the Job Retention Scheme nears, and concerns about the potential for a no-deal Brexit have escalated as negotiations remain in stalemate,"" said Tom Crotty, group director of chemicals and industrial firm INEOS.
The CBI data showed manufacturers were slightly less negative about the outlook for production over the next three months, but still expected it to fall.

The most recent official data showed factory output expanded by 6.3% in July but was 9.4% lower than in July 2019.

Some 10.5% of consumers surveyed said they had become unemployed between March and July of this year, up from 2.8% in July 2019 and reaching a series high for the survey, which started in March 2014. The average expected likelihood of becoming unemployed also rose to 3.7% in July from 2% a year earlier.
Consumers also faced more challenges finding new jobs. The share of people who changed employers dropped to 4.4% in July from 6.2% a year earlier.
Only 13.5% of individuals said they received at least one job offer in the prior four months, down from 21.0% in July 2019 - a figure that had been rising from March 2018 until March 2020, when the coronavirus began to spread around the world. The average expected likelihood of receiving a job offer in the next four months also dropped sharply to 18.5% in July from 24.1% a year earlier.
A separate survey released by the Fed last week found that government aid provided substantial relief to people affected by the pandemic, with more Americans overall reporting that they were doing OK financially as of July. However, the enhanced unemployment benefits and small business loans rolled out as part of the CARES Act expired in July and negotiations in Congress over another aid package are at a standstill.
The survey also found that people with work are generally more satisfied with their wages and benefits.

The labor survey is done as part of the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations. Approximately 1,000 panelists are polled every four months about job transitions and their current job.

The island's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 13.6% in August from a year earlier to $45.5 billion, Ministry of Economic Affairs data showed on Monday, setting a historic high for the month.
The data exceeded an 8.2% rise projected in a Reuters poll and a 12.4% increase in July. It was the sixth consecutive month of gains and the strongest since January 2018.
The ministry said the blockbuster performance was helped by continued strong demand for products such as laptops and tablets, with orders for electronics including smartphones hitting a record high thanks to upcoming new product launches.
Taiwan usually sees strong electronics orders in the third and fourth quarter ahead of the year-end holiday season when vendors launch new smartphone models.
The ministry said it expects export orders to be between a fall of 0.1% and rise of 3.2% in September from a year earlier. It expects demand for electronics to remain strong, but warned of uncertainty over the pandemic and China-U.S. trade frictions.
Taiwan's manufacturers are a key part of the global supply chain for tech giants such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
Orders from the United States for Taiwan's goods rose 19.5% in August from a year earlier, compared with 22.2% growth in July, while those from China were up 21% versus a 16.8% gain the previous month. European orders lifted 21.2%, while those from Japan dropped 3.8%.

The Make UK industry association and accountants BDO said output and orders had improved from historic lows struck last quarter during the depths of the pandemic.
But the survey's quarterly gauge of investment intentions fell to -32% from -26%, almost touching depths last seen in the financial crisis.
""Manufacturing has begun to climb away from the abyss that it stared into earlier in the year,"" said Stephen Phipson, chief executive at Make UK.
""But, make no mistake it is going to be a long haul back towards normal trading conditions, with talk of a 'V'-shaped recovery nothing more than fanciful.""
The possibility that Britain and the European Union fail to agree a trade deal before the end of the Brexit transition period would be a ""final nail in the coffin"" for many manufacturers, Phipson added.
Output in Britain's manufacturing sector was still 8.7% below its pre-pandemic level in July, according to official data published earlier this month.

LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers spent more last month, taking sales further above pre-COVID levels, as strong online demand helped much of the sector rebound faster than the rest of the economy.
Retail sales volumes rose by 0.8% in August, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday -- slightly above the average 0.7% forecast in a Reuters poll. Compared with a year earlier, they were up 2.8%, just below forecasts of 3.0% annual growth.
Sales had already overtaken pre-COVID levels in July and now stand 4.0% higher than before the crisis, although economists are cautious about what will happen later this year if unemployment rises sharply as forecast.
""Spending may yet stutter as the furlough scheme is wound down and unemployment rises, weighing on household incomes and job security. And other parts of the economy, such as investment, are taking much longer to recover,"" Andrew Wishart of consultancy Capital Economics said.
Retailers have benefited from fewer British people holidaying abroad this summer, pent-up demand from the lockdown, and a shift to spending on household goods rather than activities outside the home.
However, the rebound masks a sharp split between online and high-street retailers. Online and catalogue sales were up 34.4% on the year in August, while primarily in-store clothing sales were 15.5% lower, despite a 13.5% rise from July.
""Overall, the switch to greater online sales means the high street remains under pressure,"" ONS deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow said.

The crisis in traditional retailing is having a knock-on effect for commercial landlords, with stores closing and tenants such as clothing chain New Look seeking to renegotiate rents to link them to turnover.
Upmarket department store chain John Lewis wrote off 470 million pounds in the value of its stores in results published on Thursday, and scrapped its annual staff bonus for the first time since 1953.
Grocery sales rose just 0.4% in August, after strong growth in previous months when British people had eaten at home more.
August saw a temporary government promotion for dining in restaurants, named 'Eat Out to Help Out', which earlier industry data suggested had dented grocery demand.
Separate ONS figures on Friday showed the number of British adults visiting restaurants, pubs and cafes fell for the first time since July after the programme ended, dropping to 30% in the week to Sept. 13 from 38% in late August.
The Bank of England said on Thursday that Britain's economy was on course to recover faster than it had forecast in August, but output in the July-September period is still expected to be 7% lower than in 2019's final quarter.
Britain suffered the biggest economic hit of any G7 economy between April and June, when output fell by more than 20%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's next quarterly survey will likely show its big manufacturers were less pessimistic than they were in the June quarter, when business sentiment struck an 11-year low following a nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Fourteen economists polled by Reuters forecast the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey would show the headline index for big manufacturers' confidence at minus 23 in September, improving from minus 34 in June as sentiment began recovering after a nationwide lockdown was eased.
The June index was the weakest since June 2009, when the economy was in the throes of the Global Financial Crisis.
The sentiment index for big non-manufacturers is expected to have recovered to minus 9 in September from minus 17 marked in June survey, which was the worst reading since December 2009, according to the Reuters poll. 
""Demand recovery after social and economic activities restarted in Japan and overseas helped business sentiment to improve in broad industries,"" said Akane Yamaguchi, economist at Daiwa Institute of Research.
The Reuters poll showed sentiment among both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers over the outlook was likely to remain subdued. 
Big manufacturers' business confidence is expected to recover somewhat to minus 17 in the coming quarter, and non-manufacturers' sentiment is forecast to remain at minus 9, the poll found.
""The pace of recovery in business sentiment is expected to be limited as coronavirus prevention steps remain in place and concerns over a resurgence in the cases continue to be strong,"" Yamaguchi said.
Big companies will likely raise their capital spending plans by 1.3% for this fiscal year to March 2021, revising down from 3.2% projected in the June survey.
""Companies will stay cautious as corporate earnings have worsened due to the spread of the coronavirus infection and it is uncertain how the situation will develop,"" aid Kenta Maruyama, an economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices fell at their fastest pace in almost four years in August, dragged mostly by government-sponsored discounts for domestic travel aimed at supporting the battered tourism sector.
The weak consumer price data comes after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Thursday it would monitor not just price trends but jobs growth in guiding policy, signalling a readiness to ramp up stimulus if job losses heighten the risk of deflation.
Japan's new premier Yoshihide Suga on Wednesday pledged to contain COVID-19 and retain his former boss's ""Abenomics"" growth policies while pushing reforms such as deregulation and digitalisation.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, fell 0.4% in August from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday.
That compared with the median market forecast for a 0.4% decline and a flat reading in July and matched the level seen in November in 2016. 
The main factor for the fall in the core CPI was a price decline in accommodation and hotels after the government launched subsidies for national travel discounts from late July to revive tourism. 
Prices of accommodation fell 32.0% in August from a year earlier, the index showed.
""Downward pressure on consumer prices will likely continue and the core CPI index could fall to around 1.0% year-on-year later this year,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
He said the travel campaign will continue to weigh on accommodation while the boost to prices from a sales tax hike implemented last October will disappear later this year.
Meanwhile, downward pressure on prices is broadening from the hit to demand caused by the coronavirus.
The so-called core-core price index, which excludes food and energy prices and is closely tracked by the central bank as a narrower gauge of inflation, fell 0.1% in August, the first fall since March 2017. In July, the index gained 0.4%.
""There is also a possibility that weak demand triggered by the coronavirus outbreak could push down consumer prices going ahead, though we haven't seen significant impact on consumer prices so far,"" Shinke said.
The economy shrank an annualised 28.1% in April-June, its biggest postwar contraction.

Analysts see the reopening of businesses after a nationwide shutdown supporting the economy, but firms and consumers remain cautious about the coronavirus outbreak and the pace of recovery may be limited.

The findings represent a sharp turnaround from last year, when a large majority of companies said they intended to keep up or better their rates of recruitment. 
The annual report from the Confederation of British Industry and the Pertemps Network Group recruitment consultancy showed 51% of companies planned to maintain or increase recruitment next year, while 46% foresaw a reduction or a complete stop.
The net balance of +5% compared with +56% in last year's survey.
""The UK labour market has been under heavy stress since the outset of the Covid-19 crisis and, although the economy has started to re-open, pressure on firms remains acute,"" said Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief policy director.
One in three of companies said they planned to implement a pay freeze across all roles - compared with one in 20 in last year's survey.
The figures chimed with a Bank of England survey on Thursday that showed a ""large proportion"" of companies planned to delay or cancel their annual pay reviews.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak is under pressure to announce a partial extension of the government's furlough scheme by targeting help towards the worst-hit sectors of the economy in order to slow a wave of job losses.
While he has said the scheme will not be prolonged beyond the planned closure on Oct. 31, earlier this week he said he would be ""creative"" in seeking new ways to stave off unemployment.
Data on Tuesday showed Britain's unemployment rate increased to 4.1% in the three months to July from the 3.9% level it had clung to since early 2020.
The Bank of England has forecast that unemployment will hit 7.5% at the end of this year, when it is expected to expand its bond-buying stimulus programme again.

The CBI/Pertemps survey of 248 companies was conducted between Aug. 17 and Sept. 4.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell less than expected last week and applications for the prior period were revised up, suggesting the labor market recovery had shifted into low gear amid fading fiscal stimulus.
The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed nearly 30 million people were on unemployment benefits at the end of August, laying bare both the continuing economic and human devastation six months after the COVID-19 pandemic started in the United States.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday vowed to keep interest rates near zero for a long time, noting that the coronavirus ""will continue to weigh on economic activity"" in the near term and ""poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said more fiscal support was likely to be needed for the economy.
""With nearly 30 million people unemployed and the ongoing failure of politicians to deliver additional needed fiscal stimulus, the climb out of the pandemic downturn is likely to be slower and more damaging to long-term growth than it should have been,"" said Ron Temple, head of U.S. equity at Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Asset Management in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 33,000 to a seasonally adjusted 860,000 for the week ended Sept. 12. Data for the prior week was revised to show 9,000 more applications received than previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 850,000 applications in the latest week.
Unadjusted claims dropped 75,974 to 790,021 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted claims number given earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations because of the economic shock caused by the coronavirus crisis. 
A total 658,737 applications were received for the government-funded pandemic unemployment assistance last week. The PUA is for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs. Altogether, 1.45 million people filed claims last week.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 916,000 to 12.628 million in the week ending Sept. 5. Economists attributed the drop in the so-called continuing claims to people exhausting their eligibility for benefits, which are limited to 26 weeks in most states.
The number of people on a government-funded program that provides up to 13 additional weeks of benefits to individuals who have exhausted their regular unemployment compensation increased 104,683 to 1.5 million in the week ending Aug. 29.
""The crisis has yet to abate, rehiring is growing slowly, and the struggles of families and businesses continue to fester,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation in New York.
A third report from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region moderating in September, though manufacturers remained optimistic about growth over the next six months. Reports this week showed a slowdown in retail sales and production at factories in August.
U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY
After declining from a record 6.867 million at the end of March, as businesses reopened after being shuttered to stem the spread of the coronavirus, claims have flattened, with layoffs spilling over to industries not initially impacted by the mandated closures. 
A $600 weekly unemployment benefits supplement ended in July and was replaced with a $300 weekly subsidy, which is not available in all states and is expected to run out of funding this month. A program to help businesses with wages lapsed in August, while $25 billion in government assistance for airline payrolls expires this month. 
Last week's claims covered the period during which the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm payrolls component of September's employment report. 
""Unemployment insurance claims indicate that job growth will be slower through the rest of 2020 and that full recovery in the labor market will take years,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The economy added 1.371 million jobs in August and has recouped 10.6 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost at the depth of the coronavirus crisis.
Unemployment has disproportionately affected low-wage workers, who are typically renters, limiting the hit from the pandemic on the housing market. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 4.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.021 million units in August. 
Further gains are likely, with building permits for single-family housing units accelerating 6.0% to a rate of 1.036 million units, the highest since May 2007. A 22.7% tumble in starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment, however, led to a 5.1% drop in overall homebuilding to a rate of 1.416 million units last month. 

The housing market is being fueled by record low interest rates and a pandemic-fueled migration to suburbs and low density areas.

Housing starts dropped 5.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.416 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Data for July was revised slightly lower to a 1.492 million-unit pace from the previously reported 1.496 million. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts slipping to a rate of 1.478 million units.
A survey on Wednesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders increased to a record high in September. Builders, however, remained concerned about rising costs for materials and delivery delays, especially for lumber.
The housing market has outperformed the broader economy despite nearly 30 million people being on unemployment benefits. Unemployment has disproportionately affected low-wage workers, who are typically renters. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.86%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
Home building last month was pulled down by a 22.7% tumble in starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment to a pace of 395,000 units. But construction of singe-family housing units, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 4.1% to a rate of 1.021 million units.
Groundbreaking activity rose in the West and Midwest, but fell in the South and Northeast.

Permits for future homebuilding dropped 0.9% to a rate of 1.470 million units in August. Single-family building permits increased 6.0% to a rate of 1.036 million units. Multi-family building permits decreased 14.2% to a rate of 434,000 units.

Investing.com -- Initial claims for jobless benefits continued their painfully slow decline last week, with the number of Americans filing for the first time falling less than expected to 860,000. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised up its figure for the previous week to 893,000 from 884,000 originally reported.
The number of continuing jobless claims, by contrast, fell by more than 900,000 to 12.628 million, its lowest since the first surge in joblessness caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the spring. However, the BLS's most comprehensive measure of total unemployment, which includes those claiming under the two pandemic-related assistance schemes, rose again to 29.77 million as of August 29, the last week for which data are available. That's an increase of 98,000 from the previous week.
There have been suggestions, not least from California Governor Gavin Newsom, that a large part of the recent rise in claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance have been fraudulent, with claimants exploiting past data breaches across the U.S. to file unjustified claims.
Elsewhere, data from the housing market showed that sector of the economy cooling off after three months of an extremely strong rebound. Housing starts in August fell by more than expected to 1.416 million, while building permits fell slightly to 1.47 million, disappointing hopes for a rise to 1.52 million.
The housing market has been one of the bright spots of the U.S. economy's recovery since the second quarter, propelled by falling rates for remortgaging and by the desire of many cash-rich city-dwellers to escape to the suburbs in anticipation of a future where working from home will be more widespread.
The National Association of Home Builders housing market index, which tracks the level of sales rather than prices, rose to an all-time high of 83, according to a release from the NAHB on Wednesday."

Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 0.4% month-on-month in August for a -0.2% year-on-year decline, Eurostat said, in line with its own earlier estimate and market expectations.
Energy prices which fell 7.8% year-on-year in August had the biggest impact on the overall consumer price index, subtracting 0.77 percentage point from the final number. 
Non-energy industrial goods pulled the index a further 0.03 percentage point lower, offsetting the 0.33 point positive contribution from food alcohol and tobacco and 0.30 point from services.
Without the volatile food and energy prices, or what the European Central Bank calls core inflation, prices fell 0.5% on the month for a 0.6% annual increase, as expected by economists polled by Reuters. This is a deceleration from 1.3% year-on-year growth in July.
An even narrower measure of inflation which also excludes alcohol and tobacco prices, fell 0.6% month-on-month for a 0.4% year-on-year increase, slowing from 1.2% growth in July.

The ECB wants to keep inflation below, but close to 2% over the medium term and watches the core inflation measure closely in its policy decisions.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's jobless rate unexpectedly slipped from a 22-year high in August as employment surged past expectations helped by part-time work, but the economic toll from the pandemic has hit young job seekers hard.
The country's overall jobless rate fell to 6.8% in August as employment skyrocketed by 111,000, Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data showed on Thursday. That was better than economists' forecasts of 7.7% and a 50,000 fall in jobs in a Reuters poll.
But the figures were less positive for 15 to 24 year olds, with the unemployment rate now hovering near 20%, more than three times the national tally. During the 2008/09 global financial crisis, the rate was 10%-12%.
""These people are at risk of being the forgotten victims of COVID, if policy doesn't address youth unemployment,"" said Matthew Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual.
Higher welfare dependency, significant loss to economy and social issues are some of the side effects of high and rising youth unemployment, Sherwood added.
Jemish Lakhani, who is studying for a Masters degree in accounting from the University of Wollongong in Sydney, concurs with Sherwood. 
""Everyday I fear if I'd ever find a job. I have zero experience in accounting,"" says Lakhani who will graduate next year. 
Lakhani, an international student from India, has been struggling to make ends meet since losing his part-time job at a restaurant in May. 
He has since signed up to deliver food via UberEats and spends most of his afternoons near a busy restaurant strip in Sydney's west.
""Business has been lukewarm"", he said. ""The money is alright but there are days when I wait for hours outside a restaurant to make just A$20 ($14.6).""
Thursday's data showed a majority of the job surge in August employment was led by those like Lakhani who are sole traders or ""non-employees as the hours worked only inched up a paltry 0.1%.
POOR PRINT
""It is fair to infer that many of those new workers hardly worked for many hours. That leaves us describing this as a poor employment print,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) economist Phil Odonaghoe.
The Australian dollar , which pared losses after the data, soon slipped into negative territory to last stand at $0.7279.
Lakhani is among the tens of thousands in Australia who lost their jobs to the pandemic with little hope of finding work though the economy reopened earlier than expected.
Rising unemployment is becoming a headache for the federal government which is pushing states to ease regional shutdowns and open up internal borders as new COVID-19 cases ease.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg delivers the federal budget on Oct. 6 where he is expected to announce some policies to help youth while also expanding its broader A$300 billion fiscal support.
One reason young people are taking the brunt of the economic fallout is that retail and hospitality sectors - which employ 45% of young people compared with 27% of other age groups - have been crippled by COVID-induced lockdowns.
The situation is dire for those not eligible for government welfare payments.
Sydney resident Daniella Youkhana, 32, was made redundant from full-time work last month but she is not eligible for government support because of her redundancy package.

""That money is small, it's not going to last me long,"" said Youkhana, who has since applied for more than 20 jobs without success. ""I even applied for a shelf-stacking job at the supermarket but got denied. It's quite tough out there.""

In July, new car registrations dropped by 3.7% year-on-year to 1,281,740 vehicles in the European Union, Britain and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, statistics from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) showed.
Sales fell by 17.6% in August to 884,394 vehicles, when all countries in the region, except Cyprus, recorded losses compared to the previous year. Registrations in Germany and France fell sharply while they edged down in Italy, the data showed.

709,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 10:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand’s central bank said a stress test it ran on lenders to assess their resilience to economic shocks supports its decision to require bigger capital buffers.
While all banks would survive a downturn that might occur once every 50 to 75 years, their capital levels would fall below minimum requirements when faced with a 1-in-200 year event, the Reserve Bank said Thursday in Wellington. The test “illustrates the benefit and necessity of shoring up bank capital in the good times to provide resilience,” the RBNZ said. “The Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated that large shocks can occur with very little warning.”
The RBNZ decided at the end of last year to increase capital requirements for banks, but delayed implementation of the new rules until July 2021 after the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic. It is now considering whether a further delay is warranted as it encourages banks to keep lending during the economic slump.
A decision is due by Nov. 25, when the bank publishes its next Financial Stability Report.
“All options are on the table,” Head of Financial System Policy and Analysis Toby Fiennes told a media briefing today. “We do not want the banks to be challenged at meeting higher levels of capital while we also want them to use the buffers that they have to support the economy through their lending. In an ideal world, Covid would have hit after they built up those buffers.”
The original plan called for banks to increase buffers over seven years. The largest lenders, which are all Australian-owned, would need to raise their level of high-quality Tier-1 capital to 16% of risk-weighted assets, amounting to a total of about NZ$20 billion ($13 billion).
If the RBNZ presses ahead, it will be asking banks to increase capital at a time when their profits may be eroded by historically low interest rates. The RBNZ is buying bonds to reduce borrowing costs during the recession, and has said it may take its benchmark rate into negative territory next year.
“The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic provides a stark reminder to us all of the importance of being prepared for the unexpected, especially when you are a systemically important bank at the core of New Zealand’s financial system,” Deputy Governor Geoff Bascand said in a statement with the stress test results. “The more capital a bank holds, the better it can weather economic storms and meet customer needs during tough times like now.”
The central bank instructed banks earlier this year to suspend dividend payments during the Covid crisis.
“The results of this stress test supports decisions that were made as part of the Capital Review to increase bank capital levels,” the RBNZ said today. “The findings will help to inform Reserve Bank decisions on the timing of the implementation of the Capital Review, and any changes to current dividend restrictions.”

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand fell into its deepest economic slump on record in the second quarter as its battle against the coronavirus pandemic paralysed business activity, official data showed on Thursday.
Gross domestic product contracted a seasonally adjusted 12.2% quarter-on-quarter, its sharpest quarterly contraction on record and largely in line with forecasts of a 12.8% decline from economists polled by Reuters. GDP fell 12.4% year-on-year.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand had forecast a quarterly and annual GDP decline of 14% in its August statement.
Growth has been hit by a standstill in economic activity as a strict nationwide coronavirus lockdown in April and parts of May forced almost everyone to stay at home and businesses to shut.
The GDP data confirms New Zealand's worst recession, defined as two straight quarters of contraction, since 2010, with GDP in the March quarter falling 1.6%.
In comparison, second quarter economic growth in neighbouring Australia which enforced a less stringent COVID-19 lockdown fell 7.0%, while the United States recorded a 9.1% drop.
But economists say New Zealand will bounce back faster, while other nations are still struggling to contain the coronavirus.
""We expect the June quarter’s record-breaking GDP decline to be followed by a record-breaking rise in the September quarter,"" said Westpac Senior Economist Michael Gordon. 
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government, which faces an election on Oct. 17, has said success in suppressing the virus locally is likely to help recovery prospects.
Treasury forecasts released on Wednesday showed that while New Zealand's response to COVID-19 helped lessen the short-term economic shock, massive debt and continuing disruptions will delay a full recovery.

Economists say the GDP data will have little impact on the central bank's policy, which is expected to hold interest rates at a record low of 0.25% at its meeting on Sept. 23.

713,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 07:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand suffered its worst economic slump since the Great Depression in the second quarter as a strict nationwide lockdown to combat the coronavirus brought the country to a standstill.
Gross domestic product plunged 12.2% from the first quarter, Statistics New Zealand said Thursday in Wellington. That’s the biggest three-month contraction since quarterly records began in 1977. Economists forecast a 12.5% decline. From a year earlier, the economy shrank 12.4%, the most recorded in comparable official data dating back to 1955.
New Zealand is going through a sharper but shorter economic shock than it experienced during the depression, when GDP fell 5.3% in 1931 and a further 7.1% in 1932, according to academic research. Nor is the Covid slump as bad as initially feared. The South Pacific nation succeeded in eliminating community spread of the virus, allowing it to emerge early from lockdown, and indicators suggest growth surged in the third quarter as consumers went on a spending spree.
However, the real pain may still lie ahead. The border remains closed to foreigners, crippling the tourism industry, and the end of the government’s wage subsidy is expected to see unemployment rise.
The New Zealand dollar was little changed at 67.36 U.S. cents after the release.
Today’s report confirms the first recession -- defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline -- since 2010. GDP fell a revised 1.4% in the first quarter of the year, the statistics agency said.
The data are unlikely to dent Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s chances of winning a second term in the Oct. 17 election. Ardern is riding high in the polls after her deft handling of the pandemic.
New Zealand’s seven-week lockdown began in the final week of March and ended in May. While a fresh community outbreak of Covid-19 in mid-August required a second lockdown in largest city Auckland, the country has fared better than many of its peers who still don’t have the virus under control.
U.K. GDP plummeted 20.4% in the second quarter from the first and 21.7% from a year earlier. In the U.S., the economy shrank 9.5% in the quarter, a drop that equals an annualized pace of 32.9%, its sharpest downturn since at least the 1940s.
Australia’s economy shrank less -- 7% in the quarter and 6.3% in the year -- but it is not expected to enjoy the same bounce back in activity in the third quarter that New Zealand is experiencing.
The government has pledged NZ$62 billion ($42 billion) of fiscal support to help revive domestic demand and protect jobs, while the central bank has slashed interest rates and embarked on quantitative easing to drive down borrowing costs. Reserve Bank policy makers are considering taking interest rates negative to further nurse the economy through the downturn.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending slowed in August, with a key retail sales gauge unexpectedly declining, as extended unemployment benefits were cut for millions of Americans, offering more evidence that the economic recovery from the COVID-19 recession was faltering.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday ramped up pressure on the White House and Congress to restart stalled negotiations for another fiscal package. At least 29.6 million people are on unemployment benefits. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. 
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates near zero, noting that the pandemic ""will continue to weigh on economic activity"" in the near term, ""and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.""
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters more fiscal support is likely to be needed.
""Consumers are being increasingly cautious with their spending,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""If Congress is unable to extend fiscal aid to households in the coming weeks, the economy will be particularly susceptible to a cutback in consumer spending, especially from the lowest-income families.""
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services dipped 0.1% last month after a downwardly revised 0.9% increase in July. These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were previously reported to have advanced 1.4% in July. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core retail sales rising 0.5% in August. Overall retail sales increased 0.6% in August, in part as sales at restaurants and bars continued to recover. Data for July was revised down to show retail sales increasing 0.9% instead of 1.2% as previously reported.
Retail sales account for the goods component of consumer spending, with services such as healthcare, education, travel and hotel accommodation making up the other portion. Services have been hardest hit by the coronavirus, which plunged the economy into recession in February, and spending on services remains about 10% below the pre-pandemic level. 
U.S. stocks were trading higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S Treasury prices were lower.
SLOWDOWN BROADENING
The retail sales report followed data this month suggesting the labor market was losing speed after astounding employment gains in May and June as businesses reopened after being shuttered in mid-March to control the spread of the coronavirus. 
Job growth slowed further in August and new applications for unemployment benefits remained perched at extraordinarily high levels in early September. At the same time, manufacturing is also showing signs of tiring, with output slowing last month.
A $600 weekly unemployment subsidy expired in July. It was replaced by a $300 weekly supplement, which was not available in all states, and funds for the program are expected to run out this month. Economists estimated that the reduced unemployment benefits supplement cut income by about $70 billion in August.
Government money was credited for the sharp turnaround in economic activity that started in May. Still, consumer spending is expected to rebound strongly in the third quarter because of robust momentum in core retail sales at the tail end of the April-June quarter. 
Consumer spending suffered a record collapse in the second quarter. The pullback in core retail sales in August, if sustained, would set up consumer spending on a slower growth path in the fourth quarter. Growth estimates for the third quarter top a 30% annualized rate. The economy contracted at a historic 31.7% pace in the April-June quarter.
""We have concerns about how strong the recovery will be in the fourth quarter and our optimistic 7.0% real GDP growth looks on increasingly shaky ground unless more jobless workers can find a place in this economy,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The slowdown in spending last month was underscored by a 5.7% drop in sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Receipts at food and beverage stores fell 1.2%, while online and mail-order retail sales were flat. 
Sales at electronics and appliance stores rose just 0.8% after surging 20.7% in July. Receipts at auto dealerships rebounding 0.2% after falling 1.0% in July. 
While sales at clothing outlets gained 2.9%, they remained 20% below the February level. Receipts at restaurants and bars rose 4.7%. Though sales at these establishments accounted for a chunk of overall retail sales last month, they were still more than 16% below their pre-pandemic level. 
Sales at building material stores rebounded 2.0% and receipts at furniture outlets rose 2.1%. The strength in these categories likely reflects a resilient housing market, which is being boosted by historically low mortgage rates and the migration to suburbs and lower-density areas as more workers continue to operate from home because of the pandemic.

A report on Wednesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders rose to a record high in September.

Investing.com – The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday, and reiterated that monetary policy would remain accommodative for a prolonged period to support the economy's ongoing recovery.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25%.
The unchanged decision comes just weeks after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell unveiled the central bank's average inflation targeting regime, designed to allow inflation to overshoot its 2% target in an effort to achieve long-term price stability. The move has raised expectations that rates could be held near zero for longer than would have been the case under the Fed's previous target, with some market participants forecasting no rate hikes for some time.
The latest economic projections from the Fed appear to support expectations for rates to remain lower for longer, with policymakers backing the central bank to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.1% through 2023. 
Many argue that the Fed had raised rates too quickly in the Financial Crisis era, on expectations that inflation would eventually trend toward target, underpinned by a hot labor market. The new approach seeks to avoid a repeat of inflation running below target for a prolonged period.
""With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent,"" The Fed said in a statement. ""(I)t will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.""
The Fed's pledge to keep rates near zero and persist with asset purchases has helped support an uptick in economic activity.
The central bank expects the economy to contract by 3.7% in 2020, compared with an estimate for a 6.5% decline previously. But growth in 2021 and 2022 was revised lower to 4% and 3% from 5% and 3.5% respectively.
The stimulus measures have spurred a rebound in the pace of inflation and the labor market, which currently tracking above expectations.
Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%, while core PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, came in at 1.3%.
In the wake of the stronger data, the Fed revised its unemployment rate forecasts for the year to 7.6%, down from 9.3% previously. While inflation is expected to pick up pace and reach 1.2% by year-end, up from a previous forecast of 0.8%.
Looking ahead, the bank sees unemployment falling to 4.6% by 2022, down from a prior estimate of 5.5% previously.  While inflation for 2021 and 2022 was revised higher to 1.7% and 1.8% from 1.6% and 1.7% respectively, but is set for a faster climb to about 2% in 2023.
The Fed’s balance sheet has increased in recent weeks to over $7 trillion, nearing the June peak of about $7.2 trillion."

(Reuters) - Slower-than-expected sales at retailers in August suggest a speed bump is emerging in the U.S. economic recovery from coronavirus lockdowns, less than two months before the Nov. 3 presidential election. 
Overall, retail sales have returned to their pre-crisis levels and then some, gaining 0.6% in August, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. The rebound plays into U.S. President Donald Trump's narrative of resurgent growth after a sharp pandemic downturn. Incumbent presidents are generally helped at the polls by a strong economy, and hurt by a weak one.
But last month's rise was driven in part by an increase in gasoline prices, not typically a cause for consumer celebration. Meanwhile core retail sales, a closer measure of underlying spending trends, fell 0.1% last month. Both readings fell short of economists' expectations.
GRAPHIC: A rebound, then sideways? - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY-RETAILSALES/azgpoamerpd/ 
Back-to-school shopping season, or the lack of it, was one cause. Many students actually could not head back to the classroom because of COVID-19 restrictions, and their curbed spending on supplies helped drive down core retail spending, said Regions Financial Corp (NYSE:RF) economist Richard Moody. Meanwhile, a jump in sales at restaurants and bars drove most of the gain in overall retail sales. 
The softening comes as nearly 30 million Americans are on some form of unemployment insurance. An extra $600 weekly that out-of-work-adults were getting in government aid expired at the end of July; it was replaced by a program that sent out $300 payments, but stopped taking new applicants on Sept. 10.
Lawmakers have so far failed to agree to any new aid package, and without more fiscal help, economists say the recovery will stall. 

""The economy is weak: there are no two sides around that,"" says Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB). Part of a voter's calculus in picking a president may be, ""Do you think additional stimulus is necessary, and if so what do you want that to look like?""

Business inventories edged up 0.1% in July after declining 1.1% in June, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Inventories, a key component of gross domestic product, had dropped for six straight months. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast business stocks gaining 0.1% in July.
Retail inventories rebounded 1.2% in July as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 2.7% decrease in June. Goods imports soared a record 12.3% in July, the government reported last month.
Motor vehicle inventories increased 2.7% rather than 2.5% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.6% as estimated last month.
An inventory drawdown contributed to GDP declining at a record 31.7% annualized rate in the second quarter. Inventories subtracted 3.5 percentage points from GDP, the most since the first quarter of 1988. Inventories have declined for five straight quarters. The economy fell into recession is February.
Wholesale inventories fell 0.3% in July. Stocks at manufacturers dropped 0.5%. 

Business sales increased 3.2% in July after shooting up 8.6% in June. At July's sales pace, it would take 1.33 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.37 months in June.

The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) rose five points to an all-time high of 83 this month, data showed on Wednesday. A reading above 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as good than poor. 
Builders, however, remained concerned about rising costs for materials and delivery delays, especially for lumber.
""Lumber prices are now up more than 170 percent since mid-April, adding more than $16,000 to the price of a typical new single-family home,"" said NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz.
""That said, the suburban shift for home building is keeping builders busy, supported on the demand side by low interest rates. In another sign of this growing trend, builders in other parts of the country have reported receiving calls from customers in high-density markets asking about relocating.""
The housing market has pushed ahead despite nearly 30 million people being on unemployment benefits. Economists say unemployment has disproportionately affected low-wage workers, who are typically renters. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.86%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).

The HMI survey's current sales conditions index rose four points to 88 this month. The component measuring sales expectations in the next six months increased six points to 84 and the measure of prospective buyers jumped nine points to 73.

720,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. retail sales rose less than forecast in August as the expiration of supplemental jobless benefits weighed on incomes and spending despite solid employment gains.
The value of overall sales increased 0.6% after a downwardly revised 0.9% increase the prior month, Commerce Department figures showed Wednesday. So-called control group sales, which exclude food services, car dealers, building-materials stores and gasoline stations, fell 0.1%, also missing estimates. The measure is often considered more reflective of underlying consumer demand.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for the overall measure to increase 1% from the prior month.
With many more stores and restaurants now open, the initial boost in spending driven by reopenings is moderating. At the same time, the expiration of the supplemental $600 weekly payments at the end of July as well as slowdowns in back-to-school spending likely weighed on retail activity during the month.
Those benefits bolstered incomes during the pandemic, and without them, millions of unemployed Americans will have significantly less cash to support the nation’s retailers. Lawmakers appear increasingly unlikely to approve additional stimulus until after the election, despite still-elevated joblessness.
Nine out of 13 major categories increased in August, led by restaurants, clothing stores and furniture outlets. Receipts at motor vehicle and parts dealers posted a modest gain, while sales at nonstore retailers barely improved. Sporting goods and hobby stores posted the biggest percentage decline from the prior month and receipts at department stores weakened. Grocery store sales fell as well.
With total retail sales data above pre-pandemic levels, the data underscore a shift in where consumers are spending their money. Some categories, like restaurants and clothing stores, are still below year-ago levels. Meanwhile, purchases at nonstore retailers are up 22.4% from August of last year.
Retail sales don’t capture all consumer spending though, and the pandemic continues to have a clear impact on services outlays. While the value of retail receipts exceeded February levels back in June, personal consumption -- which includes spending on goods and services -- was still below its pre-pandemic level in July, the latest available data. The Commerce Department will release the August figures Oct. 1.
Another factor to keep in mind is the Lost Wages Assistance program. That’s the program President Donald Trump authorized in early August to temporarily offset part of the income gap unemployed Americans faced after the expiration of the extra $600 in weekly benefits. However, rollout of the program has been patchy across states.

Investing.com -- U.S. retail sales grew at the slowest rate in four months in August, as spending tailed off in the wake of the expiry of enhanced unemployment benefits at the end of July.
The Commerce Department said that overall retail sales grew only 0.6% in August from July, rather than the 1.0% rise expected. July's rise of 1.2% was also revised down to 0.9%. Growth in core retail sales, a series that excludes automobiles, also slowed to 0.7% from a downwardly revised 1.3% a month earlier. 
The news is consistent with other data showing that the economic rebound has lost dynamism in recent weeks after bouncing sharply from the lows of the second quarter. U.S. industrial production and manufacturing output also slowed in August, according to figures released on Tuesday.  The news comes only hours before the Federal Reserve announces the results of its latest two-day policy meeting.

LONDON (Reuters) - A hefty drop in meal prices, spurred by Britain's scheme to support the hospitality sector through the COVID-19 pandemic, helped to push inflation down last month to its lowest rate in almost five years.
Consumer prices rose by 0.2% in annual terms in August, the smallest increase since December 2015 and a sharp slowdown from July's 1.0% increase, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 0.0%.
Discounts for more than 100 million meals were claimed Last month through the government's ""Eat Out to Help Out"" programme, which offered diners a state-funded price reduction of up to 10 pounds ($12.89).
While this prompted an unusually large fall in the rate of inflation, the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy and a coming surge in unemployment look likely to keep consumer prices in check.
Prices in restaurants and cafes were down 2.6% compared with August last year, their first fall since records began in 1989.
Falls in air fares and a smaller-than-usual rise in clothes prices also helped to push annual inflation down.
""While we expect an initial bounce-back in inflation in September, as the 'Eat Out to Help Out' scheme comes to an end, overall inflation is likely to remain well below the Bank of England's target for some time,"" said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG.
The consumer price index has now been below the BoE's target for 13 months in a row.
Most economists polled by Reuters think sharply rising unemployment and a slowing recovery will prompt the BoE to pump more stimulus into the economy before the end of this year. 
The ONS said eight items in its inflation basket were still unavailable to its price collectors, reflecting things that remain off-limits such as tickets to the theatre, soccer matches and horse racing, and catering for more than 50 people.
In April, during the most stringent period of the lockdown, 90 items had been unavailable.
There were already signs that inflation pressure would remain weak.
Factory output prices fell for the fifth month in a row in annual terms - the longest such run in four years - as weaker oil prices pushed them down by 0.9%.
Excluding oil and other volatile components, core factory output prices showed no change in annual terms, their weakest showing in nearly five years.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports posted a double-digit slump for a sixth straight month in August as U.S.-bound shipments shrank due to a global demand slowdown from the coronavirus pandemic, casting a shadow over a trade-led recovery from the deep recession.
The export decline highlights the immense task Yoshihide Suga, who is assured to be elected prime minister later on Wednesday, faces in driving an economic recovery.
Total exports fell 14.8% year-on-year in August, a smaller decline than the 16.1% expected by economists in a Reuters poll, official data showed on Wednesday.
That meant exports fell for their 21st straight month, marking the longest run of declines since a 23-month run through July 1987. That followed a 19.2% drop in the previous month.
The decline in August was driven by fewer shipments of cars and mineral fuels, though the pace of contraction eased somewhat from July as economic activity showed signs of picking up.
""Strong demand for ICT technology linked to working from home resulted in exports of electric machinery only falling 5.5% year-on-year,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""However, export volumes may not reach pre-virus levels until early-2022,"" he said in a note.
Suga, who won a ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership election on Monday, will face a huge challenge to get the economy back on track after it posted its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter.
By region, shipments to the United States - Japan's key market - fell 21.3% in the year to August, weighed heavily by declines in engine parts and construction machinery.
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 5.1% year-on-year in August, helped by a sharp increase in shipments of semiconductors, the data showed.
That marked the second straight monthly rise in China-bound shipments, which showed signs of picking up, a finance ministry official said.
Exports to the rest of Asia declined 7.8%, weighed by shrinking exports of iron and steel products.
Overall imports fell 20.8% in the year to August, versus the median estimate for an 18.0% decrease.

As a result, the trade balance came to a surplus of 248.3 billion yen ($2.36 billion), versus the median estimate for a 37.5 billion yen shortfall.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory production increased for a fourth straight month in August, but the recovery is showing signs of strain, suggesting business investment in equipment could remain depressed through the end of the year as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on.
The report from the Federal Reserve on Tuesday added to data on the labor market that has indicated a stall in overall economic activity because of the coronavirus' persistence and fading fiscal stimulus. The ebbing economic recovery, accompanied by warming inflation, is likely to dominate the U.S. central bank's two-day policy meeting, which started on Tuesday. 
""It is looking increasingly like the recovery in factory production will stall in coming months if no one from Washington is going to ride to the rescue with another pandemic stimulus package,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The coronavirus has made the public cautious and this uncertainty is keeping factories from opening back up completely."" 
Manufacturing production rose 1.0% last month after advancing 3.9% in July. The Fed noted that ""the gains for most manufacturing industries have gradually slowed since June."" Factory output remains 6.7% below its February level. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output would rise 1.2% in August. 
Government financial aid to businesses and the unemployed has virtually dried up, and talks on another package are at an impasse. At least 29.6 million people were on unemployment benefits in August. Government money was credited for the sharp rebound in economic activity. Cheaper crude oil because of the pandemic is also hurting oilfield services and equipment firms.
The International Energy Agency on Tuesday slashed its 2020 oil demand forecast, warning ""the outlook appears even more fragile.""
Brent crude is trading around $40 a barrel. Business spending on equipment has declined for five straight quarters.
A separate report from the New York Fed on Tuesday showed manufacturing conditions in New York state improving further in September, but the lingering virus was seen restricting activity.
""Weak demand, supply chain disruptions, and fears of a virus resurgence will weigh on the manufacturing sector's recovery until a health solution is discovered and broadly available,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Stocks on Wall Street rose as investors looked for more stimulus from the Fed. The dollar (DXY) was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
AUTO PRODUCTION FALLS
Last month, production of long-lasting manufactured goods increased 0.7%. Motor vehicle production, however, dropped 3.7% after accelerating 31.7% in July. There were increases in the output of machinery, furniture, computer and electronic products as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components, goods that complement life under the pandemic.
Production of apparel and leather products increased as did the output of plastics and rubber goods. 
The rise in manufacturing offset declines in both mining and utilities output, lifting industrial production 0.4% in August. Industrial output rose 3.5% in July.
Mining production fell 2.5% in August as Tropical Storm Marco and Hurricane Laura caused what the Fed said were ""sharp but temporary"" drops in oil and gas extraction and well drilling on the Gulf Coast. Utilities output fell 0.4%, with small decreases in both electric and gas utilities. 
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, increased to 70.2% in August from 69.5% in July. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector ticked up to 71.4% from 71.1% in July. It is 8.4 percentage points below its 1972-2019 average.
Officials at the U.S. central bank tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy - how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.
A third report on Tuesday from the Labor Department showed import prices rose 0.9% in August as the costs of goods increased broadly after accelerating 1.2% in July. Economists had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, would increase 0.5% in August. 
The rise in import prices mirrored further gains in both consumer and producer prices in August. But these developments are unlikely to have an impact on monetary policy as the Fed last month rewrote its framework, putting new emphasis on the labor market and less on worries about too-high inflation.
Last month, prices for imported fuels and lubricants rose 3.3% after advancing 15.1% in July. Imported food prices rebounded 0.4% in August after dropping 0.9% in the prior month.
Excluding fuels and food, import prices accelerated 0.7% last month, the largest gain since April 2011, after rising 0.3% in July. The so-called core import prices shot up 0.9% in the 12 months through August. Further gains are likely, with the dollar falling about 3.6% against the currencies of the United States' major trading partners since June.
""While a few industries are experiencing production bottlenecks, there are wide swathes of unused capacity throughout the economy, which will restrain inflation in the near term,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. median household income hit a record high in 2019 and the poverty rate fell, according to a government survey released on Tuesday that offered a snapshot of the economy before millions of American jobs were destroyed by the coronavirus pandemic.
The U.S. Census Bureau said real median household income jumped 6.8% from $64,324 in 2018 to $68,703 last year - the highest since the agency began tracking the data in 1967.
It also said the nation's poverty rate fell last year to 10.5%, a 1.3-percentage-point drop. Another measure of poverty that adjusts for government aid programs for low-income Americans showed a drop to 11.7% last year from 12.8% in 2018.
At the same time, however, the number of people without health insurance for at least part of the year hit 29.6 million, up one million from the year before. The number of uninsured children also grew.
The report offered a look back at the state of the economy before the novel coronavirus outbreak hit the United States early this year, shuttering many businesses as the country sought to contain the pandemic. 
Since then, more than 6.5 million people in the United States have contracted the highly contagious virus and more than 194,000 have died. Vast swaths of the economy were devastated and 22 million Americans were thrown out of work.
While activity is now rebounding, economists warn that the recovery may be uneven as federal stimulus money runs out with no signs of replenishment from Washington. A potential second wave of COVID-19 infections this autumn and winter as people move back indoors also looms large.
President Donald Trump, who had staked his re-election on economic gains before the outbreak, has downplayed impact of the virus and the risk of another wave, as he has urged states to fully re-open. He has also repeatedly touted gains on Wall Street - a narrow gauge of economic performance - and pledged to rebuild the economy if he wins a second term. 
His Democratic rival in the Nov. 3 election, former Vice President Joe Biden, has said the gains since COVID-19 emerged have been uneven and have left many segments of the working population still reeling.
""Those at the top see things going up. But those in the middle and below see things getting worse. And we have leaders who bear false witness, want us to believe that our country isn't gone off track,"" Biden said on Monday.
A Reuters/Ispos poll in late August showed American's support for Trump's handling of the economy has slipped. 
The income and poverty data for 2019, the last year of the economic expansion following the 2007-2009 Great Recession, ""do not reflect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or the current recession,"" Census' Social, Economic and Housing Statistics Division chief David Waddington told reporters on a conference call.

Census officials and private economists cautioned that the COVID-19 outbreak impacted data collection as the agency suspended in-person interviews earlier this year.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Debt-laden Turkish companies are seeking more time to repay bank loans after the coronavirus pandemic upended plans to sell assets, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
Even before the virus hit Turkey in March, firms were seeking lower rates from banks after an aggressive monetary easing campaign and since then, large and small companies are looking for further revisions to nearly all of the restructurings agreed in the past two years, according to one of the sources.
Conglomerate Dogus was among the companies preparing for talks, according to the source, who requested anonymity.
In response to a query from Reuters, Dogus said: ""Our regular and usual negotiations with banks are, as always, underway within the framework of good relations.""
Other restructuring talks involving major companies are already happening, the source said.
Businesses in Turkey, like counterparts in other parts of the world, have been hit hard by lockdowns to try and stop the spread of the virus with the economy shrinking nearly 10% in the second quarter.
But Turkish companies were already weakened by a 2018 currency crisis and some, including Dogus, Yildiz and several energy firms signed billions of dollars worth of restructuring deals.
Asset sales were a key part of some of those restructuring agreements but the impact of the coronavirus crisis has deterred some would-be buyers, the sources said.
Turkish conglomerate and food giant Yildiz Holding last month announced a revision in which it said it paid off $600 million for its syndication credit and extended the maturity to 2030.
The company declined to comment for this story. 
In February, Reuters reported some conglomerates, including Dogus and Yildiz, were in talks for cheaper loans after the central bank cut rates from 24% in mid-2019. The policy rate is now 8.25% but hikes could be in store given high inflation and a record low lira.

While M&A activity has largely stalled this year, some deals were struck including Zynga's (O:ZNGA) purchase of Turkish mobile-game maker Peak for $1.8 billion in June.

China, where the coronavirus first emerged late last year, introduced strict lockdowns and measures to curb its spread which are seen to have largely worked, as the country has largely reopened its economy and allowed normal life to resume.
The country's aviation capacity has snapped back to more than 90% of pre-pandemic levels, but the sector is still working hard to recover from the first half of the year, which saw the number of domestic tourists dropping 62% to 1.17 billion on year, and tourism revenue plummet 77%, according to government data. 
""We are relatively optimistic about the tourism economy in the latter half of 2020,"" the China Tourism Academy concluded. 
Zhou Weihong, vice general manager of Shanghai-based Spring Travel, said the impact of the pandemic on operations is huge.
""Before the cross-province travel ban was lifted in mid July, business was basically frozen for half a year,"" she said.
During the pandemic, self-rescue became the buzz word for travel companies which turned to live-streaming to hawk deals or came up with suburban travel packages and promotion campaigns to encourage consumers to travel. 
The report also pointed out that China's lower tier cities had increasingly become a popular choice for local tourists, and that they have contributed a larger proportion to domestic tourism consumption.

Investing.com – China continued to tread a robust path towards economic recovery from COVID-19 in August, with retails sales growing for the first time in 2020 and industrial output accelerating the fastest in eight months.
Data released earlier in the day by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that retail sales increased 0.5% year-on-year, beating the forecast 0.1% growth prepared by Investing.com and July’s contraction of 1.1%. Meanwhile, industrial production increased 5.6% year-on-year, beating both its own forecast 5.1% growth and the 4.8% growth seen in July.
August's unemployment rate was 5.6%, against July’s 5.7%.
The Chinese economy saw pent-up demand, government stimulus and exports that have been surprisingly resilient fuel its recovery from the COVID-19-induced paralysis seen at the beginning of the year. Recent data, including trade, producer prices and factory activity, also all pointed to a continuous recovery.
“We think that China’s economic recovery is on a reasonably firm footing now and should continue through Q4 and into 2021, with solid investment growth, gradually recovering consumption momentum and resilient exports,” Oxford Economics’ Louis Kuijs told Reuters.
Consumer confidence also continues to increase, with an uptick in sales of automobiles and duty-free shopping. Confidence has also been boosted by government stimulus measures, as well as measures to keep COVID-19 under control in the country.
“Fiscal and monetary policy stimulus should continue to support the recovery. But we expect the impact of policy stimulus to lose some punch with credit growth easing in Q4,” Kuijs said.
But some investors struck a cautionary note over simmering U.S.-China tension, which could escalate in the run-up to November’s U.S. presidential elections.
NBS spokesman Fu Linghui warned during a briefing that the current economic recovery remains unbalanced given the still-fragile consumption and heightened external risks.
“Externally, there are still many unstable and uncertain factors. On the domestic side, in the process of economic recovery, some industries and enterprises are still facing difficulties, and the recovery is unbalanced,” Fu said.
The number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, with over 29.1 million global cases as of September 15 according to Johns Hopkins University data. The possibility of fresh outbreaks in the winter are also increasing investor jitters."

Real estate investment in August rose 11.8% from a year earlier, quickening slightly from 11.7% seen in July, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday.
For January-August period, property investment grew 4.6% on an annual basis, faster than a 3.4% uptick in January-July.
China's property market was among the first to recover after the economy reopened this year, thanks to cheaper credit and a relaxation of urban residential curbs, with some analysts warning of a potential bubble in a handful of big cities.
But top government officials are keen to keep property prices in check, reiterating its overarching policy of ""houses are for living, not speculating"" and keeping most of its real estate curbs in cities across China in place. 
 Evergrande  (HK:3333), China's second-biggest property developer, stepped up price discounting this year to clear a growing pile of unsold homes. Property developers have faced sluggish demand in smaller cities as the pandemic hit people's incomes. 
Property sales by floor area rose 13.7% from a year earlier in August, faster than July's expansion of 9.5%, Reuters calculations showed.
However, growth in new construction starts measured by floor area eased to 2.4% in August, from the 11.3% increase in July.

Funds raised by China's property developers grew 3.0%, compared with a 0.8% growth for the first seven months of 2020.

735,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 09:15PM ET</span>","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand is set to record its sharpest quarterly contraction and officially enter recession when it releases second quarter economic data this week, reflecting the full impact of coronavirus lockdowns on business.
The median forecast of economists polled by Reuters showed GDP shrinking 12.8% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to June, following a 1.6% decline in the previous quarter.
That would put New Zealand in its first technical recession, defined as two straight quarters of contraction, since 2010, although an easing in coronavirus curbs has aided a quick recovery. GDP is expect to fall 13.3% year-on-year.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government, which faces an election on Oct. 17, has said there will be ""large drop"" in activity in the June quarter, but that success in suppressing the virus locally is likely to help recovery prospects.
New Zealand was the only country to stay free of COVID-19 for more than 100 days, largely due to a strict lockdown in April and some parts of May that forced almost everyone to stay at home and businesses to shut.
The measures battered economic activity, but it has since bounced back despite a second wave of infections in its biggest city, Auckland.
That has prompted some analysts to temper their gloomy forecasts, though they acknowledge the predictions are open to revisions as there was uncertainty around the measurement of data during the lockdown.
ANZ Bank cut its quarterly forecast to a 12% decline from 17.5%, but said the focus has shifted to the third quarter, which would bring ""the sharpest quarterly economic expansion we'll ever see.""
""Market forecasts have clearly been trending towards a smaller negative number in recent weeks, as the data showed that the economy bounced back readily from the lockdown,"" said Westpac Senior Economist Michael Gordon.

The central bank is expected to hold rates at its meeting on Sept 23 after re-affirming last month that the cash rate will remain at 0.25% until early 2021.

Reeve, previously the division's deputy director, replaces Thomas Laubach, who died earlier this month. 
Reeve, who holds a doctorate in economics from Harvard University, joined the Fed staff in 1998 and spent 16 years in the central bank's Division of International Finance, including a stint advising the U.S. Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund.
He served as an adviser to both former Fed Chair Janet Yellen and current Chair Jerome Powell, and as deputy of the monetary affairs group beginning in 2018, according to the board website.
In announcing the appointment, Powell said Reeve's advice had been ""indispensable"" to him, and cited his ""wealth of experience in policy analysis and in facilitating the monetary policymaking process.""
The staff of the Fed's Washington-based Board of Governors is organized into 12 divisions covering areas from research and statistics to financial stability and legal matters.
Monetary affairs is at the heart of the policymaking process, with 170 staff who help guide the Fed on fundamental decisions like interest rates, bondbuying, and communications. The group was central to a Fed strategic review that ended with a heightened central bank commitment to stronger job growth.

The trough of the recession was reached in the second quarter and the easing of lockdown measures since May led to a rapid recovery in industry and in some service sectors, the ministry said in its monthly report on Monday, adding that the revival has lost some steam lately though.
""The German economy is continuing to pick up, albeit at a more moderate pace,"" the ministry said.
Economists expect Europe's biggest economy to show a return to growth in the third quarter after a record 9.7% contraction in the second quarter as consumer spending, company investment and exports all collapsed.
The ministry said significant economic growth was likely in the third quarter thanks to impetus from May and June, when there were signs of a rebound.
It said exports remained far from their pre-coronavirus levels and while industrial production had returned to almost 90% of its pre-coronavirus level and was continuing to rise, it had lost some momentum.
Earlier this month, the German government revised upward its economic forecast for this year to a decline of 5.8% from a previously expected slump of 6.3%.
A temporary cut in Germany's value-added tax (VAT) as part of the government's stimulus package and a child bonus are also expected to boost domestic demand in the second half of the year, it added.

Average new home prices in 70 major cities climbed 0.6% in August from a month earlier, a touch better than a 0.5% increase in July, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday.
On an annual basis, home prices rose 4.8% in August, matching July's pace.
The property market has been a major driver in China's economic recovery, with home sales and investment growing at a robust pace in recent months after coronavirus lockdowns were lifted.
Yet policymakers remain wary about the risks of overheating, long one of the key balancing acts for authorities as they try to support a crucial sector of the economy without stoking excessive speculation. 
Since July, many major cities have imposed new restrictions on property transactions to arrest sharp price rises. Big provincial capitals Hangzhou and Shenyang also strengthened curbs on home purchases this month..
Most of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS reported monthly price increases for new homes, with the number unchanged from 59 in July.
Tier-3 cities reported the strongest monthly gains. Huizhou, a small city in China southern Guangdong province which is close to Shenzhen, was the top performer in August, notching up a monthly price increase of 1.9%.
Regulators said last month they would institute new rules to control liquidity in the real estate market and are looking to contain property developers' debt levels to reduce risks to the financial system.
That has prompted indebted developers to cut prices to spur sales and cashflow. Analysts expect more developers would initiate sales promotion in the coming months, dubbed ""Golden September, Silver October"", a traditional sales peak season.
""Going forward, price cuts and sales promotion would be the main theme,"" said Yan Yuejin, director of the Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution.
""We do not rule out possibility that the home price increase will continue to narrow.""

New home prices in 70 major cities, excluding state-subsidized housing, rose 0.56% last month, compared to a 0.47% gain in July, National Bureau of Statistics data released Monday showed. Values in the secondary market, which is largely free from government intervention, gained 0.34%, compared with 0.26% in July.

Policy makers have in recent months stepped up regulatory caution against developers’ leverage and excessive home-price growth, after frenetic buying spread from the country’s biggest cities to some booming regional centers. In August, cities including Nanjing and Wuxi followed Shenzhen in tightening home-purchase rules.
For now, a renewed fear of missing out on price increases and an urge to guard against anticipated inflation are sustaining housing demand. Credit growth rebounded more-than-expected in August as monetary-policy easing continues to take effect and support the recovery.
“So far, the property market is much stronger than our expectation,” Macquarie Securities Ltd.’s head of China economics Larry Hu said before the data release. “In the next few months, property sales may continue to recover.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's manufacturers remained pessimistic for the 14th straight month in September, and though the gloom eased somewhat the broad results of the Reuters Tankan survey pointed to a painfully slow recovery for the coronavirus-stricken economy.
The result underlines the huge challenge the country's next leader succeeding Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will face to boost growth and corporate and consumer sentiment after the economy sunk into its deepest recession on record.
Monday's poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched ""tankan"" quarterly survey, showed manufacturers' morale mirrored frail sales in key sectors such as auto and the construction industry.
""Sales for cars as well as construction machinery are not recovering,"" a manager of a transportation equipment maker wrote in the Reuters poll of 485 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 256 firms replied on condition of anonymity.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers inched up to minus 29 in September from minus 33 in the previous month, still deeply pessimistic even though it marked the least gloomiest level in six months.
The materials industries such as steel, nonferrous metals, textiles and paper put a drag on the overall sentiment index.
The service-sector index stood at minus 18, up from minus 23 in August, but sentiment among wholesalers, transport and utilities weighed on broad business confidence.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means that pessimists outnumber optimists.
The BOJ will hold its next policy review on Sept. 16-17, and release its next ""tankan"" survey results on Oct. 1.
The central bank was expected to offer a brighter view next week on the economy, output and exports than in July to signal that they were starting to recover from the COVID-19 crisis, sources familiar with its thinking said.
A manager at a machinery maker in the Reuters Tankan survey said that a sharp drop in demand from weak corporate activity due to virus-induced lockdown measures appeared to have bottomed out. ""A recovery will take time,"" the manager said.
Manufacturers' sentiment was seen recovering further to minus 19 in December, while that of service-sector firms was expected to tick up to minus 17.
""Our corporate performance is improving but it's unclear how long it will hold up,"" said another manager, at a rubber company said.

The Mexican economy has been especially hard hit by the pandemic, with health authorities confirming on Friday that the official death toll has surpassed 70,000, the fourth highest number of deaths globally.
The economy is seen contracting by up to 13% this year, the deepest downturn since the 1930s-era Great Depression.
Despite the modest August job gains, following several months of losses, the labor market has bled 833,100 formal jobs so far this year, according to IMSS data.
Formal jobs stem from contracts and include defined pay and tax obligations, while informal jobs mostly operate in cash and outside the law.

Slightly more than half of Mexican workers are thought to be employed informally.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the U.S. federal budget deficit above $3 trillion for the first 11 months of fiscal 2020, more than doubling the previous full-year record, the U.S. Treasury said on Friday.
The budget deficit for August was $200 billion, matching the deficit in August 2019 but lower than the $245 billion forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. However, $55 billion worth of benefit payments were shifted into July because August started on a weekend.
The $3.007 trillion year-to-date deficit was nearly triple the $1.067 trillion deficit for the comparable year-ago period, spurred by a massive increase in government spending to battle the economic fallout from the pandemic.
The previous 11-month deficit record was $1.37 trillion, reported by the Treasury in August 2009 during the financial crisis and recession. The full fiscal 2009 deficit totaled $1.4 trillion.
Concerns about ballooning deficits have stoked opposition by some Republicans in Congress to spending trillions of dollars more on a new round of coronavirus aid programs. This has helped to stall negotiations between Democrats and the Trump administration.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has projected the full-year 2020 U.S. deficit to reach $3.3 trillion, or 16% of GDP, the highest share since the end of World War Two.
August budget outlays were $423 billion, compared with $428 billion in August 2019 and $626 billion in July 2020. Labor- related outlays, largely unemployment benefits, fell to $55 billion in August from $110 billion in July after a $600-a-week federal unemployment supplement expired on July 31.
Receipts in August were $223 billion, compared with $228 billion in the year-earlier period. While taxes collected from paycheck withholdings fell by $11 billion from a year earlier, non-withheld tax payments were up $4 billion due to a processing backlog from the delayed July 15 tax deadline, a Treasury official said.
Earnings from the Federal Reserve soared in August by $5 billion compared with a year earlier from earnings on the Fed's massively expanded bond holdings and lower interest payments on bank reserves.
The Treasury's interest costs on public debt rose $7 billion in August compared with a year earlier as borrowing expanded massively. But debt costs were $53 billion lower for the first 11 months of 2020 versus a year earlier due to lower interest rates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in August, with the cost of used cars and trucks accelerating by the most in more than 51 years likely as Americans shunned public transportation because of fears of contracting COVID-19. 
The report from the Labor Department on Friday also showed a firming in underlying inflation last month, putting fears of deflation to rest. Deflation, a decline in the general price level, is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices.
Still, stirring inflation is unlikely to discourage the Federal Reserve from pumping more money into the economy to aid the recovery from the COVID-19 recession amid considerable labor market slack. The U.S. central bank in August rewrote its framework, putting new emphasis on the labor market and less on worries about too-high inflation.
""Consumer prices are rebounding from the pandemic shock, but as supply shortages are resolved, upward price increases should moderate,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""The Fed's new policy objectives underscore that monetary policy will remain very accommodative for a considerable time."" 
The consumer price index increased 0.4% last month, also lifted by gains in the costs of gasoline, recreation and household furnishings and operations. The CPI advanced 0.6% in both June and July after falling in the prior three months as business closures to slow the spread of the coronavirus depressed demand.
In the 12 months through August, the CPI increased 1.3% after gaining 1.0% in the 12 months through July.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would rise 0.3% in August and climb 1.2% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI gained 0.4% last month after surging 0.6% in July, the largest gain since January 1991. A 5.4% jump in prices of used cars and trucks, the largest gain since March 1969, accounted for more than 40% of the rise in the so-called core CPI last month.
In the 12 months through August, the core CPI climbed 1.7% after rising 1.6% in July.
Though the Fed's embrace of what it calls ""flexible average inflation targeting"" is still shy of many details, in theory it could see policymakers tolerate price increases above its 2% target for a period of perhaps several years to offset years in which inflation was lodged below its goal.
Policymakers have expressed a range of ideas about how this might work in practice, but agree the aim is to let prices rise fast enough that household and businesses take their inflation target seriously. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 1.3% in the 12 months through July. August's core PCE price index data is scheduled to be released at the end of this month.
Some economists questioned the need for higher inflation as many households were struggling because of the pandemic.
""For the individual worker, rising inflation is not good news, no matter what the Fed thinks,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher after pulling back in the previous session. The dollar (DXY) was slightly lower against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose.
BROAD PRICE INCREASES
Though food prices rocketed at the height of the COVID-19 business shutdowns, inflation stayed muted as the pandemic undercut demand for services like healthcare, air travel, dining out and hotel accommodation. High unemployment is also keeping a lid on price pressures despite the Fed's extraordinarily easy monetary policy and record fiscal stimulus from the government.
Nearly 30 million people are on unemployment benefits. 
Last month, gasoline prices rose 2.0% after increasing 5.6% in July. Food prices edged up 0.1% after declining 0.4% in July, the first decrease since April 2019. The cost of food consumed at home fell 0.1% after dropping 1.1% in the prior month.
Consumers paid less for beef as its price dropped 4.4%. But prices of dairy products rose 1.5%. The cost of food consumed away from home rose again.
Housing inflation cooled further amid forbearance agreements between tenants and landlords and a government moratorium on evictions. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, nudged up 0.1%. That followed a 0.2% gain in July.
The cost of recreation rebounded 0.7% after falling in June and July. Prices for household furnishings and operations rose 0.9%, the largest increase since February 1991, likely due to more people working from home. Apparel prices rose 0.6%, advancing for a third straight month. The cost of motor vehicle insurance rose 0.5% and prices of airline fares increased 1.2%.

Healthcare costs gained 0.1% after rising 0.4% in July. But prescription medication prices fell 0.2%. New vehicle prices were unchanged. Education costs fell 0.3%, the first decline since the series started in 1993. Many schools and universities have shifted to online classes because of the pandemic.

(Reuters) - Consumer prices aren't rising fast enough to make inflation a major issue in the upcoming U.S. presidential election, the latest data from the Labor Department suggests. In fact, the trend upwards is a sign the economy is recovering.
Still, Americans in the market for a new couch or a used car got a sticker-price sting last month. 
The index for the price of used cars and trucks rose 5.4% in August from the previous month, the fastest in more than 51 years, the Labor Department reported on Friday. Household furnishings rose 0.9%, the biggest monthly increase since February 1991.
Overall, the consumer price index rose 0.4% in August from July, and 1.3% from a year earlier.
That's tame, and unlikely to sway voters as they weigh their options for the Nov. 3 election. 
Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan seized on double-digit inflation in his 1980 challenge to then-President Jimmy Carter, telling voters it ""robbed"" them of the ability to plan for the future, and Reagan won in a landslide. 
Today, with the unemployment rate high and some 29 million Americans on some form of unemployment insurance, the fact that prices are rising as much as they are is the bigger surprise. 
""The price increases this time reflect low inventory – as demand is outstripping supply,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics. ""There has been a lot more upward pressure on prices than we would have expected given the extent of the collapse in the real economy.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy recovered half of its COVID-19 crash by the end of July, helped by pubs and restaurants reopening from lockdown, but the bounce-back is expected to slow as job losses mount and Brexit tensions rise.
After shrinking by a record 20% in the second quarter, output expanded by 6.6% in July, slower than June's monthly rate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Friday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth of 6.7%.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak welcomed the figures but added that people were rightly worried about the coming months.
The economy remains 12% smaller than its level in February, before the pandemic hit Britain. 
""July was probably the last of the big step-ups in activity and a full recovery probably won't be achieved until early 2022,"" Thomas Pugh, an economist with Capital Economics, said.
In response, the Bank of England was likely to ramp up its bond-buying stimulus programme by a third, or 250 billion pounds ($320 billion), Pugh said.
Britain's economy suffered the sharpest second-quarter fall of any Group of Seven nation in the April-June period.
Hopes for a swift rebound have faded as businesses struggle to cope with social distancing rules and many people remain reluctant to travel on public transport or go to crowded places.
Tensions between London and Brussels over a post-Brexit trade deal are also mounting.
JOB PROTECTION CALLS
Furthermore, unemployment is expected to rise sharply because Sunak has ruled out extending his coronavirus job retention scheme which is due to expire at the end of October.
Parliament's Treasury Committee urged Sunak to ""carefully consider"" a targeted extension of the scheme and other support measures, a call echoed by the head of a major employers group.
Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry said she was in ""deep conversation"" with the government about a more selective version of the job subsidies scheme to avoid long-term job losses.
""We need to make sure that other countries, for example Germany, France, Australia, others who have put in place schemes like this, don't steal a march on our economy at this time,"" she told Sky News.
The pound fell slightly against the dollar as Friday's data showed output in Britain's dominant services sector was a bit weaker than expected. [GBP/] Growth in the much smaller manufacturing and construction sectors exceeded forecasts.
Complicating the outlook, Brexit risks have resurfaced.
The European Union told Britain on Thursday it should scrap a plan to breach their divorce treaty, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government refused and pressed ahead with a draft law that could sink four years of talks.
""We are far from out of the woods yet,"" Tom Stevenson, Investment Director, Personal Investing, at Fidelity International said, pointing to rising COVID-19 infections, new rules on social gatherings and the end of the furlough scheme.

Though food prices rocketed at the height of the COVID-19 business shutdowns, inflation stayed muted as the pandemic undercut demand for services like healthcare, air travel, dining out and hotel accommodation. High unemployment is also keeping a lid on price pressures despite the Fed's extraordinarily easy monetary policy and record fiscal stimulus from the government.
Nearly 30 million people are on unemployment benefits. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 1.3% in the 12 months through July. August's core PCE price index data is scheduled to be released at the end of this month. 
Gasoline prices rose 2.0% in August after increasing 5.6% in July. Food prices edged up 0.1% after declining 0.4% in July, the first decrease since April 2019. The cost of food consumed at home fell 0.1% after dropping 1.1% in the prior month. 
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, nudged up 0.1%. That followed a 0.2% gain in July. Many tenants have entered into forbearance agreements with landlords, while the government has temporarily halted evictions.

The cost of recreation increased 0.7% after falling in June and July. Prices for household furnishings and operations rose 0.9%, the largest increase since February 1991, with the costs of furniture and bedding advancing 1.6% and appliances rising 2.0%. Apparel prices rose 0.6%, advancing for a third straight month. The cost of motor vehicle insurance rose 0.5% and prices of airline fares increased 1.2%.

The Labor Department said on Friday its consumer price index rose 0.4% last month. The CPI advanced 0.6% in June and July after declining in the prior three months as business closures to slow the spread of the coronavirus depressed demand. 
In the 12 months through August, the CPI increased 1.3% after gaining 1.0% in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising 0.3% in August and climbing 1.2% year-on-year.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Services activity in Brazil rose in July for a second straight month, figures showed on Friday, but the pace of growth was slower than forecast, suggesting the economy's rebound from the worst of the COVID-19 may not be quite so entrenched.
The sector expanded by a seasonally-adjusted 2.6% from the previous month, government statistics agency IBGE said, less than the 3.1% rate of growth economists in a Reuters poll had forecast. 
Services sector output in July was down 11.9% from a year ago, IBGE said, more than the 10.4% decline forecast in the Reuters poll.
Four of the five sectors surveyed by IBGE showed increases in activity from the previous month, most notably a 2.2% rise in information and communications services, and a 2.3% increase in transport and transport-related services, IBGE said.
After surging 12.2% in June, services provided to families fell 3.9% in July, IBGE said.
June's rate of expansion in the services sector was revised up slightly to 5.2% from 5.0%. The figures mean that in the first seven months of the year, services sector activity in Latin America's largest economy fell 8.9% from the same period in 2019, IBGE said.

The level of service sector activity is still 22.2% lower than the peak in November 2014, IBGE said.

(Reuters) - The still-sky-high number of Americans who lost work during the coronavirus crisis and continue to tap unemployment insurance would normally be a troubling sign for a U.S. president seeking reelection, but maybe not this year. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits remained at a seasonally adjusted 884,000 for the week ended Sept. 5, Labor Department data https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf showed on Thursday, the same number as a week before and a bit more than economists expected.
All told, some 29.6 million Americans were relying on some form of unemployment insurance as of Aug. 22. That figure equates to a little under a fifth of the total number of jobs supported by the U.S. economy in February, before the current economic crisis hit.
""10.6 MILLION jobs added in four months,"" the White House tweeted after the release of the latest jobless claims report, which does not measure jobs added. ""That's the Great American Comeback!""
Graphic: Jobless claims still elevated - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY-JOBLESS/azgponxegvd/chart.png
A Labor Department report last Friday showed U.S. employers added 10.6 million jobs from April through August. That is less than half the 22 million jobs lost in the first two months of the coronavirus-triggered recession. 
Still, if the stall in the labor market's recovery helps push a deadlocked U.S. Congress toward agreement on a new package of relief for households hit by the crisis, the extra aid could bolster support for the political status quo and lift President Donald Trump's chances of beating Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 election, according to Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at Glassdoor.
""The reality is that millions of Americans either unemployed or financially on the edge from pandemic-related losses and financial relief is a very present and urgent need,"" he said.

""In a normal election year, a financial stimulus package that puts thousands of dollars in the pockets of Americans and boosts the economy heading into November would seem like a clear political winner. However, as this year has repeatedly shown, normal rules of engagement may not apply during a global pandemic,"" Zhao said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People flocked to stores - and back to restaurants - over Labor Day weekend in the United States, setting post-pandemic highs for retail foot traffic and seated dining but also posing a puzzle. 
The upturn may be a sign that consumer confidence is returning alongside a fall in new coronavirus infections. Or it could be a one-time bright spot in a slow economic recovery that remains challenged by massive joblessness and a persistent health crisis, one many fear will intensify in coming weeks.
Broad measures of the recovery ticked higher over the last week, gross domestic product estimates kept by the Atlanta and New York Federal Reserve banks have been increasing since mid-summer, and high frequency indicators from private data services have shown steady if sometimes slow progress.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Jan Hatzius said Sept. 8 he was ""upbeat"" about the direction of the global economic recovery, and saw annualized third-quarter growth in the United States hitting 35% - far higher than the median of roughly 20% seen by forecasters in a Philadelphia Federal Reserve bank survey in mid-August.
Hatzius noted that even challenged service sector businesses ""are adapting to the pandemic via low-cost mitigation measures,"" a fact that may have contributed to some signs of progress for the beleaguered restaurant industry.
Data on seated diners provided by restaurant booking site OpenTable https://www.opentable.com/state-of-industry as of Sunday were just 14% below 2019, a level not seen since before a state of emergency was declared March 13 and a wave of mandated closures and social distancing protocols temporarily shut down restaurants and other close-contact industries.

Retail traffic overall has moved back to its March 1 level, according to data on cellphone locations provided by Safegraph https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard/covid19-commerce-patterns. Similar data from Unacast https://www.unacast.com/covid19/covid-19-retail-impact-scoreboard showed retail traffic had returned to year-ago levels in a pandemic-era record 33 states based on analysis through Saturday.
That momentum, however, may not be translating fully to the job market - a possible sign that the ""adaptation"" Hatzius highlighted is businesses learning to get by with fewer workers.
Initial jobless claims for the week ending Sept. 5 were unchanged from the week before, at 884,000, and the total number of people claiming some form of unemployment benefit increased by 380,000, to a staggering 29.6 million for the week ended Aug. 22. 
The headline unemployment rate has fallen faster than expected to 8.4%, and has been declining more quickly than after the 2007 to 2009 recession. But that overlooks the 3.7 million who have left the labor force altogether since February and so are not counted as unemployed, and hundreds of thousands on ""temporary"" furloughs that may turn permanent, Jason Furman, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and Harvard Kennedy School research associate Wilson Powell, wrote in an analysis for the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
A ""realistic"" unemployment rate is more likely near 10%, they wrote.
""Labor market problems are very deep...Even if individuals on temporary layoff returned to work very quickly, the United States would still have a recessionary level of unemployment for some time to come,"" their analysis says.
Narrower measures of job recovery have been stodgy. Employment over the past week fell at small businesses whose time records are managed by Homebase https://joinhomebase.com/data, an online scheduling tool, many of them restaurants. New job postings culled from company and other websites by Chmura http://www.chmuraecon.com/blog Economics also dropped. 
Shifts worked at a broad set of industries whose worker time is managed by Kronos https://www.kronos.com/about-us/newsroom/update-us-workforce-activity continued a slow weekly pace of growth, stalled below 1% and with only about half of the estimated jobs recovered since massive rounds of layoffs and furloughs in the spring.

The growth in new coronavirus cases and deaths has been falling steadily since midsummer, and the improving health outcomes have boosted an Oxford http://blog.oxfordeconomics.com/topic/recovery-tracker Economics Recovery index back above 80 for the first time since the state of emergency.
Graphic: Oxford Economics Recovery Index - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/OXFORDINDEX/rlgpdlnyepo/chart.png
The issue now is whether a new wave of infections is coming, given the combination of Labor Day crowds, infection hot spots at college campuses, and the onset of cooler weather driving people back to less-safe indoor activities. 
Budget stresses at state and local governments, and the loss of household income as unemployment benefits expire could both lead to a crash in consumer spending absent further federal aid, many economists fear.
""The economic situation remains worrisome,"" Oxford analysts wrote. ""With one out of two laid-off workers still unemployed and Congress in deadlock over urgently needed fiscal support, a battered labor market and lackluster demand have brought the speed and durability of the recovery into question.""

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would gain 0.2% in August and fall 0.3% on a year-on-year basis.
Producer prices were led by a 0.5% increase in services. Nearly 20% of the rise in services was attributed to

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 884,000 for the week ended Sept. 5, matching the number of applications received in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 846,000 applications in the latest week.
Though claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million at the end of March, layoffs persist across industries as many companies have exhausted loans from the government to help with wages and the coronavirus lingers. A weekly unemployment supplement, credited for the sharp rebound in economic activity, starting with record retail sales growth in May, lapsed in July.
Airlines, including United Airlines (O:UAL) and American Airlines (O:AAL) have announced furloughs and job cuts. There have also been layoffs at oilfield services and equipment companies.
Economists believe the labor market could take years to return to its pre-pandemic levels and are urging the White House and Congress to restart stalled negotiations for another rescue package amid a setback in the quest for a vaccine.

Investing.com -- The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits came in at a larger than forecast 884,000 last week, indicating that labor market recovery is stalling amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Economists had forecast a decline to 846,000. The prior week's figure was revised up to 884,000 from an initially reported 881,000.
Because of a change to how seasonal adjustments are calculated made earlier in the month, today's figure is only comparable to the previous week.

755,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 04:05AM ET</span>","BERLIN (Reuters) - The number of firms declaring insolvency in Germany was 6.2% lower than in the first half of last year despite the coronavirus crisis, the Statistics Office said, partly because of a rule designed to keep firms afloat in the pandemic.
In March, the government gave companies that find themselves in financial trouble due to the pandemic a respite by allowing them to delay filing for bankruptcy. That was later extended until the end of the year.
The fact that insolvency numbers fell even as Europe's largest economy shrank the most in its post-war history will lend ammunition to critics who say that suspending compulsory insolvencies is merely keeping afloat ""zombie companies"" whose collapse has merely been delayed, not prevented.
There were 9,006 corporate insolvencies in the first half of 2020, a sixth of them in the retail sector, which was especially hard-hit by lockdowns to stem the virus's spread. Construction and hospitality also notched up more than 1,000 insolvencies.
Companies that had declared insolvency had total estimated debts of 16.7 billion euros, up from 10.2 billion euros in the first half of 2019.
""The economic pain many companies have suffered in the coronavirus crisis is not so far reflected in the number of declared insolvencies,"" the Office said on Thursday. ""One reason is that the obligation to declare insolvency has been suspended since March 1.""
Germany's economy shrank by an unprecedented 9.7% in the second quarter, a contraction that without government countermeasures would ordinarily have been accompanied by a wave of bankruptcies and mass unemployment.

Defenders of the insolvency protection measures say they have helped spare Germany a yet more serious dip in economic output and helped prevent a disastrous spike in unemployment.

BEIJING (Reuters) - New energy vehicle (NEV) sales in China surged 26% on year to 109,000 units in August for their second consecutive month of gain, a promising sign for automakers that have invested heavily in the world's biggest market for electric vehicles (EVs).
For the full year, NEV sales are likely to reach 1.1 million vehicles, down around 11% from last year, said the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) on Thursday.
NEVs include battery-powered electric, plug-in gasoline-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
""The sales rebound was fuelled by rural NEV sales promotion events and local governments' support,"" said senior CAAM official Chen Shihua.
EV makers from home-grown Nio Inc (N:NIO) and  Xpeng Inc  (N:XPEV) to U.S. leader Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) are expanding manufacturing capacity in China where the government heavily promotes greener vehicles as a means of reducing chronic air pollution.
""There was a new-car effect in August, as a new mini EV model from GM's local venture and Tesla's Model 3 both sold well,"" said senior LMC Automotive analyst Alan Kang. ""Sales at EV startups like Nio and Xpeng were stable too.""
NEV sales in coming months will be around same as in August, Kang said.
China's overall auto sales in August rose 11.6% to 2.19 million vehicles from the same month a year earlier, the fifth consecutive month of gain as China comes off lows hit during the coronavirus lockdown in the first few months of the year.
Sales are still down 9.7% for the first eight months of the year at 14.55 million vehicles, CAAM said.
Sales of trucks and other commercial vehicles, which constitute around a quarter of the market, surged 41.6%, driven by government investment in infrastructure and as buyers upgraded to comply with tougher emissions rules.
Sales of passenger vehicles rose 6%.

Automakers that reported sales growth in August include Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203). The main local joint ventures of Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) and General Motors Co (N:GM), however, saw sales slide last month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's machinery orders rebounded in July from a sharp fall in the previous month, a welcome relief for the coronavirus-stricken economy but the outlook for capital spending remained uncertain due to fragile global business conditions.
Corporate Japan is facing strains from steep declines in earnings, discouraging business investment as the economy grapples with its worst postwar slump. 
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, grew 6.3% in July after a 7.6% decline in June.
The rise was bigger than a 1.9% gain seen by economists in a Reuters poll.
""Corporate earnings are likely to remain in a sluggish state in the second half of the fiscal year,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. 
Orders from manufacturers advanced 5.0%, while those from non-manufacturers gained 3.4%, the Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday.
The government maintained its assessment on machinery orders to say they were on a decreasing trend.
Overseas orders rose for the first time in five months, gaining 13.8% in July from the previous month to highlight a pickup in external demand.
From a year earlier, core machinery orders were down 16.2% in July, not far off an expected 18.3% decline.
The world's third-largest economy is preparing for a new prime minister for the first time in nearly eight years after Shinzo Abe announced his resignation last month due to poor health.
The country's next leader will face the daunting task of fighting the economic, social and medical fallout from the health crisis while pulling the country out of its worst postwar recession.
The government has already rolled out a combined $2.2 trillion of fiscal stimulus packages to combat the pandemic, adding to an enhanced programme from the Bank of Japan.
The central bank will hold its next policy review on Sept. 16-17.
Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics, said he still expected non-residential investment to weaken a little further in the third-quarter despite the uptick in July orders.
""With domestic capital goods shipments falling to their lowest level since 2011 in July, we think business investment weakened further in Q3,"" he wrote in a note.

The monthly gauge of house prices from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) shot up to +44 in August from +13 in July, hitting its level since February 2016. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of +25.
Prices rose across the country except for London where they have remained more or less flat over the past two months.
The survey chimed with other signs that a mini-boom is underway in the housing market - one of the few parts of the economy to have bounced back from the pandemic - helped in part by an emergency tax cut for buyers.
Demand accelerated sharply, helped by a shift towards properties with gardens after the COVID-19 lockdown, RICS said.
Some 83% said they expected to see higher demand for properties with gardens and most predicted reduced demand for homes in highly urban areas or tower blocks.
""The latest RICS survey provides firm evidence of a strong uplift in activity in the housing market which should help support the wider economy gain traction over the coming months,"" RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said.
Still, there were some ominous signs.
The survey's gauge of sales for the next 12 months deteriorated further in August, dented by worries about the economy.

Last week Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said it was too soon to say if the rebound in the housing market was anything more than a release of pent-up demand following lockdown, helped by the temporary cut to property taxes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings increased further in July, though more workers quit their jobs in the retail as well as professional and business services industries likely because of fears of exposure to COVID-19 and problems with childcare.
Despite the surge in vacancies reported by the Labor Department on Wednesday in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, the number of unemployed people competing for a new job remained relatively high in July. 
""The labor market recovery will be measured in years, not months,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, jumped 617,000 to 6.6 million on the last day of July. Still, vacancies remain below their level of 7 million in February. 
Job openings were led by the retail sector, with 172,000 new vacancies. There were an additional 146,000 jobs in healthcare and social assistance. In the construction industry, job openings increased by 90,000. The job openings rate shot up to 4.5%, the highest since October 2019, from 4.2% in June.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs increased 344,000 to 2.9 million. There were 152,000 workers who quit their jobs in the retail sector. In the professional and business services sector, 98,000 workers left. State and local government education reported 35,000 workers quit in July.

CHILDCARE CHALLENGES
While schools have opened for the new academic year, many are conducting virtual classes. Problems securing childcare have forced some workers, mostly women, to resign from their jobs. The labor participation rate for women dropped in April to levels last seen in the late 1980s and has not rebounded much since.
The quits rate, which under normal circumstance is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence, increased to 2.1% in July from 1.9% in June.
""More quits during the pandemic are probably a reflection of virus fear and challenges related to childcare given the current weak state of the labor market,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
The JOLTS report followed on the heels of news last Friday that the economy created 1.371 million jobs in August after adding 1.734 million in July. About 10.6 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost at the depth of the coronavirus pandemic have been recovered.
In July, there were 2.5 people per job opening.
The JOLTS report showed hiring dropped by 1.183 million jobs to 5.8 million in July. Hiring decreased by 599,000 jobs in the accommodation and food services sector. It fell by 137,000 in the healthcare and social assistance industry. 
But federal government hiring increased by 33,000, largely because of recruitment for the 2020 Census.
Overall, the hiring rate fell to 4.1% from 5.1% in June. 
Layoffs abated in July, declining 274,000 to 1.7 million, the lowest since March 2019. There were decreases in manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, utilities and wholesale trade industries. 
Though layoffs as measured by the number of new claims for unemployment benefits remain elevated, economists believe the worst of the job cuts related to the pandemic is likely over.

""It remains difficult to understand why various measures related to layoffs have sent different signals in recent months, but several of the key measures suggest that we have moved past the worst of the layoffs associated with the virus spread,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

761,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 10:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. job openings increased for a third straight month in July, consistent with a steady improvement in the labor market as the nation grinds its way forward from a pandemic-induced recession.
The number of available positions rose to 6.62 million during the month from a revised 6 million in June, according to the Labor Department’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released Wednesday. The figure exceeded all projections in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Openings that involve workers recalled from layoffs or positions that are only offered internally are not counted in the figure.
Competition among those looking for work remains elevated with a little more than 16 million Americans jobless in July, leaving about 2.5 unemployed workers vying for every job opening. That stands in stark contrast to a two-year trend in which job vacancies exceeded the number of unemployed.
The number of hires, which does include rehired employees, declined 1.18 million to a still-solid 5.79 million in July. The hires rate decreased to 4.1% from 5.1%.
Separations, which include layoffs and quits, rose by 108,000 in July, reflecting an increase in the number of people voluntarily leaving their jobs. The number of quits jumped to 2.95 million from 2.61 million a month earlier. The quits rate increased to 2.1%, edging closer to where it was at the start of the year, when the unemployment rate was at its lowest in decades. The rate of layoffs and discharges dropped to 1.2% in July from 1.4%.
The increase in job openings, which occurred in all four U.S. regions, reflected a 217,000 gain in vacancies within trade, transportation and utilities. Openings also picked up in construction, education and health care, manufacturing and business services. They fell within leisure and hospitality, which continues to suffer from declining demand related to the pandemic.
Employers added to payrolls at a steady rate in August, indicating companies are continuing to adjust headcounts against a backdrop of firmer demand, the agency’s latest monthly jobs data showed Friday.
The JOLTS data lag behind the monthly employment report by a month, but it offers a level of detail not available in the jobs report. However, the two are not directly comparable across all categories. For employment, the reference period is the pay period that includes the 12th of the month -- the same as the payroll survey in the jobs report -- but for job openings it’s the last business day of the month and for hires and separations, it’s the entire calendar month.

""Dubai's non-oil economy saw a disappointing slowdown in growth in August, as the PMI fell for the first time since April,"" said David Owen, economist at survey complier IHS Markit.
""Firms have not seen a full-scale uplift in demand to pre-pandemic levels and many commented that market conditions remained strongly depressed.""
The Middle East's trade and tourism hub relies on foreign visitors and shoppers for a large chunk of revenue and was hit hard by virus containment measures.
Output expanded for the third consecutive month in August, though at the slowest pace in that period, falling to 52.7 from 56.1 in July.
Employment contracted for the sixth straight month and was largely in line with the average in that period, falling to 46.0 in August from 46.8 in July, as companies cut jobs and employee costs.
""Business optimism weakened, with some firms expecting activity to improve but others citing that the unpredictability of the recovery could lead to business closures,"" Owen said.
The non-oil private sector in the United Arab Emirates - of which Dubai is a part - contracted in August for the first time since May, hit by record job cuts that reversed the growth of the previous two months as coronavirus restrictions were lifted.

Annual producer prices fell for a seventh straight month but at a slower pace, while consumer prices saw more moderate growth due to falling pork price inflation. Core consumer prices however rose month-on-month for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic worsened in China in January.
China's economy returned to growth in the second quarter of this year, underpinned by government stimulus and as the country managed to get the virus broadly under control. Recent indicators have pointed to a sustained recovery.
""Looking through the volatility in food prices, the broader disinflationary impact from the COVID-19 downturn continues to ease,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
The producer price index (PPI) fell 2.0% from a year earlier in August, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday. That was in line with expectations in a Reuters poll, but the decline was more modest than the 2.4% drop in July. 
The consumer price index meanwhile rose 2.4% last month from a year earlier, as expected, but slower than a 2.7% annual increase in July, as food price inflation eased, driven by pork prices.
Pork price inflation slowed last month from a higher base a year ago, when prices began to surge in August 2019 as the African swine fever decimated China's pig herd. Pork prices rose 52.6% in August from a year earlier, easing sharply from a 85.7% annual jump in July.
""Looking ahead, headline consumer price inflation probably has further to fall as pork supply continues to recover from last year's African swine fever outbreak,"" Evans-Pritchard added.
UNCERTAINTY STILL ""HUGE""
Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.5% in August from a year earlier, unchanged from July, suggesting domestic demand still remained soft.
On a month-on-month basis, core inflation rose 0.1% in August, the first monthly rise since January, while producer prices rose 0.3%, slowing from 0.4 % in July.
""In August, industrial production continued to improve while market demand kept recovering,"" said Dong Lijuan, senior statistician with the NBS, in a statement accompanying the data release.
But Nie Wen, economist at Shanghai-based Hwabao Trust, does not expect annual PPI to turn positive by the end of the year. 

""(It) would ultimately depend on when the global pandemic will be brought under control. Given China is very likely to see a resurgence of infections during winter, the uncertainty (on the industrial recovery) is still huge.""

Investing.com – The Chinese economy continued to show signs of recovery from the economic impact of COVID-19 as factory gate prices rose at the slowest annual pace since March, but fell for seventh consecutive month, in August.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released on Wednesday said that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% year-on-year and 0.4% month-on-month, down from July’s 2.7% and 0.6% respectively but hitting forecasted numbers prepared by Investing.com. Meanwhile, the Producer Price Index (PPI) fell 2% year-on-year, down from July’s 2.4% drop but also hitting its forecasted number.
The figures, combined with Monday’s trade data and the Caixin Purchasing Manager’s Indexes (PMI) released during the previous week, indicated that economic activity and manufacturing in the country continue to sustain recovery as the world’s second largest economy returned to growth in the second quarter as the country loosened strict COVID-19-induced lockdowns during the first quarter.
“In August, industrial production continued to improve while market demand kept recovering,” NBS senior statistician Dong Lijuan said in a statement.
“Prices for global commodities such as crude oil, iron ore and non-ferrous metals continued to rise, driving a rebound in domestic factory-gate prices,” he added.
Although the recovery in economic activity and consumer demand is expected to continue as COVID-19 comes under control in China, but risks to the outlook remain as the number of global cases continues to rise.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's currency in circulation and bank deposits rose at a record annual pace in August as companies and households continued to pile up cash to guard against the coronavirus- driven income slump, central bank data showed on Wednesday.
The data underlines the difficulty of prodding companies and households to start spending again, even as the economy gradually re-opens after lockdown measures were lifted in May.
Japan's M3 money stock - or currency in circulation and deposits at financial institutions - rose 7.1% in August from a year earlier, marking the biggest increase since comparable data became available in 2004, Bank of Japan data showed. The rise topped a 6.5% gain in July.
Bank deposits surged a record 15.3% in August from a year earlier, as the hit to sales from COVID-19 prompted companies to continue to hoard cash as a precaution.
Cash in circulation rose 5.5% in August, matching the pace of gain in July, the data showed.
""Some households may be holding cash at home instead of parking them in bank accounts, as the pandemic makes them cautious of visiting bank branches, a BOJ official told a briefing.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports remained far below their pre-crisis levels in July despite a 4.7% increase during the month, data published on Tuesday showed, adding to signs that Germany's economic recovery from the coronavirus will be slow.
Imports rose by only 1.1% on the month, taking the seasonally adjusted trade surplus to 18 billion euros, the Federal Statistics Office said.
Economists expect Europe's biggest economy to show a return to growth in the third quarter, helped by higher activity levels domestically and in some of Germany's main trading partners after lockdowns were lifted from April.
Yet weak demand from major economic peers still grappling with the pandemic, such as the United States, is holding back a stronger recovery.
The data showed that exports to the United States were 17% lower in July year-on-year. Exports to China, however, which is experiencing a more pronounced recovery than the United States, were only 0.1% lower.
""While today's numbers are good news for our call of surging GDP growth .... (in the second half of the year) and suggest that the export sector is flourishing again, we should not get carried away by these numbers,"" said Carsten Brzeski, euro zone chief economist at ING.
He added: ""They are still part of the mechanical rebound. In fact, the German export sector is still suffering from structural challenges including trade tensions, Brexit and global supply chain disruptions as well as difficulties among its main trading partners to cope with the virus.""
The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investment and trade all collapsed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Exports were in July still more than 12% lower than in February.
Trade tensions, uncertainties linked to Britain's departure from the European Union and an automotive sector struggling to adapt to electrification had suppressed demand for German goods and services before the pandemic, setting off a recession in the manufacturing sector.
The COVID-19 crisis makes a full recovery difficult.

The VDMA business association said on Tuesday that German engineering firms expected production to decline by 17% this year before growing by only 2% in 2021 - barring both a second coronavirus wave and resurgent trade disputes.

Data out later in the morning is expected to show the economy shrank more than previously estimated in the second quarter as the health crisis delivered a blow to capital spending, in a sign of the challenge policymakers face in avoiding a deeper recession.
Labour ministry data on Tuesday showed inflation-adjusted real wages, a key gauge of households' purchasing power, declined 1.6% in July from a year earlier, following a downwardly revised 2.1% drop the previous month.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, dropped 16.6% in July from a year earlier, down for the 11th straight month, while nominal total cash earnings dropped 1.3% in the year to July.
Regular pay - or base salary, which makes up most of total cash earnings - saw a modest increase, growing 0.3%, which was smaller than June's downwardly revised 0.4% gain.
The COVID-19 crisis continued to pile pressure on companies, leading to a 2.4% decrease in special pay, including one-off bonuses, the data showed.

Barclaycard said its measure of spending rose in annual terms for the first time since before the lockdown, up 0.2% year-on-year as people bought more fuel to go on holiday in Britain and to begin returning to their workplaces.
There was also an increase in spending in restaurants, pubs and bars as diners took advantage of the government's Eat Out to Help Out"" discount scheme that run during August.
The overall increase was the first since February. Spending on clothing rose for the first time since March 2019 as people ventured back to shops.
By contrast, spending on travel – including airlines and travel agents – slumped by 61%.
Britain's economy suffered a record 20% contraction in the April-June period before recovering a bit in May and June. Its prospects depend in large part on how confident households are about getting back to something resembling normal life.
""It's encouraging to see the first uplift in spending after such a turbulent time for retailers,"" Raheel Ahmed, head of consumer products at Barclaycard, said.
However, a surge in online orders meant the recovery might be a long one for bricks-and-mortar stores.
Economists are also warning that unemployment will rise sharply as the government scales back its job protection scheme.
Separately, the British Retail Consortium said spending at retailers rose by 3.9% compared with August 2019, the biggest increase in more than two years excluding distortions caused by the timing of Easter.
The shift to working from home boosted sales of food, computing, furniture and televisions, the BRC said.
But many retailers who rely on commuters were at risk of closure if people continue to stay away from offices and other places of work, BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
""Government will need to act fast or September will see more shops close and more job losses realised,"" she said.
Barclaycard's measure of consumer confidence in the economy sank to 19%, its lowest since it began polling six years ago.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output rose far less than expected in July, suggesting Europe's largest economy faces a slow return to production levels that preceded the crisis unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Industrial output rose by 1.2% on the month, a third successive increase after record drops in March and April during a lockdown, figures released on Monday by the Statistics Office showed. A Reuters poll had forecast an increase of 4.7%.
A breakdown of the data showed that activity in the construction sector, which had expanded during the lockdown, shrank by 4.3%, dragging on the headline figure.
The automotive sector, which before the crisis was grappling with falling demand and an expensive shift to electric vehicles, saw activity expand by almost 7% month-on-month but production levels were still around 15% lower than in February.
""The German economy remains on track for a strong surge in the third quarter,"" said Carsten Brzeski, chief euro zone economist at ING. ""It is too early to tell how much momentum will be left thereafter.""
Even excluding the volatile construction and energy sectors, output rose by 2.8%, still lower than the forecast.
The Germany economy has weathered the pandemic much better than many of its big European neighbours, largely because the country kept factories open during a six-week lockdown. The government has also put in place a massive stimulus package.
A strong rebound in activity in May and June raised hopes of a fast recovery but economists now mostly predict a slow return to pre-crisis activity levels.
Industrial firms expect production to increase slightly in the coming months, according to a survey published on Monday by the Ifo economic institute.
Industry orders data published last week showed that domestic demand had fallen by more than 10% in July.
""With the latest data showing a small fall in domestic orders in August, while activity is losing momentum elsewhere in Europe, the economic recovery looks set to be moving into a more difficult, slower phase,"" Jack Allen-Reynolds of Capital Economics wrote in a note.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports rose for the third consecutive month in August, eclipsing an extended fall in imports, as more of its trading partners relaxed coronavirus lockdowns in a further boost to the recovery in the world's second-biggest economy.
Exports in August rose a solid 9.5% from a year earlier, customs data showed on Monday, marking the strongest gain since March 2019. The figure also beat analysts' expectations for 7.1% growth and compared with a 7.2% increase in July. 
Imports however slumped 2.1%, compared with market expectations for a 0.1% increase and extending a 1.4% fall in July. 
The strong exports suggest a faster and more balanced recovery for the Chinese economy, which is rebounding from a record first-quarter slump thanks largely to domestic stimulus measures
""China’s exports continue to defy expectations and to grow significantly faster than global trade, thus gaining global market share,"" said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics.
A private survey on manufacturing activity last week showed Chinese factories reported the first increase in new export orders this year in August as overseas demand slowly revives. The pick-up in business also led to a further expansion in production, marking the sharpest gain in almost a decade.
China's export performance, boosted by record shipments of medical supplies and robust demand for electronic products, has not been as severely affected by the global slowdown as some analysts had feared.
All the same, some analysts cautioned that the stronger exports reflected in part the base effects of the year-ago weakness. 
Imports unexpectedly slipped further into contraction, suggesting softer domestic demand.
But imports were largely stable in terms of volume, said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics, in a note. 
""With credit growth still accelerating and infrastructure-led stimulus still ramping up, import volumes should remain strong in the coming months,"" he said. 
Copper imports in August eased from the previous month's all-time high, as an arbitrage window to bring in overseas metal shut and demand from key consumption sectors slowed. Coal imports slipped 20.8% from the month before. Iron ore imports fell 10.9% from July but rose from a year earlier on resilient demand for steel.
China posted a trade surplus of $58.93 billion last month, compared with the poll's forecast for a $50.50 billion surplus and $62.33 billion surplus in July. 
OUTLOOK STILL UNCERTAIN
The outlook is still far from rosy as external demand could suffer if virus control measures have to be re-imposed by trade partners later this year on a resurgence of the epidemic. 
China also is looking to reduce its reliance on overseas markets for its development as U.S. hostility and the pandemic increase external risks that could hamper longer-term progress.
Already heightened U.S.-China tensions are expected to escalate ahead of the U.S. presidential election. China remains well behind on its pledge to boost purchases of U.S. goods under an agreement that was launched in February.
China's trade surplus with the United States widened to $34.24 billion in August from $32.46 billion in July. 
Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials reaffirmed their commitment to a Phase 1 trade deal in a phone call last month. ""Both sides see progress and are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure the success of the agreement,"" the U.S. Trade Representative's office said.
Falling imports of integrated circuits in August are likely the result of the new restrictions on U.S. companies doing businesses with Chinese technology companies, said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING, in a note. 

Bilateral tensions could also affect exports of technological products and services in the coming months, she said.

Investing.com – China saw exports rise for a third consecutive month, but also saw an extended fall in imports, with loosening global lockdown measures boosting the country’s economic recovery from COVID-19.
Customs data for August released earlier in the day said that exports increased 9.5% year-on-year, beating Investing.com's 7.1% forecast, as well as July’s 7.2% increase. However, imports fell 2.1% year-on-year, bigger than the forecast 0.1% drop and the 1.4% drop from the the previous month.
The increase in exports, attributable to record shipments of medical supplies and increased demand for electronics, suggested a faster and more balanced recovery for the world’s second largest economy, and a continuing rebound from the record slump seen in the first quarter due to strict lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19.
The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), released during the previous week, also saw the first increase in new export orders this year for Chinese factories, with loosing lockdown measures slowly reviving demand outside China.
“China’s exports continue to defy expectations and to grow significantly faster than global trade, thus gaining global market share,” Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics told Reuters.
But he warned, “The import data disappointed, pointing to the need for caution as we assess growth of China’s domestic demand.”
However, a resurgence of COVID-19 could mean tighter control measures, such as the reimposition of lockdowns, and impact the growth in exports.
Meanwhile, the trade balance stood at $58.93 billion, higher than the forecast $50.50 billion but lower than July’s $62.33 billion figure. Simmering U.S.-China tensions ahead of the U.S. presidential elections mean that China is looking to reduce its dependence on exports and overseas markets. China’s trade surplus with the United States jumped to $34.24 billion in August from July’s $32.46 billion, indicating that China remains behind on its pledge to boost purchases of U.S. goods under the agreement between the two countries launched in February.
However, U.S. and Chinese trade officials reaffirmed their commitment to a Phase 1 trade deal in a phone call in August, “Both sides see progress and are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure the success of the agreement,” according to U.S. Trade Representative’s office. During the previous week, the U.S. extended tariff exclusions for a wide range of Chinese goods, including smartwatches and some medical masks, through the end of 2020."

Exports rose 9.5% in dollar terms in August from a year earlier, while imports fell 2.1%, the customs administration said Monday. That left a trade surplus of $58.9 billion for the month. Economists had forecast exports would increase by 7.5% and imports would rise 0.2%.

784,"<span>Sep 06, 2020 07:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The much-anticipated U.S. jobs report on Friday answered some important questions about the state of the labor market. Yet by also leaving some important issues outstanding, it will not serve as the much needed outside catalyst to resolve both the policy stalemate on Capitol Hill and the increasingly visible tug-of-war in financial markets.
The narrow message of the jobs report came through loud and clear in four monthly numbers. Despite all the headwinds facing the economy, its inherent dynamism and entrepreneurship — plus a positive one-off influence from census hiring — led to buoyant job creation (1.4 million) and a sharp fall in the unemployment rate (from 10.2% to 8.4%). This was coupled with an increase in both labor force participation and the equally important employment-to-population ratio.
Pulling the lens back a bit provided a second, less reassuring message. The pace of improvement in the labor market continues to moderate. Monthly job creation has fallen from a three-month average of 3 million after gains resumed in the wake of the economic sudden stop in March related to the Covid-19 shock to monthly rates of 1.7 million in July and 1.4 million in August.
This is an issue because of the third, more macro message in the jobs report. The overall labor market situation remains worrisome. Almost 30 million Americans depend on some form of unemployment assistance at a time when the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the share of the long-term unemployed is growing.
These three different messages are problematic when it comes to breaking the stalemate in the fiscal policy debate in Washington. Both Democrats and Republicans will find enough in the jobs report to support their competing positions on the relief bill languishing in Congress. For Republicans who favor a smaller relief package, the report’s favorable narrow message provides ammunition, especially because the unemployment rate was yet another data point that beat the consensus expectations of economists and Wall Street analysts last week. Democrats will point to the other two messages to press for a much bigger relief package.
A similar tension exists in financial markets as a result of the tug-of-war between investors who are thinking in relative terms and those starting to look more closely at absolute valuations, especially as awareness grows about how option trading activity has impacted the price of both individual stocks and overall market indexes. Specifically, relative-value arguments that favor stocks will point to the data that beat expectations. The “deltas” are what matters. However, those worried about absolute valuations will argue that the declining rate of labor market improvement is troublesome not just because of the magnitude of the damage already done to the U.S. economy but also because of signs of looming corporate layoffs and the cumulative effect of declining benefits for the unemployed.
Both policy and market uncertainties are offset to some extent by the clarity exhibited by the Federal Reserve. Given the deepening of its one-sided risk mitigation paradigm — as illustrated most recently in the revisions to its monetary policy framework — the central bank is in no mood to relax its “pedal to the metal” liquidity approach until it sees unambiguous evidence of broad-based economic improvements that allow it to meet both its employment and inflation objectives. This may buy even more time for a stalemated Congress and conflicted markets but at the cost of an even bigger “only-game-in-town” burden on central banks, with all the distortions and risks of collateral damage and unintended consequences that come with that.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada added 245,800 jobs in August, the fourth consecutive monthly increase though the pace of new gains slowed, bringing employment within about a million jobs of pre-pandemic levels, Statistics Canada said on Friday.
The unemployment rate in August fell to 10.2%. The headline numbers were slightly weaker than analyst expectations of 275,000 new jobs and an unemployment rate of 10.1%.
""We are seeing some, as expected, cooling down in decent job gains. Still quite robust though,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. 
""We’ve got a long way to go to before we make up the deep losses that we saw in March and April,"" he added. ""But this is another big step in the right direction.""
The Canadian dollar  was trading 0.1% higher at 1.3115 to the U.S. dollar, or 76.25 U.S. cents, even as the greenback (DXY) rallied against a basket of major currencies.Employment rose at a faster pace among women than men in August, as they continued to claw back from sharper losses. Employment for core-age women is at 95.6% of pre-pandemic levels, StatsCan said, while employment among core-age men is at 96.6% of its February level. 
The jobless rate, meanwhile, remained far higher for non-white Canadians, with Arabs at 17.9% and Blacks at 17.6%.
Analysts noted that there would challenges ahead for employment to fully return to pre-pandemic levels, particularly if there is a second wave of COVID-19 in the fall or winter.
""With provincial reopening plans having largely gone as far as they will go before a vaccine is available, we will be entering a new phase of the recovery where the path higher for employment is slower and potentially uneven,"" said Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.
Full-time employment rose by 205,800 compared with 40,000 new part-time positions. Employment in the goods-producing sector grew by 27,600 jobs, while the services sector grew by 218,100 positions.

If those who wanted to work but did not look for a job were included as unemployed in August, the adjusted unemployment rate would have been 13.0%, StatsCan said.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy added 1,371 million nonfarm jobs in August, roughly in line with expectations, in further evidence of a gradual recovery from the disastrous second quarter. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that private payrolls rose 1.027 million, more than twice the estimate of ADP that was published on Wednesday. However, that was still short of expectations for a rise of 1.20 million. 
The overall employment numbers were boosted by around 238,000 related to hiring for the 2020 census.
The unemployment rate fell more sharply than expected, to 8.4% of the working population from 10.2% in July. Adult participation in the labor force edged up to 61.7 from 61.4.
""A good job report, but skewed by temporary census hiring,"" said Roberto Perli, Head of Global Policy Research at Cornerstone Macro via Twitter. Perli, a former Federal Reserve staffer, said the survey ""doesn't change much"" from the Fed's point of view. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had announced a major change in strategy last week by downgrading the importance of current inflation and attaching more weight to  unemployment, a more concrete illustration of slack in the economy."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Orders for German industrial goods rose by a weaker-than-expected 2.8% in July, indicating an initial snap back from the coronavirus shock is fading into a slower recovery in Europe's largest economy.
The rise compared with a Reuters forecast for a 5.0% gain on the previous month, signalling a slow return to pre-crisis levels. June figures were revised up to show an increase of 28.8% from 27.9% previously reported, the Federal Statistics Office said on Friday.
Order intake in July was still 8.2% lower than in February, before lockdown measures were imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
""In the coming months, we will probably see that the low-hanging fruit has been harvested, and now the economic race to catch up will lose momentum,"" said Jens-Oliver Niklasch, economist at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.
""We will not see the pre-crisis levels quite as quickly as some had hoped,"" he added.
The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investment and trade all collapsed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A government stimulus package includes a temporary cut in value-added tax (VAT) from July 1 until Dec. 31, worth up to 20 billion euros ($24 billion), to give an additional push to domestic demand, which remains sluggish.
""ENORMOUS TWIST""
Domestic industrial orders fell by 10.2% on the month in July but orders from abroad were up 14.4%, the Statistics Office said. ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the figures showed ""an enormous twist between domestic and foreign demand"".
The weak domestic demand chimed with figures published on Wednesday showing German retail sales fell unexpectedly in July, dashing hopes that household spending can drive a strong recovery in the third quarter.
Earlier this week, the chief executive of Germany's  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) said global demand for Mercedes-Benz cars had stabilised from a sharp drop in sales triggered by the coronavirus crisis.
""In China we saw a V-shaped recovery. That's not the case in Europe and North America but we have rebounded from the freefall,"" Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius said.
Germany's response to the pandemic has been effective by European standards, keeping infection and death rates relatively low despite imposing restrictions that were both milder and shorter than in many other countries.
The government on Tuesday revised upwards its 2020 forecast for the economy to shrink by 5.8% this year from a previous estimate of -6.3%. But that would still represent the biggest economic slump since World War Two.

789,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - The momentum behind the recovery of Britain's construction industry faded unexpectedly in August, according to a survey on Friday that pointed to another sharp drop in employment.
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 54.6 from 58.1 in July, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll that pointed to an improvement to 58.5.
The civil engineering sector slumped back into contraction in August and growth in the commercial and housebuilding sectors slowed.
""The latest PMI data signalled a setback for the UK construction sector as the speed of recovery lost momentum for the first time since the reopening phase began in May,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit.
""The main reason for the slowdown in total construction output growth was a reduced degree of catch-up on delayed projects and subsequent shortages of new work to replace completed contracts in August.""
Construction firms cut jobs for the 17th month running, although at a slower rate than in July. 
Still, most companies held out hope for better days ahead as the survey's gauge of business optimism rose to a six-month high.
""Construction firms turned their hopes towards a boost from major infrastructure work and reorienting their sales focus on new areas of growth in the coming 12 months,"" Moore said.
The all-sector PMI - a combination of this week's construction, services and manufacturing surveys - rose to a six-year high of 58.7 from 57.1.

Some economists view the current strength of the PMI with scepticism because it reflects an inevitable increase in businesses reporting growth as the economy reopens, rather than a recovery in output that could take years.

790,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 01:40AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports likely posted a second month of solid gains in August as more of its trading partners relaxed coronavirus lockdowns and reopened their economies, while imports edged back into growth, a Reuters poll showed on Friday. 
China's export performance, boosted by record shipments of medical supplies and robust demand for electronic products, has not been as severely affected by the global slowdown as some analysts had feared, adding to hopes for a sustained economic recovery.
Exports in August are expected to have risen 7.1% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of a Reuters poll of 23 economists, compared with a rise of 7.2% in July.
Imports likely rose 0.1% on year, the poll showed, still sluggish but improving after falling 1.4% the previous month.
A private survey on manufacturing activity showed Chinese factories reported the first increase in new export orders this year in August as overseas demand slowly revives. The pick-up in business also led to a further expansion in production, marking the sharpest gain in almost a decade.
Stronger exports could signal a faster and more balanced recovery for the Chinese economy, which is rebounding from a record first-quarter slump thanks largely to domestic stimulus measures.
July exports confounded analysts' expectations by rising the most this year, while some raw material imports hit record highs.
""Exports are back in play to be the key driver for Asia's biggest economy,"" Prakash Sakpal, an economist at ING, said in a note this week. 
However, external demand could suffer if virus control measures have to be re-imposed by trade partners later this year on a resurgence of the epidemic. 
China also is looking to reduce its reliance on overseas markets for its development as U.S. hostility and the pandemic increase external risks that could hamper longer-term progress.
Already heightened U.S.-China tensions are expected to escalate ahead of the U.S. presidential election. China remains well behind on its pledge to boost purchases of U.S. goods under an agreement that was launched in February.
Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials reaffirmed their commitment to a Phase 1 trade deal in a phone call last week. ""Both sides see progress and are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure the success of the agreement,"" the U.S. Trade Representative's office said.

The U.S. Trade Representative's Office said Tuesday it had extended tariff exclusions for a wide range of Chinese goods such as smartwatches and some medical masks but only through the end of 2020, a move that may create some leverage for Washington in trade negotiations but increases uncertainty for businesses.

August is usually one of the quietest months for new car sales and the drop follows an 11% jump in July - the first increase in 2020 - when car showrooms reopened following the coronavirus lockdown.
The SMMT has previously said it could take until the end of September for a clear picture to emerge on trends in the car market as the economy recovers from the coronavirus lockdown.

Around 107,000 jobs ads were posted in the week beginning Aug. 24, taking the total of active postings to 1.12 million. In the first week of August, 126,000 new ads were posted.
""The trend of improvement in hiring we are seeing may be slow, but it is sure,"" Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said.
""But we can't assume an upturn in hiring means we are out of the woods, given the likely scale of job losses this autumn as firms adapt to the new reality.""
Unemployment in Britain is expected to rise as the government winds down its coronavirus job retention scheme which is due to expire on Oct. 31. 
REC said a rise of more than 8% in adverts for air conditioning engineers and legal associate professionals suggested businesses were returning to their offices.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people to get back to their workplaces to help the economy recover from its record 20% contraction in the April-June period.
Separately on Friday, a retailers group reported a modest improvement in the number of shoppers going to high streets and retail parks during August.
Footfall was down by nearly 35% compared with August 2019, a seven percentage-point improvement from July, the British Retail Consortium said.
However, there was a marked upturn in the final week of the month, Andy Sumpter, retail consultant for Europe with ShopperTrak, a research firm, said.

793,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 06:15PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry growth slowed in August, likely as the boost from the reopening of businesses and fiscal stimulus faded. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 56.9 last month from 58.1 in July. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index slipping to 57 in August. 
The services sector has been hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Though new infections have declined, hot spots remain, causing some businesses to be closed again and reopening plans to be scaled back. At the same time, a $600 weekly unemployment supplement funded by the government expired on July 31.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry dropped to a reading of 56.8 last month after surging to a record 67.7 in July. But backlog orders increased and exports orders rebounded.
The survey's index of services industry employment increased to a reading of 47.9 last month from 42.1 in July. Still, the continued contraction in the index buttresses economists' expectations that employment growth slowed further in August.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 1.4 million jobs last month after rising 1.763 million in July. That would leave nonfarm payrolls about 11.5 million below their pre-pandemic level.
The Labor Department is scheduled to release its closely watched employment report for August on Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell below 1 million last week for the second time since the COVID-19 pandemic started in the United States, but that does not signal a strong recovery in the labor market.
The drop in initial claims to a five-month low reported by the Labor Department on Thursday largely reflected a change in the methodology it used to address seasonal fluctuations in the data, which economists complained had become less reliable because of the economic shock caused by the coronavirus crisis.
There are growing signs the labor market recovery from the depths of the pandemic in mid-March through April is faltering, with financial support from the government virtually depleted.
""There are new seasonal adjustment factors this week which brings down the joblessness slightly,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The labor market looks just as bad as it was and it will be a miracle if economic growth can continue at such a fast clip during this recovery if it has to drag along millions and millions of workers without paychecks.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 130,000 to a seasonally adjusted 881,000 for the week ended Aug. 29. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 950,000 applications in the latest week. A staggering 29.2 million people were on unemployment benefits in mid-August.
The Labor Department has switched to using additive factors to more accurately track seasonal fluctuations in the series. The government dropped the multiplicative seasonal adjustment factors it had been using because they could cause systematic over-or under-adjustment of the data in the presence of a large shift in the claims series.
Unadjusted claims rose 7,591 to 833,352 last week. The increase in the raw numbers, which many economists prefer to focus on, added to a raft of data suggesting the labor market recovery was ebbing. 
A report on Wednesday from the Federal Reserve based on information collected from the U.S. central bank's contacts on or before Aug. 24 showed an increase in employment. The Fed, however, noted that ""some districts also reported slowing job growth and increased hiring volatility, particularly in service industries, with rising instances of furloughed workers being laid off permanently as demand remained soft.""
Private employers hired fewer workers than expected in August. In addition, data from Kronos, a workforce management software company, and Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed employment growth stagnated last month.
Another report on Thursday showed job cuts elevated in August amid layoffs by airlines. United Airlines (O:UAL) said on Wednesday it was preparing to furlough 16,370 workers on Oct. 1.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading sharply lower. The dollar (DXY) was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
SEVERE DISTRESS
The weak labor market reports raise the risk of a sharper slowdown in job growth in August than is currently anticipated by financial markets. The government is scheduled to publish August's employment report on Friday. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists nonfarm payrolls likely rose by 1.4 million jobs last month after increasing by 1.763 million in July. That would leave nonfarm payrolls about 11.5 million below their pre-pandemic level.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 1.238 million to 13.254 million in the week ending Aug. 22. Part of the decrease in so-called continuing claims was likely because of people exhausting eligibility for benefits.
The number of people receiving unemployment benefits under all programs jumped 2.2 million to 29.2 million in the week ended Aug. 15.
""While Wall Street hits record highs, much of Main Street remains in severe distress,"" said Ron Temple, head of U.S. Equity at Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Asset Management in New York. ""The pandemic and the federal failure to sustain necessary assistance to households as well as state and local governments are weakening long-term economic growth and social stability.""
Fiscal stimulus boosted economic activity after it nearly ground to a halt following the shuttering of nonessential businesses in mid-March to control the spread of COVID-19. That set up the economy, which plunged into recession in February, for a sharp rebound in the third quarter. 
A $600 weekly unemployment supplement expired in July and funding programs for businesses have also lapsed, leaving the outlook for growth uncertain. Also clouding the growth prospects, the trade deficit jumped 18.9% to a 12-year high of $63.6 billion in July, driven by a record surge in imports. 
While the rise in imports could be blunted by an increase in inventories, export growth was moderate in July. That could threaten a recent acceleration in manufacturing activity.

A fourth report on Thursday showed growth in the services industry slowed in August. The services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, has been hardest hit by the pandemic.

The Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at an 10.1% annualized rate last quarter. That was revised up from the 7.3% pace estimated in August and was the largest rise since the first quarter of 1971.
Productivity fell at a 0.3% rate in the January-March period. Hours worked plunged at a 42.9% rate instead of the 43.0% pace estimated last month. That was the largest drop since the series started in the first-quarter of 1947.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast productivity would be revised up to a 7.5% rate in the second quarter.
Compared to the second quarter of 2019, productivity rose at a 2.8% rate. Growth in unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - rose at a downwardly revised 9.0% rate in the April-June quarter. Unit labor costs were previously reported to have jumped at a 12.2% rate.
Unit labor costs increased at a 9.6% rate in the first quarter. They rose at a 4.9% rate in from a year ago.

(Reuters) - In the countdown to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, the state of the economy is a key concern for many voters.
Americans face a barrage of data, from this Friday's monthly jobs report to what in all likelihood will be a blockbuster economic activity scorecard a mere five days before Election Day.
No one is debating that the United States has been struck by a recession of historic magnitude because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Rather, President Donald Trump says he is best placed to lever signs of a nascent recovery into a return to economic health. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, meanwhile, argues a lack of leadership by Trump - on containing the virus in particular - has made the slump worse than it needed to be.
With two months to go before the election, and less time than that for those planning to mail in their ballots, here is a voter's guide to some of the biggest economic data to watch for.
JOBS
The most highly anticipated read on the state of the labor market comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly jobs report https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm. Just two more are scheduled before Nov. 3.
Next due: Sept. 4, Oct. 2. 
What to look for: U.S. businesses probably created 1.4 million jobs last month, economists polled by Reuters say. Massive, yes, but in fact it would be the smallest monthly increase since the economic rebound began in May. And the economy would still be short about 11 million jobs compared with February. 
""If we continue to see deceleration into the September report released on Oct. 2, the message that we are probably in for a long slow recovery might start to sink in,"" said JP Morgan economist Jesse Edgerton.
What to skip: Average weekly wages, included in the jobs report, have risen dramatically. Usually a sign of a strong labor market, this time it simply reflects bigger job losses among low-wage than high-wage workers, skewing the average upward. As low-wage jobs return, expect wage growth to drop. 
Bonus data: A tally https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf released each Thursday shows the number of people receiving unemployment insurance, currently more than 29 million, with fewer than 1 million filing new claims on a seasonally-adjusted basis in the latest week for just the second time since March. Those numbers remain many times higher than pre-crisis norms. 
GRAPHIC: Jobs fell off a cliff Jobs fell off a cliff - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY-DATA/xlbvglzxepq/chart.png 
SPENDING
Retail sales are back to where they were before the crisis, buoyed by the extra $600 in weekly unemployment insurance benefits paid from March to July. With that payment now down to $300, economists expect that spending fell in August.
Next due: Sept. 16, Oct. 16. 
What to look for: Continued gains in retail sales, as reported by the Commerce Department, would suggest unexpected underlying strength among consumers, whose purchases account for about two-thirds of economic activity. 
Bonus data: The Conference Board releases monthly reads on consumer sentiment, which dropped to a six-year low in August, a signal that spending could be set to weaken. The next reads are released on Sept. 29 and Oct. 27.
GRAPHIC: Retail sales rebound - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY-DATA/oakveoxgbvr/chart.png 
INFLATION
With so many millions of Americans out of work, there is little chance of a sustained surge in prices anytime soon. Indeed, the Federal Reserve is concerned inflation is too sluggish and is keeping borrowing costs low to help nudge it upward. 
Next due: Sept. 11, Oct. 13.
What to look for: The Consumer Price Index, a widely followed measure of inflation, tracks prices for a broad basket of goods and services. ""We are seeing these increases in inflation for goods that matter to the average household"" like groceries and rent, said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. If people feel they have less purchasing power, he said, that tends to hurt the incumbent party. 
GRAPHIC: Inflation creep - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY-DATA/nmopaqdajpa/chart.png 
MANUFACTURING
Factory activity, accounting for just 11% of U.S. output but having a big impact on sentiment about the economy, has fared better than many sectors during the pandemic, in part because manufacturing sites have been able to adapt to social distancing guidelines and other measures to stop the spread of the virus. 
Next due: Oct 1., Nov. 2.
What to watch for: A reading above 50 for the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index means that factory output is increasing; a reading below 50 means that output is shrinking. The latest report showed output at a 21-month high in August.
Bonus data: Within the report is an index for new orders, which can signal the trajectory of future demand for goods. 
GRAPHIC: Factories churning out more goods - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY-USA/qzjvqyozxvx/chart.png 
HOUSING
Even as many people struggle to pay rent, July data from the National Association of Realtors showed the median price of an existing home shot above $300,000 for the first time. 
Next due: Sept. 22, Oct. 22. 
What to look for: Further increases to home prices could deliver a boost to the financial stability and spending power of homeowners.
GRAPHIC: Amid health crisis, home prices rocket to record - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY-DATA/dgkvllaedvb/chart.png 
GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) 
While the U.S. economy shrank at an annual pace of 31.7% in the second quarter - its worst showing since the end of World War Two - it is expected to rebound in the third quarter. 
Next due: Oct. 29. 
What to watch for: It's hard not to see this coming in as a whopper of a number. Republicans and Democrats undoubtedly will spin the data, with Trump likely pointing out, correctly, that it is the biggest quarterly gain ever for the world's biggest economy, and Biden countering, also correctly, that U.S. economic output is still way down from last year. 
CORONAVIRUS CASES
Arguably the single most important piece of data driving the economic outlook. The number of new daily coronavirus cases has moderated in the United States, but a resurgence in the fall could trigger fresh restrictions on economic activity. 

Next due: Every day.

Investing.com -- The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits fell to 881,000 last week, boosting hopes that the recovery in the labor market is gaining momentum despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Economists had forecast a decline to 950,000. The prior week's figure was revised slightly higher to 1.011 million from an initially reported 1.006 million.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, decreased to 13.254 million, the largest weekly drop since May The previous week's figure was also revised downwards to 14.492 million.
The number of people making a continuing claim for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance totalled 13,570,327 in the week to Aug. 15. That was up nearly 2.6 million from a week earlier. The overall number of people receiving all unemployment-related benefits thus rose by 2.20 million to 29.22 million as of the middle of the month.
The BLS said that, as of this month, it had changed the way it adjusts its data to account for seasonal fluctuations in the labor market. It said it would change to an 'additive' system of adjustments and away from a 'multiplicative' one, as the new system should provide a more accurate picture of trends in real time and reduce the need for revisions.
Earlier Thursday, the latest Challenger jobs report showed that job cuts in August totaled 115,762, 56% lower than the 262,649 job cuts announced in July. However, the report noted that an increasing number of companies that initially had temporary job cuts or furloughs are now making them permanent.
U.S. private sector hiring slowed more than expected for a second straight month in August data showed on Wednesday, as government benefits to support workers and employers expired.
The reports come ahead of Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for August, which is expected to show that the U.S. economy added 1.4 million jobs last month, down slightly from 1.76 million in July. The unemployment rate is expected to tick down to 9.8% from 10.2%.
But some analysts are speculating that the jobs report could be weaker than expected after recent poor consumer confidence data pointed to anxiety over rising Covid cases and worries about job prospects."

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone's rebound from its deepest economic downturn on record faltered in August, surveys showed on Thursday, with some countries in the bloc suffering more than others from restrictions imposed to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
Overall growth in the dominant service industry - which has been harder hit than manufacturing from lockdown measures - almost ground to a halt, suggesting the long road to recovery will be bumpy.
Last quarter the bloc's economy contracted 12.1% as lockdowns led to businesses being shuttered and citizens staying home, official data showed.
A Reuters poll last month predicted a bounceback this quarter with growth of 8.1% but said a full recovery would take two years or more. [ECILT/EU]
But as infection numbers have risen some restrictions have been re-imposed, and IHS Markit's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good gauge of economic health, suggested the economy was still floundering.
It sank to 51.9 last month from July's 54.9 - close to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, albeit slightly better than an initial flash reading of 51.6. The services PMI fell to 50.5 from 54.7, better than its flash reading of 50.1.
""The recovery is already cooling down a little bit and it is very uneven among countries. Some countries like Germany have performed relatively well and other countries like Spain and to a lesser extent France are sending more worrying signs,"" said Daniela Ordonez at Oxford Economics. 
While Germany's services PMI fell, it nevertheless remained relatively healthy. French business activity growth also eased, with new orders stagnating as the euro zone's second-biggest economy battled the disruption to trade caused by the pandemic.
On Thursday, the French government detailed its 100 billion euro stimulus plan to erase the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis over two years, lining up billions of euros in public investments, subsidies and tax cuts.
Meanwhile the services PMIs for Italy and Spain, both of which rely heavily on tourism, dropped back below the breakeven mark as travel restrictions put in place by many European countries have hit the summer season.
Greece's economy, also largely reliant on tourism, contracted 14% last quarter, official data showed on Thursday.
In Britain, outside the currency union, the composite PMI was at a six-year high but job losses accelerated in a bleak sign ahead of the closure of the UK government's coronavirus furlough scheme at the end of next month. [GB/PMIS]
WEAK DEMAND
Demand stuttered across the currency union, despite firms cutting prices, and headcount was reduced for a sixth month.
Inflation turned negative last month for the first time since May 2016, official data showed on Tuesday, and the composite output price index remained below the 50 line at 48.5. That was below a flash reading of 49.0 but above July's 48.1.
The European Central Bank would like inflation just below 2% and has already bought record amounts of debt to keep borrowing costs down and support the economy.
ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane recently warned complacency risked entrenching low inflation and reducing price growth expectations, making it even more difficult for the ECB to deliver on its target. Some economists took his words as a hint the bank is preparing to expand stimulus even further.
""It depends on how inflation goes but it is reassuring the ECB is ready to act ... and the pressure is increasing on the ECB to act,"" Ordonez said.

That extra support may be needed as the new business index for the service sector fell below 50 to 49.8 from July's 51.4.

Those working exclusively from home slipped to 20% from 22%, the Office for National Statistics said. That figure stood at

Johnson has urged more people to get back to their workplaces as schools across Britain reopen after the summer holidays.

The ONS said footfall in retail areas hit more than 75% of its level a year earlier in the week starting Aug. 24, largely driven by people returning to high streets.
Counts of cars, pedestrians and cyclists in London and the north east of England returned to around pre-lockdown levels.
However, there was a reminder that Britain is facing higher unemployment as the government winds down its job retention scheme - online job adverts remained around 55% of their 2019 average for a fourth consecutive week, the ONS said.
Separately, a survey published by the Bank of England showed companies expect the hit to sales and employment from the pandemic to last well into next year.""

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 1.3% month-on-month for a 0.4% year-on-year rise. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 1.5% monthly gain and a 3.5% annual increase.
Eurostat said sales of food, drinks and cigarettes were flat month-on-month and 1.5% up year-on-year, but sales of non-food products fell 2.9% on the month and were only 0.5% higher on the year. Sales of textiles, clothes and shoes plummeted 10.6% on the month and 25.8% year-on-year.

The IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a monthly gauge of activity in services and manufacturing companies, rose to a six-year high of 59.1 from 57.0 in July.
Still, that was revised down from a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 60.3, hinting at a weaker end to activity last month.
Some economists view the current strength of the PMI with scepticism because it reflects an inevitable increase in businesses reporting growth as the economy reopens, rather than a recovery in output that could take years.
The survey's index of employment declined for the first time in three months - chiming with widespread reports of layoffs from major employers grappling with the hit from the pandemic.
Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said companies' ability to cope with the withdrawal of economic support measures like the furlough programme was now the ""burning question"".
The government's job retention scheme has supported almost 10 million jobs in total since its launch in April.
""Worryingly, many companies are already preparing for tougher times ahead, notably via further fierce job cutting,"" Williamson said.
""Policymakers face a huge challenge in sustaining this recovery and avoiding a 'bounce and fade' scenario.""

Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of services companies, which account for around half of the country's economic output, fell to 47.7 from 51.9 in July. The 50 line separates growth from contraction, and the survey hit a record low of 7.1 in April.
""August's services data will dash the hopes of those looking for a V-shaped recovery in Spain's services economy as activity fell on the back of a lack of incoming new business,"" said Paul Smith, economics director at IHS Markit.
A sister survey of Spanish manufacturing activity on Monday also showed a decline to 49.9 in August from 53.5 in July.
After the three-month lockdown ended in late June, Spain's economy gradually revived in July. But new outbreaks of the coronavirus and travel restrictions imposed by various European countries have ravaged the summer tourism season.
Since the end of the lockdown in June, Spain has suffered a sharp resurgence in cases as measures were relaxed and mass testing began. The daily number of infections is now close to the March peak.

The Spanish economy contracted 18.5% in the second quarter, the widest margin on record and one of the deepest downturns in the region.

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to 54.0 from July's 54.1, dipping for the second month after June's decade high, but staying above the 50-mark that separates monthly growth from contraction.
The services sector, which accounts for about 60% of the economy and half of urban jobs, had been slower to return to growth initially than large manufacturers, but the recovery has gathered pace in recent months as COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings lifted.
Firms started to hire more in August after six months of layoffs, indicating some recovery in a labour market that has been hit hard by sharp falls in demand and epidemic restrictions earlier in the year. 
Domestic demand drove new orders, with the Caixin survey showing new export businesses received by Chinese services firms contracting again in August, albeit at a slower pace.
However, the growth in new orders was the weakest in four months and dropped below the long-term average.
""The ongoing resumption of work and normalisation of market demand continued to promote the post-epidemic economic recovery,"" said Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group.
Service firms remained optimistic about business prospects as the economy continues to recover from the COVID-19 lockdowns, although a sub-index for confidence in the year dipped from July's multi-year high. 
China returned to growth in the second quarter after a deep slump at the start of the year, but unexpected weakness in domestic consumption underscored the need for more policy support to bolster the recovery.

Investing.com – China’s Caixin services PMI for August came in at 54, just slightly down from July’s reading of 54.1. That said, the index still pointed to a recovery in the sector that has now extended into a fourth consecutive month.
The PMI for August managed to stay above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. In May, the services PMI was 55, then rose to a new high of 58.4 in June, indicating a substantial increase in service sector activity.
“The Caixin China General Services Business Activity Index [services PMI] came in at 54 in August, almost the same as the previous month‘s 54.1. The ongoing resumption of work and normalization of market demand continued to promote the post-epidemic economic recovery,” said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.
The reading indicates developments in the private sector economy by tracking variables such as sales, employment, inventories and prices.
Growth of China’s services sector has remained elevated for four months now. The sector takes up 60% of China’s economy and half of the jobs in the cities. The positive data from the sector indicates the country’s economy is quickening its pace of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The country has been reaping the benefits from its efforts to contain the pandemic, with major cities such as Beijing allowing public gatherings again.
China also unveiled on Monday the official non-manufacturing PMI that covers larger firms in services and construction. The reading came in at 55.2 for August, up from 54.2 in July.
Meanwhile, Japan’s August services PMI came in at 45, slightly below July’s 45.4. Investors now await more PMI figures from Europe and the U.S., alongside U.S. payroll figures, later in the day."

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) declined to 48.8 from 50.0 in July, slipping back below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""After stabilising in July, the economy fell back into a downturn as firms registered a solid drop in new business, in part linked to the rise in VAT charges and ongoing social distancing measures,"" the IHS report said.
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, tripled VAT in July to 15% to boost state coffers badly hit by low oil prices, in a move several economists said will likely slow the economic recovery from the coronavirus downturn.
""Newly-imposed VAT changes stalled consumer spending across the Saudi Arabia economy in August, latest PMI data suggested,"" said David Owen, economist at IHS Markit.
""New business was down solidly from July, as several firms commented that the sharp uptick in prices kept some customers away from markets,"" he said.
Business activity and employment declined for the sixth consecutive month, although the declines were modest and the drop in employment was the slowest since May.
Due to the VAT hike, businesses reported the sharpest increase in input costs since September 2012, as suppliers increased prices of raw materials.
There had been signs of resilient economic activity in July, including annual increases in points of sales transactions and lending to the private sector, data from the central bank, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, showed on Aug. 30.

To stem the impact of the pandemic on small and medium-sized enterprises, the central bank this week extended deferrals on bank payments for three more months.

The final Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched down to a seasonally adjusted 45.0 in August from 45.4 in the previous month, pressured by weakening new business and business expectations.
The survey results will be discouraging news for policymakers who are counting on a pickup in domestic spending to help pull the world's third-largest economy out of a sharp recession.
""The COVID-19 pandemic continued to hang over the Japanese service sector in August, halting previous momentum towards recovery amid fragile customer demand,"" said Andrew Harker, economics director at IHS Markit.
The headline index, which worsened for the first time since April, matched a preliminary reading, with firms reporting a negative impact from a lack of customers and restrictions on activity.
The survey also showed employment conditions in the services sector remained sluggish in August, with firms reporting the same pace of job cuts as in the previous month mainly due to reduced workloads.
Japan's July jobless rate rose to 2.9% and the jobs-to-applicants ratio slipped for a seventh straight month to 1.08, which marked the lowest level since April 2014, the government said this week.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, was largely unchanged in August from the previous month, ticking up to 45.2 from July's final 44.9.

Researcher Springboard said the vacancy rate rose to 10.8% in July, from 9.8% in January 2020, reaching its highest level since January 2014 as Britain's store-based retail sector, outside of food, was hit by a lockdown to counter the pandemic.
Already weak players such as Laura Ashley, Debenhams, Oasis Warehouse, Cath Kidston and Monsoon/Accessorize have all gone into administration, with the loss of thousands of jobs, while other major retailers, including Marks & Spencer (L:MKS), Boots (O:WBA) and John Lewis [JLPLC.UL], are also closing stores.
Britain's store groups were already struggling with high rents and business taxes, tight margins and online competition before the pandemic took a grip on the country's economy.
Springboard said vacancies rose in six out of ten areas, but by far the greatest increase was in Greater London, where the vacancy rate rose by nearly two-thirds.
""This result brings into sharp focus the difficulties faced by large cities in attracting customers back and the impact of this on our bricks and mortar retail landscape,"" Springboard director Diane Wehrle said in a statement.

Springboard said that although shopper numbers improved in August for the third consecutive month, they were still down 30.8% from the same period in 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers hired fewer workers than expected for a second straight month in August, suggesting that the labor market recovery was slowing as the COVID-19 pandemic persists and government money to support workers and employers dries up.
The moderation in job growth was also flagged by another report from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday showing furloughed workers increasingly being laid off permanently in some parts of the country. 
The bulk of hiring last month was by large businesses, with small enterprises posting a modest increase. A $600 weekly unemployment supplement expired on July 31, while a program that gave businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for employee pay has also lapsed.
""The recovery in jobs lost in this pandemic recession was always a weak one,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""But for a second month in a row it is looking like the jobs are not going to come back unless there is more stimulus from Washington to bolster economic demand and keep business activity and consumer spending growing.""
Private payrolls increased by 428,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment Report showed. Data for July was revised higher to show hiring up by 212,000 jobs instead of the initially reported 167,000. The revision still left the July tally out of alignment with the 1.462 million rise in private employment reported by the government last month. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 950,000 in August. 
The ADP report, jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, has fallen short of the government payrolls count since May because of methodology differences. The ADP report is based on active and paid employees on company payrolls. 
The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) counts workers as employed if they received a paycheck during the week that includes the 12th of the month.
When businesses were shuttered in mid-March, millions of workers were either laid off or furloughed. Some economists believe that the return of furloughed workers when most businesses reopened in May boosted the employment numbers reported by the government.
Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told reporters he expected the gap between the ADP and BLS private payrolls to narrow in August. The government is scheduled to publish August's employment report on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls probably increased by 1.250 million jobs in August after rising 1.462 million in July. Such a gain would result in nonfarm payrolls advancing by 1.4 million jobs last month after increasing 1.763 million. That would leave nonfarm payrolls about 11.5 million below their pre-pandemic level.
Separately on Wednesday, the Fed's ""Beige Book"" report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide showed employment rising overall among districts, with gains mostly in manufacturing. 
But the U.S. central bank said ""some districts also reported slowing job growth and increased hiring volatility, particularly in service industries, with rising instances of furloughed workers being laid off permanently as demand remained soft."" 
The Fed also noted that ""firms continued to experience difficulty finding necessary labor, a matter compounded by day care availability, as well as uncertainty over the coming school year and jobless benefits.""
""Risks remain tilted to the downside for recovery in the labor market,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar gained against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
UNCERTAIN OUTLOOK
The moderation in job growth suggested by the ADP report is in line with other labor market indicators. Weekly new applications for unemployment benefits are hovering around 1 million. Data from Kronos, a workforce management software company, showed seasonally adjusted shift growth continued to stagnate in August, while figures from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed little change in employment last month from July.
""In order for the economy to begin to add the number of jobs that continue to be predicted each month, we must first see a significant and sustained increase in overall shift volume growth,"" said Dave Gilbertson, vice president, strategy and operations at Kronos.
United Airlines (O:UAL) said on Wednesday it was preparing to furlough 16,370 workers on Oct. 1. Airlines received $25 billion in government stimulus funds in March to pay wages and protect jobs through September.
Large businesses accounted for 298,000 new jobs last month, while small business payrolls increased 52,000. Medium-sized companies added 79,000 jobs.
Most of the increase in employment in August was in industries directly impacted by the pandemic, including restaurants, leisure and hospitality. There were also gains in temporary help, reflecting the uncertain economic environment.

Manufacturers hired 9,000 workers.

Investing.com -- The rebound in the U.S. labor market appears to have run out of steam in August.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German retail sales fell unexpectedly in July, data showed on Wednesday, dashing hopes that household spending in Europe's largest economy can drive a strong recovery in the third quarter from the coronavirus shock.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has since March unleashed an array of rescue and stimulus measures, financed with record borrowing of 217.8 billion euros, to help companies and consumers get out of the crisis.
The stimulus package includes a temporary cut in value-added tax (VAT) from July 1 until Dec. 31, worth up to 20 billion euros, to give domestic demand an additional push.
But the retail sales figures released by the Federal Statistics Office cast some doubt on whether the measure is working. Some companies are not passing on the tax cut to consumers and shoppers generally seem to be holding back.
Retail sales were down by 0.9% on the month in real terms in July after a revised drop of 1.9% in June and a 13.2% jump in May, when authorities eased lockdown measures.
This missed a Reuters forecast for a 0.5% increase, though retail sales are a volatile indicator often subject to revision.
""The disappointment among German retailers is likely to have been great: The VAT cut on July 1 did not lead to the hoped-for increase in sales, at least in the first month,"" DZ bank economist Michael Holstein said.
But Holstein warned that it was too early to write off the tax cut as ineffective -- it could still help in the coming months.
V-SHAPED RECOVERY
The retail picture was a bit brighter over the past 12 months. On the year, retail sales rose by 4.2% in real terms after an upwardly revised increase of 6.7% the previous month, the data showed.
Compared with February, the month before the outbreak of the pandemic, retail sales were 0.9% higher in real terms in July, the office said, suggesting they managed to recover relatively quickly.
In the first seven months of the year, retailers increased their sales by 2.6% in real terms despite the crisis.
The data revealed huge gaps within the sector. Sales in shops selling textiles, clothes, shoes and leather goods collapsed by more than a quarter in the January-July period. Online retailers increased their sales by a fifth.
The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investment and trade all collapsed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The government on Tuesday revised upwards its 2020 forecast for the economy to shrink by 5.8% this year from a previous estimate of -6.3%. But this would still represent the biggest economic slump since World War Two.

The number of jobless people rose by 0.79% in August, pushing up the national total to 3.80 million and ending a positive trend that began in May when Spain began emerging from one of Europe's strictest coronavirus lockdowns.
The heavily tourism-dependent Balearic Islands were the hardest hit region, registering a 3% rise in unemployment.
The pace of job creation in Spain stagnated in August, with only 6,822 more people with a formal working contract and contributing to social security in that month, compared to an increase of 161,000 in July, the social security minister said on Wednesday. 
Overall, Spain had about 740,000 more jobless people in August than in the same month a year ago. The lockdown prompted by the coronavirus erased some 900,000 jobs in March alone. 
After the three-month lockdown ended in late June, Spain's economy gradually revived in July but new outbreaks of the coronavirus and travel restrictions imposed by various European countries have ravaged the crucial tourism season.
Spending on unemployment benefits fell to 3.2 billion euros in July, according to the last data available. 
""The travel restrictions by European countries have had an impact on unemployment data,"" Secretary of State for Employment Joaquín Pérez Rey told a news conference, with almost all the new jobless focused on the service sector.
The number of workers registered in Spain's ERTE furlough scheme fell by 27% to 812,438 in August.

Since the end of the lockdown in June, Spain has suffered a sharp resurgence in cases as measures were relaxed and mass testing began and the daily number of infections is now close to the March peak. Spain's total tally of COVID-19 cases now stands at 470,973, the highest number in Europe, with 29,152 deaths.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Like many Lebanese expatriates, Nadim Srour wired savings back as a nest egg for his return. Now those deposits have crumbled in an economic crisis and a Beirut blast has destroyed his home.
""Our lives turned 180 degrees,"" said the 43-year-old who returned from the Gulf with his wife and two sons in September 2019 - a month before Lebanon's banking system imploded and a year before the port explosion shattered a swathe of Beirut.
""Now we are ruined.""
His story is far from unique in a nation that piled up a mountain of public debt to rebuild after its 1975-1990 civil war, attracting savers with high interest rates, but squandered most of the cash amid mismanagement and corruption.
The system that some economists likened to a state Ponzi scheme collapsed last year. Banks drew down the shutters on savers like Srour, who now face strict limits on the amount they can withdraw, while the real value of those deposits has been slashed as Lebanon's pound has crashed.
""We have money and they will not give it to us. We are being driven like sheep,"" said Srour, who left the United Arab Emirates after a construction downturn there and has now joined Lebanon's growing ranks of jobless.
A minister in January put the unemployment rate at above 35%. Economic hardship has only deepened since then.
Compounding the crisis, a huge quantity of highly explosive material stacked up in unsafe conditions in a warehouse in Beirut port blew up on Aug. 4, killing more than 190 people and destroying houses - including the apartment of Srour's parents where he had returned to live until he could buy his own place.
A charity helped Srour find a Beirut flat for his family, while his elderly parents and brother, who is unable to work due to childhood injuries sustained in the civil war, have moved to the mountains, a place of refuge in Lebanon's troubled times.
FROZEN SAVINGS
Srour's savings have been frozen for two years under a deal allowing him to convert his Lebanese pounds to dollars. But he can only withdraw at an exchange rate of 3,900 to the dollar, well below the pound's street value which has touched 8,000. The pound was previously pegged to the U.S. currency at 1,500.
Banks also limit how much savers can withdraw. ""Now we stand in line outside the bank and hope we get a turn,"" Srour said.
The curbs have not been formalised as capital controls and the central bank has said deposits would not be subject to a ""haircut"", or a reduction in the total depositors will receive.
But such comments offer little reassurance to Srour or his father, Maurice, who rebuilt his savings once before after a 1980s currency crisis. Although he has money in the bank, his family can only take out the equivalent of $1,000 a month.
""Even if I want to use it to fix my house, the bank won't give it to me,"" Maurice Srour said.
The central bank has instructed Lebanese banks to offer interest-free, dollar loans to help those making repairs. But borrowing at any rate does little for those without salaries.
""I don't want a loan. I want my money,"" said Samir Sfeir, a 75-year-old retiree with cuts on his arms from the port blast.
He can only withdraw $700 a month from the bank and has turned to the generosity of friends to help rebuild his home.
Joe Nader, a 48-year-old bank employee and property owner, has been repairing a furnished apartment building for his 13 tenants. But he struggles to find the dollars suppliers demand.
He said his family ""are selling our possessions for cash: gold, prayer beads, paintings"" to raise the dollars he needs.

For some, like Srour, this is a fresh reminder of why they went abroad to work in the past. And given the chance, he'd leave Lebanon again: ""If we could, we would do so tonight.""

815,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 10:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s economy contracted by the most on record last quarter, with the recovery from the nation’s first recession in almost 30 years buffeted by Victoria state’s renewed Covid outbreak and lockdown.
Gross domestic product plunged 7% from the first three months of the year, the first back-to-back quarterly declines since 1991, statistics bureau data showed in Sydney Wednesday. The slump was larger than economist forecasts of a 6% drop. From a year earlier, it tumbled 6.3% versus an estimated 5.1% fall.
The Australian dollar fell after the report, trading at 73.43 U.S. cents at 12:05 p.m. in Sydney from 73.60 cents.
Australia’s early lifting of restrictions and reopening of its economy is now being offset by an almost two-month lockdown in Melbourne, the nation’s second-largest city with about 5 million people, delaying the recovery.
The central bank and government are working in tandem to try to support the economy, with the former on Tuesday expanding a lending facility to banks to keep credit flowing and the latter extending its labor market assistance package.
Today’s report showed:
The Reserve Bank in March cut its cash rate to a record-low 0.25% and set the same target for the three-year bond yield as it aims to lower borrowing costs across the economy. The RBA predicts the renewed lockdown will lift unemployment to about 10% later this year.
The government, meantime, has injected tens of billions of dollars into the economy including its signature JobKeeper wage subsidy program designed to keep workers attached to firms as it tries to maintain employment connections until activity can resume.
Australia’s record run of avoiding two consecutive quarters of negative GDP, which included avoiding recessions during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the Dot Com Bubble and the 2008 global financial crisis, has come to an end with the largest contraction on record according to ABS data dating back to 1959. It now joins much of the world in succumbing to a pandemic-induced downturn.
On the upside, China’s stimulus to revive its economy is fueling demand for Australian commodity prices, keeping the terms of trade elevated in the second quarter. Australia saw a record current-account surplus of A$17.7 billion ($13.1 billion) in the three months through June, aided by the nation’s closed international borders which is keeping people from traveling abroad.
Yet its trade position has also fueled the nation’s currency, which soared almost 30% from a nadir in March.
The central bank on Tuesday boosted a line of cheap funding to banks to A$200 billion. In addition to supporting the economy, that should also help ease some of the upward pressure on the currency by confirming the RBA’s commitment to keeping conditions accommodative until activity recovers.

816,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers discounted their goods a bit more aggressively in August than in July as they sought to get customers back after the coronavirus lockdown earlier in the year, industry data showed on Wednesday.
Average shop prices in August were 1.6% lower than a year before, compared with a fall of 1.3% in July and a record 2.4% tumble in May, the British Retail Consortium said.
August's fall was driven by bigger price declines of 3.4% for non-food prices, compared with a 2.9% drop in July.
""Many retailers have continued to run promotions and sales in order to entice customers to spend and make up for lost ground during lockdown,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
The availability of fresh, seasonal produce allowed food inflation to ease to 1.3% in August, down from 1.5% in July, Dickinson said.
Figures from the Confederation of British Industry published last week showed an unexpected weakening of retail sales in the first half of August, raising concerns that a bounce-back in consumer spending after the lockdown might be short-lived.

The BRC shop prices survey was conducted between Aug. 3 and Aug. 7.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment is projected to increase by 6 million jobs this decade, with the annual growth rate sharply slower than during the economy's recovery from the Great Recession, according to a government report on Tuesday.
The projections published by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) do not include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and response efforts, and are developed using models based on historical data. 
The coronavirus crisis delivered the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression, with 22 million jobs lost. Only 9.3 million jobs had been recovered by July.
""The 2019-29 projections were finalized in the spring of 2020 when there was still significant uncertainty about the duration and impacts of the pandemic,"" the BLS said.
Employment is projected to increase to 168.8 million over the 2019-29 decade from 162.8 million over the prior period. That reflects an annual growth rate of 0.4%, significantly slower than the 2009-19 pace of 1.3%, which was bolstered by recovery from the 2007-09 recession. 
The healthcare and social assistance industry is projected to add the most new jobs, and six of the 10 fastest-growing occupations are related to healthcare, the BLS said. 
The long-term projections are intended to capture structural changes in the economy, not cyclical fluctuations. The projected pedestrian employment growth pace reinforces economists' belief that it could take years for the labor market to recoup the jobs lost during the pandemic.
A moderate pace of economic growth is also projected. Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product is forecast rising 1.8% annually from 2019 to 2029, down from 2.3% in the prior decade.
The labor force is expected to increase by 8.0 million to 171.5 million in 2029. The labor force participation rate, the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, is forecast falling to 61.2% in 2029 from 63.1% in 2019.
""The decline in labor force participation is due to the aging of the baby-boom generation, a continuation of the declining trend in men's participation, and a slight decline in women's participation,"" the BLS said. ""By 2029, all baby boomers will be at least 65 years old."" 

Worker productivity is seen increasing 1.8% from 1.1% during the 2009-19 decade.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity increased more than expected in August as new orders surged to their highest level in over 16-1/2 years, but employment at factories continued to lag amid safety restrictions intended to slow the spread of COVID-19.
The upbeat report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) strengthened expectations for a sharp rebound in economic activity this quarter, though the outlook is uncertain as money from the government dries up. Manufacturing is not out of the woods yet as the coronavirus crisis lingers. 
Factory activity is being driven by demand for goods used at home like electronics while capital investment remains weak. The ISM said manufacturers described sentiment as ""generally optimistic, though to a lesser degree compared to July."" The economy, which slipped into recession in February, suffered its deepest contraction in at least 73 years in the second quarter.
""The economy isn't back to normal regardless of what these upbeat surveys of purchasing manager executives are telling us,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Time will tell if companies should be more vigilant about expansion plans. Government pandemic stimulus programs are starting to sputter, and attempts to limit bankruptcies and foreclosures, and those paycheck protection schemes, are all set to fade.""
The ISM said its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 56.0 last month from 54.2 in July. That was the highest level since November 2018 and marked three straight months of growth. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 54.5 in August.
Underscoring the uneven landscape, manufacturers of transportation equipment said ""airline industry continues to be under great pressure."" Makers of machinery said ""capital equipment new orders have slowed again.""
In contrast, manufacturers of electrical equipment, appliances and components reported ""strong demand from existing and new customers."" Similar sentiments were echoed by makers of chemical, wood and fabricated metal products. 
Fifteen industries including wood, primary metals and computer and electronic products reported growth in August. Printing and related support activities, petroleum and coal, and furniture and related products contracted.
""Manufacturers tied to services hit hard by the pandemic continue to struggle,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte North Carolina. ""As the pandemic drags on... manufacturers, even those tied most tightly to goods spending, are hardly in the clear.""
For now manufacturing is chugging along, and also picked up across the world in August. Factory activity in China expanded at the fastest clip in nearly a decade last month, while manufacturing remained on a recovery path in the euro zone.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
EMPLOYMENT TRAILING
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index increased to a reading of 67.6 in August, the strongest since January 2004, from 61.5 in July. Fifteen industries reported an increase in demand. Only one industry said orders declined. A measure of customers' inventories dropped to its lowest level since June 2010, an indication that orders could rise further.
The survey's measure of order backlogs at factories increased as did orders for exports.
Though factory employment continued to improve last month, it remained in contraction territory. The ISM's manufacturing employment measure rose to a reading of 46.4 from 44.3 in July. This measure has now contracted for 13 straight months. 
According to the ISM ""companies and suppliers operated in reconfigured factories, with limited labor application due to safety restrictions."" It said ""long-term labor market growth remains uncertain.""
Factory employment was already in decline before the coronavirus crisis because of the Trump administration's trade war with China. Its struggle to rebound even as orders received by factories are rising fits in with economists' views that the labor market is losing steam after being boosted by the reopening of businesses in May. 
The government's closely followed employment report to be released on Friday is expected to show 1.4 million jobs created in August after 1.763 million were added in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would leave nonfarm payrolls about 11.5 million below their pre-pandemic level.
Even with manufacturing now in what some economists say is a V-shaped recovery, business investment remains lackluster. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed construction spending edged up 0.1% in July after falling 0.5% in June, confounding economists' expectations for a 1.0% rebound. While low mortgage rates boosted investment in homebuilding, outlays on nonresidential construction projects such as office infrastructure and power fell, potential headwinds to manufacturing.
Spending on public construction projects tumbled 1.3%, with big declines in education, highways and streets.

""Public construction will continue to be held down as state and local budgets are squeezed by the pandemic,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
 
"
819,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending barely rose in July as an increase in outlays on private projects was almost offset by a plunge in public construction projects.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that construction spending edged up 0.1%. Data for June was revised to show construction outlays falling 0.5% instead of decreasing 0.7% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would rebound 1.0% in July. Construction spending dipped 0.1% on a year-on-year basis.
Spending on private construction projects advanced 0.6%, boosted by investment in homebuilding amid record-low mortgage rates. Spending on residential projects surged 2.1%, eclipsing a 1.0% drop in outlays on nonresidential construction projects such as manufacturing and power plants. 

Spending on public construction projects tumbled 1.3%.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 55.1 in August, its highest level since the same month two years ago, from 52.9 in July. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
In April, when many businesses were closed to help contain the coronavirus pandemic, the index slumped to a record low of 33.0.
The data ""highlighted a strong upturn in the Canadian manufacturing industry, continuing the recovery from the severe second quarter downturn,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
""Production and order book volumes both expanded at the fastest pace in two years, driven by the reopening of client businesses and improvements in customer demand,"" Patel said.
On Friday, a flash estimate from Statistics Canada showed that Canada's gross domestic product increased 3% in July, edging economic activity closer to pre-pandemic levels. 
The PMI's measure of new export orders showed that foreign demand for Canadian goods expanded for the first time in six months, while the employment index climbed to its highest level since January 2019.

On a more cautious note, IHS Markit said that transportation delays, reduced staff and pandemic restrictions contributed to one of the steepest deteriorations in supplier performance since the start of the survey and input price inflation accelerated to a 19-month high.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation turned negative last month for the first time since May 2016, raising chances that the European Central Bank will have to inject yet more stimulus to generate price growth which has undershot its target for over seven years.
Annual inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell to minus 0.2% in August from 0.4% in July, underperforming analysts' expectations for a reading of 0.2% and a far cry from the ECB's target of just under 2%.
Worryingly for policymakers, underlying inflation also tumbled, suggesting that the bloc's deepest recession in living memory is not just a temporary shock but could prove to become a bigger and longer-lasting drag on consumer prices.
Inflation excluding volatile fuel and unprocessed food prices, which is closely watched by the ECB, fell to 0.6% from 1.3% while an even narrower measure, which also excludes alcohol and tobacco, slowed to 0.4% from 1.2%. Both were far below analysts' expectations.
""There is no escaping the disinflationary effects of the crisis, at least over the coming quarters,"" Pictet Wealth Management Strategist Frederik Ducrozet said. 
""We stick with our view that the ECB will ultimately increase the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme envelope again, most likely by 500 billion euros in December.""
Energy prices tumbled 7.8% year-on-year in August after an 8.4% fall in July. Prices of non-industrial goods also declined by 0.1% after a 1.6% increase in July.
As coronavirus restrictions pushed the euro zone economy into freefall this year, the ECB acted quickly, buying record amounts of debt to keep borrowing costs down and lending banks more than 1 trillion euros at negative interest rates.
But even with this stimulus in place, ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane recently warned that complacency risked entrenching low inflation and reducing price growth expectations, making it even more difficult for the ECB to deliver on its target. 
Some economists took his words as a hint that the ECB is preparing to expand stimulus even further. But others noted that one-off, temporary factors had skewed inflation readings over the summer and that a mechanical rebound later is likely.

ECB policymakers next meet on Sept. 10 and while no major policy moves are expected, economists still expect further stimulus before the year end.

The region was hit hard by the initial coronavirus outbreak, as businesses and daily life came to a virtual halt and foreign trade sank.
Updated gross domestic product data this week showed a year-on-year contraction of 8.2%-13.6% in countries across the region, with Hungary the worst hit and Poland and the Czech Republic faring better than expected.
Sentiment indicators are giving some hope the worst is over even if a slower recovery is seen.
In Poland, manufacturing activity improved more slowly in August as demand stagnated, with IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) falling to 50.6 last month from 52.8 in July.
The Czech Markit PMI rose to 49.1 in August from 47.0 in July, its best reading since December 2018 but still below the 50 mark that divides contraction from expansion.
In Hungary, a similar PMI survey by the Association of Logistics, Purchasing and Inventory Management rose to 52.8.
Katarzyna Rzentarzewska, an economist at Erste Group Bank, said data was pointing to a recovery shaped more like the  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) brand's ""Swoosh"" than a ""V"", assuming no broad lockdowns again. 
""Rising infections ... may affect the pace or dynamics of this recovery so we may see some uncertainty or cautiousness but at this point it is not translating into worsening market conditions,"" she said.
Central Europe, like western Europe, has seen an uptick in COVID-19 cases since the summer, leading Hungary to shut its borders to most foreign tourists in September. Governments are seeking to avoid nationwide lockdowns.
""(Manufacturing) optimism for the next 12 months persists but has faded in the face of the uncertain epidemic situation,"" Poland's Alior Bank said.
Capital Economics said the PMIs indicated industrial out growth of around 3% in Poland in the third quarter and around 5% in Hungary.
""Industrial sectors are likely to recover further over the coming months, although the pace of the rebound is likely to slow,"" Liam Peach, emerging Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany expects the economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to be less severe than originally feared this year, but it now sees a weaker rebound for Europe's largest economy next year, two sources told Reuters on Tuesday.
The government revised upward its economic forecast for 2020 to a decline of 5.8% from a previously expected slump of 6.3%, said two people with knowledge of the figures.
Still, this would be the biggest plunge since the end of World War Two. During the world financial crisis, the German economy contracted by 5.7%.
For 2021, the government revised downward its growth forecast to an expansion of 4.4% from its previous estimate of 5.2%, said the two people who both spoke on condition of anonymity.
This means the German economy will not reach its pre-pandemic level before 2022.
An economy ministry spokesman declined to comment.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier will present the updated outlook later on Tuesday (0900 GMT) after the economy suffered its worst recession on record in the first half of the year.
The updated GDP forecast will form the basis of tax revenue estimates, which the finance ministry is expected to update next week, and with them the 2021 budget, which Finance Minister Olaf Scholz is expected to present later this month.

The PMI's output component -- which IHS Markit says can give a better guide to the sector's strength than the headline figure -- rose to its highest since May 2014.
The index levels represent the pace of growth rather than the amount of output, however, and the sector has a long way to go to get back to where it was before the lockdown.
Job losses were widespread at the businesses surveyed.

Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit, said the recovery was not widespread as some German manufacturers were still struggling with weak demand.
""The encouraging top line numbers mask ongoing troubles in some sectors, especially machinery and equipment production, which is being hit by a lack of appetite for investment,"" he said.

Investing.com – A private survey showed that Chinese factory activity expanded at the fastest rate in nearly a decade over the year’s first new export orders, with manufacturers raising production to meet the increased demand.
Chains said on Tuesday that the Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for August increased to 53.1, higher than July’s figure of 52.8 and the forecasted 52.6 prepared by Investing.com. The reading indicated a fourth consecutive month of growth and the biggest rate of expansion since January 2011.
The Chinese economy continues to make progress in the economic recovery from COVID-19, with the export orders a potential signal of a more durable and broad recovery ahead. The orders came on the back of countries loosening COVID-19 restrictions to kickstart their own economic recoveries
However, August’s manufacturing and non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMIs), released on Monday, struck a note of caution. Monday’s data showed that factory activity grew at a slightly slower pace in August, attributable to flooding in parts of China over the summer, but the services sector was at its strongest level since 2018.
China’s labor market saw more companies hiring to meet the increased production needs, but unemployment remains a concern
“Employment remained an important focus. An expansion of employment relies on long-term improvement in the economy. Macroeconomic policy supports are essential, especially when there are still many uncertainties in domestic and overseas economies,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in in a commentary accompanying the data release.
He added that employment was reaching a “turning point” as factories’ backlogs of work rose at a faster pace.
Meanwhile, Chinese factories’ business optimism towards the year ahead remained strong overall but saw a slight dip in August over fears of COVID-19's long-term severity."

Purchasing managers’ indexes for Japan and South Korea improved in August, to 47.2 and 48.5, according to IHS Markit figures, their strongest performance since February. Taiwan’s reading continued to stay above 50, the dividing line between contraction and expansion, recording 52.2 for the month for its best showing in two years.
A private gauge of China’s factory activity grew at the fastest pace in August since January 2011, helped by improving exports and continued domestic recovery. The Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose for the fourth consecutive month to 53.1 from July’s 52.8, beating the median estimate of 52.5.
“Asia’s purchasing managers’ indexes, on balance, showed the economic recovery extending into August but also revealed that some parts of the region stumbled,” said Chang Shu, chief Asia economist for Bloomberg Economics.
For Taiwan, the bumper performance was driven by better new orders and improving output, according to Annabel Fiddes, associate director at IHS Markit.
“Companies frequently mentioned that the reopening of clients and resumption of operations, both at home and overseas, had helped to lift sales,” Fiddes said in a release. “Furthermore, firms recorded the first increase in export orders since January, adding to hopes that the global economic recovery is gaining momentum.”
Indexes in Southeast Asia showed some setbacks. While Indonesia advanced into expansion territory, Malaysia slipped below the 50 dividing line, and the Philippines and Vietnam retreated further into contraction.
A separate report Monday showed Chinese economic activity continued to rebound in August, with a gauge of the services industry at the strongest level since early 2018 while the expansion in manufacturing activity slowed slightly. The non-manufacturing gauge rose to 55.2 from July’s 54.2, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday. The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index moderated to 51 from 51.1 a month earlier.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese firms slashed spending on plant and equipment by the most in a decade in the second quarter, the government said on Tuesday, suggesting the economy will take a protracted period to fully rebound from the coronavirus-induced slump. 
Separate private-sector data showed that factory activity in August shrank at the slowest pace in six months, reducing some pressure on policymakers to act more aggressively to prevent a deeper recession. Other official data pointed to worsening labour market conditions.
The fall in spending comes after the government called a state of emergency early in the second quarter in a bid to tackle the health crisis, which also led to sharp declines in corporate profits and sales in the quarter.
Capital spending shed 11.3% in April-June year-on-year, the biggest drop since the first quarter of 2010, as the COVID-19 crisis hit investments by the manufacturing as well as service sector, Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed on Tuesday.
""The deceleration in capital spending is likely to become stronger in the second half of the fiscal year,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
""Production has fallen considerably so there are more moves to put off spending as it isn't seen as being necessary or urgent for the time being.""
Tuesday's sharp decline followed a 0.1% rise in the first three months of the year. On a seasonally-adjusted basis, capital expenditure lost 6.3% quarter-on-quarter in April-June.
The negative data will be used to calculate revised second-quarter gross domestic figures (GDP) due on Sept. 8 of the initial estimate for a 27.8% decline - with some economists expecting a downward revision based on Tuesday's data. 
While analysts expect the economy to fare better in the current quarter after the state of emergency was ended in late May, many forecast any rebound to be modest and a recovery to take years.
JOBLESS RATE EDGES UP
Japan's seasonally adjusted jobless rate ticked up to 2.9% in July, separate government data showed, compared to a median forecast for 3.0% in a Reuters poll of economists.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio slipped for the seventh straight month in July, dropping to 1.08 from 1.11 in the previous month to mark the lowest reading since April 2014 - meaning fewer than six jobs were available per five job-seekers.
Japan is also in the midst of a leadership change after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday he will step down due to worsening of a chronic illness, raising uncertainty about the outlook for monetary and fiscal policies.
The government expects the economy will recover to pre-coronavirus levels around the first quarter of 2022, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said last week.
The latest MOF survey showed manufacturers' business spending fell 9.7% from a year earlier, following a 5.3% drop in the previous quarter.
Corporate recurring profit tumbled 46.6% in the April-June quarter year-on-year, the biggest drop since the second quarter of 2009, due to declining demand for cars and other transportation goods.

Sales dropped 17.7% year-on-year in April-June, down for the fourth straight quarter to mark the biggest drop since January-March 2009.

831,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING(Reuters) - China's factory activity expanded at the fastest clip in nearly a decade in August, bolstered by the first increase in new export orders this year as manufacturers ramped up production to meet rebounding demand, a private survey showed on Tuesday. 
The world's second-biggest economy has largely managed to bounce back from the coronavirus crisis, and the emerging bright spot in the forward-looking gauge of export orders could herald a more durable and broad-based recovery for the Chinese economy in the months to come. 
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) rose to 53.1 last month from July's 52.8, marking the sector's fourth consecutive month of growth and the biggest rate of expansion since January 2011.
It beat analysts' forecasts for a slight dip to 52.6. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The upbeat findings contrasted with an official survey on Monday, which showed China's factory activity grew at a slightly slower pace in August as floods across southwestern China disrupts production, but there were positive signs in both PMIs.
The official PMI's improving trend in new export orders was similar to the private survey, while the former also showed solid growth in the crucial services sector in a boost to the economy's continued recovery from the coronavirus shock.
In Tuesday's Caixin, Chinese factories reported the first increase in new export orders this year in August as overseas countries eased COVID-19 restrictions to kick start their economies. The pick-up in business also led to a further expansion in production, marking the sharpest gain in almost a decade. 
The labour market also saw signs of improvement, with some companies increasing recruitment to meet production needs, although the gauge of employment continued to stay in negative territory for the eight straight month.
Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, said a turning point is approaching for employment as factories' backlogs of work rose at a faster pace. 
""Employment remained an important focus. An expansion of employment relies on long-term improvement in the economy. Macroeconomic policy supports are essential, especially when there are still many uncertainties in domestic and overseas economies,"" said Wang, in a commentary accompanying the data release. 
A mirror factory in the Chinese city of Yiwu, which supplies to retail giants such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), has been inundated with new business beyond the factory's current operating capacity, with the management sending the entire sales team down to factory floors, a 23-year-old salesman at the company told Reuters. 
""We laid off workers when the pandemic first started but now, with this many orders, we cannot find enough people,"" said the salesman, adding that the firm was having issues booking shipments as finished goods piled up at their warehouses. 
Business optimism towards the year ahead among Chinese factories remained strong overall, although it dipped slightly in August. Firms are concerned about the severity of the global pandemic over the long term.

The world's third-largest economy is expected to see a modest bounce in the current quarter after a record slump in April-June as new coronavirus cases keep a lid on consumer sentiment and slow the overall recovery.
Tuesday's final au Jibun Bank Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 47.2 in August from 45.2 in July. It marked the slowest contraction since February, and also eclipsed a preliminary reading of 46.6.
""The easing of restrictions related to COVID-19 around the world helped to soften falls in key metrics such as production and new work,"" said Annabel Fiddes, economics associate director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
But the pandemic continued to limit the performance of the sector as a whole, with firms feeling pressured to cut their prices due to relatively weak demand.
Another month of shrinkage in overall output and new orders held the headline index below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for a 16th month, matching a similar run through June 2009.
Many analysts expect only a modest third-quarter rebound, while a firmer recovery is expected to take time as a resurgence in global infections and uncertainty over the outlook for U.S.-China trade threaten overseas demand.
Japan is also dealing with a leadership issue after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced his resignation Friday due to the worsening of a chronic illness, stirring doubts about future fiscal and monetary stimulus policies.
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura last week said he hoped the economy will recover to levels seen before the coronavirus around the first quarter of 2022.

""It is hoped that as economies around the world reopen and business operations normalise, this will feed through to... a recovery of Japanese manufacturing activity in the months ahead,"" said Fiddes.

That was the sharpest contraction since the final quarter of 2008 when the economy decreased by 3.3%.
The economy, Asia's fourth-largest, slipped into technical recession - two straight quarters of decline - in the June quarter, joining its peers Japan, Thailand and Singapore.
A 16.1% plunge in exports of goods and services was the biggest drag on the trade-reliant economy, though it was revised up from a July estimation of a 16.6% decline, still marking the worst contraction since the final quarter of 1963.
Private consumption, which generates nearly half of the nation's gross domestic product, grew a revised 1.5% in sequential terms, slightly better than a 1.4% rise estimated earlier.

835,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Italian companies slashed investment and consumers cut back on spending during the coronavirus lockdown in the second quarter, sending the economy into a record contraction.
Figures from statistics office Istat showed household spending fell 11.3% in the period, and exports dropped 26.4%. Investment plunged 14.9%, with transport investment down about 20%. The economy shrank 12.8% in the three months, slightly worse than an initial estimate.
A strict national lockdown in Italy, the original European epicenter of the virus, took a heavy toll on the economy. The government forecasts that GDP will contract 8% in 2020, a projection that looks optimistic next to the 10% predicted by economists, and the European Commission’s 11%.
There’s also been a huge fallout on Italy’s public finances after the government ramped up health and stimulus spending to counter the pandemic. Debt was already projected to exceed 150% of GDP this year even before the latest tranche of spending. The government has so far approved about 100 billion euros ($119 billion) in stimulus to try to save the economy.
Some of that money will come from Europe, with Italy expected to receive the biggest share of a 750 billion-euro recovery fund approved by European Union. Conte told the Senate in Rome last month that the country will benefit from total funding of 209 billion euros in grants and loans under the package.

The world's second-biggest economy has largely managed to bounce back from the health crisis, though intensifying Sino-U.S. tensions over a range of issues and the global demand outlook remain a risk factor. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell slightly to 51 in August from 51.1 in July, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Monday. It remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts had expected it to pick up a touch to 51.2.
China's vast industrial sector is steadily returning to the levels seen before the pandemic paralysed huge swathes of the economy, as pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure expansion and surprisingly resilient exports propel a recovery, but the recovery remains uneven.
A sub-index for the activity of small firms stood, however, at 47.7 in August, down from July's 48.6, with over half of them reporting a lack of market demand and more than 40% of them reporting financial strains, Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician with the NBS, said in a separate statement. 
""In addition, some companies in Chongqing and Sichuan reported an impact from the heavy rains and floods, resulting in a prolonged procurement cycle for raw materials, reduced orders and a pullback in factory production.""
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, also showed the sub-index for new export orders stood at 49.1 in August, improving from 48.4 a month earlier and suggesting a bottoming out in the contractionary trend after COVID hit. 
""The growth engine is now clear. Overseas demand will only pick up slowly and travel restrictions will only be relaxed if COVID-19 cases subside overseas. Until then China will rely more on its own for economic growth,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China chief economist at ING. 
Economic indicators ranging from trade to producer prices all suggest a further pick up in the industrial sector. Profits at China's industrial firms last month grew at the fastest pace since June 2018, data showed on Thursday.
SERVICES SHINE
Activity in the construction sector, a powerful domestic growth driver, also eased in August, likely due to the floods in Southern China. But analysts are confident that as the torrential rains recede, Beijing's infrastructure push - on the back of accommodative policies - would further bolster growth. 
The official non-manufacturing PMI, which includes services and construction sectors, rose to 55.2 from 54.2 in July, the NBS survey showed. 
Investment bank HSBC expects China's economy would grow by 5.4% in the third quarter year-on-year, followed by a 6.2% expansion in the fourth quarter, returning China's growth to pre-COVID levels. 
But some analysts fear that the recovery could stall, hurt by rising tensions between Washington and Beijing and as another wave of local infections returns in the winter. Moreover, the continued rise in the number of COVID-19 cases across many countries, led by India and the United States, remain a risk to the outlook. 
The economy, which grew 3.2% in the second quarter year-on-year, is set to expand 2.2% this year - the weakest in over three decades.
Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said the services sector uptick suggested an encouraging broadening out of the recovery.

""This is consistent with our view that an investment-led rebound would eventually also shore up consumer sentiment and household spending, keeping the overall economic recovery on track.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output rose in July at the fastest pace on record, driven by automobiles and car parts, signaling a gradual recovery from the blow delivered by the coronavirus pandemic.
But retail sales fell for a fifth straight month and at a somewhat faster pace, a worrying sign for private consumption, which accounts for more than half of the world's third-largest economy.
Monday's data underscored the fragility of an economy that suffered a record 27.8% contraction in the April-June quarter as the pandemic took a heavy toll on both domestic and external demand.
While analysts believe the economy has bottomed out after lockdowns were lifted in late May, they say any rebound will be modest amid worries about a second wave of infections.
""The bounce-back in factory output will run its course in August and we expect a pullback in production in October-December,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior market economist at Mizuho Securities.
""Factory output will fluctuate from now on to settle in at about 90% of the pre-coronavirus crisis level,"" he said.
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) data showed Japan's industrial output grew 8.0% in July from the previous month, versus economists' median estimate of a 5.8% gain and following a 1.9% increase in June.
The growth rate was the fastest on record going back to 1978, the government said. 
It was also the second straight month of gains after having hit its lowest level in May since the global financial crisis. 
Manufacturers surveyed by METI expect output to increase 4.0% in August and grow 1.9% in September.
METI officials said industrial output will continue to improve but activity would remain below pre-crisis levels for some time. The officials said they were closely watching the impact of a resurgence in coronavirus infections. 
Compared with a year earlier, output was down 16.1%.
Highlighting weak consumer demand, however, retail sales fell 2.8% year-on-year in July, worse than a 1.7% drop seen by economists in a Reuters poll and following a 1.3% drop in June, separate METI data showed on Monday.
Declines in car demand dragged down overall retail sales, and department stores and supermarkets suffered from sluggish consumer activity amid a surge in new COVID-19 cases.
Clothing demand also suffered, while oil product sales fell reflecting declines in crude oil prices, the data showed.

On a seasonally-adjusted basis, retail sales fell 3.3% month-on-month in July, posting the first drop in three months.

Industrial production in July rose by a seasonally-adjusted 1.6% from a month earlier, Statistics Korea said on Monday, down from 7.2% in June and slightly missing the median forecast of a 1.9% rise.
But the economic recovery may lose momentum as South Korea extended Phase 2 social distancing rules - the second-strictest level - for at least another week and toughened restrictions on some businesses to battle the resurgence of the virus in August.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased more than expected in July, boosting expectations for a sharp rebound in economic growth in the third quarter, though momentum is likely to ebb as the COVID-19 pandemic lingers and money from the government runs out.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed a rise in personal income after two straight monthly declines, but a chunk of the increase was from unemployment benefits, which were bolstered by a weekly $600 supplement from the government that expired on July 31. Both consumer spending and income remain well below their pre-pandemic levels. 
""The consumer is back spending at the shops and malls in July, but many of their purchases reflected pent-up demand following the pandemic lockdown,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The expenditures needed to fuel the economy's recovery in August are a big question mark given the hit to personal income nationwide with the loss of those $600 weekly unemployment benefit checks.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 1.9% last month, after jumping 6.2% in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would gain 1.5% in July. July's increase left consumer spending about 4.6% percent below its February level.
Consumers boosted purchases of goods like new motor vehicles. They also lifted spending on healthcare, dining out and hotel and motel accommodation. While spending on goods has rebounded above its pre-pandemic level, outlays on services are about 9.7% from recovery as consumers remain wary of exposure to the coronavirus. 
That is a bad omen for the services-based economy, which fell into recession in February. Though new COVID-19 infections have subsided after a broad resurgence through the summer, many hot spots remain, especially at college campuses that have reopened for in-person learning. 
The economy suffered its deepest contraction in at least 73 years in the second quarter, with consumer spending at the forefront of the decline in gross domestic product. While economists are anticipating a sharp rebound in GDP in the third quarter, led by consumer spending, they are cutting estimates for the fourth quarter.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher while the dollar (DXY) was down against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose.
CONDITIONS UNFAVORABLE
Americans in low-wage jobs have borne the brunt of the economic downturn. Though President Donald Trump extended the jobless benefit supplement, the payout was cut to $300 per week and funding for the program is expected to be depleted by September.
A handful of states are offering the extra unemployment benefit. Economists estimate the loss of the $600 could cut $50 billion from retail sales in August. At least 27 million people are on unemployment benefits.
A survey on Friday from the University of Michigan showed a modest gain in consumer sentiment this month. According to the survey, half of all consumers expected the economy to improve in the year ahead, but many of them viewed the overall economic conditions as unfavorable.
In July, income rose 0.4%, in part as the reopening of more businesses lifted wages. Income fell 1.0% in June. It remains 5% below February's level. Wages gained 1.3%.
Unemployment assistance paid out $1.364 trillion last month, down from $1,470 in June. Economists expect the reduced unemployment benefits supplement will cut income by about $70 billion in August. 
With the saving rate at a lofty 17.8%, some believe consumer spending will remain supported for the rest of the third quarter. But others say worries about the economy and the virus' persistence could make consumers reluctant to dip into savings. The saving rate slipped from 19.2% in June. 
""It's important to note that the pace of decline in the savings rate has slowed markedly,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Beyond the mechanical third-quarter rebound, more timely figures confirm that the demand recovery has lost some momentum."" 
Prospects for third-quarter GDP growth were boosted by another report from the Commerce Department on Friday showing retail inventories rebounding 1.2% in July after declining for several months. That could offset a drag from rising imports, which led to the goods trade deficit widening 11.7% to $79.3 billion in July. Imports increased 11.8%, matching the gain in exports.
July's solid increase in spending boosted monthly consumer prices, though overall inflation remained muted. The Federal Reserve on Thursday rolled out a sweeping rewrite of its mandate, putting new weight on the labor market and less on worries about too-high inflation.

The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.3% in July, matching June's advance. In the 12 months through July, the so-called core PCE price index climbed 1.3% after increasing 1.1% in June. The core PCE index is the preferred inflation measure for the Fed's 2% target, which is now a flexible average.

While remaining well below pre-crisis levels and the long-term average, the monthly indicator which gauges confidence in the economy soared to 87.7 points from 82.4 in July, above the 85.0 point average forecast of economists polled by Reuters.
The new pick-up, confirming the gradual rebound from May, was driven mostly by higher optimism in the service sector, the largest in the 19-country currency bloc. It remains in negative territory, but rose to -17.2 in August from -26.2 in July.
Confidence also rose in the industry and retail trade sectors, although factory managers' production expectations edged down after three consecutive monthly increases that pulled them to above pre-crisis levels.
Consumer confidence posted a slight recovery to -14.7 points from -15.0, confirming preliminary estimates released by the Commission earlier in August.
Consumer price expectations edged down, with a slightly higher appetite for major purchases in the coming twelve months, and a slight reduction in such major spending for now, the survey showed.
The employment expectations indicator continued to improve for the fourth month running, while confidence in the construction sector slightly worsened. 

Among the bloc's largest economies, sentiment improved markedly in France, the Netherlands and Germany. It also rose in Italy, but it fell in Spain.

843,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 04:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- French consumer spending rose less than forecast in July and Spanish retail sales continued to decline, a reminder that the strong rebound seen after the end of the coronavirus lockdowns could lose steam.
Spending in France increased 0.5% from the previous month, far below the 1.2% expected by economists. The figures came alongside a report showing the economy shrank 13.8% in the second quarter, unrevised from an initial estimate.
In Spain, retail sales dropped almost 4% year-on-year, in the fifth straight monthly decline. A lack of tourists because of the pandemic has been a huge hit to the economy, with the biggest decline in sales seen in holiday regions such as Mallorca and Ibiza.
Economies across Europe bounced back strongly once restrictions to contain infections were lifted, but the big question is the longer-term sustainability of the recovery.
A recent acceleration in the daily count of coronavirus cases in several countries is adding to worries and may keep consumers at home. It also increases the risk that governments will put in place more restrictions. From Friday, mask-wearing is obligatory on the streets of Paris.
The other major risk is unemployment. Governments spent billions of euros on measures to protect workers’ incomes and help businesses, but that aid won’t last forever, and job cuts could mount. That would also hit household confidence and could push people to hold on to savings accrued during lockdown rather than spend the cash.
The Bank of France estimates households put aside an extra 80 billion euros ($95 billion) by the end of July, and that figure will likely rise to 100 billion euros by the end of the year.
Figures due later on Friday are forecast to show a pickup in euro-area economic confidence in August. While that keeps the recovery moving in the right direction, the index is still well below its pre-crisis level."

One of Europe's strictest lockdowns put the euro zone's second biggest economy into an unprecedented tailspin in the quarter. It had already contracted 5.9% in the previous three months. 
With most shops, cafes and hotels closed from mid-March to May 11, unspent cash pushed the household savings rate up to a record 27.4% of disposable income, while consumer spending - the traditional driver of the French economy - dropped 16.4% in the quarter.
Meanwhile, in the corporate sector, companies saw their profit margins fall to 26%, the lowest since the end of 1983, INSEE's data showed.
After most businesses were able to reopen in May, activity quickly surged, although there has been some signs that the catch-up is easing after the initial rebound.

Going into the third quarter, consumer spending rose 0.5% in July from June, slowing from a surge of 10.3% in June, INSEE said in a second release. That fell short of economists' average forecast for an increase of 2.0% in a Reuters poll.

845,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German consumer morale worsened heading into September, casting some doubt on whether household spending in Europe's largest economy is powerful enough to drive a strong recovery from the COVID-19 shock, a survey showed on Friday.
The GfK institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to -1.8 heading into September from an upwardly revised -0.2 in the previous month.
The drop followed three consecutive increases from June to August. The reading missed a Reuters forecast for a rise to 1.2.
GfK consumer expert Rolf Buerkl pointed to a recent rise in new coronavirus infections and fear of another round of lockdown measures to slow down the spread of the disease, both of which were causing uncertainty and depressing the mood.
""The VAT cut that came into force on July 1 is supporting the propensity to consume, but it's currently not yet giving any stronger impulses,"" Buerkl said.
Germany's stimulus package includes a cut to value-added tax (VAT) for regular goods to 16% from 19% and for food and some other goods to 5% from 7% from July 1 until Dec. 31. The reduction is estimated to cost the federal government up to 20 billion euros ($23.6 billion).
The government hopes that its rescue and stimulus measures will help companies and consumers recover more quickly from the coronavirus shock which plunged the economy into its deepest recession on record in the second quarter.
The drop in consumer sentiment was mainly driven by falling income expectations while expectations for the development of the broader economy improved a fourth month in a row.
""Consumers are still expecting that the German economy can work its way out of the worst recession since the end of the war,"" Buerkl said.
But he cautioned that consumers' optimism would fade if the rise in new infections could not be stopped, forcing authorities to implement drastic measures or even a second lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. 
NOTE - The consumer climate indicator forecasts the development of real private consumption in the following month.
An indicator reading above zero signals year-on-year growth in private consumption. A value below zero indicates a drop in comparison with the same period a year ago.
According to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1 percent in private consumption.
The ""willingness to buy"" indicator represents the balance between positive and negative responses to the question: ""Do you think now is a good time to buy major items?""
The income expectations sub-index reflects expectations about the development of household finances in the coming 12 months.
The additional business cycle expectations index reflects the assessment of those questioned of the general economic situation in the next 12 months.

But economists say the bounce-back could prove short-lived with unemployment expected to rise as Britain's state-funded job subsidy scheme is wound down before its expiry on Oct. 31.
Lloyds said only 18% of businesses with staff still on furlough expected to be able to retain all of them.

Finance minister Rishi Sunak has ruled out extending the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.

847,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy picked up speed in August as a strong industrial sector and stock market, better business confidence and home and car sales combined to boost the first economy globally to emerge from the Covid-19 slump.
That’s the assessment from the earliest available indicators, which showed China’s economy continuing to improve. The final result in July was also stronger than initially seen, given better results from purchasing manager indexes and more robust sales of homes and autos in the latter part of the month.
New home sales in China’s four biggest cities accelerated in the first three weeks of August, continuing July’s pickup. Car sales also are improving this month on the heels of July’s rebound as that market emerges from a two-year slump.
Still, even with better consumer confidence and spending, the broader retail sector remains sluggish. Without a strong rebound in dining out and shopping, retail is unlikely to return to strong growth.
More on Consumption
Conditions for small businesses continued improving in August, according to Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, which surveys more than 500 smaller firms each month. Still, the improvement appears to be at a plateau, with the index for expectations dropping slightly.
“This suggests that the V-shaped post-Covid rebound may be nearing its limit, with growth approaching its potential level,” according to economists Shen Lan and Ding Shuang, who published the results. “SMEs’ new orders continued to increase in August, but that pace slowed for the first time since March.”
External conditions slowly improved as well. Average daily shipments from South Korea in the first 20 days of August fell 3.7%, significantly better than the double-digit declines seen in April through June. That suggests global trade is slowly gathering momentum.
South Korea’s exports serve as a barometer of global trade as its companies are closely linked to global manufacturing supply chains, and it releases data quickly.
China’s stocks have stalled since the the CSI 300 Index soared to a five-year high in mid-July. While still at a high level, the market is down 3% since that high amid tensions with the U.S. and as the People’s Bank of China moves to normalize monetary policy.
Early Indicators
From July, Bloomberg has changed some of the components for the early look at China’s economy, adding home sales in the biggest four cities, weekly car sales and inventories of steel reinforcing, while removing iron-ore prices, sales manager sentiment and property-related stocks.
Bloomberg Economics generates the overall activity reading by aggregating a three-month weighted average of the monthly changes of eight indicators, which are based on business surveys or market prices.

848,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 02:30PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Labor Department said on Thursday it was changing the methodology used to address seasonal fluctuations in its weekly unemployment claims data, which economists complained was less reliable because of the economic upheaval caused by COVID-19.
The department said in a statement that starting next Thursday, it would use additive factors to seasonally adjust the initial claims and continued claims data instead of multiplicative factors.
""A multiplicative seasonal effect is assumed to be
proportional to the level of the series. A sudden large increase in the level of the series will be accompanied by a proportionally large seasonal effect,"" the department said. 
""In contrast, an additive seasonal effect is assumed to be unaffected by the level of the series.""
The coronavirus crisis has caused an unprecedented decline in economic activity, with nearly 7 million people filing new claims for unemployment benefits at one point. The Labor Department said in the presence of a large shift in the claims series, the multiplicative seasonal adjustment factors could result in systematic over-or under-adjustment of the data.
""In such cases, additive seasonal adjustment factors are preferred since they tend to more accurately track seasonal
fluctuations in the series and have smaller revisions,"" it said.
Economists welcomed the change in methodology.

""The change should address the issues that have plagued seasonally adjustments during this pandemic,"" said Heidi Shierholz, director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits hovered around 1 million last week, suggesting the labor market recovery was stalling as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on and financial aid from the government dries up.
The government also confirmed on Thursday that the economy suffered its sharpest contraction in at least 73 years in the second quarter because of the disruptions from the coronavirus, with corporate profits sinking deeper. 
Though new COVID-19 infections have subsided after a broad resurgence through the summer, many hot spots remain, especially at college campuses that have reopened for in-person learning. With the fiscal stimulus ebbing, signs are growing that the economy's recovery is slowing. Economists still expect a sharp rebound in growth this quarter, but they are dialing back estimates for the fourth quarter.
""This economy is not out of the woods yet,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Without federal government assistance it will take years for the services-based economy to generate employment opportunities for the workers unable to return to thousands of closed and bankrupt restaurants and bars and retail shops and malls across America.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 98,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.006 million for the week ended Aug. 22, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 1.0 million applications in the latest week.
The reopening of businesses in May pulled down claims from a record 6.867 million in March, when establishments were shuttered in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Claims fell below 1 million early this month for the first time since the pandemic started in the United States.
""The snail's pace of improvement in claims suggests that the next leg of the labor market's recovery will be much slower going,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte North Carolina. 
The COVID-19 crisis has altered the economic landscape and widened income inequality. The Federal Reserve on Thursday rolled out an aggressive new strategy to restore the nation to full employment and lift inflation back to healthier levels.
Stocks on Wall Street rose as investors cheered the Fed's new focus. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED
Americans in low-wage occupations have borne the brunt of the recession, which started in February. A government-funded program offering businesses loans to help with wages has lapsed and a $600 weekly unemployment supplement expired on July 31.
Though President Donald Trump extended the supplement, the payout was cut to $300 per week and economists expect funding for the program to be depleted by September. A few states are offering the extra unemployment benefit. 
Economists estimate the loss of the $600 could cut $50 billion from retail sales in August.
""The spending made possible by the $600 was supporting 5.1 million jobs,"" said Heidi Shierholz, director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. 
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 223,000 to 14.535 million in the week ending Aug. 15. The so-called continuing claims data covered the week during which the government surveyed households for August's unemployment rate.
Though continuing claims declined between the July and August survey periods, economists expect the unemployment rate remained above 10% this month. Part of the decrease in continuing claims was likely because of people exhausting eligibility for benefits. 
At least 27 million people were receiving unemployment benefits under all programs in the week ended Aug. 8. 
In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said gross domestic product plunged at a 31.7% annualized rate last quarter, the deepest drop in output since the government started keeping records in 1947. That was revised from the 32.9% pace reported last month and reflected less steep declines in consumer spending and inventory accumulation than initially estimated. 
Graphic: Consumer spending contribution to U.S. GDP https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnpwaawopw/gdp.png
After-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment dropped at a rate of 11.7%. Profits decreased at a pace of 13.1% in the first quarter. They fell 20.8% year-on-year. 
Profits of domestic financial corporations rebounded $39.5 billion last quarter. Domestic non-financial corporations' profits fell $170.1 billion and profits from the rest of the world dropped $96.2 billion.
When measured from the income side, the economy contracted at a 33.1% rate in the last quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) declined at a rate of 2.5% in the January-March period. 
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, decreased at a 32.4% rate last quarter. That compared to a 3.7% pace of decline in the first three months of the year.
""With a health solution still out of reach and the economic rebound looking fragile, fiscal stimulus is urgently needed to prevent the economy from sliding back into a downturn,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

INSEE, the official statistics agency, said its monthly business sentiment index rose to 91 from 84, reaching its highest since March, when midway through the month the government put France under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.
Business confidence has rebounded since the government began lifting the lockdown on May 11 as companies struggled to respond to pent-up demand from clients.
INSEE said that the survey showed business' leaders personal outlooks had eased in August despite the overall improvement, suggesting that much of the recovery in activity had already run its course.
""The speed of the catch-up could as a result slow in the coming months,"" INSEE said in a note accompanying the survey.
The overall rebound in business confidence came as the government struggled this month to contain a surge in new COVID-19 cases as the French went on summer holiday.
That has fuelled fears of a second wave of infections heading into the winter, which could derail France's economic recovery after a record recession in the first half of the year.

In a second quarterly survey, INSEE said that industrial companies had indicated they intended to cut investment this year by 11%, down from a reduction of 7% expected the last time the survey was conducted, in April.

Profits at China's industrial firms grew 19.6% on-year to 589.5 billion yuan ($85.58 billion), the statistics bureau said on Thursday, following an 11.5% increase seen in June, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Thursday.
China's recovery had been gaining momentum after the pandemic paralysed huge swathes of the economy as pent-up demand, government stimulus and surprisingly resilient exports revived activity.
However, some signs of weakness have emerged in July, with industrial output growing slower than expected. Some analysts said flood and torrential rain have dampened activity and demand for electricity.
Factories' profits also face risks from increasingly tense U.S.-China relationship ahead of the U.S. presidential elections in November, which could impact overseas orders and confidence from investors and consumers.
For January-July, industrial firms' profits fell 8.1% on an annual basis to 3.1 trillion yuan, improving from a 12.8% slump in the first six months.
Automobiles and electronics industries notched up significant recoveries in profits in July, seeing growth rates of 125.5% and 38.6% respectively, according to Zhu Hong, an official at the statistics bureau.
Despite the acceleration in profits in July, accumulated profit declines in the mining and raw materials industries remain large, company cash flow pressures are high, and a ""complex and severe"" environment at home and abroad means that future profit growth has a degree of uncertainty, said Zhu. 
Profit growth was mainly driven by higher margins, with reveune growth slowing modestly from June, said analysts from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a note.
Earnings at China's state-owned industrial firms were down 23.5% on an annual basis for the first seven months of the year, versus a 28.5% decline in the first half of the year, the statistics bureau data showed.
Liabilities at industrial firms rose 6.5% on-year at end-July, up from a 6.4% growth as of end-June.
Private sector profits fell 5.3% in January-July, narrowing from January-June's 8.4% fall.

Companies reliant on spending by consumers - many of which only reopened in recent weeks after the lockdown - cut jobs at the fastest pace on record, according to a survey published on Thursday by the Confederation of British Industry.
Business and professional services firms reported the steepest declines since May 2009.
Companies expected job losses to slow slightly in the next three months but the CBI said government action was urgently needed.
""As we head into the autumn, the UK needs a bold plan to protect jobs as the job retention scheme draws to an end, to support the services sector,"" CBI economist Ben Jones said.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak has rejected calls to extend his huge Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme beyond Oct. 31. Since the start of this month employers have had to pay a share of its costs.
Britain's unemployment rate is expected to almost double to 7.5% by the end of 2020, according to the Bank of England, and many economists think it will go higher than that.
The CBI survey showed volumes of business dropped less severely than in the three months to May and companies expected the pace of decline to moderate further in the coming months.
Business and professional services firms were holding up better than companies in consumer services, but Jones said they faced additional uncertainty over Britain's unresolved future trading relationship with the European Union.
Business and professional services reported a small uptick in sentiment, and confidence fell at a slower pace among consumer services firms after a record plunge in the three months to May.

But the outlook for investment intentions remained bleak. Business and professional firms expected to cut back on vehicles, plant and machinery, land and buildings and training over the next 12 although IT investment was expected to rise.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased in July, though the pace slowed from June's robust gain, suggesting the rebound in business investment would be gradual amid uncertainty about the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed an uneven recovery in investment as the coronavirus crisis shifts spending away from equipment used in the services industries such as restaurants and bars to purchases of goods like home electronics. 
""While orders are nearly back to their pre-pandemic levels, the slowing pace of gains suggests it will take a while for activity to fully recover,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
""We do not expect business investment to reach its pre-pandemic level before mid-2022.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 1.9% last month. These so-called core capital goods orders jumped 4.3% in June, which was the largest gain in six years. 
Core capital goods orders are slightly below their pre-pandemic level. They fell 1.9% on a year-on-year basis in July. Last month's rise in orders matched economists' expectations.

Though new coronavirus cases have subsided after a broad resurgence following the reopening of businesses in May, the path of the pandemic remains unclear, with many hot spots remaining. There are growing signs that the economy's recovery from the pandemic is slowing or even reversing.
At least 28 million people are on unemployment benefits and bankruptcies are rising as government aid rolled out at the start of the pandemic dries up. Regional Federal Reserve surveys showed a moderation in factory activity in the New York state and the mid-Atlantic regions this month. Consumer confidence fell to a six-year low in August.
""The trends in economic indicators have not changed significantly,"" economists at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities wrote in a research note. ""We likely need to see daily COVID-19 cases decline much more significantly in order for gains in economic activity to accelerate meaningfully.""
The economy slipped into recession in February.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
LEAN ORDER BOOKS
Core capital goods orders last month were supported by demand for machinery, fabricated metals products, computers and electronic products and electrical equipment, appliances and components. Unfilled core capital goods orders edged up 0.1%. That followed a 0.2% gain in June. 
""The recovery remains uneven between investment that complements COVID-life and that which does not,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Computers and communications orders have surpassed their February levels, while orders for machinery and metals continue to dig out from the hole left by shutdowns and more muted profit outlooks."" 
Shipments of core capital goods increased 2.4%. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They shot up 3.8% in June, but remain 0.4% below their February level.
The shuttering of nonessential businesses in mid-March and a collapse in oil prices helped to undercut business investment, which was already under pressure from the Trump administration's trade war with China. 
Business investment tumbled at a record 27% annualized rate in the second quarter, with spending on equipment collapsing at an all-time pace of 37.7%. Investment in equipment has now contracted for five straight quarters. 
Economists expect the government will report a historic drop in corporate profits in the second quarter on Thursday when it publishes its second estimate of GDP for the last quarter.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, surged 11.2% in July after advancing 7.7% in June. Durable goods orders have recouped losses suffered during the shutdown and are almost back at their pre-pandemic level. 
Durable goods orders were boosted by robust demand for motor vehicles, which powered ahead 21.9% after accelerating 85.6% in June. There were no orders reported for civilian aircraft. Orders for transportation equipment jumped 35.6% last month after rising 19.7% in June. Motor vehicles have a bigger weighting in the transportation category. 
Boeing (N:BA) reported no aircraft orders in July after receiving only one in June. The planemaker has struggled with cancellations as airlines grapple with sharply reduced demand for air travel because of the pandemic. 
The grounding of Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX jets since March 2019 after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia has also weighed on the company.

Households' concerns about unemployment fell to their lowest level since April when France was still in a two-month coronavirus lockdown that ended May 11.
France has avoided a major spike in permanent unemployment as companies put workers on state-subsidised furloughs en masse.
While households' general economic outlook was stable, it remained far below the survey's long-term average. The number of people who said it was a good time to save money rose while those prepared to make big purchases fell.
With most stores and restaurants closed, French households built up an extra 100 billion euros ($118 billion) in savings during the lockdown.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence dropped to a more than six-year low in August as households worried about the labor market and incomes, casting doubts on the sustainability of the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 recession. 
The second straight monthly decrease in consumer confidence reported by the Conference Board on Tuesday overshadowed an acceleration in new single-family home sales to a more than 13-1/2-year high in July. The housing market continues to show strong immunity to the coronavirus crisis. 
The ebb in confidence followed the expiration of a $600 weekly unemployment benefit supplement on July 31 and a flare-up in new coronavirus infections across the country, which forced some jurisdictions to shut down businesses again or pause reopenings. Though new cases have subsided, hot spots remain. 
""Today's data are telling us that while some lucky workers are able to buy new homes, millions of others are unable to afford life's necessities and pay the rent especially after the federal government canceled those $600 checks,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The consumer is the most worried they have been all year which pours cold water on the idea that the economic recovery is sustainable."" 
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 84.8 this month, the lowest since May 2014, from 91.7 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index edging up to a reading of 93 in August.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, tumbled to a reading of 84.2 this month from 95.9 in July. The expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions dropped to 85.2 from a reading of 88.9 in July.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, deteriorated to a reading of -3.7 this month from 2.2 in July. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. 
It has dropped from as high as 38.3 in August last year, and fits in with views that the labor market recovery is losing speed after nonfarm payrolls increased by 1.763 million jobs in July after a record jump of 4.791 million in June. 
The share of consumers expecting an increase in income fell to 12.7% this month from 14.8% in July and the proportion anticipating a drop increased to 16.6% from 15.8% last month.
The weekly unemployment supplement has been cut to $300. Economists estimate the reduced unemployment benefits will slash about $50 billion from retail sales in August and restrain consumer spending, the main driver of the economy. 
""We are clearly in the second phase of the recovery, driven by underlying fundamentals rather than purely the surge in activity as household reengaged,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""This reinforces our view that a V-shaped recovery will not happen, the U.S. economy is unlikely to recover all of its lost output until mid-2022.""
The economy slipped into recession in February. Gross domestic product contracted in the second quarter at its steepest pace in at least 73 years. 
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed after a three-day rally. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were down.
HOUSING SHINES
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said new home sales rose 13.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 901,000 units last month, the highest level since December 2006. New home sales are counted at the signing of a contract, making them a leading housing market indicator. 
Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 13% of housing market sales, gaining 1.3% to a rate of 785,000-units. The housing market is being powered by record low interest rates and a migration to low-density residential areas as companies allow employees to work from home. 
Data last week showed a record jump in sales of previously owned homes in July. Homebuilding and permits also soared last month, while confidence among homebuilders increased in August to the highest level since December 1998. 
At least 28 million people are on unemployment benefits. Economists, however, say unemployment has disproportionately affected low-wage workers, who are typically renters. 
In July, new home sales increased in the Midwest, South and West. They fell in the Northeast. The median new house price increased 7.2% to $330,600 in July from a year ago. 
There were 299,000 new homes on the market, down from 304,000 in June. At July's sales pace it would take 4.0 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 4.6 months in June.

""Given most people who can afford a new home are higher-paid workers who still have their jobs, we should expect this trend to continue,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.

Quarterly CBI figures showed the employment balance - which measures job changes over the past 12 months - sank to -45 in August from -20 in May, reaching its lowest since February 2009. A deeper fall is expected later this year.
The drop in the monthly retail sales balance was unexpected, falling to -6 in August from July's 15-month high of +4 and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Figures last week showed the volume of retail sales rose above pre-pandemic levels in July. 
Howard Archer, an economist with forecasters EY Item Club, said he still thought consumer spending was headed for a substantial rebound in the third quarter.
""However, the weaker-than-expected August CBI survey is a reminder that there is considerable uncertainty as to just how willing and able consumers will be to spend beyond the third quarter,"" he said. ""Indeed, persistent consumer caution is seen as a significant risk that could limit the UK recovery.""
Retailers in the CBI survey said spending in August was 27% below normal compared with a 79% shortfall in June - a disparity not shown in other figures, which may reflect how social distancing requirements have had a much bigger impact on some sectors - such as high street clothing retailers - than others.

The CBI survey was based on responses from 63 retail chains collected between July 28 and Aug. 14.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter as consumer spending, company investments and exports all collapsed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the statistics office said on Tuesday.
The economic slump was much stronger than during the financial crisis more than a decade ago, and it represented the sharpest decline since Germany began to record quarterly GDP calculations in 1970, the office said.
Still, the reading marked a minor upward revision from an earlier estimate for the April-June period of -10.1% that the office had published last month.
Consumer spending shrank by 10.9% on the quarter, capital investments by 19.6% and exports by 20.3%, seasonally adjusted data showed.
Construction activity, normally a consistent growth driver for the German economy, fell by 4.2% on the quarter.
""The second quarter was a complete disaster,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said. ""Regardless of whether it is about investments, private consumption, exports or even imports -everything was in free fall.""
The only bright spot was state consumption, which rose by 1.5% on the quarter due to the government's coronavirus rescue programmes, the office said.
The German parliament has suspended the debt brake this year to allow the government to finance its crisis response and fiscal stimulus push with record new debt of 217.8 billion euros.
The fiscal U-turn after years of balanced budgets means that the German state recorded a budget deficit of 51.6 billion euros from January to June, the statistics office said in a separate statement.
That represents a deficit of 3.2% of economic output as measured by the EU's Maastricht criteria.
Employment edged down by 1.3% on the year to 44.7 million in as sign that the government's efforts to shield the labour market from the coronavirus shock with its short-time work programme are paying off.
The relatively mild impact of the crisis on employment helped to stabilize income for many households, which together with the reluctance to consume, led to a considerable increase in household saving.
The savings rate almost doubled to 20.1% in the 2nd quarter compared to the previous year, the office said.
The German central bank expects household spending to drive a strong recovery in the third quarter, though the economy might not reach its pre-crisis level before 2022.
The government's stimulus measures include a temporary VAT cut from July to December worth up to 20 billion euros, which Berlin hopes will give household spending an additional push.
""The reopening of the economy will give the German economy a strong boost in the period from July to September,"" Gitzel said, but he added that the moment of truth would come in the autumn and winter months, which could see a wave of bankruptcies.

""In addition, the negative consequences of structural change in the automobile industry are becoming increasingly evident,"" Gitzel said, pointing to many small suppliers in the sector that are struggling to adapt to digitisation and electrification.

865,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 11:35PM ET</span>",,,,,,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian employment fell by 1% over the month to Aug. 8, data showed on Tuesday, with job prospects particularly hard hit in the southeastern state of Victoria as it grapples with a fresh wave of coronavirus infections.
The latest fall in employment underlines the deepening cracks in the labour market, with the government predicting unemployment in the country would climb above 13% by the end of September, from a 22-year high of 7.5% in July.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed payroll jobs for the period fell 2.8% in Victoria, which has suffered the biggest decline in employment since mid-March when Australia recorded its 100th coronavirus case.
The release, an experimental weekly series, differs from the monthly official employment data and is based on wage payment figures from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
Economists said Tuesday's numbers are a cause for concern as they showed jobs growth had stalled after a sharp rebound in recent months.
""Obviously Victoria isn't helping and weakness across Victoria may have spilled over to other states,"" said Callam Pickering, economist at global job site Indeed.
""Policymakers will need to be proactive in the coming months and there should be concern that rates of JobSeeker and JobKeeper are being reduced when unemployment remains so high.""
About 1.3 million Australians have applied for the COVID jobless benefit, called JobSeeker, according to government figures. 
Economists estimate at least another 6 million people - a quarter of the population - are having their wages subsidised by a separate relief package for shuttered companies called JobKeeper.

""Clearly many Australian businesses are in a precarious position and that is reflected in their hiring decisions,"" Pickering said.

866,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s recession will extend into a third quarter, making it the longest slump since 1982-83, and unemployment remain elevated next year due to a tepid recovery, according to Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY).
It predicts gross domestic product will fall 0.7% in the current quarter after declining 6% in the prior period; the economy contracted 0.3% in the first three months of the year. Australia’s jobless rate is forecast to peak at 9% in the final months of this year and then average 8.8% through 2021, the bank said.
“Courtesy of the large roll the Commonwealth Bank plays in the Australian economy we can see the most recent deterioration in the labor market,” said Stephen Halmarick, chief economist at the nation’s largest lender. “A large number of people have, once again, found themselves without employment and have had to either start, or restart, receiving the JobSeeker payment.”
The downward revisions to the bank’s forecasts reflects a renewed lockdown in Victoria state, accounting for about a quarter of GDP, which will drag on the national performance. The Reserve Bank of Australia, in its updated forecasts released earlier this month, sees the economy basically flat in the current quarter and expects unemployment to peak at 10% later in the year.
CBA expects only a “modest recovery” in the economy in 2021, forecasting GDP to rise just 1.8% from a year earlier. It predicts the economy won’t return to its pre-Covid level until the second half of 2022 “at the earliest.”
On a more positive note, China’s role as first nation to fall victim to the virus and first to recover means its stimulus measures are driving demand for the chief ingredient in steel, iron ore, which is Australia’s largest export. CBA forecasts the price will average a still high $110 a ton in the fourth quarter -- from $129 at present -- and then ease back to $90 a ton late next year.
Halmarick also highlighted the surge in income since the onset of Covid-19, reflecting the Australian government’s substantial stimulus program. Indeed, total income flowing into CBA bank accounts is now a little over 20% higher than it was this time last year, he said.
While some of that is being spent, a lot is also being saved, he says. CBA’s average total savings balance per household, including home lending related savings and transaction or savings accounts, was up 14% in July from a year earlier.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil posted its strongest July job growth in eight years, official figures showed on Friday, snapping four consecutive months of job losses as the country continued to relax the coronavirus-fighting lockdown measures from earlier in the year.
The addition of a net 131,010 formal jobs in July was driven by industry and construction, which together accounted for over 70% of the overall gains, followed by retail and agribusiness.
Services continued to shed jobs, the economy ministry said.
Over 1 million jobs were created, while 912,640 positions were lost.
July's figures followed a downwardly-revised 19,579 formal job losses in June, and brings the net loss in the first seven months of the year to 1.1 million.
Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said he was ""excited"" by the ""extraordinary"" figures.
A 'V-shaped' recovery is possible, Guedes said, adding that the job numbers justified a recent wave of economists revising their 2020 gross domestic product forecasts upward.
""Revisions are now confirming that GDP may fall 4%, just over 4%, practically half of what had been predicted before,"" he told reporters in Brasilia.
Work and Pensions Secretary Bruno Bianco said the government would extend for another two months a program that allows firms to reduce workers' hours or suspend contracts, in return for keeping them on the payroll.
More than 16 million workers and 1.4 million employers have been involved in the program so far, Bianco said, adding that only 23.2 billion reais out its 51.6 billion reais budget had been spent.
The latest official unemployment statistics show the jobless rate rose to a three-year high of 13.3% in the three months to June. But underlying figures paint a far more precarious picture.
A record number of Brazilians are out of the workforce completely, a record low number as a share of the working population - less than 50% - have a job, and the underemployment rate surged to an all-time high.

(Reuters) - In signs an economic recovery may be picking up speed, U.S. home sales rose at a record rate for a second straight month in July, and purchasing managers in both the manufacturing and services sectors report business activity has accelerated at a brisker-than-expected pace this month. 
With mortgage rates holding near record lows and a work-from-home trend apparently enticing many Americans to move further from city centers, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday sales of existing homes rose 24.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.86 million units last month from 4.7 million in June.
Home prices also shot to a record $304,100, and a shortage of inventory is making competition for houses fierce. The average time on the market fell to 22 days in July, a record low, from 24 in June, and nearly 70% sold in less than a month.
Combined with June's 20.2% gain, home sales have mushroomed by nearly 50% in two months to fully retrace the cratering in residential real estate activity in the spring after the COVID-19 pandemic started spreading across the country. July's sales rate was the fastest since December 2006, when the country was in the latter stages of the sub-prime mortgage housing boom.
“The housing market is well past the recovery phase and is now booming with higher home sales compared to the pre-pandemic days,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “With the sizable shift in remote work, current homeowners are looking for larger homes and this will lead to a secondary level of demand even into 2021.”
Graphic: Existing home sales https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dgkvllwbbvb/ehs.png
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales rising 14.7% to a rate of 5.38 million units in July. Existing home sales, which make up about 85% of U.S. home sales, rose in all four regions and were up 8.7% nationally from a year earlier.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is at an average of 2.99%, hovering near levels last seen in the early 1970s, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Data earlier this week showed homebuilding accelerating by the most in nearly four years in July. 
Housing has been a bright spot in the economy even as other sectors suffer amid widespread coronavirus infections that have slowed commerce and kept unemployment high. More than 28 million people were collecting jobless benefits under all programs at the end of July.
The pandemic tipped the economy into recession in February, ending a record-long expansion that had brought U.S. unemployment to a 50-year low.
BACK TO BUSINESS?
Meanwhile, a purchasing managers' survey showed U.S. business activity snapped back to the highest since early 2019 in August as companies in both the manufacturing and services sectors saw a resurgence in new orders even as new COVID-19 cases remain stubbornly high across the country.
Data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. Composite PMI Index rose to a reading of 54.7 this month - the highest since February 2019 - from 50.3 in July. Its flash - or preliminary - indicator for the manufacturing sector stood at its highest since January 2019 and for the services sector it was the highest since March 2019.
A reading above 50 indicates growth in private sector output.
Graphic: Markit PMI https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/qmyvmaobavr/markit.png 
""Driving the overall upturn in output was stronger client demand,"" Markit said in its report. ""Total new business rose for the first time since February and at a solid rate. Manufacturing firms registered a steeper expansion in new order inflows than in July, while service providers signaled a renewed increase in sales.""
The survey's flash composite new orders index climbed to 54 in August - the highest since March 2019 - from a final reading of 49.7 in July. Foreign sales increased at the fastest rate since September 2014, it said, as more non-U.S. markets reopened their economies.
The improvement in the PMI and home sales data comes even as U.S. coronavirus infections continue to climb, and some authorities in the hard-hit South and West regions this summer have been forced to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings. As of Aug. 20, more than 5.5 million U.S. cases cumulatively had been recorded since the pandemic began, according to a Reuters tally, up from around 4.6 million at the end of July.
The unexpectedly sharp increases in Markit's indexes and home sales continue a pattern of choppy U.S. economic data that paint a picture of a fitful recovery from the COVID-19 recession, with pockets of both strength and weakness dotted across disparate portions of the economy and regions. 

On Thursday, for instance, the U.S. Labor Department reported that new claims for unemployment benefits shot back above the 1 million mark last week. Meanwhile, earlier in the week the government reported residential construction had accelerated by the most since October 2016 last month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economic recovery from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic has gathered pace, data showed on Friday, but government borrowing rose past the 2 trillion pound ($2.6 trillion) mark and fears of future job losses are mounting.
Retail sales rose above pre-pandemic levels in July, the first full month for many shops reopening after lockdown, and August's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data showed the fastest growth in almost seven years.
But Britain's economy still faces a long recovery after shrinking by a record 20% in the second quarter, the largest decline of any big country. 
""The UK is still seeing a V-shape bounce in activity. But ... a hot summer can quickly turn to a cold autumn,"" HSBC economist Liz Martins said, pointing to a softening in euro zone business activity as coronavirus cases begin to rise again.
Retail sales in July were 1.4% above year-ago levels and 3.0% above their level before the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics said.
August's preliminary composite PMI, which covers most businesses outside retail, hit its highest level since October 2013.
But employers are increasingly planning to shed jobs and were making staff redundant rather than bringing them back from a government-subsidised furlough scheme that expires in October.
""Scarring from the pandemic and lingering doubts about the sustainability of recovery resulted in a need to cut overheads,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, which compiles the PMIs.
The Bank of England forecasts unemployment will reach 7.5% by year-end, almost double its most recent reading. 
Separately, the Confederation of British Industry said manufacturing orders were ""severely depressed"", with little improvement in August.
Stuttering PMI surveys for the euro zone -- where countries exited lockdown earlier than Britain -- suggested the boost from pent-up demand was already fading. 
JOB LOSSES
Retail sales are only part of overall household spending. A GfK survey showed no improvement in consumer confidence since early July.
Within retail, different businesses have had contrasting fortunes. Grocery sales are 3% up on the year and online sales are 50% higher than before the pandemic. But sales volumes at clothing and footwear stores are 25% lower than last year.
Stores including Marks & Spencer, Boots and John Lewis [JLPLC.UL] have announced plans for major job cuts.
Friday's data also laid bare the impact of increased public spending and a slide in tax revenues on the public finances.
Public sector net debt exceeded 2 trillion pounds in July for the first time, and is its highest since 1961 as a share of gross domestic product.
Government borrowing so far this financial year is 150.5 billion pounds, almost seven times higher than in the same period in 2019 though below the 178.8 billion pounds Britain's budget forecasters predicted last month. 
The government has spent more than 35 billion pounds so far on its job support scheme, the largest single measure to tackle the economic impact of the pandemic.
Government figures showed 6.8 million jobs were furloughed at the end of June, down from 8.9 million in early May.

The Confederation of British Industry's monthly order book balance rose to -44 in August from -46 in July. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a bigger rise to -35.
While marking the highest level since March, the survey showed the proportion of manufacturers reporting below-normal levels of orders still outnumbered those reporting above-normal orders by a wide margin.
""This has been another difficult month for manufacturers,"" said Anna Leach, CBI deputy chief economist.
""Activity continues to be poor and order books severely depressed, although the worst of the decline seems to be behind us,"" she added.

Earlier the IHS Markit/CIPS survey of manufacturers showed month-on-month growth in activity accelerated in August to hit a 2-1/2-year high, though heavy job losses were underway.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone's recovery from its deepest economic downturn on record hit the brakes in August, particularly in services, as pent-up demand unleashed by the easing of coronavirus lockdowns dwindled, a survey showed on Friday.
To contain the spread of the virus, which has infected over 22.5 million people globally, governments imposed strict lockdowns - forcing businesses to close and citizens to stay home, bringing economic activity to a near halt.
After many of those restrictions were relaxed, activity in the euro zone expanded in July at the fastest pace since mid-2018. But as infection rates have risen again in parts of the region, some earlier curbs have been reinstated.
So in data likely to concern policymakers and diminish hopes for a V-shaped recovery, IHS Markit's flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index sank to 51.6 from July's final reading of 54.9, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll that predicted no change.
""The fall back in the euro zone composite PMI in August suggests the initial V-shaped rebound following the lifting of the lockdowns is already fizzling out,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
The flow of incoming new business for firms slowed and once again some of August's activity was derived by businesses completing backlogs of work.
Germany and France, the bloc's two biggest economies, also lost economic momentum this month, driven by the services slowdown.
Apart from those economies, activity in the bloc decreased marginally in August, IHS Markit said.
In Britain, outside the currency union and who entered and exited lockdown later than its euro zone neighbours, the recovery from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic quickened again in August.
British retail sales surged past pre-pandemic levels in July, the first full month shops selling non-essential goods were open since the country went into lockdown in March, although economists fear the retail recovery may not last. 
However, snowballing job cuts sent an ominous signal for the months ahead. [GB/PMIS]

SERVICES STALL
Growth in the euro zone's dominant service sector stalled, with that PMI plummeting to 50.1 from 54.7, below all forecasts in the Reuters poll which predicted a small dip to 54.5.
With demand waning, the bloc's services firms cut headcount for a sixth month and more sharply than in July. 
Economists noted the employment components of the PMIs suggested trouble in the job market. 
""Those numbers indicate that the worst is yet to be seen in the euro area labour market and clearly points to a gradual recovery path,"" noted Tuuli Koivu at Nordea Markets.
Factory activity - which didn't suffer quite as sharp a decline as the service industry during the height of the pandemic - expanded for a second month.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, rose to 55.7 from 55.3.
However, suggesting factory purchasing managers don't expect a big pick up in activity, they again bought fewer raw materials than in the previous month.
European Union leaders agreed last month a 750 billion euro pandemic recovery fund but the relief won't kick in until next year. For its part, the European Central Bank is expected to keep monetary policy ultra-loose for a long time.
A full bounceback from the euro zone's deepest recession on record will take two years or more, according to a recent Reuters poll of economists. [ECILT/EU]

LONDON (Reuters) - The recovery among British businesses from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic quickened again in August, but snowballing job cuts sent an ominous signal for the months ahead, a survey showed on Friday.
The early reading of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), covering the services and manufacturing sectors, shot up to a nearly seven-year high of 60.3 from 57.0 in July, far above the 50 threshold for growth.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 57.1.
While the PMI indicated a further acceleration of growth, it did not signal a return to normal levels of output across businesses, which some economists think could take years.
""There were encouraging signs that customer-facing service providers have started to catch up with the rebound seen earlier this summer across the wider economy,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
He cited a further easing of lockdown measures and the government's ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme, which subsidises restaurant meals, as helping to boost growth during August.
Nonetheless, there were widespread worries among companies that the recovery might fade in the coming months, with the government's job protection scheme set to close at the end of October.
The PMI showed companies in both the services and manufacturing sectors cut jobs at a faster pace in August - echoing the almost daily announcements of lay-offs among many of Britain's biggest companies.
Economists polled by Reuters this month thought it would take at least two years for Britain's economy to recover the output lost during the pandemic, with a contraction of almost 10% in store for 2020. [ECILT/GB]
The PMI for the services sector, which comprises the bulk of Britain's economy, rose to a six-year high of 60.1 in August from 56.5 in July - again better than expectations for a reading of 57.0.
Still, business expectations for the year ahead cooled slightly as companies fretted over the outlook.

Factories reported a better August too. The manufacturing PMI rose by two points to 55.3, its highest level since February 2018.

875,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 04:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The euro-area economy unexpectedly lost momentum this month as renewed travel restrictions and concerns about the coronavirus took a toll on services.
The sharp slowdown shows that the path out of recession won’t be plain sailing, and undermines lingering hopes for a V-shaped recovery. While infections are on the rise, economic concerns mean governments are so far reluctant to re-impose the type of strict lockdowns seen earlier this year.
In a report published Friday, IHS Markit said its composite measure of private-sector activity dropped to 51.6 in August from 54.9 in July. The manufacturing gauge remained virtually unchanged, but services plunged to 50.1, a level that practically signals stagnation.
The economy had initially bounced back strongly after lockdowns were eased, though many were concerned that the pace could fade. At their last meeting in July, European Central Bank policy makers were reluctant to draw firm conclusions about the health of the economy, a stance that looks justified by Friday’s numbers.
The fallout on jobs in both sectors continued, with employment declining for a sixth straight month. That’s a key worry for governments, who fear a damaging rise in joblessness could persist for some time. While France and Germany, the euro area’s biggest economies, continued to see growth in activity, the Markit report suggested output declined in Italy and Spain.
“The euro zone stands at a crossroads,” said Andrew Harker, economics director at IHS Markit. “The path taken will likely depend in large part on how successfully Covid-19 can be suppressed and whether companies and their customers alike can gain the confidence necessary to support growth.”"

IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to 53.7 from 55.3 in July.
The reading was still above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, but it came in weaker than a Reuters poll of 55.0 and was the first drop after three months of gains.
The main drag came from the service sector, where the sub-index declined to 50.8 from 55.6.
Manufacturing proved more resilient with the subindex rising to 53.0 from 51.0, reaching its highest level in nearly two years.
IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said activity in the service sector was close to stalling amid renewed travel restrictions and a sustained decline in overall employment that was weakening domestic demand.
In manufacturing, further cuts to factory workforce numbers also showed that ""there is still ground to make up and businesses remain under pressure to cut costs"", Smith added.
The German economy, Europe's largest, contracted at its steepest rate on record in the second quarter as consumer spending, company investment and trade all collapsed during the peak of the pandemic.

Sentiment surveys and recent economic data had pointed to a quick, V-shaped recovery as long as another big wave of new infections and a nationwide lockdown can be avoided in the second half of the year.

The reading for the services sector stayed above the 50-point level dividing an expansion from a contraction, but the preliminary PMI reading for manufacturing came in below that level.
The dominant service sector saw its PMI reading for August fall to 51.9 points from 57.3 in July - below a forecast for a reading of 56.3 points.
The manufacturing PMI fell to 49.0 points in August - down from 52.4 in July and below a forecast for 53.7 points.
French business activity had surged after the euro zone's second-biggest economy emerged in May from one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe as firms responded to pent-up client demand.
The August PMI survey indicated that backlogs were no longer growing in the service sector and were growing at a slower pace in manufacturing. Meanwhile, new order flow was stable in services and slowed slightly in manufacturing, the survey showed.

The INSEE statistics agency said at the end of July that the French economy contracted by a post-war record of 13.8% in the second quarter due to the lockdown.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices were stubbornly unchanged in July, dashing hopes for a modest rise as the coronavirus pandemic hit household demand and revived fears of a national plunge back into deflation.
A slow economic recovery from last quarter's record slump is expected to weigh on prices as consumer demand collapsed amid resurgent infections, which will in turn hit profits, jobs and business investment, analysts say.
The spectre of a return to deflation will keep the Bank of Japan (BOJ) under pressure to continue massive monetary stimulus and maintain ultra-low interest rates to support government fiscal spending aimed at battling the health crisis.
Japan's core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, stood flat in July from a year earlier, data by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications showed on Friday.
It fell short of a median market forecast for a 0.1% rise, following a flat reading in June.
Drops in gasoline prices reflecting weak global demand for crude oil offset gains in food and household durable goods such as electric rice-cookers and air-conditioners, the data showed.
""Taken together, core CPI is likely to stay largely flat towards next year,"" said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.
""Japan is in a deflationary situation. As we shift towards 'new normal' following the coronavirus, the BOJ's 2% inflation target is increasingly losing reality.""
The so-called core-core inflation index, which excludes food and energy prices and is similar to the core index used in the United States, rose 0.4% in the year to July, maintaining the pace seen in the last two months.
The BOJ projects consumer prices to fall 0.5% this fiscal year to next March and stay well below its 2% target through early 2023.
The central bank holds its next policy-setting meeting Sept. 16-17.
Friday's data came after a batch of indicators confirmed weak demand at home and abroad, with exports posting a fifth consecutive month of double-digit falls and a surprise drop in core machinery orders pointing to fragile capital expenditure.
Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, suffered a record annualised contraction of 27.8% in April-June as lockdowns through late May aimed at containing the pandemic dampened business activity and crushed private consumption.

Analysts expect any rebound in the current quarter to be modest, with fears of a second wave of infections potentially hitting spending and prolonging a long stretch of deflation.

Consumer prices excluding fresh food were unchanged in July, the ministry of internal affairs reported Friday. Economists had forecast a gain of 0.1%.

880,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 07:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. consumer confidence remained weak in August as the specter of unemployment hung over the British economy.
GfK’s key index of household sentiment, which plunged deep into negative territory after the lockdown imposed earlier this year triggered a record recession, was unchanged from July.
The lack of improvement came despite a further easing of the restrictions hampering the economy. Much of the apprehension can be attributed to worries about employment. The government began winding down its wage subsidy-program for furloughed workers this month, leading to warnings that millions of Britons risk losing their jobs unless Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak extends support beyond October -- a demand he has so far resisted.
“Employment is now the big issue because the pandemic has ended years of job security,” said GfK’s client strategy director, Joe Staton. Although consumers were slightly more confident about their personal finances in the next year, “this could change quickly when furlough ends and the inevitable redundancies start,” he warned.
The U.K. relies heavily on consumer spending for growth, so encouraging people to return to the shops is crucial to getting the economy back on its feet.
The government’s Eat Out to Help Out program, which picks up part of the tab on restaurant meals during August, has not translated to increased spending elsewhere, according to Staton.
“Yes, discounted dinners have proved a winner with hungry consumers across the country this month, but it’s difficult to see any increased appetite for other types of spending for now,” he said.

881,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers turned a bit more confident about their personal finances in August, but they were increasingly worried about the outlook for the economy with unemployment expected to rise sharply, a survey showed on Friday.
The headline GfK consumer confidence index held at -27, the same level it has been since early July.
That represented its joint-highest reading since the coronavirus lockdown began in March, but is not far above its lowest level in a decade that was touched in May.
""Circumspect consumers report they are more confident about their personal financial situation over the next year but the uptick from zero to +1 does not amount to much,"" Joe Staton, GfK's client strategy director, said.
""This can change quickly when furlough ends and the inevitable redundancies start.""
Around one in eight workers remain on the government's job retention subsidy scheme which has already cost 35 billion pounds ($46 billion) and is due to close at the end of October.
A measure of how consumers view the economy over the next 12 months fell to -42 from -41 in July, GfK said.
Britain's economy shrank by more than 20% in the April-June period and the Bank of England thinks it will take until the end of next year for it to regain its pre-pandemic size. 
Some private-sector economists say it could take a lot longer than that, with the average forecast in a Reuters poll on Thursday showing that it would take at last two years for the economy to return to the same size it was at the end of 2019.

(Reuters) - The number of Americans filing a new claim for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly back above the 1 million mark last week, a setback for a struggling U.S. job market crippled by the coronavirus pandemic.
Still, in a sign some rehiring is underway, the rolls of those continuing to receive jobless benefits is slowly declining, the Labor Department reported on Thursday, and other data indicated a recovery from the recession triggered by COVID-19 continues, though at a more fitful pace than earlier.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 1.106 million for the week ended Aug. 15, from an upwardly revised 971,000 in the prior week. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 925,000 applications in the latest week.
The previous week's level had marked the first time since March that new claims had registered below 1 million, and had fueled some optimism that the pace of layoffs would slow further. Last week's reversal soured that, and new weekly claims have been above the 1 million mark for 21 of the last 22 weeks.
""The labor market is a long way from being healthy,"" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients.
The volatility in benefits activity follows the lapse of an extra $600 weekly unemployment benefit at the end of July. The enhanced benefit had been in place since the spring under the massive coronavirus stimulus package passed by Congress in late March, but Democrats in Congress and the White House have failed to reach agreement on extending it. 
While President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that includes a provision extending the supplement at a reduced rate of $400 a week, there has been confusion over its implementation.
States are required to cover $100 of the benefits, but many governors have indicated they don't have the financial capacity after revenues were decimated in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The remaining $300 will be funded from a limited emergency disaster relief program, which economists estimated could be depleted as early as September.
Oxford's Vanden Houten noted that only seven states have been approved to pay the extra benefits.
'LOSING STEAM'
New COVID-19 infections continue to spread across the nation, forcing authorities in some of the most afflicted areas to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings. The newest twist in the path of the outbreak includes the eruption of hot spots associated with some colleges reopening their campuses. 
First-time claims peaked at a record 6.867 million in late March.
""Claims are still down 325,000 from the last full week of July,"" economists at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note to clients that described the overall increase as ""disappointing.""
""The next few weeks will be telling in terms of how much of the recent improvement has been fundamental as the Sun Belt has recovered from their COVID surge, or technical as the $600 benefit expired,"" the Jefferies economists said.
While new claims are up, the number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits beyond the first week fell to the lowest level since April. So-called continuing claims declined to 14.844 million in the week ending Aug. 8 from a revised 15.480 million in the prior week. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast continued claims at 15 million.
Including those enrolled in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which provides benefits for those out of work who would not ordinarily qualify for standard state jobless benefits, the total number of people receiving assistance was 28.06 million in the week ended Aug. 1, down roughly 200,000 from the prior week.
Only 9.3 million of the 22 million jobs lost between February and April have been regained so far, and the economy suffered its largest slump since at least the end of World War Two in the second quarter, contracting by nearly 33% at an annualized rate.
Nonetheless, two other reports on Thursday showed a recovery is underway, although the pace has slackened in recent weeks. 
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's manufacturing index showed the pace of activity growth in the mid-Atlantic region slowed for a second straight month in August.
The Philadelphia Fed's business index slid to a reading of 17.2 from 24.1 in July. A reading above zero indicates expansion. Economists polled by Reuters had been looking for a reading of 21.
And the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index rose 1.4% in July, following increases of 3.0% and 3.1% in June and May, respectively.

""Despite the recent gains in the LEI, which remain fairly broad-based, the initial post-pandemic recovery appears to be losing steam,"" said Ataman Ozyildirim, the Conference Board's senior director of economic research. ""The LEI suggests that the pace of economic growth will weaken substantially during the final months of 2020.""

Investing.com -- The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased to 1.106 million last week, adding to fears that the recovery in the labor market is stalling. The prior week's figure was revised up to 971,000 from 963,000.
Economists had forecast a decline to 925,000. The number of people claiming Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for the first time also rose by 53,000 to 543,000, suggesting that the rate of layoffs remains high despite the gradual reopening of the economy.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, decreased to 14.844 million. The previous week's figure was also revised downwards to 15.480 million.
Including another 12.5 million or so Americans who are claiming Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, the total number of people claiming unemployment benefits as of August 1st fell by some 200,000 to 28.06 million.
The data comes a day after the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s July meeting showed that officials already see the rebound in the labor market slowing. The minutes also reiterated that the outlook for the economy hinges on the outlook for the virus.
The number of new coronavirus infections has eased markedly since last month, and is now at its lowest since June, but is still averaging over 40,000 a day, according to John Hopkins data.
The minutes also noted that since many provisions of the government's coronavirus fiscal relief package are due to expire while the labor market is still weak, ""additional fiscal aid would likely be important for supporting vulnerable families, and thus the economy more broadly, in the period ahead.""
Elsewhere, there was further evidence of the recovering flattening out as the Philadephia Federal Reserve's manufacturing index fell for a second straight month, and by more than expected, to 17.2.  The employment subindex fell particularly sharply, while capital spending and new orders held up slightly better.

884,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 08:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank policy makers expressed uncertainty at their latest policy meeting about the economic outlook and the extent to which they’ll have to deploy monetary stimulus.
The account of their July session showed officials were reluctant to draw conclusions from early signs of economic recovery after pandemic lockdowns were eased. Chief economist Philip Lane told the gathering that the breadth and scale of the recovery remained uneven and partial.
“At its September meeting the Governing Council would be in a better position to reassess the monetary policy stance and its policy tools,” the account of the meeting showed. “This would provide more clarity regarding the medium-term inflation outlook” and prospects for economic activity.
A sharp initial rebound had some officials speculating in the run-up to the gathering that the ECB might not need to spend the full 1.35 trillion euros ($1.6 trillion) earmarked for purchases under its pandemic program. That debate was reflected in the account, with some policy makers arguing that “the net purchase envelope should be considered a ceiling rather than a target.”
Other officials countered that the “current presumption” was that the envelope of the program “would have to be used in full.”
Since then, prospects for the economy have darkened, with some indicators suggesting activity has plateaued. Lane warned earlier this month that uncertainty about the coronavirus will weigh on consumers and businesses for some time.
Infections are rising again across Europe as peak vacation season is under way. That’s forced some governments to reinstate travel warnings and tighten restrictions on mask-wearing and social contact.
At the same time, unemployment is beginning to creep up -- despite generous furlough schemes in many countries. The numbers are likely to rise further in the coming months as governments start to phase out support programs.
In the U.S., central bankers backed off in July from an earlier readiness to set a clearer bar for raising interest rates. Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last meeting published Wednesday showed officials are committed to keeping policy ultra-loose so long as the coronavirus crisis is significantly holding the economy back.
ECB officials agreed at their last gathering to wait for new forecasts in September before reassessing the outlook. Most economists predicted ahead of the July meeting that the central bank would increase pandemic purchases this year.

885,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - The number of online job adverts posted by employers in Britain - a measure of how quickly the labour market might recover from its coronavirus slump - has fallen back slightly, the country's statistics office said on Thursday. 
Between Aug. 7 and 14, the total volume of online job adverts decreased to 58% from 62% of its 2019 average, partly offsetting a large increase in the previous week, the Office for National Statistics said. 
The figures used job adverts provided by Adzuna, an online job search engine, the ONS said.
Britain, like many other economies, is facing the prospect of a sharp rise in unemployment as the government phases out its emergency job subsidy scheme, which is due to close at the end of October.
The ONS said 12% of the workforce was on furlough, based on a survey it conducted between July 27 and Aug. 9, little changed from the previous two-week period.

It also said the number of people going shopping continued to rise slightly in the latest week. Overall footfall was 68% of its level the same day a year ago, the highest since the week beginning March 16, just before the lockdown fully started.

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation jumped unexpectedly last month to its highest since March, as clothes shops did not hold their usual summer sales when they reopened after the coronavirus lockdown, but most economists expect it to fall again soon.
Annual consumer price inflation rose to 1.0% in July from 0.6% in June, the Office for National Statistics said, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Most economists expect the rise to prove temporary -- especially as the impact of the government's ""Eat Out to Help Out"" restaurant discount kicks in during August. 
ING said ""the only way is down"". ""While ongoing supply-chain disruption will inevitably cause price spikes in certain areas, the more dominant factor will be the widely predicted rise in unemployment,"" ING economist James Smith said.
The consensus of economists polled by Reuters shows inflation remaining below the Bank of England's 2% target at least until the end of next year.
Nonetheless two-year inflation-linked bonds  priced in a higher rate of inflation at 2.675% on Wednesday, up from Tuesday's four-week low of 2.629%.
These bonds use the RPI measure of inflation, which rose to 1.6% in July from 1.1%, and this figure will also be used to calculate next year's annual increase in rail fares.
Clothing and footwear prices were the biggest contributor to the rise in inflation in July, the ONS said.
In most years retailers slash clothes prices between June and July to clear out their summer ranges in preparation for autumn.
This year, the drop in clothing and footwear prices was unusually small, perhaps reflecting discounting early in lockdown.
Higher petrol prices - and greater costs for haircuts, dentistry and physiotherapy - also contributed to higher inflation, the ONS said.
""Prices for private dental treatment, physiotherapy and haircuts have increased with the need for PPE (personal protective equipment) contributing to costs for these businesses,"" ONS Deputy National Statistician Jonathan Athow said.
Haircuts and other personal grooming cost 5.1% more than a year before.
Core inflation - which excludes typically volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices - rose to its highest in a year at 1.8% from June's 1.4%, versus expectations for a small fall.
The ONS said July's inflation number was based on near-complete coverage of its standard basket of goods and services, after widespread unavailability of some services at the start of the lockdown.
The Bank of England said earlier this month it expected inflation to turn briefly negative in the near-term, falling to -0.3% in August.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports extended their double-digit slump into a fifth month in July as the coronavirus pandemic took a heavy toll on auto shipments to the United States, dashing hopes for a trade-led recovery from the deep recession.
Meanwhile, core machinery orders, a leading indicator of business spending, unexpectedly fell to a seven-year low in June, dashing hopes domestic demand would make up for some of the slack from sluggish global growth.
The grim data suggests the depressed conditions seen in the world's third-largest economy in the second quarter showed no signs of rapid improvement in the current quarter, compounding challenges for policymakers as they look to prop up activity.
Total exports fell 19.2% in July from a year earlier, roughly in line with market expectations for a 21.0% decrease, government data showed on Wednesday.
It was, however, smaller than a 26.2% drop in June, which some analysts saw as a sign external demand may have bottomed out.
""Today's trade data confirmed that external demand hit bottom and is heading toward gradual recovery,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.
""But the pace of recovery remains slow. Given the risk of a second wave of infections, it will take a couple of years before exports and GDP return to pre-pandemic levels,"" he said.
Shipments to the United States plunged 19.5% in the year to July as demand for engines and automobile remained weak, a sign Japan was feeling the pinch from the slow U.S. recovery from the pandemic's pain.
Globally, automakers are taking a heavy hit from the coronavirus, which has shuttered vehicle factories and kept customers out of car dealerships.
Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269) said this month its operating profit nearly wiped out during the June quarter because of plunging car sales in India, its biggest market.
SLOW RECOVERY
In a glimmer of hope, exports to China - Japan's largest trading partner - rose 8.2% to mark the first increase in seven months on brisk demand for chip-manufacturing equipment and cars.
But those to the rest of Asia were down 8.2%, the data showed, reinforcing expectations that a full-fledged recovery in regional trade was still some time off.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 7.6% in June, confounding market estimates of a 2.0% gain.
Foreign orders dropped 3.9% in June from the previous month, extending declines to a fourth straight month, but slowing from double digit falls seen in April and May.
Total core orders slumped to 706.6 billion yen ($6.72 billion), the lowest since February 2013, forcing the government to downgrade its assessment to say machinery orders were ""declining.""
Manufacturers surveyed by the government expect core orders to fall 1.9% in the current quarter after dropping 12.9% in April-June, the data showed.
A decline in July-September would mark the fifth straight quarter of falls, the longest streak of decrease since orders slid for six straight quarters during the 2008 global financial crisis.
Adding to the gloom, a survey from Tokyo Shoko Research on Tuesday showed 8.5% of small firms, or more than 300,000 companies, could go out of business if the pandemic is prolonged. Such firms employ 7 out of 10 workers in Japan.
Japan's economy suffered a record annualized contraction in April-June as the pandemic crushed demand for cars and other exports and kept consumers confined at home.

Analysts expect any rebound in the current quarter to be modest as a resurgence of infections will likely put a lid on demand both at home and abroad.

Japanese exports continued to drop steeply in July but fell by the smallest margin in four months as a recovery in shipments to China helped cushion declines to Europe and other key markets where the coronavirus is spreading rapidly.
The value of Japan’s overseas shipments declined 19.2% from a year earlier amid continued steep falls for cars and auto parts, the finance ministry reported Wednesday. The overall slide was slightly better than economists’ projection for a 20.9% drop, but still far short of indicating a strong rebound.
A separate report showed machinery orders fell by 7.6% in June from the previous month, suggesting that a revival in capital spending could be delayed. Analysts had forecast a 2% gain in the volatile data.

Housing starts increased 22.6% - the biggest gain since October 2016 - to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.496 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Data for June was revised up to a 1.22 million-unit pace from the previously reported 1.186 million.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would increase to a rate of 1.24 million units. July's data exceeded even the highest estimate of 1.32 million units.
July's construction pace was the fastest since February, the month when a record-long U.S. economic expansion abruptly ended as the coronavirus began spreading rapidly around the country, triggering business shutdowns and widespread stay-at-home orders. With last month's increase, new home building is just 4.5% below February's pace of 1.567 million units.
On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 Index (SPX) regained a record high in Tuesday morning trading, completing a full recovery from the stock market crash after the onset of the coronavirus crisis in February. Shares of several leading U.S. homebuilders were also at a record, including DR Horton Inc (N:DHI) and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN). Shares of both are up around 40% this year. 
STARTS UP IN ALL REGIONS
The largest increases in homebuilding were in the Northeast, up 35% from June, and the South, up 33% from the prior month. Construction starts were up by around 6% in the Midwest and West.
Multi-family projects of five units or more surged by nearly 57% - also the largest increase since October 2016 - while single-family construction rose by just 8.2%.
On Monday, the National Association of Home Builders reported confidence among housing construction firms surged this month to match a record high. On Friday, the National Association of Realtors is expected to report sales of previously owned homes accelerated for a second month, to the fastest rate since February.
""Strong demand and a record level of homebuilder confidence will support housing starts in the second half of 2020, but the still-widespread coronavirus and an economy struggling to recover without fiscal support may limit the upside,"" Oxford Economics economists wrote in a note after the housing starts release.

Building permits issuance, considered a more forward-looking gauge of residential construction activity, also accelerated in July. Permits issuance totaled 1.495 million units at an annualized rate, up 18.8% from 1.258 million in June.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia posted its biggest trade surplus in nine years in July, as exports improved while domestic demand for imports remained subdued amid the coronavirus pandemic, data from the statistics bureau showed on Tuesday.
Southeast Asia's largest economy reported a $3.26 billion surplus in July, the bureau said, the biggest since August, 2011, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. 
The figure handily beat a forecast in a Reuters poll for a $680 million surplus and followed a $1.27 billion surplus in June.
July exports grew 14.33% from June to $13.73 billion, though were 9.90% below the value of shipments in the same month last year. Still, the pace of contraction was slower than the poll's prediction for a 16.65% drop.
By value, exports were the highest since March. Statistics bureau chief Suhariyanto attributed this to sales of agricultural products like palm oil, herbs and birds nests, and despite weaker exports of coal, rubber and oil and gas.
Imports plunged 32.55% on an annual basis to $10.47 billion, steeper than the 22.48% fall expected in the poll.
The data indicates the potential for a further narrowing of the current account deficit for the rest of the year, even after it significantly narrowed in the first half due to the pandemic.
Central bank data earlier on Tuesday showed Indonesia's current account gap in April-June was equal to 1.2% of GDP, less than half the deficit in the same period in 2019.
Bank Danamon's economist, Wisnu Wardana, said despite the trade data the central bank may need to consider a number of other indicators before utilising ""a limited room of monetary easing"", such as inflation and the rupiah's movement.

Bank Indonesia (BI) is due to wrap up a two-day policy review on Wednesday. The majority of economists in a Reuters poll, including Wardana, expects the benchmark rate to remain unchanged after four cuts to support the economy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's manufacturers were their least pessimistic in four months in August, the Reuters Tankan survey of business sentiment showed on Tuesday, but signalled a slow recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
The reading highlights the immense task policymakers face to pull the economy out of its deepest recession on record after the coronavirus pandemic pummelled corporate and household activity.
The poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched ""tankan"" quarterly survey, pointed to a modest recovery, with manufacturers' morale seen somewhat less negative in the coming months.
Tuesday's survey found that the mood of manufacturers rose to minus 33 in August from minus 44 the previous month, its highest since February. The service-sector gauge was at minus 23 from minus 26.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are derived by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means that pessimists outnumber optimists.
""Demand is on an improving trend compared to the first quarter but it remains at about 70% of what we had projected,"" a manager at a transport equipment maker wrote in the survey.
Data on Monday showed Japan was hit by its largest economic slump on record in the second quarter as the health crisis delivered a blow to consumption and exports.
Though the overall mood remained pessimistic, all industry categories but oil refinery/ceramics were less gloomy than in the previous month, the poll showed.
Some firms warned of uncertainty in the months ahead because of resurfacing U.S.-China trade tensions.
""Conditions in the domestic market are still bad,"" a manager at a chemicals maker wrote in the survey. ""Even if quantity (of orders) returns in Asia, prices won't match that due to intensifying competition.""
Manufacturers' sentiment was seen recovering further to minus 22 in November, while that of service-sector firms was expected to drop to minus 26, according to the poll of 495 large- and mid-sized non-financial companies, of which 232 firms responded, on condition of anonymity.

Among services, those from the information/communications and retailers sectors were positive about business conditions, while the others remained gloomy.

895,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 03:50PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - U.S. home builder confidence rose for a third straight month in August to match its highest level ever as record-low interest rates spur buyer traffic, data released on Monday showed in the latest indication the housing market is a rare bright spot in the economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. 
At the same time, however, a growing number of home owners are falling behind on their mortgages with tens of millions still out of work and growing signs that the labor market recovery is softening.
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose 6 points to 78, matching a series record set in 1998. The median expectation among 30 economists in a Reuters poll was for a rise to 73 from July's reading of 72.
NAHB's measures of both current and future home sales improved. 
""Housing has clearly been a bright spot during the pandemic and the sharp rebound in builder confidence over the summer has led NAHB to upgrade its forecast for single-family starts, which are now projected to show only a slight decline for 2020,"" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. ""Single-family construction is benefiting from low interest rates and a noticeable suburban shift in housing demand to suburbs, exurbs and rural markets as renters and buyers seek out more affordable, lower density markets.""
But even as home builder confidence surges, more homeowners affected by the crisis have stopped paying their mortgages, a separate report showed. 
The delinquency rate for residential mortgages rose to 8.2% in the second quarter, up nearly 4 percentage points from the first quarter and the largest quarterly increase on record, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
Loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, a program used by many first-time buyers and those with lower incomes, saw their delinquency rate jump to almost 16% - the highest since the survey began more than four decades ago. 
The figures reflect the struggles faced by millions of homeowners during the crisis, including many participating in a forbearance program that allows people facing financial struggles because of the pandemic to put off their mortgage payments for up to one year. An estimated 4.2 million homeowners had loans in forbearance as of the end of June, according to the MBA. 
That forbearance program, combined with rising home values and other loan modification options can offer relief to struggling homeowners, said Marina Walsh, vice president of industry analysis for the MBA.
There was a glimmer of positive news in the delinquency report: The 30-day delinquency rate dropped by 0.33 percentage point to 2.34% in the second quarter. 
That suggests fewer homeowners fell newly behind on payments as the unemployment rate dropped in May and June, Walsh said. ""The flood of new delinquencies is dropping off,"" Walsh said, adding that the mortgage delinquency rate tends to rise when the unemployment rate increases and vice versa. 
The U.S. Census Bureau will report July's housing starts data on Tuesday, and economists polled by Reuters are looking for an increase to 1.24 million units on an annualized basis from 1.186 million in June. 
Housing starts plunged this spring during widespread lockdown orders issued to try to contain the virus, but have rebounded sharply from a six-year low hit in April. The economy fell into recession in February as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A separate report from the New York Federal Reserve Bank on Monday showed the pace of growth in manufacturing activity slowing much more than expected in August from a 14-month high in July.
The New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey index dropped to 3.7 from 17.2. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 15, with a reading above zero indicating expansion.

The survey's measures of new orders and shipments both pulled back after three straight months of increases.

896,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - The financial health of British households deteriorated in August at a faster pace than last month, in an unpromising sign for the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, a survey showed on Monday.
The Household Finance Index from data company IHS Markit fell to 40.8 in August from 41.5 in July, dragged down by the biggest drop in job security since 2011.
A wave of lay-offs is already underway and economists fear worse will come when the government's furlough scheme closes at the end of October.
Although economic output collapsed by a historic 20% in the second quarter of 2020, the official unemployment rate has not risen from its pre-pandemic level of 3.9% due to the furlough scheme as well as quirks in the joblessness definition.
Tax data suggests businesses have shed more than 700,000 staff since the start of the lockdown.
Earlier this month, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the central bank's projection for an unemployment rate of 7.5% at the end of this year was a ""very bad story"" for the British public, and warned that it could turn out worse than that.
""Overall, the data hint at some worrying trends when put in the context of the significant recession facing the UK,"" Lewis Cooper, an economist at IHS Markit, said.
""Incomes from employment fell sharply again, while the survey measure of job security perceptions remained firmly in negative territory as the winding down of the government's furlough scheme looms.""
Other indicators of the consumer economy like retail sales have shown a rapid rebound since the COVID-19 restrictions were loosened, although evidence from businesses has been mixed. 

The IHS Markit survey of 1,500 adults took place from Aug. 6 to Aug. 9.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan was hit by its biggest economic slump on record in the second quarter as the coronavirus pandemic emptied shopping malls and crushed demand for cars and other exports, bolstering the case for bolder policy action to prevent a deeper recession.
The third straight quarter of declines knocked the size of real gross domestic product (GDP) to decade-low levels, wiping out the benefits brought by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies deployed in late 2012.
While the economy is emerging from the doldrums after lockdowns were lifted in late May, many analysts expect any rebound in the current quarter to be modest as a renewed rise in infections keep consumers' purse-strings tight.
""The big decline can be explained by the decrease in consumption and exports,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""I expect growth to turn positive in the July-September quarter. But globally, the rebound is sluggish everywhere except for China.""
The world's third-largest economy shrank an annualised 27.8% in April-June, government data showed on Monday, marking the biggest decline since comparable data became available in 1980 and slightly off a 27.2% fall forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
While the contraction was smaller than a 32.9% decrease in the United States, it was much bigger than a 17.8% fall in Japan in the first quarter of 2009, when the Lehman Brothers collapse jolted global financial markets.
The size of Japan's real GDP shrank to 485 trillion yen, the lowest since April-June 2011, when Japan was still suffering from two decades of deflation and economic stagnation.
Japanese stocks fell on Monday by the most in two weeks and yields on most government bonds fell on the weak GDP data.
Elsewhere in the region, Thailand reported its biggest economic decline since the Asian financial crisis of 1998.

CONSUMPTION PLUNGES
Underlying Japan's dismal reading was private consumption, which plunged a record 8.2% as lock-down measures to prevent the spread of the virus kept consumers at home.
External demand - or exports minus imports - shaved a record 3.0 percentage point off GDP, as overseas shipments tumbled 18.5%, with auto exports hit particularly hard.
Falling global vehicle sales have hurt automakers like Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201), among the biggest drivers of Japan's economy.
Capital expenditure declined 1.5% in the second quarter, less than a forecast 4.2% fall, as solid software investment made up for weak spending in other sectors.
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura conceded the GDP readings were ""pretty severe,"" but pointed to some bright spots such as a recent pickup in consumption.
However, some analysts warn that companies could cut jobs and spending if a resurgence in infections and soft global demand continue to hurt their bottom line.
Renewed U.S.-China tensions may also weigh on the fragile recovery. About 90% of economists surveyed by Reuters expect the conflict to affect Japan's economy.
""Demand for business investment is expected to fall due to worsening corporate profits and risk of the coronavirus spreading,"" said Saisuke Sakai, senior economist at Mizuho Research institute.
""There is a chance economic activity may stagnate if major nations adopt lockdown measures again, or Japan re-issues a state of emergency,"" he said.
Japan has deployed massive fiscal and monetary stimulus to cushion the blow from the pandemic, which hit an economy already reeling from last year's sales tax hike and the U.S.-China trade war.

While the economy has re-opened after the government lifted state of emergency measures in late May, a recent worrying rise in infections cloud the outlook.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's economy suffered its biggest annual contraction since the Asian financial crisis in the second quarter due to the fallout of the coronavirus, prompting the government to slash its GDP forecast for the year and announce more stimulus.
Data from the state planning agency showed a 100% fall in foreign tourism dealt the biggest blow to Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, while the coronavirus and measures to curb it also hit consumption, private investment and exports.
New Deputy Prime Minister Supattanapong Punmeechaow told a media conference the government would announce more stimulus this month, ""to support the economy and all groups of affected people,"" adding these would be discussed at a Aug 19 meeting.
The data, which also showed a record contraction quarter-on-quarter, represents another headache for the government, also facing its biggest anti-government protests since the 2014 coup.
""Today's economic release underscores the collapse of aggregate demand, both externally and internally,"" said Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital markets research of Kasikornbank.
""Recovery will be lengthy as the shock to the demand and supply side has been the most severe in living memory.""
Thailand's economy, which is heavily reliant on tourism and exports, shrank 12.2% in the second quarter from a year earlier after a revised 2.0% fall in the March quarter. It fell a record 9.7% on the quarter, on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Economists in a Reuters poll had forecast the economy would shrink 13.3% year-on-year and fall 11.4% quarter-on-quarter.
The National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) cut its gross domestic product forecast for the year, expecting the economy to fall 7.3%-7.8% in 2020, having previously forecast a 5%-6% slump. The economy saw a record annual contraction of 7.6% in 1998.
While Thailand has lifted most curbs after seeing no local transmission of the coronavirus for over 80 days, its economy continues to suffer from tepid global demand and an ongoing ban on foreign visitor numbers.
On Monday, the NESDC said it expected only 6.7 million foreign tourists to come to Thailand this year after last year's record 39.8 million and said there were no foreign tourists in the second quarter. 
Meanwhile, NESDC expected a 10% fall in exports in 2020, having previously forecast an 8% decline.
""A clear economic recovery will take place once there is a vaccine, which we expect in the middle of next year,"" NESDC head Thosaporn Sirisumphand told a separate press conference.
The government has already supported the economy with a 1.9 trillion baht ($61 billion) fiscal stimulus package, while the central bank has slashed interest rates by 75 basis points this year to a record low of 0.50%.

The main stock index (SETI) dropped 0.5% in early afternoon while the baht  was little changed.

899,"<span>Aug 16, 2020 09:27PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s economy suffered a record contraction last quarter as a state of emergency and lockdowns in the country’s major export markets hammered consumer spending, production and exports. A recent uptick in infections threatens to slow the recovery.
Gross domestic product contracted an annualized 27.8% in the three months through June from the previous quarter, the Cabinet Office reported Monday, the worst for data back to 1955. Analysts had forecast a 26.9% decline. Until the pandemic, the economy’s worst single quarter was during the global financial crisis, when GDP shrank about 18%.
The figures showed a sharp drop in private consumption was the biggest drag on the economy as the virus-triggered emergency kept shoppers at home. Some factory production lines were also idled as lockdowns in the country’s major export markets contributed to the slide.
The question for policy makers and economists now is how quickly the economy can recover from the body blow and whether activity will need to be restricted again after a rise in virus cases.

What Bloomberg’s Economist Says
“Beyond 2Q, high-frequency indicators suggest the economy has been recovering in 3Q. Even so, the virus outbreak in Japan has taken a turn for the worse, prompting the government to reintroduce containment measures. This risks thwarting the recovery.”
