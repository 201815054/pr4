NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's retail inflation accelerated in November, led by a rise in food prices, but remained within the medium-term target of the central bank, strengthening views that the bank could keep interest rates on hold at its next meeting in February.
Consumer prices rose 4.91% in November from the same month last year, speeding up from October's 4.48% but lower than the consensus Reuters poll forecast of 5.10%, Ministry of Statistics data showed on Monday.
The Reserve Bank of India left interest rates on hold last week, saying growth was a priority as it warned of risks from inflation and the new Omircon variant on the economic recovery. 
India's economy expanded 8.4% in the September quarter from a year earlier, the fastest pace among major economies, but economists say the pandemic situation is a wild card.
The central bank expects retail inflation at 5.1% for October-December period and 5.7% for January-March quarter in the current financial year. 
Food prices, which contribute to nearly half of the consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.87% year-on-year in November, compared with 0.85% a month before. Prices of edible oil rose nearly 30% from a year ago period while vegetable prices fell by 13.6%.
Inflation has been within the RBI's 2-6% target range in recent months, and a cut in fuel tax last month by the federal government and softening of global crude oil prices have dampened inflationary pressures. 
Economists, have, however warned of risks of uptick in headline inflation over the coming months as companies pass on rising input costs to consumers amid economic recovery. 
""CPI inflation is set to rise further over the coming months and the risks are stacked to the upside,"" said Shilan Shah, India economist at Capital Economics. 
However, any rise in inflation is unlikely to trigger monetary tightening by the central bank, he said. 
Retail fuel prices rose 13.35% in November year-on-year compared to 14.35% in the previous month, the data showed. 

Annual core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, was estimated at between 6.08% and 6.2% in November, according to three economists, compared with 6% to 6.1% in the previous month.
The government does not release core inflation numbers.

The price measure is widely considered an indicator of future inflationary tendencies as wholesale trade is the hinge between manufacturers and end-customers.
""The high rates of change for wholesale prices in annual comparison derive from increased prices for raw materials and intermediate products,"" the Federal Statistics Office said in a statement.
The largest impact on the annual measure came from increased prices for mineral oil products, which rose 62.4% on the year.
Supply chain bottlenecks have put upwards pressure on the cost of intermediate products.
More than half of German companies doing business abroad are suffering severe problems in their supply chains or logistics, pushing them to diversify suppliers, shorten delivery routes and even relocate their own production, a survey showed last month.
German consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose 6.0% year-on-year in November, increasing pressure on the European Central Bank to react.

Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said last month - just before taking office - that very high inflation rates had to be watched closely.
On the month, wholesale prices rose 1.3% in November.

Shipment numbers were up from about 27.7 million in November 2020 and 32.7 million in October 2021, according to the CAICT, a state-backed think-tank.
Handset brands are currently experiencing production issuesdue to a global computer chip shortage.
A combination of factors including demand miscalculation,unexpected factory shutdowns and U.S.-China tensions haveprompted a number of automobile companies to report chipsourcing issues.

LONDON (Reuters) - The number of British manufacturers raising prices has hit its highest in at least two decades, according to a survey published on Monday as the Bank of England considers whether to head off inflation pressure with an interest rate hike this week.
Trade body Make UK and accountants BDO said a net balance of 52% of manufacturers had increased their prices in the final three months of the year, up from 50% three months earlier and the fourth quarterly rise in a row.
It was the highest reading since the survey began asking questions about prices in 2000, pushed up in large part by global supply chain problems since the COVID-19 pandemic, and the share was likely to rise further to 58% in early 2022.
Domestic market orders outpaced export orders but demand for both was slowing, the survey showed.
Make UK said it remained positive about manufacturing output growth for next quarter but lowered its forecast for 2021 from 7.1% to 6.9% and predicted growth of 3.3% in 2022.
""While manufacturers will be able to enjoy some festive cheer this year, their spirits will be tempered by the eye-watering impact of escalating cost pressures,"" James Brougham, senior economist at Make UK, said.
""Given the global nature of some of these pressures there is little sign that they will abate anytime soon. However, they will hope as we enter a fresh year that these will gradually unwind,"" he said.
Richard Austin, head of manufacturing at BDO, said orders and output remained very positive compared to historical levels but input prices, labour, logistics and inflation were ""settling in for the long haul.""
Official data last week showed British manufacturing output in October remained more than 2% below its pre-pandemic level. 

The survey of 303 companies was conducted between Nov. 3 and Nov. 24.
The figures come ahead of the BoE's interest rate announcement on Thursday as it tries to balance rising inflationary pressures with the risk that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus slows Britain's recovery from the pandemic.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's service-sector mood improved to a two-year high but the recovery among manufacturers stalled, a closely watched central bank survey showed, a sign rising raw material costs was weighing on the economy's recovery from the pandemic.
Big firms expect conditions to worsen ahead as high fuel prices and a weak yen push up import costs, reinforcing expectations Japan will maintain massive fiscal and monetary support to underpin a fragile economy.
""Non-manufacturers' sentiment got a boost from the end to pandemic curbs, while supply constraints hit manufacturers,"" said Toru Suehiro, an analyst at Daiwa Securities.
""Overall, business confidence lacks strength with both manufacturers and non-manufacturers expecting conditions to worsen,"" he said.
The headline index gauging big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 18 in the final quarter of 2021, unchanged from the previous quarter and below a market forecast for plus 19, the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) tankan survey showed on Monday.
Rising costs and auto output disruptions hit industries such as non-ferrous metals, chemicals and machinery, it showed.
By contrast, big non-manufacturers' sentiment improved for the sixth straight quarter at plus 9, up from plus 2 in September and exceeding market forecasts of plus 6.
The index hit the highest level since December 2019, as the Sept. 30 lifting of state of emergency curbs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic boosted morale among retailers.
But the survey, conducted for a month through Dec. 10, likely did not incorporate much of the recent spread of the Omicron variant, with nearly 80% of the replies coming in by Nov. 29.
Rising raw material costs add to uncertainty by squeezing profits of firms just emerging from the pandemic's hit.
An index gauging big manufacturers' output prices rose to levels last seen in 1980, though the gauge for input prices was also at its highest since 2008, the survey showed, a sign firms may struggle to hike prices as much as needed to cover costs.
Companies expect inflation to hit 1.1% a year from now, the tankan showed, marking the highest level since September 2015.
Despite the murky outlook, companies plan to increase hiring and capital expenditure to deal with a chronic labour shortage.
Big firms plan to increase capital spending by 9.3% in the year ending in March 2022, less than market forecasts for a 9.8% gain but rebounding from an 8.3% drop in the previous year.
Separate data showed machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital expenditure, rose in October for the first time in three months.
The tankan also showed corporate funding continued to ease, giving the BOJ scope to phase out emergency support deployed last year to combat a pandemic-induced credit crunch.

Japan has lagged other countries in staging a strong rebound from last year's pandemic hit, shrinking an annualised 3.6% in July-September due to weak consumption and output hit by a spike in infections and supply constraints.
While analysts expect growth to bounce back in the final quarter of this year, some warn the emergence of Omicron clouds the outlook and may keep the recovery feeble next year.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's core machinery orders rose in October for the first time in three months as service sector firms ramped up investment amid low COVID-19 infections, a welcome sign firms were spending and the broader economy was recovering.
The world's third-largest economy is set to post a solid rebound this quarter after a larger-than-expected contraction in July-September, although the outlook is currently blurred by uncertainties around the new Omicron coronavirus variant.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 3.8% in October from the previous month, the Cabinet Office data showed on Monday.
That compared with a 2.1% expansion forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and followed no change in September.
Core orders from service-sector firms excluding ships and electrical utilities gained 16.5% month-on-month in October, led by transport and postal services that grew 170.1% due to large-scale orders for railroad vehicles.
""As the coronavirus outbreak settled down, capital expenditure among a broad range of non-manufacturers grew,"" a government official told reporters.
Meanwhile, orders from manufacturers declined 15.4% from a month earlier, as decreasing demand from chemical firms offset growth from semiconductor-making equipment and production machinery companies.
In a year-on-year basis, core orders rose 2.9% in October, the data showed, versus a 4.0% rise expected by economists.
Companies' capital expenditure slowed in the third quarter due to a global resurgence of COVID-19 outbreak, which particularly battered carmakers and other manufacturers dependent on parts supplies from Asian factories.

While supply bottlenecks eased, the outlook on production and spending remained sluggish. The Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey on Monday showed large manufacturers' business mood was flat in December from October, whereas sentiment among service-sector firms improved more than expected.
The central bank is expected at this week's policy review to debate whether to extend pandemic relief programmes beyond their current March 2022 deadline, although no change to its ultra-easy monetary policy is expected.

6,"<span>Dec 12, 2021 07:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Confidence among Japan’s large manufacturers held at the highest level since 2018 but slippage in the outlook signaled that the omicron variant has clouded views on the country’s economic recovery.
Sentiment among big makers of products stayed at 18 this month, while an index of the outlook slipped to 13, according to the Bank of Japan’s quarterly Tankan survey released Monday. The index subtracts the percentage of pessimists from the percentage of optimists.
 
The Tankan offers a key piece of information for BOJ policy board members as they decide the fate of a special Covid funding program as early as Friday. Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya said last week that economic uncertainty is extremely high partly due to the emergence of the new variant.
Until the emergence of omicron, Japanese businesses had seen reasons for more optimism compared with the summer. Infection cases at home and a continued economic recovery in their main export destinations from U.S. to China had given cause for guarded bullishness. 
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also likely helped buoy corporate sentiment by unveiling a larger-than-expected economic package last month offering record fiscal support for the economy.    
The Tankan survey was taken from Nov. 10 to Dec. 10, so at least some of the businesses responding factored omicron into their answers. The variant was flagged as a variant of concern on Nov. 26.
A separate report Monday from the Cabinet Office showed orders for Japanese machinery rose for the first time in three months. Bookings are a signal of planned capital spending.

The November deficit was $4 billion below the median estimate among economists polled by Reuters of $195 billion.
Receipts for the second month of the federal government's fiscal year totaled $281 billion, up 28% and a record for the month of November, the Treasury Department said. Individual tax receipts rose 27% to $244 billion.
A Treasury official said the increase stems largely from the improvement in the economy and people continuing to return to work after last year's widespread shutdowns from the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered a short but sharp recession.
Spending also was a record for the month of November, with total outlays of $473 billion, up 30% from November 2020's $365 billion. Spending increases for the Health and Human Services and Treasury departments largely arising from pandemic programs drove most of the increase.
For the fiscal year 2022 to date the deficit totaled $356 billion, a decrease of 17% from the first two months of fiscal 2021, which is being fueled by record year-to-date increases in government revenue.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in November as Americans paid more for food and a range goods, leading to the largest annual gain since 1982, posing a political nightmare for President Joe Biden's administration and cementing expectations for the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates next year.
The report from the Labor Department on Friday, which followed on the heels of a slew of data this month showing a rapidly tightening labor market, makes it likely the U.S. central bank will announce that it is speeding up the wind-down of its massive bond purchases at its policy meeting next week. 
With supply bottlenecks showing little sign of easing and companies raising wages as they compete for scarce workers, high inflation could persist well into 2022. The increased cost of living, the result of shortages caused by the relentless COVID-19 pandemic, is hurting Biden's approval rating. The White House and the Fed have characterized high inflation this year as transitory.
""There's not much room to explain away this inflation from pandemic or reopening anomalies,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Inflation is a tax, gas and food are among the most regressive aspects of it. Lower-income Americans spend disproportionately on both.""
The consumer price index increased 0.8% last month after surging 0.9% in October. The broad-based rise was led by gasoline prices, which increased 6.1%, matching October's gain. With crude oil prices declining recently, gasoline prices have likely peaked for now.
Food prices rose 0.7%. The cost of food at home increased 0.8%, driven by a jump in the price of fruits and vegetables, meat, and cereals and bakery products. The price of food consumed at home gained 6.4% over the past 12 months, the most since December 2008. Dining out was also more expensive last month.
In the 12 months through November, the CPI accelerated 6.8%. That was the biggest year-on-year rise since June 1982 and followed a 6.2% advance in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would climb 0.7% and rise 6.8% on a year-on-year basis.
Rising inflation is eroding wage gains. Inflation-adjusted average weekly earnings fell 1.9% on a year-on-year basis in November.
Biden acknowledged the increased burden on household budgets from the high inflation, while trying to reassure Americans that the country was pushing ahead with efforts to ease supply bottlenecks.
""We are making progress on pandemic-related challenges to our supply chain which make it more expensive to get goods on shelves, and I expect more progress on that in the weeks ahead,"" Biden said in a statement.
Indeed, gasoline prices have been trending lower since the end of November. That helped to lift consumer sentiment in early December, a separate survey from the University of Michigan showed on Friday.

Investors took the strong inflation readings in stride. U.S. stocks were trading higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.  
TIGHTENING LABOR MARKET 
The government reported last week that the unemployment rate fell to a 21-month low of 4.2% in November. Tightening labor market conditions were underscored by a report on Thursday showing new applications for unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest level in more than 52 years last week.
Other data this week showed there were 11 million job openings at the end of October and Americans quit jobs at near-record rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the U.S. central bank should consider hastening the tapering of its bond purchases at its policy meeting next week.
""The Fed has little choice but to accelerate tapering and prepare for the possibility of much earlier rate hikes than it was planning just a few months ago,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.5% last month after gaining 0.6% in October. The so-called core CPI was supported by rents, with owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would receive from renting a home, rising a solid 0.4%.
(Graphic: Core CPI, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/egvbkolqnpq/corecpi.png) 
Hotel and motel accommodation also cost more as did apparel, household furnishings and healthcare.
Prices for used cars and trucks increased 2.5% for a second straight month. New motor vehicle prices rose 1.1%, marking the eighth consecutive month of gains. A global semiconductor shortage has undercut motor vehicle production. 
Airline fares rebounded 4.7%. But gains are likely to be curbed by the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, which could make some people hesitant to travel by air. The United States is already experiencing a resurgence in coronavirus infections, driven by the Delta variant. 
But the cost of motor vehicle insurance fell. Recreation prices dropped after nine straight months of gains. The so-called core CPI jumped 4.9% on a year-on-year basis, the largest rise since June 1991, after increasing 4.6% in October.
The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, for its flexible 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index surged 4.1% in the 12 months through October, the most since January 1991. Data for November will be released later this month.
(Graphic: The COVID inflation surge, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/akvezawxopr/chart.png) 

Economists expect the year-on-year CPI could top 7% before falling back and the core CPI rate could rise above 6%.
""The recent strength in CPI and PCE inflation reflects both factors that are temporary and should fade over time and factors that could be more persistent,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But the tightening in the labor market likely will continue over time and this should keep upward pressure on inflation.""

9,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 10:41AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - U.S. consumers' moods brightened unexpectedly in early December with an outsized increase in sentiment among lower-income households lifting overall sentiment from the lowest in a decade, a survey showed on Friday.
The University of Michigan's closely watched Consumer Sentiment Index rose to 70.4 this month from a final November reading 67.4, which had been the lowest since November 2011. Economists polled by Reuters had been expecting it to slip further, with a median estimate of 67.1.
Readings of both current conditions and future expectations also improved unexpectedly.

The increase in headline sentiment was powered entirely by a 23.6% improvement among households in the lower one-third of the survey's income distribution, the biggest monthly increase for that group since 1980. This was driven by expectations of improving incomes in the year ahead. Sentiment slipped further for the middle and upper thirds.
""While it is usually assumed that such extreme changes represent an erroneous result due to small samples, in 1980 it was the households in the bottom income third that initially signaled the end of the first part of the double recession in 1980-82, with upper income households following in subsequent months,"" survey Director Richard Curtin said in a statement.

“This report solidifies the view of what the Fed’s path will be. This further alleviates any doubt as to an acceleration of their tapering to come out of next week’s meeting. What will be key to watch from the Fed is their dot plot to see committee members’ views of when the path of hikes will come over the next two years.
“Today’s report probably doesn’t change what the market’s perspectives on when rate hikes begin, which consensus shows is some time in the second quarter. 
  “The inflation trends continue, but the trends are a little bit worrisome right now.”
MICHAEL ARONE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISORS, BOSTON
“Today’s CPI report confirmed what most Americans already know, and that is prices across a number of the components have been increasing and increasing by the largest amounts we’ve seen in decades. There’s not a big surprise here, most of this data was expected.
“The Fed is set to accelerate the tapering, and that means they’ll end in March and they’re likely to begin to raise rates at that point. Again, most of that is priced into the market already, and the Fed is behind the curve and they need to catch up. They’ll start to do that at next week’s meeting.
“The market’s positive reaction is interesting in that this data suggests that the Fed will have to tighten monetary policy more aggressively than just a couple of month ago, and the market’s acceptance of that is a little surprising to me.”
THOMAS HAYES, MANAGING MEMBER, GREAT HILL CAPITAL LLC, NEW YORK
""The market is up is because the numbers were pretty much in line with expectations, certainly on the core CPI front, and did not dramatically exceed as feared. The market doesn't like surprises.""
""The market has pretty much accepted the fact that they'll likely accelerate the tapering to end in March versus originally in June, that's known since the Powell pivot last week and now in line with expectations. The key variable now is how quickly will they be hiking rates and we won't know that until after March.""
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“The numbers came in just a bit higher than we’re looking for.”
“The good news is that over the past 12 months it didn’t exceed the top point. From that perspective it’s not going to cause jitters in the market because elevated inflation is already priced into the market. But this does mean we’re probably going to be faced by a more hawkish Fed and a change in monetary policy is likely to happen in the latter part of the second quarter of 2022.”
“I don’t think it’s going to impact the equity markets.”
JOHN CANAVAN, LEAD ANALYST, OXFORD ECONOMICS, NEW YORK

    ""From a market perspective, the response was clearly just relief. It wasn't worse than expected. The headline figures were very much in line with expectations, particularly on a year-over-year basis. And we've seen stocks rally, the dollar dip, and Treasuries rebound. That's clearly just a knee-jerk response to a little bit of relief given how often we have seen inflation figures outpace expectations. At least for this month, as high as inflation is, it was no worse than markets had previously expected.""
    ""With figures in line with expectations, I assume Fed expectations were similar, so this shouldn't really change anything one way or another. We continue to look for the Fed to pare down asset purchases next week or at least announce it next week.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy barely grew in October, even before the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant, further denting expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will raise interest rates next week for the first time since the pandemic struck.
Gross domestic product edged up by just 0.1%, slowing sharply from September's 0.6% growth and much weaker than a forecast of 0.4% in a Reuters poll of economists.
The world's fifth-biggest economy remained 0.5% smaller than it was just before Britain was first hit by COVID-19 in early 2020, the Office for National Statistics said.
""We've always acknowledged there could be bumps on our road to recovery,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said, adding that Britain's economic support measures and vaccine programme would keep the recovery on track.
Over the three months to October, the economy grew by 0.9%, its slowest since a lockdown in early 2021, the ONS said.
""Hopes that either the health or economic pain of this crisis would be all over by Christmas have been dashed,"" said James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think-tank.
INFLATION
""The possibility that restrictions will need to be tightened, combined with high inflation and rising energy bills, means government should prepare for fresh targeted economic support that may be necessary in the months ahead.""
Sandra Horsfield at Investec sounded less concerned, saying the weakness was mostly caused by global supply chain problems rather than a slump in demand. ""We would not regard it as a worrying signal for the outlook,"" she said.
Sterling fell as investors bet that the BoE, seeking to balance inflationary pressures with Omicron uncertainty, will again hold interest rates steady next Thursday.
A BoE survey showed inflation expectations among the public for the coming year jumped in November but were little changed for the longer term, the bank's main focus.
Economists cut their near-term growth forecasts after Friday's data. 
Allan Monks at JP Morgan predicted GDP would grow by 0.9% in the fourth quarter and in the first three months of 2022, down from his previous estimates of 1.3% and 1.0%, before bouncing back in the spring.
A strong rebound in Britain's economy earlier this year - following a near-10% slump in 2020 due to the pandemic - ran into supply chain problems over the summer and is expected to lose more momentum because of new COVID-19 restrictions to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. 
October's meagre growth was supported by a continued rise in face-to-face appointments at doctors' surgeries in England, which had fallen sharply during the pandemic, contributing to a 0.4% rise in output in Britain's dominant services sector.
But industrial output fell 0.6% due to a drop in electricity and gas production and oil field maintenance.
The manufacturing sector flat-lined amid supply chain problems and staff shortages. Construction fell by the most since April 2020, down by 1.8% from September.

Separately, the ONS released trade data showing that Britain's goods trade deficit narrowed to 13.9 billion pounds in October from 14.7 billion pounds in September.

Investing.com -- The British economy grew by less than expected in October, as supply chain issues and sharply rising input costs hit key sectors such as construction and car retail.
U.K. gross domestic product rose only 0.1% in October, below a consensus forecast of 0.4% and down from 0.6% in September. The construction sector contracted particularly sharply, by 1.8%, the largest fall since April 2020. The sector is 2.8% below its pre-pandemic level. October's fall in construction output was largely due to a drop off in new work. Industrial production also fell 0.6%, due largely to maintenance at oil and gas fields in the North Sea.
Monthly figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that U.K. GDP remains 0.5% below its pre-pandemic February 2020 level.  
Services continue to underpin the British economy, accounting for the 0.9% growth in GDP in the three months to October 2021. The sector's output overall is back to pre-Covid levels thanks to the gradual easing of restrictions over the last six months.  That included, notably, the reopening of the hospitality and entertainment sectors in the summer.
The biggest driver of October's growth in services came from human health and social work activities, which climbed by 3.5% with an increase in face-to-face appointments at doctors' surgeries in England, the ONS said.
The data had little effect on the British pound, which has already slumped this week on the assumption that the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 will force the Bank of England to delay its first interest rate hike again when its Monetary Policy Council meets next week. By 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the pound was down less than 0.1% at $1.3214.
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said the sluggish GDP figures meant the Bank of England's interest rate dilemma had intensified.
‘’The latest reading for the economy shows just how vulnerable the economy was to a fresh shock,"" Streeter said, adding: ""The spread of the Omicron variant is now set to be the body blow, sending the recovery reeling, while prices continue to climb. Although a rate rise can’t be completely ruled out next week, most bets are off that the Bank will push them up so soon. A rate rise in February is more likely to be on the table, as the inflation kettle is set to be whistling loudly by then.’’"

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's business mood improved in the three months to December and exports continued to benefit from robust global demand in November, a Reuters poll showed, offering policymakers hope the economy is gradually emerging from its pandemic-induced slump.
The data would bode well for the Bank of Japan, which is set to maintain ultra-easy policy next week and debate whether to phase out pandemic-relief fund schemes that expire in March.
The BOJ's closely-watched ""tankan"" survey is likely to show the headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment edged up to plus 19 in December from plus 18 three months ago, according to analysts polled by Reuters.
""Manufacturers' sentiment will likely improve as the worst has passed in terms of chip shortages, and supply constraints caused by Southeast Asian factory shutdowns are gradually easing,"" said analysts at Mizuho Research & Technologies.
Big non-manufacturers' sentiment index is also seen improving to plus 6 from plus 2, as the Sept. 30 lifting of state of emergency curbs to combat the pandemic helped boost consumption, the poll showed.
Big manufacturers and non-manufacturers both expect conditions to improve three months ahead, according to the poll, highlighting growing optimism among companies over the outlook.
The tankan will also show big firms plan to increase capital expenditure by 9.8% in the fiscal year ending in March, slightly lower than an estimate for a 10.1% gain in the previous survey, the poll showed.
But the December tankan is unlikely to factor in much of the impact of the recent spread of the Omicron new variant, which could hurt business confidence ahead, analysts say.
Markets are also focusing on the tankan's indices gauging corporate funding for clues on whether the BOJ will decide next week to scale down pandemic-relief funding support.
The BOJ will release the survey on Dec. 13 at 8:50 a.m. local time (Dec. 12 at 2350GMT).
Separate data on Japan's trade balance will show exports rose 21.2% in November from a year earlier, a sign robust global demand continues to underpin the economy, the poll showed.

Machinery orders, a leading indicator of corporate capital expenditure, likely rose 2.1% in October from the previous month, the poll showed.
The government will release the machinery orders data on Dec. 13 at 8:50 a.m. (Dec. 12 at 2350GMT), and the trade data on Dec. 16 at 8:50 a.m. (Dec. 15 at 2350GMT).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest level in more than 52 years last week as labor market conditions continued to tighten amid an acute shortage of workers.
The plunge reported by the Labor Department in its weekly unemployment claims report on Thursday was, however, probably exaggerated by difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations around this time of the year. 
The claims report, the most timely data on the economy's health, followed on the heels of news last week that the jobless rate fell to a 21-month low of 4.2% in November. Data on Wednesday showed there were 11 million job openings at the end of October and Americans quit jobs at near-record rates.
""While the latest data should be taken with a grain of salt given seasonal adjustments, we may be entering a stretch when lower-than-average layoffs continue until the 'Great Resignation' fades,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled 43,000 to a seasonally adjusted 184,000 for the week ended Dec. 4, the lowest level since September 1969. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 215,000 applications for the latest week.
Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April of 2020. Applications typically increase as the weather gets colder, but economists say this seasonal pattern is not holding because of a tightening labor market.
Unadjusted claims rose 63,680 to 280,665 last week, a smaller increase than had been anticipated. 
""The seasonal factors had expected an increase of 106,047 (or 48.9 percent) from the previous week,"" the Labor Department said in its report.
""The big jump in filings before seasonal adjustment was not fully realized, and the tight labor market may be limiting the amount of seasonal layoffs that take place around this time of year relative to norms,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
U.S. stocks were trading lower after three straight days of gains. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly higher. 
EXTREMELY LOW LAYOFFS
Filings increased sharply in California, New York, Texas and Michigan. There were also notable rises in Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Some of these states are experiencing a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.
Claims fell significantly in Virginia and North Carolina.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 21,250 to 218,750, the lowest level since March of 2020. It matches the average that prevailed from 2018 to 2019.
""The labor market continues to tighten on almost every metric and in almost every report that pertains to jobs,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""Layoffs are running at extremely low levels and consistent with a tight labor market when the unemployment rate averaged 3.8%.""
Labor market tightness bolsters Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's view that the U.S. central bank should consider speeding up the winding down of its massive bond purchases at its policy meeting next week. It also puts an early Fed interest rate increase on the table. 
The claims data aligns with other reports on consumer spending, manufacturing and services industries activity that have suggested the economy was regaining steam in the fourth quarter after a lull in the July-September period.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed the accumulation of wholesale inventories accelerated in October, supporting the stronger growth expectations. 
Fourth-quarter GDP growth estimates are as high as an 8.6% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter. 
But the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 poses a risk to the economic outlook. While little is known about the impact of the new variant, some slowdown in hiring and demand for services is likely, based on the experience with the Delta variant, which was responsible for the slowest economic growth pace in more than a year last quarter.
Rising coronavirus infections could also delay the much anticipated return to the labor force by the millions of unemployed Americans, some of whom started trickling back in November. The workforce remains 2.4 million below its pre-pandemic level even as generous federal government-funded benefits have expired and schools reopened for in-person learning. Companies are also raising wages.

The claims report showed continuing claims rose 38,000 to 1.992 million in the week ended Nov. 27. There were 1.948 million people receiving benefits under all programs in the week ended Nov. 20, down 350,527 from the prior week.
Worker shortages are hampering job growth. The government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls increased by 210,000 jobs, the fewest since last December.

16,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 10:41AM ET</span>",,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories increased a bit more than initially thought in October, suggesting that the restocking of warehouses could again support economic growth this quarter. 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that wholesale inventories accelerated 2.3%, instead of 2.2% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers increased 1.4% in September.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected inventories would be unrevised. Wholesale inventories jumped 14.4% in October from a year earlier.
Motor vehicle inventories rebounded 2.3% after falling 1.5% in September. They continue to be constrained by a global shortage of semiconductors, which has hampered motor vehicle production.
Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. Wholesale inventories, excluding autos, advanced 2.3% in October. This component goes into the calculation of GDP.
A moderate pace of inventory drawdown in the third quarter accounted for all of the 2.1% annualized rate of increase in GDP growth last quarter. Inventories were depleted in the first half of the year, and COVID-19 pandemic-related shortages are making it difficult to rebuild stocks.

The urgent need to restock is keeping manufacturing humming. There are concerns from some economists that businesses wary of delays getting stock could over-order and end up with excess inventory, which could put the economic expansion in jeopardy.
Sales at wholesalers increased 2.2% in October after rising 1.7% in September. At October's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.22 months to clear shelves, unchanged from September.

Figures from national statistics agency INEGI showed inflation in Latin America's No. 2 economy jumped to 7.37% last month from 6.24% in October. That compared with the consensus forecast of a Reuters poll for 7.22%.
The November figure took inflation to its highest level since January 2001.
The core rate of inflation, which strips out some volatile items, reached 5.67%.
The Bank of Mexico (Banxico) last month raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 5%, the fourth consecutive hike. It also revised up its expectations for Mexican inflation at the close of this year.
Banxico's final monetary policy meeting for the year is due on Dec. 16. The bank targets inflation of 3%, with a one percentage point tolerance range above and below that.

Earlier this week, Irene Espinosa, a member of the central bank's board, said Banxico's monetary policy stance continues to be accommodative and that it should respond forcefully to anchor inflation expectations.
Month-on-month, Mexican consumer prices increased by 1.14% in November, the INEGI data showed. Meanwhile, the core index of prices rose by 0.37% from October.

LONDON (Reuters) -British households ate out less and spent more on goods as the Omicron coronavirus variant spread last week, according to data on Thursday that could mean inflation stays high for longer if it marks a return to behaviour seen earlier in the pandemic.
Bank of England policymakers had been counting on a drop-off in demand for consumer goods - which soared during the pandemic and have been beset by supply-chain difficulties - to pull down rapidly rising inflation, now on course to hit 5%.
But Black Friday sales last week pushed spending on credit and debit cards in Britain to its highest level since before the first lockdown of March 2020, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Over the same period, cafe chain Pret a Manger reported a drop in sales in 8 out of 10 locations, the ONS said.
Restaurant bookings for the week to Monday fell to their lowest since restrictions on indoor hospitality eased in May, dropping by six percentage points to 5% above the equivalent figure in 2019, according to OpenTable data.
The figures pointed to a shift in consumer behaviour with the emergence of the Omicron strain of the virus, which on Wednesday prompted new health restrictions in England.
Last week, Bank of England rate-setter Catherine Mann said the Omicron variant could impede a shift in spending - away from goods and towards services like eating out and tourism - that would help to dampen inflation.
Still, BoE officials are likely to be reassured by a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) survey that showed consumers' long-term inflation expectations fell to their lowest since May.
""Rate-setters may see that as some success from their hawkish words and it may give them room to wait before hiking interest rates,"" economist Robert Wood wrote in a BofA Global Research note.
The report, based on responses given before Wednesday's announcement of renewed COVID-19 restrictions in England, showed a record 45% of Britons expect life ""never"" to return to normal.
The new rules fell short of a lockdown, but angered some retail and leisure businesses which said they were being hammered.

Citi said it expected the new restrictions to reduce economic growth by 0.4 and 0.3 percentage points in December and January respectively.
Financial markets now show a less than 40% chance that the BoE will hike interest rates this month to 0.25% from 0.10% - something that had been priced as a near certainty as recently as a few weeks ago.

Imports also saw an unexpected leap, growing 5% after a slightly revised rise of 0.4% in the prior month. 
Bankhaus Lampe chief economist Alexander Krueger said catch-up effects in the auto sector likely boosted export figures and warned that large leaps would be unlikely due to uncertainty caused by the pandemic and delivery logistics.
""If materials once again flow in sufficient quantities, companies will be able to work off their order backlogs,"" said VP Bank chief economist Thomas Gitzel.
""First, however, we have to get through the drought that lies ahead due to the lack of materials.""

Investing.com – China’s factory inflation slowed down slightly in November from a 26-year high, helped by a government crackdown on runaway commodity prices and an easing power crunch.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 2.3% year-on-year, lower than the 2.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but higher than October’s 1.5% growth. The CPI grew 0.4% month-on-month in November, higher than the 0.3% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but lower than the previous month’s 0.7% growth.
Recent government policies to rein in sharply rising energy and raw materials prices are taking effect, NBS senior statistician Dong Lijuan said in a statement accompanying the data release. These include setting an immediate ex-mine price target and ordering rapid production to cool high prices, which has been effective in easing a power shortage expected this winter.
Factory inflation remained high, however. The producer price index (PPI) grew 12.9% year on year, higher than the 12.4% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but lower than October's 13.5% growth.
While PPI has likely peaked, the rate at which it will slow down is highly uncertain, according to Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) senior EM economist Zhou Hao.
However, consumer inflation remained modest as restrictive COVID-19 measures impeded consumption and demand. Vegetable prices jumped 30.6% while pork prices dropped 32.7%, which sped up consumer inflation.
""Food aside, price pressures are generally easing, especially in heavy industry,"" Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note.
""As such, we don’t think inflation concerns will hold back the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) from further loosening measures including policy rate cuts.""
On Monday, the PBOC said it will reduce most banks’ reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points from next week.
The country’s top leaders also signaled that they would focus on stabilizing macroeconomic conditions for 2022. They also hinted that the country will ease some property curbs in the next year."

The producer price index rose 12.9% in November, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, slower than October's 26-year high of 13.5% but faster than the 12.4% expected in a Reuters poll of analysts.
While factory inflation remains uncomfortably high, the price moderation may give policymakers some latitude to unleash more stimulus to shore up flagging growth.
China's economy, which staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic slump, has lost momentum in recent months as it grapples with surging prices, a slowing manufacturing sector, debt problems in the property market and persistent COVID-19 outbreaks.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Monday announced a cut to the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, its second such move this year, to bolster slowing growth.
""Food aside, price pressures are generally easing, especially in heavy industry,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note. ""As such, we don’t think inflation concerns will hold back the PBOC from further loosening measures including policy rate cuts.""
Factory-gate inflation has sped up since May this year due to soaring commodity prices, piling pressures on downstream businesses to pass on their costs to consumers.
Authorities have rolled out a series of interventions in recent months, including setting an immediate ex-mine price target and ordering rapid production to cool red-hot prices, measures that have proven effective in easing a power shortage expected this winter.
Government policies to rein in sharply rising energy and raw materials prices are taking effect, said Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician at the NBS in a statement accompanying the data release.
Factory inflation remains extremely high, however, with prices in coal mining and washing surging 88.8% on the year and oil and gas extraction seeing 68.5% growth.
While PPI has likely peaked, the rate at which it will slow down is highly uncertain, said Zhou Hao, senior EM economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.3% year-on-year, the NBS said in a separate statement, slower than expectations for a 2.5% rise but picking up from 1.5% in October.
Consumer inflation remains modest as strict COVID-19 curbs impede consumption and weigh on demand, pointing to a limited pass-through from high factory gate prices.
No cases of the Omicron COVID-19 variant have been reported in China to date, but its emergence could add pressure to the strict zero-tolerance policy on coronavirus cases and increase logistical challenges for exporters, analysts say.

The world's second-largest economy faces multiple headwinds heading into 2022 including the downturn of its property sector.
China's top government think tank on Monday recommended authorities set an economic growth target of above 5% for next year and a consumer inflation target of 3%.

The producer price index rose 12.9% from a year earlier, above economists’ forecasts of a 12.1% gain, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Thursday. The consumer price index increased 2.3%, the fastest pace since August 2020 but below the projected 2.5% gain.
The slowdown is a sign that the government’s efforts to tame soaring commodity prices and deal with power shortages over the past few months are having an effect. If the prices pressures continue to abate, it may provide more room for the central bank to add stimulus.
Consumer inflation sped up, as vegetable prices rose 30.6% while pork prices dropped 32.7%. Core CPI, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.2%, as sporadic Covid-19 outbreaks likely continue to weigh on services consumption.

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said permanent placements of workers sped up in November to hit its fifth-fastest pace since its surveys began in 1997, pushing up these workers' pay by a record amount. Temporary hiring also accelerated.
Governor Andrew Bailey and other BoE officials have voiced concern that the shortage of candidates to fill near-record levels of vacancies could fuel a surge in pay that causes the recent jump in inflation to become entrenched.
""The current trajectory is unsustainable in the long run for businesses and the wider economic recovery,"" Claire Warnes, head of education, skills and productivity at KPMG UK, which produces the survey with REC, said.
Better skills training, more labour market flexibility and improved transport links were all important for making sure the labour market continued to function well, she said.
Official measures of broader pay trends have also shown a jump in wages but stripping out distortions caused by the pandemic, growth in earnings could be as low as an annual 3.4%, less than inflation.
The REC survey showed a further fall in candidate supply last month, albeit a less severe one than in October. Demand for staff rose again but at the slowest pace in six months.
Neil Carberry, REC's chief executive, said it was too early to tell the effect of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, which was unknown when the survey took place from Nov. 12-24.

""December may be slower than previous months as its effects feed through,"" he said. ""Hospitality will be in the forefront of any changes as we approach the festive season, of course, and the impact of high inflation will also be felt as purses tighten in January.""
Some BoE officials have said they want to understand the potential economic impact of Omicron before any decision to raise borrowing costs. Financial markets see a reduced chance of a rate hike on Dec. 16, at the end of the central bank's December meetings which begin this week.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The total amount of money circulating in Japan rose at the slowest annual pace in 19 months in November, as firms and households saw less need to hoard cash with the economy emerging from the initial shock caused by the COVID-19 crisis.
The data underscores how Japan's economy is normalising from last year's pandemic crunch, and will likely be among data the Bank of Japan will scrutinise in debating next week whether to phase out pandemic-relief fund schemes.
Japan's M2 money stock, a measure on the total amount of money available in the economy, rose 4.0% in November from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed on Thursday, slowing from a 4.2% gain in October. It was the smallest annual increase since a 3.7% gain in April last year.
The average amount of cash, at 1,175.8 trillion yen ($10.34 trillion), hit a fresh record, as the central bank continued to print money to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic.
""The balance of money stock remains at historical levels with the slowdown largely a reaction to last year's surge. There's no big change in the uptrend (in money stock),"" a BOJ official told a briefing.
The BOJ ramped up purchases of corporate bonds and commercial paper, and introduced a loan scheme aimed at channelling funds to small firms via financial institutions last year to combat a cash crunch caused by the pandemic.

The recent spread of the Omicron new variant complicates the BOJ's decision, expected to be made as early as next week's rate review, on whether to phase out the programmes when they reach their current deadline in March 2022.

LONDON (Reuters) - The number of people in Britain putting their home up for sale fell for an eighth month in a row in November, placing further upward pressure on house prices, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said on Thursday.
RICS said its monthly house price balance held at +71 in November after an upward revision to October's reading, not far from the 33-year high of +82 recorded in June.
""The continuing drought in new listings was a significant factor holding back the market nationwide,"" RICS said.
""Unless this trend is reversed soon, transaction levels may flat-line in 2022 with limited choice proving more significant than any shift in the interest rate environment for new buyers,"" RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn added.
The Bank of England has said it is likely to raise interest rates from a record-low 0.1% in the coming months, although financial markets have dialled back their bets on a move at next week's meeting, due to the new Omicron coronavirus variant.
Britain's housing market surged through most of last year and in 2021, bolstered by more demand for space to work from home during the pandemic, as well as temporary tax breaks for house-buyers which were phased out between July and September.
The most recent official data shows house prices rose 11.8% in the year to September and RICS said surveyors expected house prices to ""drift higher"" over the next 12 months.
""Even if the cost of mortgage finance does begin to edge up, it is likely that house prices will continue to move higher through the coming year, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than over the past 12 months,"" Rubinsohn said.

Rents were forecast to rise by 4% as demand from tenants rose but supply from landlords fell.
BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said on Monday that he expected consumer price inflation to ""comfortably exceed"" 5% by April next year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings surged in October while hiring decreased, suggesting a worsening worker shortage, which could hamper employment growth and the overall economy.
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Wednesday also showed a steady decline in layoffs, another sign that the jobs market was tightening. While the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs fell, it remained quite high.
""Under normal circumstances, a near record number of job openings would be something worth celebrating,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""But no employer is in a celebratory mood. It is difficult to fill orders or meet customer demands if there are not enough people to do the actual work.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 431,000 to 11.0 million on the last day of October. This was the second-highest on record. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 10.4 million vacancies.
The surge was led by the accommodation and food services industry, where vacancies increased by 254,000 jobs. There were 45,000 job openings in the nondurable goods manufacturing industry, while vacancies increased by 42,000 in the educational services sector. But job openings decreased by 115,000 in state and local government, excluding education. 
Regionally, the rise in job openings was more pronounced in the South, with moderate gains in the West and Midwest. Vacancies fell in the Northeast. The job openings rate rose to 6.9% from 6.7% in September.
Hiring dropped by 82,000 jobs to 6.5 million in October. The finance and insurance industry accounted for the decline, with a 96,000 drop in payrolls. There were, however, increases in hiring in educational services as well as state and local government education. The hiring rate was unchanged at 4.4%.
There were about 1.5 job openings per unemployed worker in October.
(Graphic: Unemployed to job openings, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/JOBS/egvbkmeoepq/chart.png) 
The government reported last Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 210,000 jobs in November, the fewest since last December, after rising 546,000 in October. The unemployment rate fell to a 21-month low of 4.2%.
Though employment is 3.9 million jobs below the peak in February 2020, economists believe that number probably is not a true reflection of the labor market's health as the shortfall includes people who have retired.
The JOLTS report showed layoffs fell by 35,000 to 1.361 million. The layoffs rate was unchanged at 0.9% for a third straight month. 
Quits decreased by 205,000 to a still-high 4 million in October. The decline was in several industries, with large drops in transportation, warehousing and utilities as well as finance and insurance, and arts, entertainment and recreation. 
But 21,000 more people quit their jobs in state and local government, excluding education. There were also more quits in mining and logging. The quits rate fell to 2.8% from 3.0% in September amid a large drop in the leisure and hospitality sector.
(Graphic: Americans still quitting their jobs in big numbers, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/byprjqqnxpe/chart.png) 

""The quits rate in those industries dropped by half a percentage point, signaling some easing in job hopping,"" said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""In addition to the slowdown in wage growth in the sector seen in recent jobs reports, this trend suggests maybe the advantageous situation for workers in this sector might deteriorate in the months ahead if the current situation continues.""
The quits rate is normally viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. The still-high quits rate suggests wage inflation will likely remain uncomfortably high for a while. Inflation is way above the Federal Reserve's flexible 2% target.

In a daily briefing, Colas pointed to a ""surprising"" surge in office occupancy in the latest week despite news of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and given that occupancy was expected to remain soft throughout the holiday period.
Colas said urban unemployment was ""a significant issue"" for the labor market during the pandemic.

""More office workers means more demand for ancillary services in large metro areas, and better employment trends as a result,"" he wrote.
November nonfarm payrolls increased by a lower-than-expected 210,000 jobs, the fewest since December 2020.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy shrank slightly faster than initially reported in the third quarter, as a sharp rise in local COVID-19 cases hit private consumption and a global chip supply shortage hurt corporate sentiment.
The deeper contraction is a setback for policymakers hoping easing supply shortages and loosened pandemic curbs would support a recovery in the world's third-largest economy this quarter.
Japan's economy declined an annualised 3.6% in July-September, revised Cabinet Office data showed Wednesday, worse than the preliminary reading of a 3.0% contraction.
The data, which was worse than economists' median forecast for a 3.1% drop, equals a real quarter-on-quarter contraction of 0.9% from the prior quarter, versus a preliminary 0.8% drop.
""This confirms that economic conditions were stagnating in the July-September quarter,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
""Growth turned negative due to the resurgence of the coronavirus.""
The faster decline was mainly due to a larger fall in private consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product, and shrank 1.3% from the previous three months, worse than the initial estimate of a 1.1% drop.
Consumption fell as bad weather kept shoppers at home and a global chip shortage hit sales of cars and electronics due to production snags, a government official said.
""A large contraction in durable goods (spending) indicated that car production cuts had a huge impact,"" said Wakaba Kobayashi, an economist at Daiwa Institute of Research.
Durable goods spending posted its biggest drop since 1994 when comparable data first became available, the official said, slumping 16.3% quarter-on-quarter and pulling down household consumption by 0.7 percentage points.
The data showed public investment dropped 2.0% versus the initial estimate of a 1.5% decline, while capital spending saw a smaller fall, shrinking 2.3% from the prior quarter, compared with a 3.8% preliminary drop.
The net contribution of exports to the GDP change was zero, offset by imports. Meanwhile, domestic demand pulled GDP down by 0.9 percentage point, matching a preliminary contribution.
The GDP downgrade, which took into account a change in the way seasonal adjustments were calculated, comes after data on Tuesday showed household spending fell for a third straight month in October.
However, in a more recent sign that consumption has picked up, a sentiment index of ""economy watchers"", or workers close to consumer and retail trends, rose in November to an eight-year high.
Since the start of the pandemic, Japan's government has sought to support the fragile economy by large-scale fiscal spending. It unveiled a record $490 billion package last month.

Analysts are hopeful spending will pick up due in part due to that spending package, with Daiwa's Kobayashi seeing positive impact from the first quarter of next year.
""We expect the stimulus package to boost Japan's GDP by around 2%, by pushing up private consumption, government spending and public investments,"" she said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector sentiment index rose 0.8 point to 56.3 in November to mark the third straight month of increase, a Cabinet Office survey showed on Wednesday, as COVID-19 cases remained low and face-to-face services saw consumers returning.
The index, which hit the highest level in nearly eight years, is based on a survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff who are called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends.

32,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 11:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory inflation may have peaked and started slowing in November, providing some relief for companies and making room for the central bank to do more to support the economy. 
The producer price index is forecast to have climbed 12.1% in November from a year earlier, slower than the 26-year high of 13.5% in October, according to the median estimate in a survey of economists. Despite the retreat, the projected increase would still be the second fastest in 26 years.
Faster inflation in China in recent months fanned stagflation concerns amid a domestic economic slowdown and worries about persistent global inflation. It also increased the challenge for the People’s Bank of China on how to stimulate growth without adding to inflationary pressures, so slower price rises may make it easier to add stimulus.
The central bank acted to release 1.2 trillion yuan ($189 billion) into the economy, announcing Monday it would reduce most banks’ reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point from next week. While the central bank said this wasn’t the start of an easing cycle, financial markets are showing some expectation of further action.

The Communist Party’s top leaders also indicated earlier this week that their focus for the coming year is stabilizing macroeconomic conditions and signaled an easing of some property curbs next year, as a real estate downturn and sporadic virus outbreaks weigh on the economic outlook.
A milder pace in price hikes show previous government measures to boost commodity supplies and tame surging costs are having some effect. Iron ore prices continued dropping in November, although they have started to climb again this month. An easing power crunch also helped to lift caps on factory output which had boosted prices.
The falling inflation trend can also be seen in the price sub-indexes of China’s manufacturing purchasing managers index. Input prices for manufacturing dropped sharply in November to 52.9 from 72.1, while output prices plunged to 48.9 from 61.1. 
Consumer inflation is forecast to have risen faster, quickening to 2.5% from 1.5% in October and potentially hitting the highest level since mid-2020. The pickup has been driven by more expensive food, with vegetable and fruit prices continuing to rise rapidly while pork has started to become pricier.

Even so, a deflationary drag from pork prices will likely continue for a while due to the low base for comparison from last year. The rise in core CPI is still muted, as it excludes more volatile food and energy prices, and sporadic Covid-19 outbreaks likely continue to weigh on services consumption. 
The National Bureau of Statistics is scheduled to release the November inflation data at 9:30 a.m. Thursday Beijing time.

LONDON (Reuters) - The United States became Britain's biggest export market for financial services in the run up to Brexit, overtaking the European Union where sales shrank in 2020, TheCityUK lobby group said on Wednesday.
Britain's financial sector was largely cut off from the EU - previously its single biggest customer - when Britain fully left the bloc's orbit last December.
For 2020, total financial services exports remained little changed at 82.4 billion pounds ($109.07 billion). Exports to the EU fell 6.6% to 24.7 billion pounds, but rose 4.1% to 57.7 billion pounds to non-EU countries.
Exports to the United States rose 5.3%, said TheCityUK, which promotes Britain's financial sector overseas.
Britain's financial services trade surplus of $80.6 billion remains the largest in the world, nearly the same as the next two leading countries, the United States and Singapore, combined at $91.7 billion.
The EU, meanwhile, is building up its autonomy in finance, making it unlikely that Britain will regain unfettered access to the continent's investors and financial markets.
""The UK’s status as a world leading financial centre is at risk unless industry, government and regulators work together to boost long term competitiveness, deepen key trade links, and focus on new areas of future global growth,"" said Anjalika Bardalai, TheCityUK's chief economist and head of research.

Britain is now revising its financial rules to maintain London's attractiveness as a global financial centre to keep up with leader New York, and fend off competition from EU cities like Amsterdam as well as Asian centres.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed sharply in October as exports soared to a record high, potentially setting up trade to contribute to economic growth this quarter for the first time in more than a year.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday, which also showed imports rising to an all-time high, added to a tightening labor market, strong consumer spending as well as services and manufacturing activity that have suggested an acceleration in growth was underway as the year winds down.
""The trade deficit is narrowing big time and pouring even more fuel into the economy's tank which guarantees stronger growth as 2021 comes to an end,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""The brightening trade picture is additional evidence that the economy is very strong."" 
The trade gap plunged 17.6% to a six-month low of $67.1 billion. That was the biggest percentage drop since April 2015, reflecting an increase in the flow of goods and services following disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a $66.8 billion deficit. Exports accelerated 8.1% to an all-time high of $223.6 billion. The surge was led by goods exports, which soared 11.1% to $158.7 billion, also a record high. 
Exports of industrial supplies and materials increased $6.4 billion, with shipments of crude oil advancing $1.2 billion. 
Petroleum exports were the highest on record.
Capital goods exports increased $3.1 billion, boosted by other industrial machines as well as civilian aircraft. Food exports rose by $2.1 billion, with soybeans increasing $1.8 billion. Exports of consumer goods jumped $1.6 billion, lifted by increases in shipments of gem diamonds as well as motor vehicles, parts and engines. 
The nation exported more services, which rose $1.0 billion to $64.9 billion. That reflected a rise in overseas travel, other business services and charges for the use of intellectual property. Further gains are likely after the United States reopened its borders to international travelers in early November after a 20-month ban. 
The Omicron variant of the coronavirus could, however, temporarily slow international travel following recent restrictions on travelers from southern African countries.
""While international travel activity could be dampened again later in the month with the emergence of the Omicron variant, we expect a continued normalization of travel through 2022,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
U.S. financial markets were unmoved by the data.
STRONG IMPORT 
The surge in exports eclipsed a 0.9% increase in imports to $290.7 billion, also a record high. Goods imports climbed 0.7% to an all-time high of $242.7 billion. The rise was led by motor vehicles, parts and engines, which increased $1.5 billion. There were also gains in imports of consumer goods, including cell phones and other household goods.
Imports of industrial supplies and materials fell as did imports of capital goods, pulled down by declines in semiconductors and civilian aircraft. There is a global chip shortage.
Adjusted for inflation, the goods deficit decreased $13.5 billion to $97.6 billion in October. That was the smallest so-called real goods deficit since last December. If the real goods trade deficit continues to shrink, trade could contribute to gross domestic product this quarter. The trade gap has been a drag on GDP growth for five straight quarters.
""Early in the fourth quarter it looks like net exports are on track to add to GDP growth although the recent volatility in the monthly figures makes it hard to detect any underlying trend,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We continue to see upside risk to our 7.0% real GDP growth forecast for the fourth quarter."" 
Fourth-quarter GDP growth estimates are as high as an 8.6% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter. It is regaining speed after being restrained by shortages and a flare-up of COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant. Shortages because of snarled supply chains caused by the coronavirus are fanning price pressures.
There are signs inflation could remain well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target for a while, also as companies competing for workers raise wages.
A separate report from the Labor Department on Tuesday showed unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, surged more than initially thought in the third quarter. Labor costs accelerated at a 9.6% annualized rate last quarter, revised up from the 8.3% pace reported in November. 
Unit labor costs increased at a 6.3% rate compared to a year ago, the largest gain since 1982.

""Unit wage cost pressures are strong in the face of a tight labor market,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
The unemployment rate is at a 21-month low of 4.2%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business confidence index rose to a four-month high in December as supply constraints began to ease, the Reuters Tankan showed on Wednesday, offering policymakers some hope the economy was headed for a moderate recovery.
Sentiment among non-manufacturers also improved in December, suggesting consumption was gradually recovering after the lifting of social curbs by end-September to contain the spread of coronavirus cases.
The survey's findings bode well for the government's efforts to pull Japan out of its pandemic-induced slump including with a record $490 billion stimulus package.
But the poll, conducted between Nov. 24 and Dec. 3, likely did not take into account any impact from the recent spread of the new Omicron variant.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched Tankan quarterly survey next due on Dec. 13, showed the manufacturers' sentiment index improved to 22 in December, following three straight months of declines to 13 in November. That compared with a reading of 18 in the BOJ's latest October survey.
""In terms of the fallout from the pandemic, we may have passed the worst,"" said a precision machinery company manager.
The index gauging non-manufacturers' sentiment rose to 6 in December from 1 in November, marking the highest level since February 2020 when the pandemic initially struck Japan.
On outlook, both manufacturers and services companies were more optimistic, with the three-month forward index among manufacturers rising to 26 from 19 and for services companies to 21 from 15. 
While non-manufacturers' sentiment improved, some sectors continued to suffer from the pandemic's scars such as those offering face-to-face services including retail and travel.
""Travel and leisure demands haven't been restored, although (consumers') cautious mood is easing,"" a service company manager said.

The Reuters Tankan poll heightens the chance the BOJ's Tankan survey for December will show a further improvement in business conditions.
The central bank is expected to keep monetary policy steady at its Dec. 16-17 meeting, where the fate of its pandemic-relief programmes will also be discussed.

With France now in its fifth wave of COVID-19 outbreaks, the outlook was marginally less optimistic than last month when the Bank of France forecast 0.75% growth from the third quarter.
Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Monday night clubs would be closed ahead of Christmas and social distancing measures tightened, but ruled out a new lockdown because nearly 90% of eligible people have been vaccinated.
Drawing on the findings of its monthly survey of 8,500 firms, the central bank said companies expected improved business conditions in the industrial and services sectors, while activity was seen stable in construction.
Led by the dominant service sector, staffing difficulties worsened slightly with 51% of all firms reporting trouble getting enough workers in the survey conducted Nov. 26-Dec. 3 after 49% in October.

Meanwhile, supply chain problems also got worse in the industrial sector, rising to 57% from 56% in October with the car industry worst hit. However, supply problems in construction eased to 56% from 58%.
Against that backdrop, the central bank estimated the economy was operating at 0.75% above pre-crisis levels of activity this month.

Labor costs rose at a 5.9% pace in the April-June quarter. They increased at a 6.3% rate compared to a year ago, instead of the previously reported 4.8% rate.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast unit labor costs would rise at an unrevised 8.3% pace.
Pandemic-related shortages amid snarled supply chains have boosted inflation well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Wages are also rising as companies scramble for workers.
Hourly compensation increased at a 3.9% rate in the third quarter, rather than at a 2.9% rate as previously reported. 

The surge in labor costs came at the expense of worker productivity, which fell at a downwardly revised 5.2% rate last quarter. Productivity was previously reported to have tumbled at a 5.0% pace. It grew at a 2.4% pace in the April-June quarter.
Compared to the third quarter of 2020, productivity fell at a 0.6% rate. It was previously reported to have declined at a 0.5% rate. Hours worked increased at a 7.4% rate last quarter, revised up from the previously estimated 7.0 pace.

House prices rose 3.4% in the three months to the end of November, the sharpest increase since late 2006, and are 8.2% higher than a year earlier, according to the monthly figures from the lender, part of Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY).
""The performance of the market continues to be underpinned by a shortage of available properties, a strong labour market and keen competition amongst mortgage providers keeping rates close to historic lows,"" Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax, said.
The Bank of England plans to start raising interest rates in the coming months from their record low 0.1%, although the emergence of the Omicron variant of coronavirus means markets are split over whether this will happen at next week's policy meeting.
Halifax said house prices rose 1.0% in November alone, the same increase as in October.
British house prices have risen strongly through most of the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with many other big economies, reflecting an increased demand for space to work from home and - in Britain's case - temporary tax incentives to move house.
The most recent official data showed house prices in September, the last month when the tax break applied, were 11.8% higher than a year before, just off a 15-year peak of 12.6% in June when the tax incentive started to be phased out in England. 

But Halifax said there were signs that the shift in demand towards larger, less central housing was reversing, as prices for apartments rose faster than those for detached houses.
""We would not expect the current level of house price growth to be sustained next year given that house price to income ratios are already historically high, and household budgets are only likely to come under greater pressure in the coming months,"" Galley said.

""The German economy is suffering noticeably from the latest developments in the COVID-19 pandemic,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement, adding that persistent supply bottlenecks were weighing on production and retail trade.

""The decline in economic expectations shows that hopes for much stronger growth in the next six months are fading,"" Wambach said, adding that earnings expectations had soured particularly among export-oriented and consumer-related industries.
Recent economic data has painted a mixed picture of the German economy at the start of the final quarter of 2021.

While weaker demand from abroad drove a much bigger than expected drop in industrial orders in October, factory output rose more than expected in the same month due to higher production in the car industry.

Exports last month were the highest monthly figure on record, rising 30.2% from a year earlier to $41.58 billion, the Ministry of Finance said on Tuesday.
A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast a rise of 23.05% for November, compared with a 24.6% increase in October.
The ministry attributed the growth to strong demand for tech products in the festive season in which vendors traditionally launch new models such as smartphones.
The growth was also supported by robust demand for chips, a shortage of which has crippled car plants globally and is affecting consumer electronics.
Exports of telecommunication and electronics products rose 19.5% in November to reach $5.69 billion, with semiconductor exports growing 26.7% from a year earlier.
Firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other global tech giants, as well as providers of chips for auto companies and lower-end consumer electronics.
The ministry warned of risks ahead, including uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as supply chain bottlenecks.
But it said the strong growth should continue, with the holiday period, traditionally a busy time for Taiwan's tech firms, helping exports, along with a steady improvement in global economic fundamentals.
Ministry official Beatrice Tsai expected exports in the fourth quarter to hit a record high.
November exports to China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, grew an annual 18.9% to $17.14 billion, while exports to the United States jumped 39.2%.
Imports leapt 33.8%, above economists' expectations for a 25.45% rise and an increase of 37.2% in October.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's household spending posted an annual drop for the third straight month in October, though the pace of decline slowed, as consumer sentiment struggled to stage a convincing recovery after coronavirus curbs ended.
The world's third-largest economy has lagged other nations in its recovery from the health crisis, mostly due to sluggish consumption. Analysts expect consumer sentiment to pick up this quarter as local COVID-19 infections fell.
Household spending fell 0.6% in October from a year earlier, after a 1.9% decline in September and a 3.0% drop in August, government data showed, matching the median market forecast in a Reuters poll.
The figures highlighted that consumers' mood was still cautious even after state of emergency curbs to contain the virus ended in September, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""This was a weak result,"" he said. ""It feels like spending is slowly picking up but not in one go.""
The month-on-month figures were positive, posting a seasonally adjusted 3.4% rise, slightly weaker than a forecast of a 3.6% gain and slowing from a 5.0% month-on-month increase in September.
On a year-on-year basis, spending on overnight stays and eating out continued to decline, though the drop was smaller than in the prior month, while that on transportation rose.
Policymakers are hoping a rebound in domestic demand will support the economy as manufacturers navigate a global chip shortage and are hit by surging raw material prices.
The Japanese government unveiled a $490 billion spending package last month as it seeks to put its economy firmly on a recovery track, going against a global trend of unwinding crisis-mode stimulus.
Spending will likely benefit from the government's plan to restart a domestic tourism campaign, which could push up the gross domestic product by about 1% next year, said Minami.
If the campaign would be restarted early next year, it would most likely boost second-quarter spending, Minami said, adding that growth was quite good in the fourth quarter last year when the government was also subsidising domestic travel.
But the economy was not expected to see any major boost from cash handouts for households with children, he added, as the money was likely to be added to savings.

Separate data on Tuesday showed the coincident indicator index, which consists of a range of data such as factory output, employment and retail sales, rose for the first time in four months in October.
Japan's inflation-adjusted real wages slumped 0.7% year-on-year in October, falling for the second straight month and boding ill for a sustainable recovery of consumer sentiment.

Exports rose 22% year-on-year in November, customs data showed on Tuesday, slower than the 27.1% jump in the previous month but faster than the 19.0% expected in a Reuters poll.
Imports climbed 31.7%, beating the 19.8% rise in October and well above the forecast 20.6% gain.
China's coal imports in November hit their highest level in 2021, as the world's biggest consumer of the dirty fuel scrambled during the onset of winter to feed its power system, which had been experiencing shortages.
The easing of the power crunch also helped increase demand for copper. Imports of the key industrial metal hit their highest levels since March.
""Coal imports in particular soared. I think this reflects the policy change in China to solve the energy shortage problem, which constrained growth in Q3,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. ""I don't think there is a significant improvement of domestic demand yet.""
China's trade surplus was $71.72 billion last month, narrower than the poll's forecast for $82.75 billion and the $84.54 billion surplus in October. 
The data comes a day after China's central bank announced a cut to the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, its second such move this year, to bolster slowing economic growth.
The country has staged an impressive rebound from the pandemic but there are signs momentum is flagging. Power shortages, regulatory crackdowns on major industries and debt troubles in the property sector are weighing on China's recovery.
Analysts expect more supportive policy measures in the coming months.
A private sector survey showed factory activity fell in November, hit by higher prices and subdued demand although the government's official survey showed activity grew in the month.
China's factory-gate inflation hit a 26-year high in October as coal prices soared during the power crunch.
No cases of the Omicron COVID-19 variant have been reported in China to date, but its emergence could add pressure to the strict zero-tolerance policy on coronavirus cases and increase logistical challenges for exporters, analysts say.
But Omicron could also support China's exporters in the near-term by keeping consumers abroad buying goods, rather than services, amid increased social distancing, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note.

""That said, the scope for a further rise in outbound shipments is limited – container throughput has levelled off in the past 12 months as ports have been operating close to capacity,"" he added.
China reported 94 new confirmed coronavirus cases for Dec. 6, with locally transmitted infections in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Yunnan and Zhejiang.

The data comes a day after the People’s Bank of China said it would reduce most banks’ reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points next week. The central bank’s second such move in 2021 will release CNY1.2 trillion ($188.16 billion) of liquidity.
China has staged an impressive economic recovery from COVID-19, but power shortages, regulatory crackdowns, and the property sector’s debt woes remain roadblocks.
China could issue more policy measures to support the recovery in the months ahead, with Premier Li Keqiang saying on Monday that China has room for a variety of monetary policy tools.
On the COVID-19 front, China has to date not recorded any cases of the omicron variant. However, if it emerges, it could add pressure to China’s zero-tolerance policy towards the virus and increase logistical pressures for exporters, according to analysts.
The data also showed a trade balance of $71.72 billion in November, with forecasts prepared by Investing.com’s predicting an $82.75 billion balance, and an $84.54 billion balance recorded in October."

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), inched up to 55.9 in November from 55.7 in October, which was its highest since June 2019 - boosted by Dubai hosting the Expo world fair.
The continued improvement in business conditions is a marked turn from last year, when the UAE's PMI recorded just four months of expansion as the pandemic pummelled tourism, aviation and other key sectors of the economy.
""The upturn was supported by marked expansions in output and new business volumes midway through the fourth quarter,"" IHS said in the PMI report. 
""The indices for both measures ticked up to their highest levels since mid-2019, as firms highlighted a strong increase in demand as the country reopened to tourism and benefited from the Expo 2020. Export sales also increased, albeit at a much softer pace than total new business.""
The output sub-index rose to 61.6 in November from 61.1 in October. New orders also quickened their pace of growth.
Despite that, the employment sub-index was mostly flat and sentiment for future output dipped.

""Whilst higher than seen throughout much of the pandemic, business confidence was still subdued compared to the historical average in November, as firms indicated that high competition had clouded their sales forecasts. Output prices were subsequently lowered for the fourth month running, while there was little change in staff levels despite growing capacity pressures,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
""The stagnation of hiring activity suggested that businesses are delaying staff decisions until they know the full extent of the economic recovery following the expo. That said, further rises in demand and backlogs could support an increase in employment sooner rather than later.""

The world's top buyer of soybeans brought in 8.57 million tonnes in November, up 68% from October's figure of 5.11 million, data from the General Administration of Customs showed. 
Hurricane Ida limited U.S. grains exports in September, including soybeans, by crippling terminals and delaying shipments.
U.S. shipments picked up later as the hurricane impact eased and the market entered the peak export season. 
For the whole marketing year, however, China's U.S. soybean imports were expected to fall from the previous year, as the hurricane delays clipped the export window for American beans, which also faced strong competition from an early Brazilian harvest. 
China's November soybean imports were also down from 9.59 million tonnes in the corresponding month a year earlier, when a large volume of U.S. cargoes arrived following a trade deal.
China brought in 87.65 million tonnes of soybeans in the first 11 months of the year, down 5.5% from the corresponding period the previous year, the data showed.
Soybean shipments in 2021 were seen to slow from the previous year, as low crush margins curbed demand.
China's soybean crush margins increased from June's record lows to more than 200 yuan a tonne in October, before retreating.
Hog margins in the southwestern province of Sichuan, a top producer of pigs, are 250 yuan a head, up sharply from early October, when farmers faced a loss of 400 yuan on each animal.

But pig prices are expected to fall in the new year if production is not cut substantially, the farm ministry said.
China also brought in 673,000 tonnes of vegetable oils in November. Imports in the first 11 months of the year were 9.573 million tonnes, up 1.6% on the year, the data showed.

48,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 10:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s exports grew faster than expected in November to hit a record, as external demand surged ahead of the year-end holidays and domestic production rebounded on an easing power crunch. 
Exports rose 22% in dollar terms from a year earlier to almost $326 billion, while imports grew 31.7%, leaving a trade surplus of $71.2 billion for the month, the customs administration said Tuesday. Economists had forecast exports to grow by 20.3% and imports to increase by 21.5%. 
The data show the continuing strength of global demand for Chinese goods, which has been strong throughout the pandemic. If the spread of the new omicron virus variant proves to be serious and other nations start to lock down again, that will likely provide support for China’s exports, especially personal protective gear and work from home devices.
Exports usually peak at the end of the year, buoyed by the Christmas shopping season, although a higher base for comparison last year might drive the headline growth rate lower. 
China’s economy has come under increasing pressure from a deepening housing market slump, which may continue to be a drag on growth over the next year. Policy makers moved to expand support for the nation’s economy Monday, with the central bank announcing a cut to most banks’ reserve requirement ratio which will release 1.2 trillion yuan ($188 billion) of liquidity.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer spending picked up in November, boosted by earlier-than-usual Christmas shopping and a recovery in spending at pubs and restaurants before news of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, industry surveys showed on Tuesday.
The British Retail Consortium, a trade body representing major high-street retailers, said total sales in November were 5.0% higher than a year earlier, the biggest annual increase since July and up from an increase of 1.3% in October.
Separate credit and debit card data from payments provider Barclaycard showed consumer spending - which includes things such as eating out and travel, as well as shopping - was 16.0% higher than in November 2019, before the pandemic.
Consumer demand has been fairly resilient in Britain through the pandemic, as household incomes were supported by government measures. But there have been big shifts within sectors - with a large chunk of retail spending moving online, and only partly reversing when shops reopened. 
Travel remains depressed, with spending on plane tickets 22.1% below its level two years ago. Restaurant spending was 4.3% down compared with November 2019, compared with an 8.3% shortfall in October, Barclaycard data showed.
Overall non-essential spending grew at its fastest rate since the start of the pandemic, up 17.7% from two years before.
However, economists forecast that households' disposable income will become increasingly squeezed in coming months as inflation picks up further and payroll taxes rise from April, complicating the task of the Bank of England which is due to consider whether to raise interest rates next week.
BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said November's boost in spending partly reflected Black Friday sales promotions beginning earlier in the month than previous years.
""As people prepared their wardrobes for the cold weather this winter, consumers took advantage of discounted clothing, shifting the focus of Black Friday from just electronics and household appliances,"" she said.
Like-for-like sales, a measure which adjusts for changes in retailers' floor space, were 1.8% higher than a year before, compared with a 0.2% drop in October.

Four in 10 consumers surveyed said that they were doing their Christmas shopping earlier than before, Barclaycard said.
""The arrival of Christmas markets and lights across the UK brought some festive cheer to the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors in November, while the return of darker nights and colder evenings saw Brits spend more on at-home pursuits,"" Barclaycard executive Jose Carvalho said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican automotive production and exports fell for the fifth month running in November, figures from the national statistics agency (INEGI) showed on Monday, as ongoing shortages of semiconductors put the brakes on the industry.
Mexican automotive production plunged by 20.25% from November 2020 to 248,960 vehicles, while auto exports declined by 16.46% to 240,341 units, the INEGI data showed.
A global semiconductor shortage https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/mexicos-auto-heartland-workers-struggle-chip-shortage-bites-2021-11-24 has prompted automakers in Mexico and the rest of North America to implement rolling shutdowns, curtailing production and hitting workers hard.
""The stoppages are due to the shortage of semiconductors, and yes, production decreased due to the shortage,"" a spokesperson for the Mexico operations of Detroit-based General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said in response to a query about falling output.
INEGI data showed that GM Mexico's production fell 43.7% in November from a year earlier, to 40,534 units.
Nissan (OTC:NSANY)'s Mexico unit told Reuters the shortage was also impacting production, after INEGI data showed its output plummeted 27.2% in November to 41,525 vehicles.
Mexican auto parts industry group INA said the global semiconductor shortage could be further complicated in 2022 as fifth-generation (5G) technologies are adopted.
""We estimate the impact due to semiconductor shortage will last at least until the first quarter of next year. But this is coupled with a very important issue, which is the switch from 4G networks to 5G,"" INA interim chief Alberto Bustamante said.
Bustamante estimated the impact due to the chip shortage could begin normalizing as of the second quarter of 2022.
Mexico's auto production fell by 20% to 3.04 million vehicles last year during the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic, and the Mexican Automotive Industry Association (AMIA) has forecast that it could drop by up to 5% more in 2021.

AMIA chief Fausto Cuevas forecast that Mexico's auto production would return to pre-pandemic levels by late 2023 or in 2024.
In the first 11 months of 2021, Mexican automotive production fell by 0.68% from the same period last year to 2,767,004 vehicles, while auto exports over the same period increased by 3.02% to 2,479,515 units, INEGI figures show.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Investor morale in the euro zone in December fell to its lowest level since April as renewed restrictions to contain a fourth wave of coronavirus infections clouded the growth outlook, a survey showed on Monday.
Sentix's index for the euro zone fell to 13.5 from 18.3 the previous month. Analysts on average had expected a December reading of 15.9, according to a Reuters poll.
Tightened lockdown measures, especially in Germany and Austria, considerably dampened the assessment of current conditions in the euro zone, said Sentix Managing Director Manfred Huebner.
""A slowdown and even a recession no longer seem to be ruled out now. These lockdowns hit the economy harder than before,"" Huebner said.
A current conditions index fell for the third month in a row to 13.3 from 23.5 in November, dropping to its lowest since May. Still, an expectations index rose to 13.8 from 13.3 in the previous month.
Sentix surveyed 1,164 investors on Dec. 2-4.
The Sentix survey followed economic data from Germany, Europe's largest economy, where weaker demand from abroad drove a much bigger-than-expected drop in industrial orders due to lockdowns in Asia and supply chain problems at home.
A Sentix sub-index for investor morale in Germany fell for the fifth month in a row to reach its lowest level since March.
""The tightening of the coronavirus measures and, in particular, the exclusion of customers from the retail sector through the so-called 2G measures put a considerable strain on the situation in Germany,"" Huebner said.

Household spending was already the sole driver of growth in Germany in the third quarter as factories struggled with a pandemic-related scarcity of microchips and other electronic components.
The jump in coronavirus infections and the renewed curbs are now threatening to knock away Germany's last pillar of growth, setting its economy on track for stagnation at best in the final quarter of this year.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Weaker demand from abroad drove a much bigger than expected drop in German industrial orders, including cars, in October, data showed on Monday, further clouding the growth outlook for manufacturers in Europe's largest economy.
A pandemic-related scarcity of microchips and other electronic components has caused massive supply bottlenecks and production problems in Germany's mighty automobile industry and other important sectors of the economy.
Orders for goods 'Made in Germany' dropped 6.9% on the month in seasonally adjusted terms after a revised rise of 1.8% in September and a plunge of 8.8% in August, figures from the Federal Statistics Office showed.
A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a smaller decline of 0.5% on the month in October.
""After incoming orders climbed to an all-time high in mid-2021, the index has lost more than 16 points in recent months,"" the economy ministry said, adding that the second sharp decline within three months put a further damper on the economic outlook.
Excluding distorting factors from bookings for big ticket items such as planes, industrial orders were still down 1.8%, the data showed.
The drop was driven by a decline in foreign orders of more than 13% on the month, with demand from countries outside the euro zone such as China particularly weak. Orders from domestic clients rose 3.4%.
""New lockdowns in Asia are slowing industry in Germany,"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said. He added that the current wave of coronavirus infections across the globe was putting a renewed burden on the world economy.
Gitzel said that domestic demand should remain strong, helped by the new ruling coalition's commitment to massive investment in the green economy.

""The decarbonization of the economy requires major investments in new technologies. German industry can and will benefit from this,"" Gitzel said.
The weak orders data suggest that manufacturing will hamper overall economic growth in the coming months, with analysts expecting stagnation at best in the final quarter of this year.

The monthly purchasing managers' data also showed an easing in inflation pressures to their lowest since April - although they are still high in outright terms.
The survey largely predates the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, and the signs of an easing in inflation may encourage the Bank of England to wait rather than raise interest rates this month, as had been widely expected. 
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 55.5 last month from 54.6 in October, and IHS Markit said the worst of supply chain shortages appeared to have passed for the sector. 
Just under half of construction companies reported longer delivery times, compared with more than three quarters in June.
""Port delays and a severe lack of transport availability due to haulage driver shortages continued to hold back supplier performance, although firms noted an improvement in the availability of specific items, especially timber,"" IHS Markit said.
Some 72% of firms reported increased costs for building supplies - compared with just 3% who saw a fall - but this still represented the lowest inflation pressure since April.
The all-sector PMI - a combined reading of November's manufacturing, services and construction surveys - edged down to 57.4 from October's 57.5, which was the highest since July.

Construction order growth was the strongest in three months, but economists warned that 2022 might still prove tough. A moratorium on commercial property evictions is due to end - reducing the demand for new space - and a likely rise in interest rates and lower disposable income hurt housing demand.
""Despite the 8% increase in public sector gross investment in the upcoming 2022/23 fiscal year, which will boost the pipeline of civil engineering work, overall construction output looks set to rise slowly,"" said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said 115,706 new cars were registered in November, up from 113,781 in October but 31% below their average in the five years running up to the pandemic.
Some 1.54 million new cars have been registered so far this year, compared with 1.50 million in the same period of 2020. 
""What looks like a positive performance belies the underlying weakness of the market. Demand is there, with a slew of new, increasingly electrified, models launched but the global shortage of semiconductors continues to bedevil production,"" said Mike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive.
Chip shortages were likely to continue into next year, he added.

Battery-powered electric cars accounted for 19% of the market - twice as much as a year earlier, while plug-in hybrid electric vehicles made up 9%. 
The SMMT called on the government to speed up its charging infrastructure rollout, saying there was one charger currently installed for every 52 new plug-in cars.

Monday's figures from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd showed total job ads climbed 7.4% in November from October, when they had already gained 7.5%.
That left adds 52% higher than a year earlier at 222,093, and a lofty 44% up on pre-pandemic levels.
ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch said the report indicated a sharp rebound was likely in official employment figures following a surprise 46,300 drop in October and a rise in the jobless rate to 5.2%.
""Job ads suggest the unemployment rate should drop back below 5% in the near term, and we expect it to fall to around 4% by the end of 2022 and even further in 2023,"" said Birch. ""Underemployment is also likely to be much lower.""

The Reserve Bank of Australia is seeking to drive unemployment down to 4% or even lower in the hope of finally lifting wage growth after years of tepid gains.
The central bank holds its December policy meeting on Tuesday and is widely considered certain to keep its policy interest rate at a record low of 0.1% and to reiterate the outlook for no hikes until at least 2023.

56,"<span>Dec 05, 2021 07:20PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy looks set to grow more slowly than previously thought this year and in 2023 due to global supply chain problems and the government must encourage longer-term business investment, an employers group said on Monday.
The Confederation of British Industry cut its forecasts for economic growth to 6.9% in 2021 and 5.1% in 2022 from previous estimates of 8.2% and 6.1%.
It said the downgrade mostly reflected weaker growth since its last forecasts in June and the supply chain problems that have slowed the recovery from last year's coronavirus slump were likely to end in mid-2022.
With exports still weak, household spending would drive 90% of growth next year and two-thirds of it in 2023 thanks to a strong jobs market and savings racked up during the pandemic.
Business investment looked set to grow by 8.2% next year and go above its pre-pandemic level but the bounce would probably prove short-lived with corporate investment falling back in mid-2023 when a tax incentive is due to expire.
""One policy in place for 18 months can't change under-investment over four decades,"" Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, said. 
The CBI called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to introduce regulations to spur investment and innovation to help build new markets in clean energy and other sectors.

The new forecasts from the group saw inflation peaking at 5.2% in April and remaining above the Bank of England's 2% target for around another year while unemployment would fall to 3.8% by the end of 2023. 
The CBI's forecasts were made before the emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus which has led to tighter COVID rules. Rain-Smith said she was hopeful that Britain's high levels of vaccinations would minimise the growth hit.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 48.7 - below the 50.0 threshold that separates growth from contraction - unchanged from October.
""A sharp rise in business costs continued to drive higher selling prices and lower demand across the Egyptian non-oil economy during November,"" IHS Markit said. 
The input cost inflation sub-index, at 63.7, was at its second-fastest in over three years, beaten only by October's 64.5. 
""A loss of client demand and slowdowns due to global supply chain issues were often behind the downturn,"" it said. ""Companies noted that higher selling prices often deterred customer spending in the domestic market."" 
The sub-index for future output expectations slipped to 60.6, its lowest level in a year, from 65.0 in October, with higher inflation expectations weighing on sentiment.

The output sub-index climbed to 47.7 from 47.5 in October, while the new orders sub-index inched down to 48.6 from 48.7.
""Higher fuel and shipping costs often led to increased prices, including for raw items such as foodstuff and paper,"" IHS Markit said, adding that companies also raised wages in response to an uptick in living expenses.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 56.9 in November from 57.7 in October, remaining above the 50.0 mark that separates growth from contraction for the 15th consecutive month.
The headline figure was down to a three-month low as growth in new orders declined for the second month in a row from September's seven-year high.
New export orders, however, accelerated in November at their fastest pace since May, pointing to higher demand from abroad due to the easing of pandemic-related restrictions.
""The Saudi Arabia PMI continued to signal a strong end to the year for the non-oil economy"", said David Owen, economist at IHS Markit.
""Despite slipping to a three-month low, new business growth was rapid overall, whilst activity expanded at one of the quickest rates since the start of the pandemic"", he said.
Surveyed businesses linked higher sales to a return to normal economic conditions after the COVID-19 pandemic and to higher tourism.
The sustained growth in output led firms to hire slightly more than in October, although the overall employment rate remained subdued as many remained cautious over sales forecasts.

""Jobs growth remained disappointingly mild, with many firms choosing not to expand their workforces amid a weak level of optimism for future activity"", said Owen.
""The threat of future COVID-19 waves continued to promote a cautious outlook, leading to a decline in the number of firms expecting output to expand over the next year,"" he added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment growth slowed considerably in November amid job losses at retailers and in local government education, but the unemployment rate plunged to a 21-month low of 4.2%, suggesting the labor market was rapidly tightening.
The four-tenths-of-a-percentage-point drop in the jobless rate from October reported by the Labor Department in its closely watched employment report on Friday occurred even as 594,000 people entered the labor force, the most in 13 months. Workers put in more hours, boosting aggregate wages, which should help to underpin consumer spending.
""Don't be fooled by the measly payroll jobs gain this month because the economy's engines are actually in overdrive as shown by the plunge in joblessness,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
The survey of businesses showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 210,000 jobs last month, the fewest since last December. But the economy created 82,000 more jobs than initially reported in September and October, a sign of strength. That left employment 3.9 million jobs below the peak in February 2020.

Despite November's slowdown in hiring, which also reflected a small gain in the leisure and hospitality industry, 6.1 million jobs have been added this year. Economists say the economy is very close to maximum employment, putting an early interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve on the table.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that the U.S. central bank should consider speeding up the winding down of its massive bond purchases at its Dec. 14-15 policy meeting.
""The Fed will see the report as more than adequate to stay on course to accelerate tapering of asset purchases at the December meeting implying an end to purchases in March,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""Moreover, an unemployment rate that is poised to fall below 4.0% perhaps in the coming months keeps a first Fed rate hike in June or even earlier firmly on the table."" Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that payrolls would advance by 550,000 jobs. Hiring continues to be hampered by worker shortages. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of September.
U.S. stocks were trading sharply lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
TIGHT LABOR SUPPLY
Employment growth was held back by a decline of 20,400 jobs in the retail sector. State and local government education employment fell by 12,600 jobs. That led to a drop of 25,000 in overall government jobs, the fourth straight monthly decrease.
Pandemic-related staffing fluctuations have distorted normal seasonal patterns in state and local government education. There have also been shortages of bus drivers and other support staff.
The leisure and hospitality sector added only 23,000 jobs compared to 170,000 in the previous month. Professional and business services payrolls increased by 90,000 jobs.
There were also solid gains in transportation and warehousing as well as in construction. Manufacturing employment increased by 31,000 jobs.
November's modest job growth did little to temper expectations that the economy was poised for stronger growth this quarter after hitting a speed bump in the third quarter.
A measure of services sector activity scaled a fresh record high in November.
Consumer spending and manufacturing activity have been strong. Spending should remain supported by rising wages as companies scramble for scarce workers. Average hourly earnings increased 0.3%, keeping the annual increase in wages at 4.8%. The average workweek climbed to 34.8 hours from 34.7. As a result of the longer workweek, aggregate wages rose 0.7%.
But the spread of the new, highly contagious Omicron variant of COVID-19 poses a risk to the brightening picture. While little is known about the impact of Omicron, some slowdown in hiring and demand for services is likely, based on the experience with the Delta variant, which was responsible for the slowest economic growth pace in more than a year last quarter.
While labor supply remains tight, there are signs that some of the millions of Americans who lost their jobs during the pandemic-induced recession are wading back into the labor force.
The smaller survey of households, from which the unemployment rate is derived, showed the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, was 61.8%. That was the highest level since March 2020 and was up from 61.6% in October. The workforce remains 2.4 million below it pre-pandemic level.

""If more people are starting to look for work again, this would allow for stronger near-term hiring,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The household survey also showed a rise of 1.136 million in the number of people employed. The employment-to-population ratio, viewed as a measure of an economy's ability to create jobs, jumped to 59.2%, also the highest since March 2020, from 58.8% in October.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that factory orders increased 1.0% in October. Data for September was revised higher to show orders gaining 0.5% instead of 0.2% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 0.5%. 
Orders increased surged 17.1% on a year-on-year basis.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the economy, is being driven by still-strong demand for goods despite spending shifting back to services. Businesses are rebuilding depleted inventories, but shortages of labor and raw materials stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic remain challenges.
An Institute for Supply Management survey on Wednesday showed manufacturing activity picked up in November, noting ""some indications of slight labor and supplier delivery improvement.""
Shipments rose 2.0% after advancing 1.0% in September. Inventories at factories gained 0.8% in October. Unfilled orders rose 0.3% after increasing 0.7% in the prior month.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 0.7% instead of 0.6% as reported last month. 

Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.4%. They were previously reported to have increased 0.3%.

61,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 10:11AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. services industry activity unexpectedly rose in November, hitting a fresh record high as businesses boosted hiring, but there was little sign that supply constraints were easing and prices remained high.
The Institute for Supply Management said on Friday its non-manufacturing activity index increased to 69.1 last month, the highest reading since the series started in 1997, from 66.7 in October. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 65. The survey added to data on consumer spending, the labor market and manufacturing in painting a strong picture of the economy. The Omicron variant of COVID-19, however, poses a risk to the outlook.
The ISM's measure of services industry employment increased to a seven-month high of 56.5 from 51.6 in October. That offered hope that a pandemic-related labor crunch, which has hampered faster job growth, could be starting to ease. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of September.
With employment levels rising, services industries made progress in reducing the backlog of unfinished work last month.
Overall, supply constraints remained binding. The survey's measure of supplier deliveries was unchanged at a high 75.6. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries. 
Longer delivery times accounted for some of the surprise increase in the services index. They are normally associated with a strong economy and increased customer demand, which would be a positive contribution to the ISM non-manufacturing index.
In this instance, however, slower supplier deliveries also indicate relentless pandemic-related shortages.

The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries ticked down to a still-high 82.3 from 82.9 in October. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday that ""the risk of higher inflation has increased."" 
A measure of new orders received by services businesses held at a record 69.7 last month.

The survey period reflects a month in which cases of the coronavirus rose again following a fall in new infections in October. Economic policymakers have been grappling with what is keeping people on the sidelines and how many they expect to eventually come back into the labor force. 
The number of people who said they did not look for work because of COVID-19 fears declined to 1.19 million from 1.29 million the prior month, the lowest number since the pandemic began but not enough to cool intense hiring competition by firms amid labor shortages.
The figures are derived from an ongoing additional survey of households carried out by the U.S. government that has accompanied the monthly jobs report since the beginning of the pandemic.
Overall, U.S. job growth increased far less than expected in November, likely as millions of unemployed Americans remained home despite companies boosting wages, generous jobless benefits expiring and schools fully reopening.
It could cause a headache for the Federal Reserve, which is set to decide whether to speed up the conclusion of its bond purchase program at its next policy meeting on Dec. 14-15, in order to possibly raise interest rates sooner next year to rein in inflation which is at a 31-year high. 
""It's a market that's healing but healing at an uneven level"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

For those in jobs, the impact of COVID continued to recede. Approximately 3.64 million people were unable to work in November or reported reduced hours due to their business either closing entirely or cutting back operations, down from roughly 3.83 million in the prior month, according to the survey.
The number of people who said they teleworked recently due to the pandemic fell last month to 17.5 million from 18.05 million in October.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's economy posted an unexpectedly large job gain in November, driving the jobless rate down and hours worked up to pre-pandemic levels, data showed on Friday, but economists say it is unlikely to change the Bank of Canada's guidance amid worries over a new coronavirus variant.
The Canadian economy added a net 153,700 jobs in November, well above analysts' expectations of 35,000, while the unemployment rate dropped to 6.0%, beating a consensus estimate of 6.6% and edging closer to the February 2020 jobless rate of 5.7%, Statistics Canada said.
""I think the job market is tighter than the Bank of Canada has been letting on,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of capital market economics at Scotiabank, pointing to wages gains, which accelerated to 3.0% on the year from 2.1% in October.
""We're 186,000 jobs above pre-pandemic levels. So the Bank of Canada's narrative that we still have runway, in terms of a labor market recovery, is looking weaker by the moment,"" Holt added.
The Bank of Canada in October signaled it could start hiking rates as soon as April 2022. Since then, massive flooding in British Columbia has hampered trade through Vancouver and the Omicron coronavirus variant has emerged as a new global threat.
Those factors create uncertainty for the central bank and it is unlikely to markedly change its tune in its rate decision next week, said economists.
""If we didn't have the variant bringing some uncertainty over the outlook, I think it would be almost all systems go for the Bank to start teeing up tightening reasonably early in 2022,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.

Canadian employment increased in both the services and goods-producing sector, and gains were fairly evenly split between full and part-time work. Total hours worked climbed 0.7%, returning to pre-pandemic levels for the first time.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.4% higher at 1.2760 to the greenback, or 78.37 U.S. cents.

PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“It’s a market that’s healing but healing at an uneven level. The reason we have the drop in unemployment is people dropping out the workforce and that’s not a good sign. This is significant, in that the if Fed abandons its full employment standard - which they probably will due to wage inflation concerns - it means that even though this is a disappointing report, the Fed is not likely to alter its accelerated tapering pace and could begin raising rates in the second quarter. 
""The bottom line is it’s a disappointment.” 
JIM VOGEL, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, FHN FINANCIAL, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE
“Right now, people are sorting through the really good numbers in the household survey, and for now they are reducing their emphasis on the big payroll miss. It’s not completely unusual for the official business survey to be a bit wonky and that’s why we’ve seen so many upward revisions and that’s part of the feel. We are trading not only the payroll number this morning, but we are still trading Powell’s confident expression that tapering is a good idea from Tuesday, and we’re working on the premise that they’ve come to some pretty firm conclusions regardless of fourth quarter data.”
JJ KINAHAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO
“So we’re going to have the unemployment rate fall by 0.4% but miss on the top line number – something doesn’t add up. As I was looking through the sectors, the sectors that don’t truly make sense to me are leisure and hospitality up so small and retail being down, which is very odd for this time of year. So I’m wondering if we are going to see some revisions going forward on those two because those just don’t add up with everything else I am seeing. Because you did get some strong numbers out of warehousing again, which is great, professional services, construction, manufacturing – all the areas you want to see growth we are seeing it, which is fantastic.” 
“The futures seemed to like it, that top-line number, maybe people are thinking that although Powell talked this week about the taper maybe this slows the pace or slows them starting it.” 

“Pretty significant revisions in September - 67,000 more, October 15,000 more. Something is very odd about this report.”
“The rally here may be top line related but when you add that top line with the employment rate it is hard to square the circle so we’ll see if the buying momentum can last off of that. There are two other things at work - the volatile week in general, this could be a little momentum from yesterday. And two weeks from today is quadruple witching, we also have the end of the year coming up, so you do have people already starting to adjust their portfolios in a bigger way.”

Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market lost momentum significantly in November, defying expectations for another strong month of job gains. 
The Labor Department said nonfarm employment rose by only 210,000 through the middle of the month, down from 546,000 in October. The latter figure was revised up by 15,000 from its original estimate, but didn't come close to offsetting the disappointment of the November number, which was over 300,000 short of a consensus forecast of 550,000. Expectations for a strong report had hardened after payrolls processor ADP had said on Wednesday that the private sector had added 534,000 jobs in the month, by its calculations. There has also been little to suggest a weakening in labor market in other data, with the monthly Job Openings survey continuing to show near-record levels of vacancies. 
Despite the big shortfall in job creation, the unemployment rate fell by more than expected to 4.2% of the workforce from 4.6% in October. That reflected an increase in labor force participation, which rose to 61.8% of the adult population, from 61.6% in October. The participation rate, which has been a particular problem holding back the economic recovery this year, is now at its highest since March last year.
""Notable job gains occurred in professional and business services, transportation and warehousing, construction, and manufacturing,"" the Bureau of Labor Statistics said, adding that employment in the retail trade actually declined in the month leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday.
The expansion of the labor force should, all other things being equal, take the steam out of some of the inflationary pressure that has built over the last year, in an environment of sustained high spending despite increasing supply-side constraints and bottlenecks. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged earlier this week that inflation was likely to remain higher for longer than at first estimated, largely due to such supply-side issues. 
However, all other things appear increasingly unlikely to stay equal in the near term, given the emergence of a new and seemingly more infectious strain of Covid-19 over the last week. The Omicron strain is now spreading rapidly through South Africa, the first country where it was detected, and has already been identified in more than two dozen countries across the world. Much of Europe has already announced a fresh wave of mobility and social distancing restrictions, with Germany - Europe's largest economy - effectively locking down unvaccinated adults in a suite of new measures prepared by the new government. U.S. President Joe Biden has announced the tightening of testing requirements on people arriving in the U.S. It is unclear that that will be enough to stop Omicron from spreading in the community.
""Labor supply simply isn't returning quickly enough and, for companies desperate to hire, this is a huge problem,"" said ING chief international economist James Knightley in a note to clients.   ""The implication is that it constrains growth and pay is bid higher, with those cost increases likely passed onto consumers.""
He noted that the discrepancy between what employers were saying and what households were saying (the household survey of employment rose by over 1 million) made it hard to interpret the numbers cleanly. 
""Effectively you can defend any position by picking out the bits of the report that suits your view,"" Knightley said."

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 58.5 in November from 59.1 in October, revised down slightly from a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 58.6.
The survey's gauges of costs paid by services companies and prices they charged to customers hit their highest levels since records started in 1998, which some Bank of England officials may view as backing the case for an interest rate hike on Dec. 16 at its next policy announcement.
New orders rose at the fastest pace in five months, driven by the travel industry after the easing of lockdown restrictions, the PMI showed.
""Worryingly, the fastest-growing parts of the service sector are also the most exposed to the return of tighter pandemic restrictions, especially as we approach the crucial festive spending period,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit.

Optimism fell to a one-year low, even before news of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 became known to most of the companies surveyed last month.
The composite PMI - a combination of the services survey and Wednesday's manufacturing PMI - eased to 57.6 in November from 57.8 in October.

ROME, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The Italian economy will grow by 6.3% this year, national statistics bureau ISTAT said on Friday, revising up a previous projection of 4.7% made in June due to an acceleration of domestic demand and world trade. 
In its twice-yearly economic outlook report, ISTAT forecast that gross domestic product will increase next year by 4.7%, raising its June forecast of 4.4%.
The institute's latest projections are broadly in line with those of Mario Draghi's government, which sees officially sees growth of 6.0% this year and 4.7% in 2022.
Draghi and other ministers have said recently this year's growth will exceed the official 6.0% target, which was made at the end of September.
The increase in GDP this year and next ""will be determined mainly by the contribution of final domestic demand, accompanied by a more modest contribution from net exports,"" ISTAT said.
The economy grew by 2.6% in the third quarter this year from the previous three months mainly due to strong consumer spending, the statistics bureau said on Tuesday, following a 2.7% GDP rise in the second quarter.
Last year, when the economy was hobbled by coronavirus lockdowns, recorded a record GDP contraction of 8.9%.
ISTAT estimated an average jobless rate of 9.6% this year, down from its June projection of 9.8%. It cut its 2022 forecast to 9.3% from 9.6%.
The unemployment rate stood at 9.4% in October, ISTAT reported on Thursday, the highest reading since June.

""An improvement in the rate of economic growth signalled by the euro zone PMI looks likely to be short-lived,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. 
""Not only did demand growth weaken, but firms' expectations of future growth also sank lower as worries about the pandemic intensified again.""

The readings in the private survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, tallied with those of an official survey, which also showed the expansion in the services sector lost some steam.
Analysts say the services sector, which has been slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, is more vulnerable to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks and anti-virus measures, clouding the outlook for a much anticipated rebound in consumption in the months to come.
China's leisure and tourism businesses have been feeling the heat from the country's zero tolerance COVID-19 strategy to contain infections. The country is currently battling a small-scale outbreak in Inner Mongolia.
Firms' input prices also expanded for the 17th month in a row and at the fastest pace since May due to rising labour and raw material costs. Prices charged also rose, but at a slower pace, pointing to margin pressures.
A sub-index for new business rose, but at the slowest pace since August. Business expectations improved from the month before, however.

Investing.com – China's services sector activity grew at a slower pace in November as inflationary pressures and small COVID-19 outbreaks continue, a private survey showed on Friday.
The Caixin services purchasing managers' index was 52.1, lower than the 52.6 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 53.8 figure reported during the previous month. However, it remained above the 50-point mark indicating growth.
The Caixin survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, follows data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) earlier in the week that showed the non-manufacturing PMI was at 52.3.
The NBS data also said the manufacturing PMI was at 50.1, and Wednesday’s Caixin manufacturing PMI was at 49.9.
The services sector has been slower to recover from COVID-19 than manufacturing, as it is more vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks and the accompanying restrictive measures. Continuous COVID-19 outbreaks, although small, are clouding the outlook for the anticipated rebound in consumption for the foreseeable future. China's leisure and tourism businesses have been particularly impacted as the country continues its zero-tolerance approach to the virus.
Companies saw input prices expand for a 17th consecutive month, and at the fastest pace since May 2020, thanks to rising labor and raw material costs. Prices charged also rose, albeit at a slower pace.

The death rate has been far lower than earlier waves, however, and case numbers have stabilised in recent days. The government has reported its first case of the Omicron variant, but has said it is too soon to judge its likely impact on the economy. 

Reports of rising COVID-19 case numbers weighed on business levels and expectations, with the slowdown evident in all of the survey's sub-indices, the survey's authors said.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland collected 9.4%, or 5.4 billion euros ($6 billion), more tax than expected in the first 11 months after it took in a record amount of corporate tax in November, traditionally the most buoyant period of the year. 
Tax revenues proved extremely resilient during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and have taken off this year despite the economy being in its third and longest lockdown for much of the first half. 
The finance ministry took in 1.5 billion euros more that it had budgeted for last month alone, it said on Thursday.
It also collected 4 billion euros in corporate tax versus the 3.2 billion expected, putting Ireland on course for another record annual haul with corporate receipts making up more than one in every five euros of tax collected.
That also meant corporate receipts for November were greater than the annual corporate tax take ten years ago, when the state took in 3.8 billion euros. 
While global corporate tax reforms are forecast to slow the recent rapid growth in a category dominated by foreign multinationals, they were 26% ahead of target during the first 11 months of the year at 13.6 billion euros.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said the outturn reflected the very robust performance of the technology sector during the pandemic and that the receipts across the board were another positive indicator of the strength of Ireland's economic recovery.
VAT receipts were 7.2% above forecast year to date at the end of November while income tax, the largest category, was 4.3% ahead of target after both also enjoyed a bumper month.
With spending 3.4% below forecast, the exchequer recorded a narrower deficit of 4.9 billion euros on a 12-month rolling basis.
The government forecast last month that it would run a 2021 budget deficit of 5.9% of modified gross national income, down from 8.8% last year.

While Ireland's fiscal watchdog predicted this week that the deficit would be lower than that by year end, Donohoe told Reuters on Wednesday that the new Omicron COVID-19 variant made December too uncertain to call.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazil's economy contracted slightly in the three months to September, government data showed on Thursday, as surging inflation, steep interest rate hikes and a severe drought triggered a recession in Latin America's largest economy.
The 0.1% decline in Brazil's gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter, reported by official statistics agency IBGE, was below a median forecast for zero growth in a Reuters poll. 
Brazil's economic rebound from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic has sputtered as inflation surged into double digits, forcing the central bank to raise borrowing costs aggressively despite the downturn.
Economists have said that the stubbornly high levels of inflation in Brazil have steadily eroded consumers' purchasing power, proving a drag on the economy.
Some analysts said Thursday's weak data may discourage the bank's monetary policy committee, called Copom, from an even larger interest rate increase at its December meeting.
""Against this backdrop, we no longer see Copom upping the pace of monetary tightening next week,"" William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, told clients in a note, forecasting another rate increase of 150 basis points.
Big rate hikes from the central bank, whose autonomy was written into Brazil's constitution this year, are one more headwind for a weak economy, which is weighing on President Jair Bolsonaro's popularity as he prepares to seek relection in 2022.
Revised data showed a 0.4% drop in the second quarter, worse than the 0.1% decline reported previously. Two straight quarters of contraction meet the definition of a recession. 
Unusually dry weather this year has also hurt key Brazilian crops such as corn and coffee. Vanishing reserves at hydropower dams drove up electricity costs, adding to price shocks.
Agricultural production fell 8.0% in the third quarter, while industrial output was flat and services advanced 1.1%.
Brazil's auto industry has struggled to ramp up production amid a shortage of components such as microchips in global supply chains. Shortages have also hurt manufacturing in Mexico, whose economy contracted more than expected in the quarter.
WORSE TO COME 
Some economists are warning of a deeper downturn next year.
The market outlook for 2022 economic growth has fallen from 2.3% in June to less than 0.6% in the latest central bank poll of economists, released on Monday.
Brazil's Economy Ministry dismissed that consensus in a statement on Thursday, reaffirming its forecast of economic growth above 2% next year and pointing to recent job creation data as evidence of a resilient recovery.
Brazil's unemployment rate fell to 12.6% in the third quarter from 14.2% in the prior quarter, data showed this week, hitting the lowest point since the beginning of the pandemic.

""The government has an obvious bias to overestimate (growth) as long as possible. But there comes a point when you can't,"" said José Francisco Gonçalves, chief economist at Banco Fator.
Compared to the third quarter of 2020, Brazil's economy grew 4.0%, IBGE data showed, below a median forecast of 4.2% growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased less than expected last week, pointing to tightening labor market conditions, while layoffs tumbled to the lowest level in 28-1/2 years in November. 
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed jobless benefits rolls falling below 2 million for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic started in the United States more than 20 months ago. 
The upbeat news on the labor market added to strong consumer spending and manufacturing data in suggesting that the economy was accelerating after hitting a speed bump in the third quarter. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus, however, poses a risk to the brightening picture. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in a nod to the strengthening economy told lawmakers this week that the U.S. central bank should consider accelerating the pace of winding down its bond purchases at its Dec. 14-15 policy meeting. 
""Companies are not laying off workers like they did during the recession,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Powell was right to hint the Fed might speed up the tapering process because a tight labor market means increasing wage demands will stoke the fires of inflation."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 28,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Nov. 27. Claims dropped to 194,000 in the prior week, which was the lowest number since 1969.
They tend to be volatile around Thanksgiving, the start of the holiday season. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 240,000 applications for the latest week. Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020.
Unadjusted claims fell 41,622 to 211,896 last week. There were sharp declines in filings in California, Texas and Virginia, which offset notable rises in North Carolina and Wisconsin.
U.S. stocks opened higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
EYES ON PAYROLLS 
Last week's data has no bearing on the department's closely watched employment report for November, scheduled to be published on Friday, as it falls outside the period during which the government surveyed businesses and households for the nonfarm payrolls count and the unemployment rate. Claims declined between mid-October and mid-November.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 550,000 jobs in November after rising 531,000 in October. The unemployment rate is forecast dipping to 4.5% from 4.6% in October. 
Also arguing for continued improvement in the labor market, the ADP National Employment report on Wednesday showed private payrolls increased by 534,000 jobs last month. A measure of manufacturing employment rose to a seven-month high, a survey from the Institute for Supply Management showed. 
The Conference Board's labor market differential - derived from data on consumers' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get - jumped to a record high in November. 
The run of good news on the labor market was extended by a separate report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers dropped 34.8% in November to 14,875, the fewest since May 1993. So far this year, there have been 302,918 job cuts, down 86% compared to the same period in 2020.
But worker shortages are hindering faster job growth. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book on Wednesday described employment growth ranging from ""modest to strong"" across Fed districts during October and early November, with contacts noting ""persistent difficulty in hiring and retaining employees."" 
There were 10.4 million job openings as of the end of September. The workforce is down 3 million people from its pre-pandemic level, even as generous federal government-funded benefits have expired, schools have reopened for in-person learning and companies are raising wages. 

But there is hope that worker shortages could start easing soon. Thursday's claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid plunged 107,000 to 1.956 million in the week ended Nov. 20. 
The lowest level in the so-called continuing claims since mid-March 2020 likely reflected a combination of people exhausting their benefits as well as finding work. A total 2.31 million people were receiving unemployment checks under all programs in mid-November.

Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs totaled 222,000 in the week ended Nov. 27, an increase of 28,000 from the prior week, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 240,000 applications.
The four-week average of initial applications, which smooths out large swings in the data, dropped to 238,750.
The level of claims is still near the lows of the pandemic and points to the labor market’s continuing recovery. However, the emerging omicron variant poses a risk to what’s otherwise been a solid pace of hiring.
The figures come a day before the government’s monthly employment report, which is projected to show payrolls increased by 546,000 in November.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 5.4% month-on-month for a 21.9% year-on-year surge.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 3.5% monthly rise and a 19.0% annual gain. Energy prices were the main reason behind the sharp increase, surging 16.8% on the month and rocketing 62.5% year-on-year.
Producer prices translate into higher prices for consumers and in November headline consumer inflation reached 4.9%, by far the highest level in the 25 years since the figure has been compiled, up from 4.1% a month earlier and well ahead of expectations for 4.5%.

Eurostat said the euro zone jobless rate continued to decline, falling to 7.3% of the workforce in October, as expected by economists polled by Reuters, from 7.4% in September.

The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 134.4 points last month compared with a revised 132.8 for October.
The October figure was previously given as 133.2.
The November reading was the highest for the index since June 2011. On a year-on-year basis, the index was up 27.3% last month.
Agricultural commodity prices have risen steeply in the past year, driven by harvest setbacks and strong demand.
The FAO's cereal price index rose by 3.1% in November from the previous month and was 23.2% higher than its year-ago level, with wheat prices hitting their highest level since May 2011. 
FAO said wheat prices were supported by concerns about unseasonable rains in Australia and uncertainty over potential changes to export measures in Russia.
The dairy price index posted the largest monthly rise, up 3.4% from the previous month. ""Strong global import demand persisted for butter and milk powders as buyers sought to secure spot supplies in anticipating of tightening markets,"" FAO said.
Global sugar prices rose 1.4% on the month and was up nearly 40% year-on-year. ""The increase was primarily driven by higher ethanol prices,"" FAO said. 
The meat price index posted its fourth consecutive monthly decline, shedding 0.9% on the month, while world vegetable oil prices fell 0.3% on October levels, but international palm oil prices remained firm, FAO said. 
Rome-based FAO cut its projection of global cereal production in 2021 to 2.791 billion tonnes from 2.793 billion estimated a month ago, according to its cereal supply and demand outlook.
However, the expected world cereal output would still represent a record, FAO said.

""The month-to-month downgrade is primarily the result of an anticipated marginally smaller global coarse grains outturn, reflecting reduced forecasts for barley and sorghum production,"" FAO said.
World cereal utilization in 2021/22 was forecast to rise by 1.7% above the 2020/21 level, hitting 2.810 billion tonnes. FAO's forecast for world cereal stocks by the close of seasons in 2022 stood at 822 million tonnes, up 2.9 million tonnes since November but still down 0.7% from opening levels.

The data marks the ninth consecutive month of falling jobless figures and the lowest unemployment figure for November since 2008, the ministry said.
Spain added 109,451 net jobs over the month, while some 125,632 people were still enrolled in the state supported furlough scheme, 39,992 fewer than a month earlier, separate data from the Social Security Ministry showed.
This has brought the number of registered workers to 19.77 million, a record high for the Spanish labour market, according to the ministry.
Spain has experienced strong employment growth so far in the second half of the year, thanks to the containment of the pandemic in a country with one of the highest vaccination rates in the world.
Although tourism data is still far from pre-pandemic levels, the autumn is proving to be good for activity in the sector, where more than 30,000 jobs were created in catering alone.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity picked up in November amid strong demand for goods, keeping inflation high as factories continued to struggle with pandemic-related shortages of raw materials.
Signs that the economy was gathering momentum halfway through the fourth quarter were underscored by other data on Wednesday showing private employers maintained a strong pace of hiring last month. But there are fears that the Omicron variant of COVID-19 could hurt demand for services as well as keep the unemployed at home, and hold back job growth and the economy.
""Manufacturing should continue to contribute positively to GDP growth over the next year as businesses replenish inventories and supply-chain issues improve,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""There are risks, including the potential for businesses overbooking orders now and the Omicron variant magnifying price and supply chain issues.""
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 61.1 last month from 60.8 in October. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 61.0.
""The U.S. manufacturing sector remains in a demand-driven, supply chain-constrained environment, with some indications of slight labor and supplier delivery improvement,"" said Timothy Fiore, ISM chair of the manufacturing business survey committee.
Global economies' simultaneous recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, fueled by trillions of dollars in relief money from governments, has strained supply chains, leaving factories waiting longer to receive raw materials. 
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book on Wednesday described economic activity as growing at ""a modest to moderate pace"" during October and early November, but noted that ""growth was constrained by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages."" 
All of the six largest manufacturing industries in the ISM survey, including computer and electronic products as well as transportation equipment, reported moderate to strong growth. 
Makers of computer and electronic products said ""international component shortages continue to cause delays in completing customer orders."" Transport equipment manufacturers reported ""large volume drops due to chip shortage."" Furniture producers said ""business is strong but meeting customer demand is difficult due to a shortage of raw materials and labor."" 
But there are some glimmers of hope. Prices for steel plate and hot-rolled coil appear to be nearing a plateau, according to manufacturers of fabricated metal products. Supply of plastic resins is improving, accounts from electrical equipment, appliances and components, as well as plastics and rubber products manufacturers suggested.
The ISM survey's measure of supplier deliveries slipped to 72.2 from 75.6 in October. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries. 
The long delivery times kept inflation at the factory gate bubbling. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers fell to a still-high 82.4 from 85.7 in October.
Factories are easily passing the increased production costs to consumers and there are no signs yet of resistance. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday that ""the risk of higher inflation has increased,"" adding that the U.S. central bank should consider accelerating the pace of winding down its large-scale bond purchases at its next policy meeting in two weeks.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure surged by the most in nearly 31 years on an annual basis in October.
Stocks on Wall Street rebounded after Tuesday's sell-off. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasury prices rose.

STRONG ORDERS
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index climbed to 61.5 last month from 59.8 in October. Customer inventories remained depressed. 
With demand robust, factories hired more workers. A measure of manufacturing employment rose to a seven-month high.
Strengthening labor market conditions were reinforced by the ADP National employment report on Wednesday showing private payrolls increased by 534,000 jobs in November after rising 570,000 in October. That was broadly in line with expectations. 
Graphic: ADP: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/byvrjqjlzve/adp.png 
This, combined with consumers' robust perceptions of the labor market last month suggest job growth accelerated further in November. First-time applications for unemployment benefits declined between mid-October and mid-November. 
But a shortage of workers caused by the pandemic is hindering faster job growth. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of September. 
Workers have remained home even as companies have been boosting wages, school reopened for in-person learning and generous federal government-funded benefits ended. 
""Overall, the risk remains that renewed health concerns will keep workers, especially those with caregiving responsibilities, from returning to the labor force, preventing a return to pre-pandemic strength,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. 

According to a Reuters survey of economists nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 550,000 jobs in November. The economy created 531,000 jobs in October. 
The Labor Department is scheduled to publish its closely watched employment report for November on Friday.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index inched slightly higher to 49.4 in November from 49.3 in October, below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
The index has consistently remained below that threshold every month since March 2020 and plummeted to 35.0 in April 2020 amid the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, in what was by far the lowest reading in the survey's 10-1/2 year history.
The new reading signaled a further deterioration in the health of the manufacturing sector, though the contraction was mild compared to those seen since the onset of COVID-19, the survey said.
""The performance of Mexican manufacturers was again negatively impacted by supply chain constraints, although subdued demand conditions partly contributed to the latest contraction in output,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
Data last week showed that Mexico's economy contracted 0.4% https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/mexican-economy-shrinks-more-than-expected-third-quarter-2021-11-25 in the third quarter, receding faster than previously thought as services slumped and supply chain issues bit, challenging the central bank as it juggles record inflation, a weak peso and leadership changes.
""In some instances, companies indicated having purchased fewer inputs due to elevated prices for many items, exacerbating their stock-replenishing problems arising from lengthening delivery times,"" said De Lima.

According to De Lima the survey underscored that inflationary pressures remained elevated, with the latest increase in input costs the second-strongest in over three years.
Mexican annual inflation accelerated faster than expected in the first half of November to more than 7%, the highest rate in over 20 years.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) -Global factory activity accelerated in November although crippling supply bottlenecks remained, putting a cap on output and driving up the cost of raw materials, according to surveys published on Wednesday.
Towards the end of the month, the newly-detected Omicron coronavirus variant emerged as a fresh worry for policymakers, who are already trying to pilot recovering economies and tamp-down inflation.
The November surveys likely did not reflect the spread of the variant, which could add further pressure on pandemic-disrupted supply chains, with many countries imposing fresh border controls to seal themselves off.
""The Omicron variant...could be a game-changer: shortages of inputs and labour would worsen for manufacturers if Britain and other countries went into another lockdown,"" said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics. 
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone nevertheless nudged up to 58.4 in November from October's 58.3, shy of an initial 58.6 ""flash"" estimate but still comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
Supply chain issues have made it a sellers' market for raw materials and the input prices index was only just below October's record high and factories in the region passed on the rising costs to customers at the fastest rate in the survey's history.

""But demand was relatively weak, suppressed by the COVID-19 epidemic and rising product prices.""

Businesses’ payrolls increased by 534,000 last month after a 570,000 gain in October, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 525,000 rise.
The figures suggest steady improvement in a labor market where skills mismatches, job switching and pandemic-related factors are still making it difficult for employers to attract and retain workers. Total employment as measured by ADP remains well below its pre-pandemic level, and the emerging omicron variant represents a risk to labor force participation. 
The data precede Friday’s monthly employment report from the Labor Department, which is forecast to show that private payrolls increased by 525,000 in November.
“The labor market recovery continued to power through its challenges last month,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said in a statement. “Service providers, which are more vulnerable to the pandemic, have dominated job gains this year.

The IHS Markit CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose in November to 58.1 from 57.8 in October. 
While revised down from a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 58.2, the survey showed a mostly improving picture for British manufacturers, marked by rising orders and employment.
But the PMI's measure of factory costs, historically a good guide to official producer input price inflation, rose to the highest level since records began in 1992 as businesses struggled with global supply chain problems.
A Confederation of British Industry survey earlier this week showed costs rising at the fastest rate in over 20 years for firms in Britain's services sector.
The BoE is keeping a close eye on gauges of cost pressure in the economy. 

While it has said higher borrowing costs can do nothing to influence energy prices paid by businesses and consumers, some of its policymakers are concerned that high inflation could harm its credibility in the eyes of the public.
Earlier on Wednesday, a survey showed British retailers increased prices for the first time in more than two years in November as the pandemic's hit to global supply chains and staff availability pushed up inflation for shoppers.

Disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, alongside a shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers, has led to product shortages and left factories struggling to get the materials they need to manufacture goods.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) nevertheless nudged up to 58.4 in November from October's 58.3, shy of an initial 58.6 ""flash"" estimate but still comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Friday and seen as a good guide to economic health, rose to 53.8 from October's 53.3.
""A strong headline PMI reading masks just how tough business conditions are for manufacturers at the moment. Although demand remains strong, as witnessed by a further solid improvement in new order inflows, supply chains continue to deteriorate at a worrying rate,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Those disruptions have made it a sellers' market for raw materials and the input prices index was only just below October's record high.
But factories passed on more of those rising costs to customers and increased their prices at the fastest pace since IHS Markit began collecting the data 19 years ago. The output prices index climbed to a survey high of 73.7 from 72.6.

Elevated inflation and a surge in house prices has put pressure on the ECB, which has undershot its inflation target for nearly a decade, to act.

93,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 02:41AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) -The growth of British house prices accelerated last month and the market was holding up despite the end of pandemic emergency support measures for housing and the broader economy, mortgage lender Nationwide said on Wednesday.
House prices rose by 0.9% in November compared with October when they rose by 0.7%, Nationwide said. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a monthly 0.5% increase.
The increase left house prices 10% higher than in November 2020, above a median forecast of 9.3% in the Reuters poll.
Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said house prices were now almost 15% above their level in March 2020 when the pandemic swept Europe.
""Underlying activity appears to be holding up well,"" Gardner said. 
Demand for housing has been strong in Britain - and many other countries around the world - since the lifting of the first coronavirus lockdown last year, boosted by demand for bigger properties as more people work from home.
The British market was also stoked by a tax incentive offered by finance minister Rishi Sunak which fully expired at the end of September, when a jobs support programme also lapsed.
Since the end of the furlough programme there has been no sign of a big jump in unemployment.
""If this is maintained, housing market conditions may remain fairly buoyant in the coming months, especially since the market has momentum and there is scope for ongoing shifts in housing preferences, as a result of the pandemic, to continue to support activity,"" Gardner said.
A shortage of homes for sale has also continued to support house prices. 

Gardner said the outlook remained uncertain due to factors such as the possibility of the Bank of England raising interest rates and the impact of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus on public health and the economy. 
""Indeed, house price growth has been outpacing income growth by a significant margin and, as a result, housing affordability is already less favourable than was the case before the pandemic struck,"" he said.

Growth in output and new orders accelerated to the fastest pace since May as client demand strengthened.
""Although the upturns were historically subdued, they were the fastest for six months,"" said Sian Jones, an economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
Employment increased for the second month running in November, with the pace of job creation at its fastest since December 2018 thanks to higher production requirements.
Input costs rose markedly due to increased supplier costs and raw materials shortages. Firms said they had partially passed them on to clients.

The level of optimism among producers reached a five-month high as they hoped for an uptick in customer orders.

Investing.com – China’s factory activity slid back into contraction in November, with subdued demand, as well as rising unemployment and prices, weighing on manufacturers.
The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was at 49.9, just below the 50-mark indicating growth. It also was lower than the 50.6 figure reported in October, as well as the 50.5 predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
The findings from Caixin’s survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, contrasted with Tuesday’s data from the National Bureau of Statistics. The data showed the manufacturing PMI was at 50.1, while the non-manufacturing PMI was at 52.3.
“Supply in the manufacturing sector recovered, while demand weakened. Relaxing constraints on the supply side, especially the easing of the power crunch, quickened the pace of production recovery,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Zhe Wang said in a statement accompanying the data release.
“But demand was relatively weak, suppressed by the COVID-19 epidemic and rising product prices.”
Although China initially staged an impressive economic recovery from COVID-19, a slowing manufacturing sector, debt woes in the property market, and COVID-19 outbreaks have all contributed to a slowdown.
Investors predict that a slowdown in gross domestic product recorded for the third quarter of 2021 to continue in the year’s last quarter.
The Caixin survey also showed that production expanded in November for the first time in four months, while new orders fell back into contraction.
Caixin’s Wang urged policymakers to focus on supporting small companies and pay attention to problems including deepening unemployment, limited household income growth, and weak purchasing power.
“In addition, the prices of some raw materials remained high. Enterprises are still facing high-cost pressures. Policymakers should treat inflation seriously,” he added.
Meanwhile, the Caixin services PMI is due later in the week."

The property sector, accounting for a quarter of the country's gross domestic product, has slowed sharply in recent months, with sentiment shaken by tight regulations and a growing liquidity crisis that has engulfed some of the country's most indebted developers.
New home prices in 100 cities dipped 0.04% in November from a month earlier, compared with 0.09% growth in October, according to data from China Index Academy, one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms.
That was the first decline in the survey since 2015, except for a drop of 0.24% in February 2020, the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in China.
Only 30% of 100 cities reported monthly price rises for new homes.
Prices in the resale home market fell 0.08% month-on-month, deepening from a 0.04% decrease in October. 
Official data for October had shown a price drop for that month for new homes, the first decline since March 2015, and falling resale prices in most cities, along with a plunge in construction starts.
""The downward trend in the property market remains unchanged in the near future"", said the academy's research director Cao Jingjing.
Rapidly deteriorating conditions in the property sector have prompted speculation that policymakers may start to dial back tough restrictions on buyers and developers and even cut interest rates.
But policymakers are widely expected to stand firm for now, while making some financial tweaks to help genuine home buyers.
Some banks have accelerated the disbursement of approved mortgages and some were told to issue more loans to property firms for project development.
The southwestern city of Chengdu last week moved to ensure developers receive funds from presold properties and fresh loans, in the first such move by a Chinese city to ease a liquidity crisis.
Monthly new home prices in Tier-one and Tier-two cities dropped 0.1% and 0.02%, versus gains of 0.01% and 0.09% in October, the data from the Academy survey showed.

The property regulation policies are expected to be fine-tune, said the Academy's Cao.
Oxford Economics in a recent note expected the property downturn would continue into the first half of 2022.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.9 in November from 50.6 the month before, versus analyst expectations of 50.5 in a Reuters poll. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The world's second-largest economy, which staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic slump, has lost momentum since the second half as it grapples with a slowing manufacturing sector, debt problems in the property market and COVID-19 outbreaks.
Analysts expect the slowdown in gross domestic product (GDP)seen in the third-quarter to continue in the fourth with demand expected to remain soft given the prolonged global COVID-19 pandemic. 
The findings from the private survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, stood in contrast with those in an official survey on Tuesday that showed manufacturing activity grew for the first time in three months.
""Supply in the manufacturing sector recovered, while demand weakened.

Production in November expanded for the first time in four months, while new orders slid back into contraction, the Caixin survey showed.
Declines in employment also deepened.
Cost pressures are finally easing after the relentless build-up in the past few months as government efforts to curb record high raw material prices paid off. 
A sub-index for input prices declined to 52.3 from 65.1 the previous month, driving a slowdown in output price inflation.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies raised spending on plant and equipment for the second straight quarter in July-September, but the pace of gains slowed as global supply shortages due to a resurgent coronavirus pandemic hit corporate activity.
A slow pickup in company spending is likely to worry policymakers hoping strong domestic demand can make the country's economic recovery more sustainable.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Wednesday showed capital expenditure in the third quarter rose 1.2% from the same period last year.
It marked the second straight quarter of year-on-year gains, having posted a much larger 5.3% expansion in the second quarter.
""This outcome shows quite a substantial fall in economic activity due to the global impact of a spreading of coronavirus infections,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research.
""While there's demand for capital spending, its progress was delayed. Due to parts shortages machines could not be produced,"" he said.
The data, which will be used to calculate revised gross domestic products (GDP) due next Wednesday, showed business spending, recurring profits and sales all declined from the previous quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis.
""Corporate expenditure rose compared to the same period in the previous year, but it fell from the prior quarter reflecting the spread of infections and growing uncertainty about the outlook,"" a government official said.
It comes after private-sector data showed Japan's manufacturing activity grew in November at the fastest pace in nearly four years. The government said on Tuesday factory production grew in October, raising hopes of a recovery fuelled by stronger car output.
The world's third-largest economy declined in the third quarter as global supply disruptions hit exports and the health crisis soured consumer sentiment.
A preliminary estimate found the economy shrank an annualised 3.0% in July-September amid a resurgence of coronavirus infections.
Tsunoda said the capital expenditure component of the revised third-quarter GDP figures was likely to be downgraded.
Wednesday's data showed manufacturers' business spending improved 0.9% from a year earlier, while that of service-sector firms advanced 1.4%.

Capital expenditure, however, lost 2.6% in July-September from the previous quarter on a seasonally-adjusted basis, the MOF data showed.
Corporate recurring profits rose 35.1% in July-September from a year earlier, while sales were up 4.6%.

99,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 08:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's factory activity expanded further in November, though output shrank for a second straight month, signalling that Asia's fourth-largest economy is struggling to fully regain momentum in the face of persistent supply chain disruptions.
The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) for November edged up to 50.9 from 50.2 in October, and managed to hold above the 50-mark threshold that indicates expansion in activity, for a 14th straight month.
""Despite the headline PMI rising slightly in November, this masked a second successive contraction in output levels, while new order growth broadly stagnated as supply shortages hit demand,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit.
Output continued to shrink on shortages of materials, notably in the semiconductors market, while slowing new orders put more strains on firms.
Total new orders and export orders barely grew, as higher demand in key Asian markets such as Japan, mainland China and Taiwan were offset by supply difficulties in the automotive industry.
Adding to the challenge, manufacturers faced more cost burdens, with input prices rising at their quickest pace since the survey began in April 2004, due to higher raw material costs.
That led firms to pass higher costs on to clients, pushing factory gate inflation to a four-month high, and reduce staffing levels for a second straight month.
Firms, however, were optimistic over the coming year that supply chain pressure would ease amid a global recovery in demand, with business confidence improving to a three-month high.

""Confidence was underpinned by hopes that supply chain pressure would ease and the recovery in global demand would accelerate the launch and mass production of new products,"" Bhatti said.
The November survey did not reflect the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant that may add further pressure on the pandemic-disrupted supply chains, with many countries imposing fresh border controls to seal themselves off.

Businesses, however, said cost pressures remained an issue as materials shortages and delivery delays caused input prices to surge the most in 13 years.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in November rose to 54.5 on a seasonally adjusted basis, marking its fastest pace of expansion since January 2018.
The figure, which compared to the prior month's 53.2 and a 54.2 flash reading, also marked the 10th straight month of expansion in manufacturing activity.
""The Japanese manufacturing sector continued to see an improvement in operating conditions midway through the fourth quarter,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Bhatti said manufacturers reported a sustained and marked deterioration in lead times, with evidence suggesting supply chain disruptions continued to hinder activity within the sector.
""Material shortages and logistical disruptions contributed to a rapid rise in average cost burdens, as input prices rose at the fastest pace since August 2008,"" Bhatti added.

Data on Tuesday showed Japan's industrial output rise for the first time in four months in October as faster car production offset declines in manufacturing of chemicals, steel and other sectors.
The world's third-largest economy is expected to rebound in the current quarter after contracting in July-September as curbs to stem a rise in coronavirus infections hurt household and corporate sentiment.

Retailers have been advertising holiday deals as early as September and are offering smaller discounts, as they look to minimize product shortages ahead of Christmas due to supply chain bottlenecks and cushion the hit to profits from surging costs.
However, those efforts have led to a more spread out holiday shopping season and fewer people concentrating their spending on days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
A total of 179.8 million shoppers made purchases in stores and online over the shopping period from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday, compared with 186.4 million shoppers in 2020, NRF's survey showed.
The total number of online shoppers fell 12.1% to 127.8 million, while in-store foot traffic rose 13.7% from a year ago when the pandemic kept shoppers away from stores. 
""With early deals in October, consumers were not waiting around for discounts on big shopping days like Cyber Monday and Black Friday,"" said Taylor Schreiner, director, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Digital Insights. 
Data from Adobe Analytics showed online spending on both Cyber Monday and Black Friday declined for the first time ever this year.
NRF's survey of 5,759 consumers also showed shoppers spent an average of $301.27 on holiday purchases such as gifts, toys and apparel, down from $311.75 last year.

The holiday season kicks off just as the new Omicron coronavirus variant triggers uncertainty over the economic reopening, but NRF CEO Matthew Shay warned against a return to lockdowns. 
""We've got to continue to keep the economy open and moving forward. We want to work with the administration and President (Biden) to get that done,"" Shay said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence dropped to a nine-month low in November amid worries about the rising cost of living and pandemic fatigue, but that did not change expectations for stronger economic growth this quarter.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumers less enthusiastic about buying a house and big-ticket items such as motor vehicles and major household appliances over the next six months, likely because of shortages, which have boosted prices. Consumers held strong views of the labor market, with the gap between those saying jobs are plentiful versus hard to get widening to a record high.
""This isn't a cause for concern as the relationship between spending and sentiment is loose, particularly in the short-run,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The good news is that consumers' assessment of the labor market improved in November, pointing toward further acceleration in job growth.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to 109.5 this month, the lowest reading since February, from 111.6 in October. The survey was conducted before the discovery of Omicron, a new COVID-19 variant.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 111.0. The measure, which places more emphasis on the labor market, is down from a peak of 128.9 in June. The fall was less than that of the University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment, which hit a decade low.
Data this month have suggested that the economy was accelerating in the fourth quarter, with consumer spending surging in October and first-time applications for unemployment benefits at a 52-year low. 
That led economists to raise their growth estimates for the fourth quarter to as high as an 8.6% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the July-September quarter. 
But the outlook for next year has been clouded by the Omicron variant.
While economists expect consumer confidence to decline further because of both the Delta and Omicron variants, they held onto their lofty growth forecasts for the current quarter.
""We currently expect the Omicron variant will have only a moderate negative impact on growth,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We still anticipate real GDP growth of 7.9% in fourth quarter and real consumer spending growth of 6.5%.""
Stocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
STRONG LABOR MARKET VIEWS 
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, jumped to a reading of 46.9 this month, the highest on record, from 43.8 in October.
This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department.
Combined with multi-decade low jobless claims, it raises hopes that employment growth accelerated further this month, though a shortage of workers remains a challenge. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of September.
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months surged to 7.6%, the highest since June 2008, from 7.1% last month. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday that the risk of higher inflation has increased and that it was appropriate to consider wrapping up bond purchases.
""These data provide further evidence that inflation expectations held by the general public are beginning to become unanchored,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic adviser at Brean Capital in New York.
Rising inflation is starting to influence consumers' spending decisions, the Conference Board survey suggested. 
The share of consumers planning to buy a motor vehicle over the next six months was the smallest in the current series. There was a break in the series in November 2010. Motor vehicles are scarce because of a global semiconductor shortage. 
Buying intentions for household appliances like television sets and refrigerators also fell, though intentions to purchase washing machines and clothes dryers rose. Consumers were less inclined to buy a house over the next six months, reflecting a dearth of homes on the market. Slowing demand could help to further cool house price inflation.
A second report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller's 20 metropolitan area home price index rose 19.1% on a year-on-year basis in September after advancing 19.6% in August.

Signs that house price growth was moderating were evident in a third report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency that showed house prices rose 17.7% in the 12 months through September after powering ahead 18.5% in August.
""There is still low availability of for-sale homes, which continues to drive price growth, but the competition has faded and assuaged some of the bidding war intensity,"" said Selma Hepp, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic. ""Overall, home price growth is likely to continue slowing over the next year.""

Asia's third-largest economy has rebounded strongly from last year's deep pandemic-induced slump, boosted by vaccinations and stronger government spending, economists said. But new COVID-19 variants, a global slowdown and rising manufacturing prices all pose risks to growth.
Gross domestic product expanded 8.4% in the September quarter from a year earlier, statistics ministry data showed on Tuesday, in line with 8.4% growth predicted in a Reuters poll and compared with a 20.1% expansion in the previous quarter.
""Data clearly shows that corporate income and profit are above the pre-pandemic level,"" K.V. Subramanian, chief economist at the finance ministry told reporters after the data release. 
He said double-digit growth was expected in the current fiscal year, which ends in April 2022, with growth of 6.5% to 7% predicted for the following fiscal year. 
The International Monetary Fund has forecast 2021 economic growth of 9.5% in India compared to a forecast for China of 8%. 
The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy committee meets on Dec. 6-8. With households increasingly worried about inflation, policymakers are expected to speed up measures to suck up excess liquidity before normalising interest rates. 
""With growth revival and sticky core inflation, we expect RBI to undertake phased withdrawal of liquidity and start raising the policy rates soon,"" said Sujan Hajra, chief economist at Anand Rathi Securities, Mumbai.
Consumer spending - the main driver of the economy - rose 8.6% from a year earlier in July-September following 19.3% growth in previous quarter, Tuesday's data showed. 
Manufacturing expanded 5.5% and farm output rose 4.5% during the three months to September, which bolstered the recovery as lower interest rates lifted consumer spending and investments. 
Investments rose 11% compared with growth of 55.3% in the previous quarter, while state spending jumped 8.7% after contracting nearly 5% in the April-June period.
RISKS TO GROWTH
Modi has rolled back three farm laws aimed at cutting subsidies and attracting investments while putting planned labour reforms on hold as his party faces growing criticism over rising distress among workers during the pandemic. 
Rising prices and falling rural wages risk denting consumer demand, analysts say. Real rural wages have contracted 3% so far in the current fiscal year, according to estimates, leading to declines in two-wheeler and tractor sales.
Supply bottlenecks including chip shortages have also hit production of vehicles and other electronic goods.
The emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant has led health authorities to tighten testing at Indian airports while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ordered a review of plans to ease travel curbs. 

Private economists said the new COVID-19 variant could dampen hopes of recovery in tourism and other services, as only around 32% of the population has been fully vaccinated. 
""We need to watch out for any risks from the Omicron COVID variant and any escalation in supply disruptions due to stricter lockdowns across the globe,"" said Sakshi Gupta, senior economist at HDFC Bank.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Canadian economy roared back in the third quarter, with growth most likely accelerating in October on a manufacturing rebound, though economists were cautious on the looming impact of the Omicron COVID-19 variant.
Canada's economy grew 5.4% in the third quarter on an annualized basis, beating analyst expectations for a gain of 3.0%, Statistics Canada data showed. A preliminary estimate for October showed a gain of 0.8%, while September's GDP was in line with expectations for a 0.1% rise.
Statscan revised down annualized second-quarter GDP to a contraction of 3.2% from a previous dip of 1.1%. But with the October gain, economic activity is now just 0.5% below pre-pandemic levels.
""The October increase was maybe more encouraging for the speed of recovery even than the third quarter numbers,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
""There is a lot of uncertainty right now about how long this can be sustained just given ... the Omicron variant.""
The third-quarter rebound was driven by one of the largest household spending sprees on record, as COVID-19 restrictions were eased and consumers bought everything from clothing to personal grooming services. Exports were also up, led by crude oil.
""We had a pretty strong showing in consumer spending. So that was nice to see after the weakness we had in the second quarter,"" said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Group. 
""But now the question is what's going to happen in fourth quarter,"" he added, pointing to both the emergence of the Omicron variant and flooding in the western province of British Columbia that cut off a key port from the rest of Canada. ""It seems the more we go into the quarter the risk has tilted to the downside.""
Canada has reported five cases of the Omicron variant. The health minister in the province of Quebec warned residents to rethink holiday travel. 

The Bank of Canada last month signaled it could start hiking rates as soon as April 2022, with inflation set to stay above target through much of next year due to supply chain bottlenecks and high energy prices.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.2% lower at 1.2768 to the greenback, or 78.32 U.S. cents. Investors are pricing in a first rate hike in either March or April. [BOCWATCH]

A measure of home prices in 20 U.S. cities jumped 19.1%, down from 19.6% in August and the second straight slowdown, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index showed Tuesday. Nationwide, prices climbed 19.5%, which was also down from a month earlier.
While values are still soaring, the cooldown comes more than a year after the pandemic sparked intense competition for a tight supply of listings across the country. Fewer families generally shop for homes after the start of the school year, and September’s jump in mortgage rates curbed buyers’ ability to bid up prices.
More owners are expected to list their properties for sale in the coming months, which would help ease the inventory shortage. But demand remains intense, signaling that meaningful relief from price gains may be a ways off.
A measure of contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes jumped to a 10-month high in October, the National Association of Realtors reported Monday. Completed purchases are on track to exceed 6 million in 2021, the most in 15 years, the group said.

107,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 05:12AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation soared to its highest rate on record this month on surging energy costs, likely peaking before a slow decline that will keep it uncomfortably high for much of the next year, data from Eurostat showed on Tuesday. 
Consumer price growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 4.9% in November, by far the highest level in the 25 years since the figure has been compiled, up from 4.1% a month earlier and well ahead of expectations for 4.5%. 
Energy prices were up 27% compared with a year earlier as oil prices soared but inflation in services and non-energy industrial goods, a drag on price growth in past years, were both above 2%, suggesting a rapid rise in underlying price pressures. 
Although inflation is now more than twice the European Central Bank's 2% target, it is unlikely to trigger any policy action, even if the data make for uncomfortable reading and could trigger political pressure on the ECB to rein in price growth.
The ECB has long argued that the inflation surge is temporary, caused by a range of one-off factors, and will subside over time so policy action now would be counterproductive as it would thwart economic growth just when inflation eases on their own.
While some policymakers have warned that high inflation, even if temporary, could trigger a surge in wages, ECB President Christine Lagarde and chief economist Philip Lane have dismissed this argument, saying that wage growth remains anaemic and there is no sign that firms are permanently altering their remuneration behaviour.
Indeed, the ECB has promised continued stimulus with bond buys and record low rates throughout 2022, even as a long list of central banks around the world are already tightening policy. 
The potential headache is that inflation will now take months to drop and could stay above the ECB's target until the second half of 2022, a communication challenge for a bank that has struggled with low inflation for a decade and has little experience with price growth above its target.
Underlying prices, a key focus for policymakers as they exclude volatile food and energy prices, also surged. 
Inflation excluding food and fuel prices and a narrower measure that also excludes alcohol and tobacco products, both rose to 2.6%, well ahead of expectations for 2.3%. 

Although both of those figures were high, Lane has dismissed these readings in the recent weeks, arguing that they are skewed by post-pandemic factors and so are not accurate gauges of actual underlying price growth.

Consumer prices rose 0.4% from last month, giving a 12-month inflation rate of 3.4%, the highest since September 2008, INSEE said.
The result slightly exceeded a Reuters poll of 17 economists' expectations which had an average forecast for inflation to remain unchanged this month at 3.2%.
Following a broader global trend, the November increase was almost exclusively driven by surging energy prices, which were up 21.6% over one year.

Separately, INSEE reported that consumer spending fell 0.4% in October from September due to a 1.8% drop in spending on manufactured goods. Economists had expected spending to remain unchanged on average.
INSEE said that consumer spending was 1.8% below pre-crisis levels seen at the end of 2019.

The Federal Statistics Office said agreed wages of unionised employees rose by an average of 0.9% year-on-year from July to September. This was the smallest increase recorded since the office began compiling the data in 2010.
Central bankers and policy makers are watching the development of wages in the euro zone very closely. They are looking for any hints as to whether rising consumer prices lead to higher wages which could mark the start of a wage price spiral and lead to higher inflation also in the medium term.
Tuesday's figure includes the agreed basic remuneration and the extra payments provided for in-wage settlements, such as one-off payments, annual extra payments or agreed back payments.
Excluding special effects related to extra payments in the car industry, negotiated wages rose by 1.3% on the year.
As consumer prices rose by 3.9% in the three months, workers suffered an actual decline in real wages in the third quarter, the office added.
The weak wage data comes after unions on Monday secured a 2.8% wage increase for more than a million public sector workers at the federal state level, a deal analysts said was too modest to kick off a wage-price spiral in Germany.

The decline in real wages bodes ill for future household spending which was the sole driver of German gross domestic product growth in the third quarter in light of supply bottlenecks and production problems in the industrial sector.
Chancellor-in-waiting Olaf Scholz, from the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), has said his three-way ruling coalition with the Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) will raise the national minimum wage by around 25% to 12 euros an hour next year.

Investing.com – China recorded a surprise growth in factory activity in November, the first in three months, as a surge in raw material prices and power rationing both eased.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was at 50.1 in November, higher than the 49.6 figure in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 49.2 figure.
The non-manufacturing PMI was at 52.3, higher than the previous month’s 52.4 figure. Both indexes were above the 50-mark indicating growth.
""A series of recently introduced policies and measures to ensure energy supply and stabilize market prices has been proven to be effective,"" NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe told Reuters.
""Power rationing eased somewhat in November while prices for some raw materials dropped significantly, driving an expansion in manufacturing PMI.""
However, the manufacturing PMI could stay near the 50-mark for the months to come, due to constraining factors such as power curbs, high raw material prices, and weaker consumption, Hwabao Trust economist Nie Wen told Reuters.
New restrictions on manufacturing in northern China are already in place due to the Beijing Winter Olympics, due to take place in February 2022.
In the services sectors, the latest lockdown measures due to COVID-19 outbreaks have weighed on services activity, but an uptick in construction has improved sentiment.
As China’s economic recovery from COVID-19 continues to slow down, the GDP is set to slow down further in the fourth quarter of 2021. Premier Li Keqiang has acknowledged that the economy faces new downward pressures but added that authorities should avoid ""aggressive"" one-size-fits-all policy responses.
Investors now await the Caixin manufacturing and services PMIs, due later in the week."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy got a much-needed boost from strong exports and government stimulus spending in the third quarter which should have at least tempered the huge hit to activity from coronavirus lockdowns.
While gross domestic product (GDP) still likely suffered its second largest contraction on record last quarter, a timely 1.7 percentage point contribution from trade and public spending will soothe some of the pain.
The GDP report is due on Wednesday and is forecast to show a drop of 2.7%, a contraction only surpassed by the 7.0% plunge that followed the start of the pandemic last year.
The drop is again due to the virus, which closed the states of New South Wales and Victoria for much of the quarter and hammered consumer spending.
Fortunately for the economy, the government stepped in with emergency aid which saw total public spending add A$3.5 billion ($2.50 billion), or 0.7 percentage points, to GDP.
Australia also benefited from strength in resource exports and a fall in import volumes which saw real net exports add 1.0 percentage points to GDP in the quarter.
The country's current account surplus climbed to a record A$23.9 billion in the quarter led by an 8% jump in exports.
The surplus would have been even larger but Australian firms, particularly miners, paid out a lot more in dividends to foreign investors after a bumper earnings season.
In any case, a rapid economic recovery is already underway as world-beating levels of vaccination have allowed most restrictions to be lifted, unleashing a wave of pent-up demand.
Retail sales surged a huge 4.9% in October as shops reopened, a splurge that banks say continued in November. CBA reported spending on its cards for the week to Nov. 26 was 24% higher than in the same week of 2019 before the pandemic hit.
The labour market has also been surprisingly resilient with payrolls rebounding to above pre-lockdown levels in October, well ahead of expectations.
The emergence of the Omicron variant is a potential threat, with the government delaying the opening of international borders by two weeks, though stay-at-home rules are unlikely as 87% of the adult population is fully vaccinated.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.1 in November from 49.2 in October, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Tuesday.
The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction. Analysts had expected it to come in at 49.6.
The world's second-largest economy, which staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic slump, has lost momentum in the second half of this year as it grapples with slowing manufacturing, debt problems in the property market and COVID-19 outbreaks.
Analysts expect the slowdown in gross domestic product (GDP)seen in the third-quarter to continue in the fourth with demand expected to remain soft.
""A series of recently introduced policies and measures to ensure energy supply and stabilise market prices has been proven to be effective,"" said Zhao Qinghe, senior statistician at the NBS.
""Power rationing eased somewhat in November while prices for some raw materials dropped significantly, driving an expansion in manufacturing PMI.""
Reflecting the positive headline PMI, a subindex for production rose to 52.0 in November from 48.4 in October while new orders fell at a slower pace, although November marked the fourth straight month of declines in customer demand.
TEMPORARY REPRIEVE
There were also signs of relief elsewhere in Asia with Japanese factory output rising for the first time in four months in October as facilities in other parts of the region resumed operations after COVID-19 closures.
The supply resumption helped cool the prices of crucial production materials.
A sub-index for input prices in the Chinese PMI stood at 52.9 in November, down significantly from 72.1 in the previous month, pointing to easing cost pressures.
That drove prices charged lower, falling for the first time since May 2020.
Despite the improvement, Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust, said he expects the manufacturing PMI to hover around 50 for the months to come, due to constraining factors such as power curbs, high raw material prices and weaker consumption. 
Analysts also warn that there could be new restrictions on manufacturing in northern China due to the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics while the impact from new COVID-19 strain Omicron on China's economy remains to be seen.
Factory gate inflation hit a 26-year high in October, further squeezing profit margins for producers and heightening stagflation concerns. As a result, policy sources say China's central bank will likely move cautiously on loosening monetary policy to bolster the economy.
Premier Li Keqiang last week acknowledged that China's economy faces new downward pressures but said authorities should avoid ""aggressive"" one-size-fits-all policy responses.
In contrast to the uptick in the factory sector, growth in the services sector slowed slightly with the official non-manufacturing PMI in November easing to 52.3 from 52.4 in October.
Fresh lockdown measures as China raced to contain the latest COVID-19 outbreak have weighed on services activity, which has been otherwise propped up by brisk construction.

The construction activity subindex rose to 59.1 in November from 56.9. 
China's official October composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, stood at 52.2, up from October's 50.8.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's industrial output rose in October for the first time in four months as re-opening of Asian factories eased supply constraints for automakers, offering some hope for the export-reliant economy as it struggles to mount a solid recovery.
The increase was smaller than market expectations, underscoring the lingering impact of global supply chain disruptions. Analysts, however, see signs of an improving outlook.
""Weak outputs among automakers have put a lid on Japan's overall production for the past three months, but the situation is easing,"" Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Factory output grew 1.1% from the previous month in October, government data showed on Wednesday, marking the first increase since June. It compared with a 1.8% gain forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and followed a 5.4% decline in the previous month.
Auto production rose 15.4% month-on-month in October for its first increase in four months thanks to the waning impact of parts shortages in Asia, a Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) official told a briefing. 
Carmakers offset shrinking production in sectors such as chemical, steel and electronic components and devices.
The outlook suggested some stabilisation was in store, with manufacturers surveyed by the government expecting output to jump 9.0% in November, led by a 35.8% surge among automakers, followed by a 2.1% gain in December, the data showed.
Automakers - which account for 15% of Japan's industrial output, according to METI - including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Honda Motor Co announced earlier this month their plans to return to normal production in December.
""While other sectors' production predictions seem optimistic, carmakers output plans are reliably solid,"" Minami said, attributing it to the automakers' lean production processes that affect a wide variety of parts suppliers. 
Still, he believes it will likely take until early 2022 for companies to make up the multi-month production losses.
Manufacturers' plans reflect eased impacts of chip and parts shortages, a government official said, though he warned of risks in firms' supply chains, including any fallout associated with COVID-19's Omicron variant.
Separate data on Tuesday showed Japan's jobless rate stood at 2.7% in October, down from the previous month's 2.8% to the lowest level since March, while an index gauging job availability fell to 1.15 from 1.16 in September.
After a contraction in July-September, economists polled by Reuters expect the world's third-largest economy to rebound an annualised 5.1% in the current quarter thanks to an uptick in consumption, as the pandemic-induced state of emergency curbs have been lifted.
The Bank of Japan's Dec. 16-17 rate-review is set to see no change in its ultra-easy policy but it may decide whether to extend pandemic-relief lending programmes beyond the current March 2022 deadline.

""In summer 2020, a rapid rebound amid automakers after a dip contributed to the overall industrial output growth,"" said Minami. 
""If the scene successfully replays, then Japan's output can return to an upward trend with the make-up production plans toward next year.""

114,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 09:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s factory production edged up in October, ending a three-month slide and adding to signs that the global supply chain crunch may have been easing before the emergence of the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
Higher output of cars and factory equipment lifted overall production 1.1% from September, the economy ministry reported Tuesday. Manufacturers said they plan to boost output again this month and next, a good sign for Japan’s recovery this quarter. Analysts had expected a 1.9% increase in October. 
A separate report showed continued resilience in the labor market, with the unemployment rate ticking down to 2.7% and a measure of demand for workers showing positions on offer still outnumbering job seekers. 
While Japan’s manufacturing gains and positive production forecasts offer more evidence that Asia’s supply chain shortages may be easing, the omicron variant of the coronavirus has reignited fears that a worst-case scenario could necessitate a return to growth-crippling lockdowns. 
Japan on Tuesday closed its borders to new foreign arrivals, a move coming only weeks after the country managed to loosen restrictions amid plummeting case counts. 
“If omicron is found within Japan and triggers more restrictions, it could shift the recovery trajectory, but so far that doesn’t seem to be happening,” said economist Atsushi Takeda at Itochu Research Institute. “September appears to have been the bottom for production.”
Economists Game Out How Omicron Will Hurt the Global Recovery
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Monday said he expects Japan’s economy to return to growth in coming months, signaling that the emergence of omicron hadn’t changed his outlook much. Analysts have been forecasting Japan’s recovery to resume this quarter, now that restrictions on the service sector have mostly been lifted and the vaccination rate is above 75%. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...     
“We expect production to accelerate in November, spurred by a gradual recovery in factory operating rates as a drop in virus cases in Asean starts to ease supply chain problems. Still, shortages of chips may remain a drag. China’s slowdown is also likely to continue weighing on exports and production.”
--Yuki Masujima, economist

October’s production gain came as parts shortages from Asia began to ease and car output increased for the first time in four months, a ministry official said. 
Reports from  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. show the group raised domestic output by about 22% last month, although the automaker’s global output is still down by more than a quarter from 2020’s level. 
Manufacturers surveyed in Tuesday’s report said they plan to increase output 9% this month and another 2.1% in December, but the reported plans tend to be overly optimistic and the survey was taken before omicron was discovered.
Semiconductor supplies also continue to be a problem. Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co. President Makoto Uchida, in an interview with Bloomberg Television this week, said the company had expected to recover from the shortages in the second half of the fiscal year, but he’s less optimistic now. The firm this month cut its sales plan for the current year by 600,000 units due to continuing parts shortages.

115,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 08:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory sentiment improved in November as the impact of a power crunch subsided and inflation pressures eased. 
The official manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 50.1, the first time in three months it exceeded the 50 mark that signals an expansion in production. The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, fell slightly to 52.3. Both measures beat economists’ expectations.
November usually sees a seasonal rebound as there are more working days compared to October when China closes for a week-long national holiday. Energy shortages, which ravaged factory production in September and October, also eased during the month as coal producers boosted output and inventories rose.
“The data signal a stabilization of the current slowdown,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd. The construction sub-index increased to 59.1 from 56.9, which suggests “activity seems to be reactivated, thanks to government relaxation measures supporting property projects,” he said.
Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics, said recent measures to strengthen energy supply and stabilize prices took some effect. Export orders also improved, mainly due to global economic recovery and the approaching of holiday season overseas, Zhao said.
The economy continues to be undermined by a housing market crisis and frequent Covid-19 outbreaks, which are weighing on next year’s outlook. Several economists expect growth to slow to under 5% in 2022, with more fiscal and monetary support likely to follow. 
China Faces More Growth Risks, Increased Policy Support in 2022
Policy makers are trying to moderate the sharp downturn in the property market, while providing targeted support to areas such as small businesses and green technology. More clues on policy action will likely come next month, when the Communist Party holds its Central Economic Work Conference.
A set of early indicators showed China’s economy continued to slow in November with car and homes sales dropping again as the housing market crisis dragged on. Strong export demand ahead of the year-end holiday season partly helped offset the property slump.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's factory output in October shrank at its sharpest pace in nearly 1-1/2 years, government data showed on Tuesday, as global chip shortages continued to weigh on car production.
Industrial output last month unexpectedly fell by a seasonally adjusted 3.0% month-on-month, Statistics Korea data showed, following a 1.1% decline in September and logging the biggest decline since May 2020.
That also missed the 0.4% growth tipped in a Reuters poll of analysts, by a large margin.
""Continued global supply chain disruption is one main factor behind the sluggish data,"" Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said, referring to the auto chip shortage.
A breakdown of data showed production of cars shrank 5.1%, while that of primary metal fell 5.9%.
""We expect better data in November, reflecting strong exports and a recovery in domestic demand and as the impact from high base fades,"" Hong said.
On an annual basis, output grew 4.5%, sharply rebounding from a 1.8% contraction in September and beating 3.0% growth forecast in the poll.
Car production contracted 13.5% year-on-year, but that was offset by 38.7% growth in semiconductors output.

The global spread of Omicron coronavirus variant may further risk production going forward, with many countries closing their borders to prevent fresh outbreaks.
Meanwhile, Tuesday's data also showed service sector output last month shrank 0.3% month-on-month, while retail sales grew 0.2%.

117,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 07:10PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Costs are rising at the fastest rate in over 20 years for firms in Britain's services sector, according to a business survey released on Tuesday which shows why the Bank of England may soon raise interest rates.
The Confederation of British Industry said its quarterly survey of the services sector showed the quickest growth in costs for both business and consumer services companies since the survey began in 1998.
Separate data from Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank showed a record 50% of businesses plan to raise prices and a quarter of them expect to raise pay by 3% or more over the next 12 months.
""Record growth in costs is threatening to put a winter freeze on the service sector recovery next quarter,"" CBI economist Charlotte Dendy said.
Both surveys took place in the first half of November, before news of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 dented the confidence of financial market investors who now see a roughly 60% chance that the BoE will raise rates in December.
British consumer price inflation hit a 10-year high of 4.2% in October and the BoE expects it to reach nearly 5% next year.
In the short run, higher interest rates will not reduce pressure from a global surge in energy prices and supply chain difficulties. But they may reduce knock-on effects that would come if companies increase prices, and workers ask for higher pay, in anticipation of permanently higher inflation.
Tuesday's CBI data showed businesses already think they will be unable to pass on higher costs in full. Although average selling prices are expected to rise by a record amount, profit growth is expected to stall over the coming three months for services firms, due to the rise in costs.

The CBI reported the fastest hiring since 2015 by business and professional services companies.
Data from recruitment website Indeed, also released on Tuesday, showed vets, optometrists, auditors, animators and truck technicians were the roles that their customers were finding it hardest to fill.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German consumer price inflation rose further in November to hit another record high, preliminary data showed on Monday, increasing pressure on the European Central Bank to react.
Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose 6.0% year-on-year following an increase of 4.6% in October, the Federal Statistics Office said.
The reading was the highest rate recorded since January 1997, when the EU-harmonised series began.
The national consumer price index (CPI) rose by 5.2% year-on-year, which was the highest rate since June 1992.
ECB board member Isabel Schnabel told ZDF television the rise did not come as a surprise to the central bank although its earlier forecasts had not predicted such a strong one.
Schnabel said the central bank believes inflation peaked in November, meaning it would be premature to raise rates as price increases look likely to slow gradually next year.
Preliminary euro zone inflation data due on Tuesday is expected to show a rise to 4.5% in November from 4.1% in the previous month.
The ECB targets an inflation rate of 2%.
DOWNWARD TREND COMING?
The recent surge in inflation is caused by a mix of several factors, including base effects, higher energy prices, a pandemic-related temporary VAT rate in the previous year and material shortages in the course of the recovery.
""Although inflation rates will remain at a relatively high level in the coming months, a downward trend should be discernible,"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
""If there are no second-round effects, the ECB target of 2% should already be reached again by mid-2022,"" Gitzel said, adding that the ECB would react calmly to the latest data.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Joerg Kraemer was more alarmed by the fresh figures, calling it a worrying sign that seasonally adjusted consumer prices rose unusually strongly on the month.
""In addition, prices are now increasing on a broader front, it is no longer just about energy and some goods particularly affected by the coronavirus pandemic,"" Kraemer added.

While he agreed that inflation was likely to fall again after the turn of the year due to some special factors, Kraemer said there was too much money circulating in the euro zone because of high budget deficits and the ECB's bond purchases.
""The ECB should take its foot off the accelerator, stop its bond purchases and end the negative interest rate policy,"" Kraemer said.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's inflation in November is forecast to have stepped up a gear compared to the previous month as supply chain issues weigh on local and international prices, an effect forecast to roll into next year, a Reuters' poll revealed on Monday. 
According to a median estimate of 16 analysts, consumer price growth in November is forecast at 0.20%, up from 0.01% in October. Consumer prices contracted 0.15% in the same month in 2020.
Analysts' forecasts fluctuated between 0.06% and 0.35%.
If inflation rises in line with the median forecast, November's 12-month consumer price growth will hit 4.94%. 
The biggest pressure on inflation is expected to come from food prices, which in turn would impact the hospitality and hotel sectors, while transport and housing will also weigh on consumer prices, the analysts forecast. 
A second sales-tax (VAT) free day took place in Colombia during November, which is expected to result in inflation in the telecommunications and fashion sectors falling, according to Itau bank economist David Cubides.
Analysts now expect inflation to hit 4.90%, down from a forecast of 4.97% last month, but still far beyond the central bank's 3% target. 
Consumer prices are expected to grow 3.80% during 2022, up from a forecast of 3.50% in October's poll. 
The central bank previously extended its 3% inflation target to 2022, with a range of between 2% and 4%, as prices rise amid greater-than-expected economic growth. 
Colombia's monetary policy authority has begun a cycle of raising interest rates to combat growing inflation, increasing its benchmark rate by 25 basis points in September and 50 basis points in October, taking the current rate to 2.50%.

Analysts forecast the bank could hike the interest rate to 4.50% by the close of next year.
The government will publish November's inflation data on Saturday, Dec. 4.

The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Monday that its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, rose 7.5% last month to 125.2. Pending home sales increased in all four regions.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts, which become sales after a month or two, would rise 0.9% in October. Pending home sales declined 1.4% in October on a year-on-year basis. Limited inventory has led to double-digit growth in home prices.
""Motivated by fast-rising rents and the anticipated increase in mortgage rates, consumers that are on strong financial footing are signing contracts to purchase a home sooner rather than later,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.
Demand for housing shot up early in the coronavirus pandemic as Americans decamped from city centers to suburbs and other, less densely populated areas in a hunt for larger homes to accommodate online schooling and working from home.

The buying spree has cooled somewhat as workers return to offices, and schools reopened for in-person learning, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations.
But total existing home sales for 2021 are now set to top six million, which would be the most in 15 years, NAR also reported.

The rate accelerated from October's 5.4% to reach its highest level since September 1992's 5.8%. Inflation has been rising across the euro zone in recent months, with Spain particularly hard hit.
Rising food costs were the main driver, followed by vehicle fuels and lubricants. However, a months-long acceleration in electricity costs reversed in November, according to the INE.
On a EU-harmonised basis, Spanish inflation also rose by 5.6% in November, up from 5.4% in October, the INE data showed.

Core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices and is used by central banks as a monetary policy determinant, rose to 1.7%, its highest since July 2013.
The European Central Bank believes euro zone inflation will have peaked in November and is set to gradually slow next year as supply bottlenecks and the energy crunch ease, according to board member Isabel Schnabel.

122,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 08:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) --
German inflation surged more than expected in November, complicating the European Central Bank’s mission to convince consumers that the current spike will soon ease.
Prices increased an annual 6% under a European-Union harmonized measure. A national gauge rose to 5.2%, the highest since 1992. 
German bonds extend declines slightly, pushing the 10-year yield four basis points higher to minus 0.30%.
Earlier on Monday, Spain reported a rate of 5.6% that was bolstered by more expensive food. Prices in Belgium jumped 5.6%. Data for the euro area due Tuesday are set to show a 4.5% gain.
Inflation rates far exceeding the ECB’s 2% goal across vast parts of the region have prompted officials including President Christine Lagarde to reassure citizens that price pressures won’t run out of control. A large portion, they argue, is due to temporary factors that will fade with time.
Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel attempted to assuage concerns in Germany this morning, explaining in a TV interview that “November will prove to be the peak.” 
The Bundesbank warned last week that inflation could climb to just under 6% this month, and attributed about 1 1/2 percentage points to a temporary cut in value-added tax and very low prices for travel-related services in 2020.
While the central bank predicts price pressures will retreat in coming months, it said inflation could remain well above 3% for a longer period of time.
Price Spiral
Employees of Germany’s federal states won a 2.8% raise and a tax-free one-time payment of 1,300 euros ($1,467.1) on Monday, in a deal that will ultimately cover nearly 3.5 million people. Meanwhile, Olaf Scholz’s new government is planning to lift the country’s minimum wage to 12 euros toward the end of next year. 
Both could have consequences that might be difficult to ignore. One reason officials have been able to classify the current inflation spike as “temporary” is that secondary effects have failed to materialize so far. 
Schnabel, a contender to succeed Jens Weidmann at the helm of the Bundesbank when he leaves at the end of the year, told Bloomberg last week that inflation risks are “skewed to the upside.” It’s a signal she might push for a faster than currently anticipated reduction in monetary stimulus when the ECB gathers in December.
Both the Council of Economic Advisers and Germany’s national tabloid Bild have issued warnings on ultra-loose monetary policy.
The ECB is set to determine next month whether its pandemic bond-buying program will end in March as planned, and how an older asset-purchase plan might need to be adjusted to address lingering uncertainty. The emergence of the new Omicron coronavirus strain risks new containment measures after the Netherlands and Germany already imposed new curbs and Austria and Slovakia went into lockdown.

A Reuters poll of analysts points to an overall CPI increase of 5% for Germany in November, which would be the highest rate since September 1992.

The EU-harmonized inflation figure (HICP) is projected to hit 5.5%. This would be the highest reading recorded since the EU-harmonised series began in 1997.
ECB board member Isabel Schnabel told ZDF television on Monday that the central bank believes inflation peaked in November, meaning it would be premature to raise rates as price increases look likely to slow gradually next year.

""There is no sign of the hoped-for relief,"" said Klaus Wohlrabe, director of the Munich-based institute, warning that the constraints would feed through into prices.
""Never have so many companies said they plan to raise prices,"" Wohlrabe added. 

The Munich-based institute said its survey of German companies had found sharper supply constraints in all sectors except the electrical equipment sector, where the share of firms reporting problems slipped from 90% to 85%.
It remained one of the most severely affected sectors, along with the machine building sector, where 86% reported problems, and the auto sector, where 88% had problems. The sector least affected was drinks manufacturing, where only 40% reported bottlenecks.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is expected to rise to 49.6 in November, up from 49.2 in October, according to the median forecast of 29 economists polled by Reuters on Monday. A reading below 50 indicates contraction from the previous month.
Analysts have attributed the shallower contraction to the post-holiday uptick in production and the easing power cuts across most parts of the nation, although factors such as high raw material prices, a slowdown in the property sector and supply shortages continue to hamper the post-COVID recovery.
""We expect the NBS manufacturing PMI to stay in contraction territory at 49.6 in November versus 49.2 previously, as evidenced by still weak heavy industry manufacturing operation rates,"" said Jian Chang, chief China economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), in a note on Friday.
The world's second-largest economy, which staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic slump, has lost momentum since the second half as it grapples with a slowing manufacturing sector, debt problems in the property market and COVID-19 outbreaks. Analysts expect a further slowdown in fourth quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
Power cuts have eased after policymakers moved to crack down on record-high coal prices. The State Grid Corporation said on Nov. 7 that power rationing has ended in most parts of the nation, except for temporary curbs on high-emission industries in some provinces.
Premier Li Keqiang last week acknowledged that China's economy faces new downward pressures but said authorities should avoid an ""aggressive"" one-size-fits-all approach.
China's central bank will likely move cautiously on loosening monetary policy to bolster the economy, as slowing economic growth and soaring factory inflation fuel concerns over stagflation, policy sources said.
Factory gate inflation hit a 26-year high in October, further squeezing profit margins for producers and heightening stagflation concerns.

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector, will be released on Tuesday.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Wednesday. Analysts expect the headline reading will edge down slightly to 50.5 from 50.6 the previous month.

The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index is forecast to improve slightly to 49.7 from 49.2 in October when it’s released Tuesday, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. That would be the third month it stays below the key 50-mark, indicating a contraction in production. 
The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, is forecast to fall to 51.5 from 52.4 in the previous month. 
China’s energy shortages, which ravaged factory production in September and October, likely eased this month as coal producers boosted output and inventories rose. However, the housing market crisis shows no signs of ending, and frequent Covid-19 outbreaks continue to curb consumption.
“Supply-side restrictions have improved marginally, so production likely rebounded somewhat,” said Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd. But there’s “not much positive signal on domestic demand,” which continued to weigh on activities, he said.
Economic growth is forecast to slow to 5.3% next year, according to a Bloomberg survey median, with some economists seeing expansion as low as 4%. Bloomberg Economics forecast growth will come in at 5.7%, as the government will likely target a 5-6% range.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“In 2021, policy played a secondary role in setting the growth trajectory. In 2022, it will be pivotal. The extent of the slowdown will hinge largely on what balance China strikes between supporting short-term growth and advancing long-term reforms.
...We see the People’s Bank of China cutting the interest rate on its one-year medium-term lending facility by 20 basis points and the reserve requirement ratio by 100-150 bps by end-2022.”

Authorities are trying to moderate the sharp downturn in the property market, while providing targeted support to areas such as small businesses and green technology. Officials will reveal more clues on how much policy easing they plan to provide during two key political meetings in December by the Politburo and the Central Economic Work Conference.
China will adopt a more proactive macroeconomic policy next year to respond to the challenges from an uneven recovery of the global economy and instability in containing the pandemic, the Securities Times, run by the People’s Daily, said in a front-page commentary Monday. 
Authorities have exercised restraint in using monetary and fiscal tools amid an economic slowdown this year, thus creating sufficient space for policy maneuvering next year, according to the commentary.
The slowdown is being cushioned by strong export demand, which likely remained solid in November, judging by latest shipment figures from South Korea.
Consumption and travel continues to be affected by a resurgence in virus cases and the country’s growing determination to stick to its strict Covid Zero strategy. Subway passenger traffic in six major cities of China declined less than 10% in November from October, though the plunge is smaller than that over the August outbreak, according to Xing.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales rose for the first time in three months in October, though less than expected, and the underlying private consumption trend pointed to persistent strains on a fragile economic recovery despite an easing of COVID-19 curbs.
Following a larger-than-expected contraction in July-September, analysts expect the world's third-largest economy to rebound this quarter thanks to an upturn in household spending, while supply-side concerns still loom for export-reliant businesses.
""However, as people are still wary of another virus wave, they're not going out and spending actively,"" said Masato Koike, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, adding that stagnant wage growth is an additional headwind to fostering solid consumption growth.
Retail sales rose 0.9% in October from a year earlier, government data showed on Monday, versus the median market forecast for a 1.1% increase. It followed an upwardly revised 0.5% drop in September.
A 25.9% surge in fuel sales due to rising petroleum product prices boosted the headline retail figure, while sales of goods other than fuel fell 1.2% year-on-year. Worryingly, car sales were down 19.5% from a year earlier, the biggest monthly drop since January 2011, dragged down by supply constraints, according to a government official.
Compared with the previous month, retail sales grew 1.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis in October, following an upwardly revised 2.8% gain in September.
Japan has eased coronavirus restrictions on restaurant hours, large-scale events and border controls as infections have fallen dramatically and more than three-fourths of its population is fully vaccinated.
Private-sector statistics, however, had shown the comeback of consumer spending was gradual in October, and analysts said a full recovery in sectors hit hard by the pandemic such as face-to-face services will take longer time.

""Indeed, there are signs that consumers are finally shedding their caution as mobility only started to surpass its 2020 level in November,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics. ""Spending on services should finally start to recover in earnest now.""
To boost Japan's lukewarm economic recovery, the government earlier this month announced a record $490 billion stimulus package, including cash payouts to households with children and subsidies to COVID-hit businesses.

""However, the consequences of the dramatic worsening of the coronavirus crisis have hit the retail trade in the past week,"" he added. 
Controls in shops, such as checks of vaccination certificates, were putting customers off, said Genth, adding he wanted fewer restrictions in shops as masks and air filters were effective.
Earlier this month, the HDE said it expected Christmas sales to rise 2% from last year to 111.7 billion euros.

Profits in October rose 24.6% from a year earlier to 818.7 billion yuan ($128.1 billion), the official data showed, quickening from a 16.3% gain reported in September.
For the January-October period, industrial firms' profits rose 42.2% year-on-year to 7.2 trillion yuan, slower than a 44.7% rise in the first nine months of 2021.
The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenues of over 20 million yuan from their main operations.
Government efforts to ensure supply and stabilize prices helped companies mitigate difficulties, which in turned helped improve production conditions and profits, said Zhu Hong a senior statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics.
However, he said profit differentiation between upstream and downstream industries had not significantly improved, with downstream industries still facing pressures on their profitability. 
Prices in China have surged amid a power crunch and Beijing has been trying to cool a red-hot market for coal, the country's main fuel for power generation.
However, an official from China's state planner said last Sunday that ""energy prices including, coal prices have fallen significantly"" and have pushed down prices for steel, aluminium, pulp, PVC and coal chemical products.
The world's second-largest economy staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic slump, but has since lost momentum as it grapples with a slowing manufacturing sector, debt problems in the property market and COVID-19 outbreaks.
China's industrial output grew faster than expected in October but remained the second lowest print this year.
On Friday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information (MIIT) Technology held a meeting with representatives from industry associations and companies including Aluminium Corp of China and China Minmetals Corp to discuss issues in the raw materials industry, it said in a Saturday statement https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5OTUwMTc2OA%3D%3D&chksm=bcceef758bb96663e8cba531059c8e1213df7038f152d88160993661a7aed8e0bf8d8adc1588&idx=1∣=2650850770&sn=6ad1c65239e97b019f1d62b58fe7f9cd#rd on its official WeChat account.

ZURICH (Reuters) -The Swiss economy grew by a weaker-than-expected 1.7% during the third quarter, the government said on Friday, as it braces for a further downturn from the widening COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing supply chain shortages.
Growth between July and September, before the recent surge in coronavirus cases, decelerated from the 1.8% increase during the second quarter, and was below the 2.0% estimate in a Refinitiv forecast. [S8N2NQ00T]
A worsening situation at home, increased restrictions abroad and the difficulty for companies to get parts and raw materials because of jammed supply chains, means economic development is likely to decelerate further during the fourth quarter.
The catch-up effect from previous months is also starting to fade, said Ronald Indergand, an economist at the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), which released the figures on Friday.
""There are significant headwinds, particularly related to the pandemic development in other countries which have triggered new lockdowns and also if Switzerland would substantially tighten its own restrictions,"" Indergand told Reuters.
Earlier this week, the government decided to hold off on new national restrictions, instead appealing to common sense and local measures to stem the rise in cases. 
So far, the Swiss economy had recovered relatively well, with GDP now 1% higher in the third quarter than in fourth quarter of 2019, SECO said.
The government agency is due to give its latest forecasts for 2021, 2022 and 2023 on Dec. 9. Previously it has forecast economic growth of 3.2% for 2021 and 3.4% in 2022.

Big risks remain, particularly related to the pandemic, Indergand said. Supply chain problems are expected to weigh for a few more quarters.
""We think the recovery is going to continue in 2022, but it's going to be bumpy,"" said Indergand. ""Up to this current moment, I don’t think we have to revise our forecast down massively, but the risk is clearly downward for 2022.""

The prices eased 0.9% in October from September, compared to a revised 0.03% fall in September. 
Home prices had risen for eight months before that to hit historical highs, levels that were last seen in May 2019 before the pandemic and anti-government mass protests in the city. 
Property agents said buyers turned more cautious before the policy address delivered in October, worried that some drastic housing policy would be introduced to curb the sky-high property prices. 
But after little substantial was announced, buyers became active again, with transaction volume in November increasing up to 40%, they added. 
At the centre of plans to tackle the city's housing shortage announced by leader Carrie Lam last month was a long-term goal to build a Northern Metropolis on the border with the mainland's technology hub of Shenzhen, covering 300 square kilometres.
""Afterall, supply is still limited in Hong Kong, and the economic and employment recovery has helped to support the property market,"" said Derek Chan, head of research at realtor Ricacorp.

He expected November home prices would be flat or post a small gain, and the gain may extend in December if the border with mainland China reopens. 
Investors have been envisioning a much delayed reopen of border will boost local economy and property demand. Local media reported the reopening could likely to come in early December but the Hong Kong government has not given a precise timing.

Sales surged 4.9% in October from a month earlier, when they rose 1.3%, and more than doubled economists’ forecast of a 2.2% gain, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed Friday. That was the biggest rise since November 2020.
“Australians coming out of lockdown have well and truly hit the pavement, ditching the loungewear, refreshing their wardrobe and heading out to enjoy cafes and restaurants,” said Jo Masters, chief economist at Ernst & Young LLP. The result “is yet another sign that the economy is roaring back,” she said.
 
Strong consumer spending, together with high job vacancies and firms boosting investment intentions help explain why markets believe the Reserve Bank’s first interest-rate increase is only a matter of months away. Traders are pricing in an initial 15 basis-point hike to take the cash rate to 0.25% in May and then at least two more quarter-point increases over the rest of 2022.
The central bank is also optimistic about the outlook for the A$2 trillion ($1.4 trillion) economy, predicting a brisk 5.5% expansion next year. But it sees price pressures taking longer to build, with core inflation only expected to reach the 2.5% midpoint of the RBA’s target in late-2023. 
That’s a key reason why Governor Philip Lowe has repeatedly dismissed aggressive market pricing and signaled the tightening cycle is only likely to begin in about two years’ time.
“It looks like a sharp rebound is unfolding in the fourth quarter,”  said Andrew Ticehurst, a rates strategist at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. in Sydney. He reiterated his view that the RBA’s first rate hike will come in November 2022, while bringing forward his expectation on the timing of the central bank ending quantitative easing to May from August previously.
The RBA will review its bond buying program -- currently running at A$4 billion a week -- at its Feb. 1 meeting. 
Some economists see the potential for the bank to scrap the program altogether in February, particularly with the Federal Reserve expected to begin scaling back its asset purchases at a faster pace as it contends with escalating U.S. inflation.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales rebounded with a bang in October as the lifting of many stay-at-home restrictions unleashed a wave of pent-up shopping, further evidence the economy is recovering rapidly from a pandemic-induced slump.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Friday showed retail sales jumped 4.9% in October to A$31.1 billion ($22.31 billion), extending September's already strong 1.7% bounce.
That was almost double market forecasts of a 2.5% rise, with clothing stores boasting gains of almost 28%; department stores 22% and restaurants 12%.
The cash splash means the A$360 billion retail sector will make a major contribution to economic growth.
""Real consumer spending could bounce back by 10% this quarter, leaving it very close to its pre-Delta peak,"" said Marcel Thieliant, a senior economist at Capital Economics. 
""And with the household savings rate still very high, consumption will continue to expand at a rapid pace next year.""
Signs are the splurge has continued as national vaccination rates of 86% allowed Sydney and Melbourne to reopen with almost no restrictions.
Spending on bank cards this month is running around 10 percentage points above pre-pandemic levels and online retailers are flagging a bumper Black Friday as the Christmas shopping season gets into full swing.
""With reopening rebounds in full swing and risks of shortages and delivery delays encouraging people to shop early, this year looks set to be stronger still,"" said Matthew Hassan, a senior economist at Westpac.
That is a welcome boost to the economy given household consumption accounts for around 55% of gross domestic product and was the main casualty of lockdowns in the third quarter.
The official GDP report is out next week and could show a fall of around 3% in the third quarter, though Australia's strong export performance will offset some of the pain.
Analysts at CBA estimate the economy shrank 3.5% in the quarter, which would be the second-largest fall on record, while Westpac has upgraded its forecast to a contraction of 2.5% from a previous prediction of a 4.0% dive.
""The GDP report will be another release for the history books as around half the country was in lockdown,"" said Gareth Aird, CBA's head of Australian economics.

The uptick in prices highlights the chance nationwide inflation will pick up in coming months as pressures from raw material shortages gradually pass through to retailers to consumers.
The core consumer price index (CPI) for Japan's capital, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 0.3% in November compared with a year earlier, government data showed.
That marked the fastest year-on-year rise since July last year, when the index gained 0.4%, but was slightly weaker than a median market forecast for a 0.4% gain.
The Tokyo index, which is considered a leading indicator of nationwide price trends, was pushed up by the biggest year-on-year jump in energy prices in over eight years as well as the fastest rise in fuel costs in more than four decades.
It was also impacted by a 57.6% year-on-year increase in accommodation costs, which was flattered by the low base effects of various travel-related discounts offered by the government last year.

The cost of tuna and other fresh fish also rose, likely due to soaring fuel costs as well as stronger domestic demand, a government official said, though they are not included in the core consumer price index.
Nationwide consumer inflation in Japan has barely risen even as other major economies, such as the United States, are worrying about the risk of too-high inflation after their economies opened up from pandemic-induced lockdowns.

BERLIN (Reuters) - A surge in coronavirus infections in Germany is weighing on consumer morale in Europe's largest economy, dampening business prospects in the Christmas shopping season and threatening to kick away its last remaining pillar of growth.
The GfK institute said on Thursday its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to -1.6 points heading into December, from a revised 1.0 points a month earlier.
The December reading was the lowest since June and compared with a Reuters forecast for a smaller drop to -0.5.
The survey was followed by detailed gross domestic product data which showed household spending was the sole driver of a weaker-than-expected economic expansion in the third quarter, more than offsetting a drop in company investments and state consumption over the summer.
Gross domestic product in Europe's largest economy grew by 1.7% quarter-on-quarter in adjusted terms from July to September, the Federal Statistics Office said. That fell short of a flash estimate of 1.8% published last month.
The data marked a slowdown in German growth from an upwardly revised expansion of 2% from April to June. The economy shrank by 1.9% on the quarter in the first three months of the year.
A 6.2% jump in consumer spending in July-September from the prior three months contributed 3 percentage points to the overall growth rate in the third quarter.
""This is due to catch-up effects in the service sector. Restaurants, bars and the hotel industry in particular benefited,"" VP Bank Group analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
But Gitzel added that persistent supply bottlenecks in manufacturing were holding back overall growth, which could be seen in weaker investment activity by companies in machinery and buildings in the third quarter.
State spending also fell on the quarter, further pushing down the headline GDP figure.
A jump in new coronavirus infections over the past weeks is now threatening to kick away Germany's last remaining pillar of growth in the final quarter.
""The consequences of the pandemic are causing a kind of stop-and-go growth,"" Gitzel said.
GfK economist Rolf Buerkl said the fourth wave in the COVID-19 pandemic, with infection rates rising rapidly and hospitals reaching capacity limits, was causing concerns that more restrictions for shops and restaurants would follow.
Inflation rates of more than 4% were also hurting the purchasing power of consumers, he said.

""Together, this is all dampening the business prospects for the upcoming Christmas shopping season,"" Buerkl said.
Consumers' expectations for their personal income and the development of the economy both deteriorated. This pushed down the propensity to buy to a nine-month low.

The CBI said its monthly retail sales balance - which looks at whether retailers think annual sales growth is rising or falling - rose to a three-month high of +39 in November from +30 in October.
But a separate measure of sales for the time of year leapt to +35 from -1, its highest since September 2015.
""Christmas seems to have come early for retailers, with clothing and department stores in particular seeing a big upward swing in sales volumes in November,"" CBI economist Ben Jones said.
Although the survey of retailers indicated stock levels were adequate for the first time in seven months, previous shortages of some goods appeared to have made shoppers want to make their purchases earlier this year, he added.
The most recent official data, for October, showed retail sales rose on the month for the first time since April. British retail sales surged in March and April when shops reopened after a lockdown, but then fell steadily as other businesses reopened and consumers faced a wider range of spending options. 
The data also add to evidence of surging price pressures in Britain, which may push the Bank of England to raise interest rates next month for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Retailers reported the most widespread rise in prices since May 1990, and expected a similar increase for the following month.

Employment in the sector - which has been under long-term pressure from online retail - also rose for the first time since November 2016.

Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Thursday showed capital expenditure fell a real 2.2% in the third quarter to A$32.7 billion ($23.57 billion), in line with market forecasts of a 2.0% drop.
Spending plans for the year to end June 2022 were upgraded to A$138.6 billion, above most analysts' estimates and a sign business confidence had weathered the disruptions well.
""It suggests that spending this financial year will be over 10% higher than fiscal 2021, comfortably outstripping the levels seen in the three years prior to the pandemic,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics.
""Construction, wholesale trade and transport, postal and warehousing led the way, reflecting the need to expand capacity to properly service the substantial shift to online retailing.""
For the third quarter, most of the pullback in investment came in plant and machinery with the retail and education sectors particularly hard hit by the lockdowns.
Data on gross domestic product (GDP) due next week is expected to show a sharp contraction given stay-at-home rules in Sydney and Melbourne hammered consumption during the quarter.
Yet with 86% of the adult population fully vaccinated, most restrictions are gone and spending has quickly ramped up as retailers count on a bumper Black Friday of sales this week.
Separate data on payrolls out on Thursday showed employment jumped sharply in the last two weeks of October, rounding out a strong month for the states of New South Wales and Victoria.
That pick up in jobs has yet to see much acceleration in wages growth which languished at an annual 2.2% in the third quarter, well short of consumer price inflation at 3%.
That is too slow for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which wants to see wage growth running at 3%-plus before pulling the trigger on rate rises, something it doubts will happen until 2023 at the earliest.
Investors are wagering the bank is behind the curve on inflation and will actually have to hike the 0.1% cash rate by June next year, if only to keep up with other central banks.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) on Wednesday lifted its rate for a second month running and flagged further rises to 1.5% by mid-2022.

The services producer price index hit 105.4 in October, the highest since November 2001, Bank of Japan (BOJ) data showed on Thursday.
But the gain was far smaller than an 8.0% spike in wholesale goods inflation in October, suggesting slow wage growth will moderate any rise in consumer prices.
The key driver behind the October services price rise was transportation fees, as robust global demand for raw materials allowed shipping firms to pass on higher fuel costs to clients.
The cost of ocean freight transportation spiked 52.0% in October from a year earlier after a 34.9% gain in September, the data showed.
The pace of declines in hotel fees slowed to 2.9% in October from 7.4% in September, a sign consumption was picking up after the Sept. 30 lifting of curbs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Corporate services prices are recovering gradually, with some sectors showing demand picking up due to the lifting of curbs. But the move hasn't broadened much on lingering caution over the pandemic,"" Shigeru Shimizu, head of the BOJ's price statistics division, told a briefing.

Japan's economy has lagged other advanced nations in recovering from pandemic doldrums, discouraging firms from passing on higher raw material costs to consumers.
Core consumer prices rose just 0.1% in October from a year earlier, even as fuel costs accelerated at the fastest pace in more than a decade.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a 52-year low last week, suggesting economic activity was accelerating as a year ravaged by shortages, high inflation and an unrelenting pandemic draws to a close.
The plunge in claims reported by the Labor Department on Wednesday was, however, exaggerated by difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations this time of the year. Still, the labor market is tightening, with jobless rolls shrinking in mid-November to the smallest since March 2020 when the economy was in the grips of the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
The economy's strengthening tone was confirmed by other data showing strong consumer spending in October as well as business orders for equipment, excluding transportation. The goods trade deficit narrowed sharply last month as exports surged. 
But prices remained stubbornly high, with annual inflation jumping by the most in nearly 31 years. The raft of solid reports ahead of Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday prompted economists to boost their fourth-quarter growth estimates to as high as an 8.6% annualized rate.
""There might be some seasonal adjustment problems, but the handwriting is on the wall and all the anecdotal reports on how companies cannot find the help they need are true,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
""The economy will finish the year with a bang, there is lots to give thanks for."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled 71,000 to a seasonally adjusted 199,000 for the week ended Nov. 20, the lowest level since mid-November 1969. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 260,000 applications for the latest week. 
Unadjusted claims rose 18,187 to 258,622 last week amid a surge in Virginia, which offset declines in California, Kentucky and Missouri. More volatility is likely over the holiday season. 
""The claims series can be noisy and especially choppy around holidays like Thanksgiving when the seasonal factors anticipate large swings in the underlying data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But even so, initial claims fell by more than a half million over the year through Nov. 20, both before and after seasonal adjustment.""
Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020, and are now viewed as consistent with a healthy labor market, though an acute shortage of workers caused by the pandemic is hindering faster job growth.
But there is hope for an expansion of the labor pool. The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 60,000 to 2.049 million in the week ended Nov. 13, a 20-month low, the claims report showed.

There were 10.4 million job openings as of the end of September. The workforce is down 3 million people from its pre-pandemic level, even as generous federal government-funded benefits have expired, schools have reopened for in-person learning and companies are raising wages.
Stocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
BRIGHTENING PICTURE
Signs the economy was regaining momentum after hitting a speed bump in the July-September quarter as coronavirus cases flared up over summer and shortages became more widespread could result in the Federal Reserve quickly winding up its bond-buying program. 
Indeed, minutes of the U.S. central bank's Nov. 2-3 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed some Fed officials would be open to doing so.
""We see the Fed accelerating tapering in January to clear the runway for a September rate liftoff,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed gross domestic product rose at a 2.1% rate in the third quarter. That was a slight upward revision from the 2.0% pace estimated in October, but was still the slowest in more than a year. The economy grew at a 6.7% rate in the second quarter. 
But that is all in the rear-view mirror. A third report from the Commerce Department showed consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 1.3% in October after rising 0.6% in September. 
Consumers, buoyed by rising wages and massive savings, bought motor vehicles and traveled, showing no signs yet of holding back because of high inflation.

Global economies' simultaneous recovery from the pandemic, fueled by trillions of dollars in relief money from governments, has strained supply chains, unleashing inflation. 
President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that the United States would release 50 million barrels of crude from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help cool oil prices, in coordination with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 0.4% last month after gaining 0.2% in September. In the 12 months through October, the so-called core PCE price index accelerated 4.1%. That was the largest gain since January 1991 and followed a 3.7% year-on-year advance in September. 
The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target.
Adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose a solid 0.7%.
In another boost to the economy, orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.6% last month, the Commerce Department said in a fourth report.
With corporate profits hitting a record high last quarter, businesses are likely to keep spending.
More goods were exported in October, sharply narrowing the goods trade deficit by 14.6% to $82.9 billion. If the trend holds, trade could contribute to GDP growth this quarter.

Wholesalers continued to rebuild inventories last month though motor vehicle shortages stymied progress by retailers, a fifth report showed.
Inventory accumulation, the key driver of GDP growth last quarter, will likely continue to support the economy. The strong data flow led the Atlanta Fed to raise its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to an 8.6% rate from an 8.2% pace. JPMorgan boosted its forecast to a 7.0% pace from a 5.0% rate.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 1.3% last month after rising 0.6% in September. Spending was partially boosted by higher prices as demand continues to outpace supply.

Consumer spending is accelerating after slowing sharply in the third quarter as COVID-19 infections driven by the Delta variant flared up and shortages of goods became more widespread. Fears of empty shelves and paying even more for scarce goods have encouraged Americans to start their holiday shopping early.
Retailers expect holiday sales will be the best in years, but some economists are cautioning about downside risks to the rosy forecast. Coronavirus infections are rising again, which could prompt some consumers to cut back on spending on travel and entertainment, including dining out.
""Moreover, continued clogged supply chains and port delays could lead to product scarcities on shelves as cargo ships remain anchored offshore waiting to be unloaded at the large ports in Southern California,"" said Scott Anderson, chief
economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. 
""Both scenarios have the potential to put a damper on these optimistic holiday sales projections.""

Price pressures heated up in October. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 0.4% after gaining 0.2% in September.

New home sales increased 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 745,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. September's sales pace was revised down to 742,000 units from the previously reported 800,000 units. 
Sales rose in the densely populated South, as well as in the Midwest, but fell in the West and Northeast. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for more than 10% of U.S. home sales, unchanged at a rate of 800,000 units. Sales fell 23.1% on a year-on-year basis in October. They peaked at a rate of 993,000 units in January, which was the highest since the end of 2006.
Sales soared over the summer of last year amid an exodus from cities to suburbs and other low-density locations as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and online schooling during the pandemic. With vaccinations allowing workers to return to offices and schools to reopen for in-person learning, the pandemic tailwind is fading.
Still, demand for new homes remains underpinned by an acute shortage of previously owned houses on the market. 
The median new house price soared 17.5% in October to $407,700 from a year ago. There were 389,000 new homes on the market, up from 378,000 units in September. Houses under construction made up 62.2% of the inventory, with homes yet to be built accounting for about 28%. Builders are being constrained by shortages of materials and labor. 

The government reported last week that the backlog of houses yet to be constructed in October was the largest in 15 years. 
At October's sales pace it would take 6.3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 6.1 months in September.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German business morale deteriorated for the fifth month running in November as supply bottlenecks in manufacturing and a spike in coronavirus infections clouded the growth outlook for Europe's largest economy, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The Ifo institute said its business climate index fell to 96.5 from 97.7 in October. A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a November reading of 96.6.
""Supply bottlenecks and the fourth wave of the coronavirus are challenging German companies,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said.
Company executives were less satisfied with their current business situation and their expectations for the next six months were more pessimistic, the survey showed.
Despite record high orders, German carmakers and other manufacturers are forced to scale back production due to a lack of raw materials and intermediate goods such as microchips.
""Industrial production is suffering from the shortage of materials, and with the brutal fourth coronavirus wave, a well-known stress factor for the service sector is now being added,"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
Gitzel said all signs were now pointing to a decline in overall economic output in the final quarter of this year.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe was a bit less gloomy, saying the economy was set to stagnate in the fourth quarter as supply chain bottlenecks showed no sign of easing up.
Wohlrabe told Reuters that the hospitality and tourism sectors were facing a tough few months ahead due to new restrictions across the country to stop the spike in COVID cases and protect hospitals from reaching capacity limits.
The German central bank warned on Monday that the economy could stagnate in the final quarter of this year as a lack of goods and labour as well as new restrictions to fight the pandemic might put an end to its fragile recovery.
The Ifo figures contrasted with a purchasing manager survey which had suggested on Tuesday that growth in Germany's private sector picked up slightly in November despite persistent supply bottlenecks and unusually high inflation.

Ralf Umlauf, an economist with Helaba bank, said Germany seemed to be hit harder by the supply bottlenecks than neighbouring France where business morale improved in November.
The grim outlook would be viewed by the European Central Bank as a confirmation of its cautious stance to leave as many policy options as possible on the table, regardless of rising inflation rates, Umlauf added.

148,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 08:55AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased solidly in October, suggesting a rebound in business spending on equipment early in the fourth quarter. 
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.6% last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. These so-called core capital goods orders gained 1.3% in September.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders climbing 0.5%. Part of the increase last month likely reflected higher prices amid global shortages of goods.
Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.3% last month after advancing 1.3% in September. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.
Business spending on equipment contracted in the third quarter after four straight quarters of double-digit growth. It was weighed down a shortage of motor vehicles. A global shortage of semiconductors is undercutting motor vehicle production. 
Unfinished work continues to pile up at factories as manufacturers struggle with snarled supply chains. This, together with strong demand for goods even as spending reverts back to services, should keep manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the economy, humming.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, fell 0.5% last month after declining 0.4% in September. 

They were depressed by a 2.6% drop in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 2.8% decline in September. Motor vehicle orders rebounded 4.8% after falling 2.2% in September
Orders for the volatile civilian aircraft category tumbled 14.5% after plunging 31.2% in September. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received only 10 aircraft orders last month compared to 27 in September. 
 
"
149,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. economic growth in the third quarter was revised slightly higher, reflecting somewhat stronger personal spending than previously estimated.
Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product increased at a 2.1% annualized rate during the period, compared with an initially reported 2%, Commerce Department data showed Wednesday. Consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of the economy, grew 1.7%.
Inventories added more than 2.1 percentage points to overall growth in the quarter. The median GDP estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists had forecast a minor upward revision to 2.2%.
The report underscores how a combination of a surge in Covid-19 infections, supply shortages and labor constraints induced a sharp slowdown last quarter in personal consumption. Recent data, including stronger-than-expected October retail sales, suggest a re-acceleration of spending in the final three months of the year.
Headwinds remain, however. Rising prices and a collapse in consumer sentiment threaten to constrain household spending, and any worsening of the persistent transportation bottlenecks and supply chain challenges seen in recent months could further stifle growth.
The report also included the first read on business earnings for the period. Pretax corporate profits increased an annualized 4.3% from the prior quarter and were up nearly 21% from a year earlier. Amid rising labor and materials costs, companies have had great success in raising prices.

150,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Applications for U.S. state unemployment benefits plunged last week to a level not seen since 1969, which if sustained would mark the next milestone in the labor market’s uneven recovery.
Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs fell by 71,000 to a seasonally adjusted 199,000 in the week ended Nov. 20, Labor Department data showed Wednesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 260,000 applications.
However, the larger-than-expected drop may be explained by how the government adjusts the raw data for seasonal swings. Wrightson ICAP chief economist Lou Crandall pointed out in a recent note that seasonal factors were anticipating a smaller increase in unadjusted claims compared with the same time last year as the labor market was struggling to recover.
Before seasonal adjustments, last week’s initial jobless claims rose by about 18,000.
Claims stood at 216,000 at the end of February 2020 leading up to the onset of Covid-19 in the U.S., which pushed applications up to a peak of 6.1 million in early April 2020. They’ve since declined as the economy reopened more broadly and Americans returned to work. Also, federal pandemic unemployment benefits ended by Sept. 6 in all states.
Even so, millions of Americans are still choosing to sit on the sidelines, frustrating employers who are desperate to fill a near-record number of positions. Child care remains a serious issue for working parents, especially as Covid cases pick up again in many states and disrupt in-person learning.
The October jobs report showed payrolls increased 531,000 after large upward revisions to the prior two months. Economists are calling for another half a million to be added in November, which will be reported on Dec. 3.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's economy is expected to grow about 7% in 2021, at the top of the official forecast range, and will expand at a slower pace next year as an uneven recovery continues across sectors, the government said on Wednesday.
The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) forecast the economy to grow 3% to 5% next year.
""The recovery of the various sectors of the economy is expected to remain uneven in 2022,"" said Gabriel Lim, permanent secretary for trade and industry.
He expects outward-oriented sectors such as manufacturing and wholesale trade to remain strong, while activity in aviation- and tourism-related sectors would remain below pre-COVID levels throughout 2022.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 7.1% year-on-year in the third quarter, the MTI said, higher than the 6.5% expansion seen in the government's advance estimate and analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy expanded 1.3% in the third quarter.
The small and open economy, which has fully vaccinated about 85% of its 5.45 million population, eased some COVID-19 safety measures this week and has opened quarantine-free travel lanes with several countries.
""Recovery has definitely started, the reopening borders and easing of mobility restrictions could help consumer facing sectors,"" Maybank Kim Eng economist Lee Ju Ye. ""But it's still going to be a slow pace of normalisation.""
The MTI said protracted supply disruptions alongside a stronger pickup in demand, as well as rising energy commodity prices, could lead to more persistent inflation.
External inflationary pressures are likely to remain elevated, while wage growth is expected to strengthen as the domestic labour market continues to recover.
Around the world, policymakers have turned their attention to inflationary risks from supply constraints and a recovery in the global economy.
Singapore's central bank tightened its monetary policy in a surprise move at its last meeting in October. At least five economists expect the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to act again at its next policy meeting in April.
The MAS will carefully watch inflation dynamics and stay vigilant on price developments when it decides its next policy move, expected in April, Edward Robinson, its deputy managing director, told a media briefing.
Singapore kept its forecast for headline inflation to come in at about 2% this year, and average 1.5-2.5% in 2022.
Data this week showed Singapore's key price gauge rose by the fastest pace in nearly three years in October, mainly driven by higher services and food inflation, while headline inflation rose at the fastest pace since March 2013.

""If we continue to see the inflation overshoot past the first quarter of next year, and if all these supply chain disruptions don’t ease, the question is then potentially how aggressive (the tightening) may be,"" said Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC, adding that she sees a ""very high probability"" for tightening in April.
The economy shrank a record 5.4% due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Activity in the services sector also accelerated, expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years as economic conditions stabilised after a sharp decline in COVID-19 cases and deaths thanks to soaring vaccinations.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 54.2, its fastest pace of expansion since January 2018.
The reading, which was lifted by a pickup in overall output and new orders, compared to a final 53.2 in the previous month.
""Activity at Japanese private sector businesses rose for the second month running in November,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Manufacturers' optimism for the year ahead eased slightly from the previous month, according to the survey, which also showed firms across sectors faced soaring price pressures. 
""Input prices across the private sector rose at the fastest pace for over 13 years with businesses attributing the rise to higher raw material, freight and staff costs amid shortages and deteriorating supplier performance,"" Bhatti said.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Services PMI Index improved to a seasonally adjusted 52.1 from the previous month's final of 50.7, putting it more firmly into expansion territory.

The reading marked the fastest pace of growth since September 2019, which was just before a sales tax hike hit consumer confidence.

Data firm IHS Markit said on Tuesday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to a reading of 56.5 in mid-November from 57.6 in October. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector. 
The rate of growth remains above the survey's long-run pre-pandemic average, and is consistent with an economy that is regaining steam after a brief lull in the summer. 
The services sector accounted for the pull back in activity, with IHS Market noting ""some resistance to higher prices.""
Though many firms reported business was strong because of increased travel both domestic and international as well as the further easing of COVID-19 restrictions, the pace of growth slowed relative to previous months. 
""The U.S. economy continues to run hot,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. ""However, the slowdown underscores how the economy is struggling to cope with ongoing supply constraints.""
The survey's measure of prices paid by businesses for inputs jumped to 78.1. That was the highest reading since the series started in 2009 and followed 74.1 in October. These higher prices are being passed on to consumers, indicating that inflation could remain uncomfortably high for a while.
Consumer prices surged in October, logging their biggest annual increase in 31 years.
A measure of employment at businesses was little changed in the first half of this month. There were 10.4 million job openings as of the end of September. 
Millions of Americans remain home even as generous federal government-funded unemployment benefits ended in early September, more people have been vaccinated against COVID-19 and companies are raising wages. The pandemic has also led to early retirements and career changes. 
The survey's flash services sector PMI fell to a reading of 57.0 early in the month from 58.7 in October. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 59 in mid-November for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Unfinished work at the services industry businesses piled up at the second-fastest pace on record, IHS Markit said. 

Despite the supply constraints, manufacturing activity picked up, amid an influx of new orders. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI increased 59.1 from a reading of 58.4 in October. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 12% of the economy, climbing to 59. 
According to IHS Markit, difficulties securing inputs and finding affordable transportation for goods led to cost burdens rising at a record pace in mid-November. It noted that firms increased their selling prices at the second-steepest pace in more than 14-1/2 years.

Supply bottlenecks caused by the pandemic have made it a sellers' market for raw materials and the composite input prices index surged to 75.9 from 73.2, by far the highest since the survey began in mid-1998.
Still, a PMI for the bloc's dominant services industry rose to 56.6 from 54.6, well above all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had predicted a fall to 53.5.
But optimism waned as renewed lockdowns are likely to have a bigger impact on services. The business expectations index sunk to 66.6 from 69.0, its lowest reading since February.
Manufacturing activity remained robust and the factory PMI rose to 58.6 from 58.3. An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, increased to 53.8 from 53.3.
Demand remained strong and factories were able to pass on some of the record increase in raw material costs to customers. The output prices index jumped to 74.3 from 72.6, the highest since the IHS Markit began collecting the data 19 years ago.
""The surveys show price pressures remain intense, with the output prices PMIs for both manufacturing and services rising to their highest in almost two decades, consistent with our view that headline inflation will remain high for some time,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.

The PMIs casts some doubt on the European Central Bank's claim the rise in inflation is transitory. Euro zone inflation expectations are at risk of continuing to overshoot the Bank's 2% target next year, according to a Reuters poll https://www.reuters.com/business/euro-zone-inflation-remain-above-ecbs-target-next-year-2021-11-12 earlier this month.
ECB board member Isabel Schnabel https://www.reuters.com/article/ecb-policy-schnabel-idUSKBN2I80FM told Bloomberg in an interview euro zone inflation would be higher next year than previously thought and there is a risk price growth could stay above the Bank's target in the medium term.

LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses reported the fastest growth in new orders since June this month alongside record cost pressures, according to a closely watched business survey that could pave the way for a Bank of England rate rise in December.
The IHS Markit/CIPS flash composite purchasing managers' index (PMI), published on Tuesday, edged down to 57.7 in November from October's final reading of 57.8. But that still indicated strong growth and was a shade higher than economists' average forecast in a Reuters poll.
""A combination of sustained buoyant business growth, further job market gains and record inflationary pressures gives a green light for interest rates to rise in December,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at financial data provider IHS Markit, said.
The Bank of England wrong-footed many investors at the start of this month by keeping rates at a rock-bottom 0.1%, after signalling an increase was on its way, because it wanted longer to assess the end of the government's furlough jobs support programme on Oct. 1.
Data since then has shown consumer price inflation hit a 10-year high of 4.2% in October, while businesses continued to hire strongly and vacancies rose to a record high.
The flash, or preliminary, PMI showed a drop in net hiring to its lowest since April, but IHS Markit said that reflected recruitment difficulties rather than a levelling-off of demand.
Rising wages, higher energy bills and other cost pressures caused input prices in the composite index to rise at the fastest rate since the series began in January 1998.
Separate, longer running PMIs for the services and manufacturing sectors also showed record rises in costs.
But some services businesses said clients were pushing back at the scale of price increases, and prices charged rose at a slightly slower pace than October's all-time high.
Orders rose, helped by reduced COVID-19 restrictions. While most coronavirus restrictions had been lifted in England by July, the more recent easing in travel restrictions was boosting services exports.

The BoE forecasts inflation will hit around 5% next year and its chief economist, Huw Pill, said on Friday that patience would be needed while it returned to its 2% target.
Higher interest rates will not mitigate the direct impact of a surge in energy prices and global supply-chain bottlenecks. But the BoE will hope they will reduce the chance of a spiral of wages and prices that could make higher inflation more permanent.

Data compiler IHS Markit said on Tuesday that its flash purchasing managers index (PMI) for the French services sector in November came in at 58.2 points, up from 56.6 in October.
The reading for the services sector beat a forecast for 56.0 points, and moved the index further above the 50-point threshold which marks an expansion in activity.
The flash PMI for the French manufacturing sector in November rose to 54.6 points, from 53.6 in October, also beating a forecast for 53.0 points.
The flash composite PMI index for November, which includes both the services and manufacturing sectors, rose to 56.3 points from 54.7 in October, beating a forecast for 53.6 points.
France's services industries benefited from new client contracts and higher workloads from existing customers, added IHS Markit, although supply-chain disruptions persisted.

""Having embarked on a clear period of slowing growth in the months leading up to October, the flash PMI data for November showed a fresh acceleration in French economic expansion,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""However, the driving force behind improvements in the data is services. Manufacturers are still struggling with component shortages, long lead times and subdued demand conditions,"" added Hayes.

IHS Markit's flash Germany composite purchasing managers' index rose to 52.8, a two-month high, from 52.0 in October. This was stronger than a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a decline to 51.0 in November. A reading above 50 marks growth in activity.
IHS Markit economist Lewis Cooper said the data showed that the slowdown in economic growth seen across Germany's private sector over the previous three months was levelling off.
Export orders in Europe's biggest economy showed a more resilient trend, but overall new work increased at the weakest rate since February.
The flash PMI for manufacturing edged down to 57.6, a 10-month low, from 57.8 in the previous month.
The services sector showed signs of better growth prospects despite a recent surge in COVID-19 infections, with the services PMI activity index rising to 53.4, a two-month high, from 52.4 in October.
Material shortages and supply chain issues, combined with higher energy and wage bills, led to an unprecedented rate of cost inflation which in turn led many firms to raise their own charges to a record degree, the survey showed.

""This subsequently knocked on to business confidence in November, with sentiment the lowest for over a year as many firms cited concerns around the pandemic, supply problems and price pressures,"" Cooper said.
The German central bank said on Monday that the economy could stagnate in the final quarter of this year as a lack of goods and labour as well as new restrictions to fight the coronavirus pandemic might put an end to its recent recovery.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales unexpectedly rose in October, reaching their highest level in nine months, though higher prices amid tight supply continued to sideline first-time buyers from the market.
The report from the National Association of Realtors on Monday also showed an increase in the share of investors buying homes last month, likely reflecting growing demand for rental accommodation as the economy reverts to normal, thanks to vaccinations against COVID-19. 
""Home sales remain resilient given the extremely tight supply of homes for sale,"" said Shannon Brobst, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Potential home buyers will continue to find it challenging to find a home that meets their budget.""
Existing home sales rose 0.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.34 million units last month. The second straight monthly increase lifted sales to their highest level since January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales falling to a rate of 6.20 million units. 
Sales rose in the most affordable Midwest region and the densely populated South, but fell in the Northeast and were unchanged in the West, which is the most expensive region.
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, dropped 5.8% on a year-on-year basis. The annual decline was, however, distorted by the surge in sales in October 2020. 
Last month's sales pace was well above the 5.64 million units sold in 2020 and 5.34 million units in 2019.
First-time buyers accounted for 29% of sales, up from 28% in September and down from 32% a year ago. Individual investors or second-home buyers made up 17% of transactions. That compared to 13% in September and 14% a year ago.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hitting record highs after President Joe Biden picked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lead the U.S. central bank for a second term. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
Existing home sales: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dwvkremzepm/ehs.png 
EXPENSIVE HOMES 
Sales soared over the summer of last year amid an exodus from cities to suburbs and other low-density locations as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and online schooling during the pandemic. 
With vaccinations allowing workers to return to offices and schools to reopen for in-person learning, the pandemic tailwind has subsided. Sales have declined from a peak 6.73 million unit-pace in October 2020, but demand for housing remains strong and continues to run against modest supply. 
The median existing house price increased 13.1% from a year earlier to $353,900 in October. Sales were concentrated in the $250,000-$500,000 price range.
""While competition for homes has eased somewhat since the mania months earlier this year, competition is still fierce and prices are still rising at double-digit rates,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""The problem is especially acute for lower-income buyers given prices and home availability are still skewed toward higher-priced homes.""
There were 1.25 million previously owned homes on the market in October, down 12% from a year ago. Last month, properties typically stayed on the market for 18 days. That compared to 17 days in September and 21 days a year ago. Eighty-two percent of homes sold in October were on the market for less than a month.

Government data last week showed a sharp decline in single-family homebuilding in October and the largest backlog of houses yet to be constructed in 15 years because of shortages of materials and labor. That could boost housing inventory when the supply constraints ease.
At October's sales pace, it would take 2.4 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 2.5 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

In its latest quarterly monetary policy report published Friday, the People’s Bank of China removed a few key phrases cited in previous reports, including sticking with “normal monetary policy.” That suggests a shift in stance toward more supportive monetary policy, according to economists at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).  
The report also dropped the phrase to “control the valve on money supply,” which suggests a step-up of monetary easing, according to Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) Ltd.’s Larry Hu.
Any easing steps would likely be targeted toward small businesses and green finance, according to economists, similar to measures the PBOC has already taken in recent weeks, including 200 billion yuan ($31 billion) of financing for coal projects announced last week. 
Goldman Sachs’ Hui Shan and colleagues said policy interest rates would likely remain unchanged, while Nomura’s Lu Ting said the chance of a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio will rise in coming months.
“We expect Beijing to soon significantly step up its monetary easing and fiscal stimulus to counteract the increasing downward pressure,” Lu said.  
The PBOC’s quarterly report came on the same day that Premier Li Keqiang told a seminar China still faces “many challenges” in keeping the economy stable, although this year’s goals will likely be achieved. 
Liu Shijin, who sits on the central bank’s monetary policy committee, said in an online forum Sunday that the economy could enter a period of “quasi-stagflation,” which needs close attention if it happens.

Hungarian inflation surged to an annual 6.5% in October, above expectations and driven in part by a 30.7% increase in fuel prices, which prompted Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government to impose a three-month price cap.
Hungary's central bank, which expects inflation to exceed 7% in November, was forced to ramp up the pace of its monetary tightening campaign to rein in inflation and shore up the forint, which skirted its April 2020 all-time lows last week.
""All participants of the economy expect price rises,"" GKI said in its monthly survey, which showed business confidence rising to a 2-1/2-year-high, driven by stronger optimism in most branches of the economy except for services.
""However, consumer (confidence) fell to an extent rarely seen over the course of a single month, sending it to levels last seen in the spring,"" GKI said.
It said worries about unemployment increased significantly, even as the share of companies planning to boost hiring exceeded those of planning layoffs in all branches of the economy.
Companies were planning price rises, while consumer inflation expectations also jumped, the survey said. It said households as well as industrial and service sector businesses turned gloomier about prospects for the economy.

Customers were also more pessimistic about their financial and savings prospects in November, breaking a six-month period of improvement, the survey said.
Facing a closely fought election next year, Orban's government has showered the electorate with handouts, including a $2 billion income tax rebate for families and an extra month's worth of pensions.

The value of government land sales in October declined 13.14% from a year earlier to 573.7 billion yuan ($89.90 billion), after suffering a drop of 11.15% in September, according to Reuters calculations of data released by the finance ministry on Friday.
Many developers including China Evergrande Group have grown desperately short of cash since authorities last year unveiled the ""three red lines"" - a policy of President Xi Jinping that imposes limits on liabilities-to-assets, net debt-to-equity, and cash-to-short-term borrowing ratios.
Poor demand among developers at urban land auctions risks squeezing regional finances, pressuring local governments to scramble for other income to fund investment and support the economy, including the issuance of more bonds that increase their debt obligations, say some analysts.
""Declining land sales will constrain fiscal funding for infrastructure, leading Chinese regional and local governments to temporarily shift to debt-funded growth,"" Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said in a recent report.
Not all provinces and regions are equally dependent on land-sale revenue.
""The unevenness in regional growth will persist, with developed provinces continuing to perform better than less-developed ones,"" Moody's said.
China's government land-sale revenue grew 6.1% to 5.9371 trillion yuan ($930.29 billion) in January-October from a year earlier，data from the finance ministry showed, slowing from the 8.7% rise in the first nine months.
In February, the land regulator imposed restrictions on sales, allowing up to three auctions a year in 22 key cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, with the rules aimed at reining in rising land prices that could otherwise lead to higher home prices.
Private developers have bought at least 140.6 billion yuan of land in a completed round of auctions held by 22 major cities, down about 75% from 553.1 billion yuan in the first round of sales this year in March-June, according to a Reuters analysis of public notices on the sales.

China's property woes have worsened in recent months, with prices lower in both new and resale homes in October amid deeper contractions in construction starts and investment by developers, weighing on the overall economic outlook.

As the French economy rebounds from the pandemic, a shortage of labour has emerged in some sectors as firms struggle to meet booming consumer demand.

However, the unemployment rate has not fallen in sync since there are also more people looking for work as people who sat on the sidelines during the crisis return to the labour market.

LONDON (Reuters) -Auction houses and shoppers seeking new clothes for the Christmas holidays lifted British retail sales last month by more than expected, adding to recent signs that a slowdown in the economy might have abated slightly.
Retail sales volumes rose by 0.8% month-on-month in October, the Office for National Statistics said. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 0.5% increase.
Retail sales are now 5.8% above the level of February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Auction houses were an especially strong driver of retail sales growth in October, the ONS said.
Last month a Banksy picture by British artist Banksy - which in 2018 was half-sliced by a shredder concealed in its frame when it was sold at auction - fetched 18.6 million pounds ($25.1 million) when it went back under the hammer in the same room in London.
Separate data showed the government borrowed more than expected last month although borrowing for the year to date is more than 100 billion pounds below its level in April-October 2020, when the economy felt the full force of the pandemic.
""The rebound in retail sales in October and the further improvement in the public finances will add to expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates from 0.10% to 0.25% in December,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics.
With inflation surging, the BoE has said it will raise rates in the coming months if the evidence shows Britain's economy has not been impaired by the end of the COVID-19 job job-protecting furlough scheme, which closed last month.
The retail sales data - and an improvement in the GfK measure of consumer confidence this month - suggested the economy has not worsened of late after slower-than-expected growth in the third quarter.
The ONS said clothes sales rose by 6.2% in October, helped by an early Christmas trading boost to sales. Sports, games and toy stores also had a good month.
Separate data showed British public borrowing was higher than expected in October at 18.8 billion pounds, 200 million pounds lower than a year earlier and above economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll of a fall to 13.8 billion pounds.
Britain's government received record stamp duty land tax revenues from a surge in property purchases as a tax break came to an end, but corporation tax receipts were down due to a new investment incentive, the ONS said.

Monthly debt interest payments were also triple their level a year earlier at 5.6 billion pounds, reflecting higher payments on index-linked bonds due to a surge in inflation.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Core consumer prices in Tokyo, a leading indicator of Japan's nationwide inflation, likely rose in November at the fastest pace in more than a year, a Reuters poll showed, a sign firms were starting to pass on higher energy and raw material costs.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes energy but excludes fresh food prices, was seen rising 0.4% in Japan's capital city in the year to November, the fastest pace of increase since July 2020, the poll of 17 economists showed. Tokyo's core CPI index rose 0.1% in October.
While such data would suggest a pick-up in Japan's nationwide core CPI, the latest reading of 0.1% in October was still well below the central bank's 2% target.
""Unlike in Europe and the United States, Japan hasn't seen a sharp rebound in demand after the lifting of COVID-19 curbs,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""The inflation rate will likely accelerate, but only at a modest pace.""
Analysts expect Japan's consumer inflation to pick up in coming months due to rising fuel costs, but not as steeply as in other countries as weak household spending discourages firms from raising prices.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday inflation will accelerate to around 1% in the first half of 2022 as the economy recovers to pre-pandemic levels.

That will still leave inflation well below the BOJ's target, suggesting the central bank is likely to maintain monetary policy ultra-loose.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose for the second straight month in October, as fuel costs accelerated at the fastest pace in more than a decade and pressures from raw materials shortages gradually passed through to retailers.
Consumer inflation is expected to pick up in coming months due to higher fuel costs, though any price rises in the country will likely be moderate compared with other advanced economies as weak wage growth limits firms from passing on hikes.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food prices but includes fuel costs, rose 0.1% year-on-year in October, government data showed on Friday.
That matched the median forecast in a Reuters poll and followed a similar rise in September, which was the first uptick since March last year.
Overall energy prices soared 11.3% from a year earlier in October, posting their biggest rise since September 2008, thanks largely to a jump in fuel costs, which surged 21.4% year-on-year, their largest gain since August 2008.
The data will be among factors the Bank of Japan will scrutinise at its last policy meeting of the year, scheduled for the middle of next month.
""This is different from the stable price rises that the Bank of Japan is looking for,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
The soaring fuel prices were leading to cost pressures in daily life, she said. ""It's having absolutely a negative impact on the economy.""
Japan has found itself exposed to soaring global commodity prices, which led to the fastest rise in wholesale inflation in four decades in October. But core CPI has stayed near zero as weak consumption and wage growth keep firms from raising prices.
The government is set to unveil a record $488 billion spending package which is expected to include support for the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors and logistics firms to help them cope with soaring fuel costs.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said this week he expected inflation to accelerate to around 1% in the first half of next year as the economy recovers to pre-coronavirus levels, still far off its 2% target.

The central bank has stuck to massive monetary stimulus in its quest to have inflation reach that illustrious target, despite worries about the side-effects of prolonged low interest rates to banks' bottom lines.
Friday's data showed processed food and accommodation prices also rose, though the gain was more than offset by a record 53.6% year-on-year plunge in telecommunication fees as cellphone carriers cut charges. 
 
"
171,"<span>Nov 18, 2021 06:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Higher energy costs caused Japanese consumer prices to edge up for a second month in October, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida expected later Friday to deliver a stimulus package that includes countermeasures to ease the pain from more expensive fuel. 
Consumer prices, excluding those for fresh food, increased 0.1% compared with a year earlier, maintaining September’s pace, the ministry of internal affairs reported. The result matched the median forecast from analysts.
While Japan’s price gains are far less dramatic than those confronting consumers and central banks elsewhere, surging oil costs have become an issue. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno last week signaled the country’s new government would offer support to fishing and transport businesses coping with higher fuel bills as part of its first economic package. The overall size of the package will total about $690 billion, according to a draft of the plan seen by Bloomberg.
Japan’s Kishida Eyes Record Fiscal Power in Economic Stimulus
Falling fees for phone service, which have dropped this year under government pressure, continue to weigh on prices. The fees fell 54% from 2020’s level, shaving 1.5 percentage point from overall prices.
Meanwhile, gasoline prices have climbed in recent weeks to the highest level in seven years. That adds a burden on households especially outside Japan’s big cities, who tend to drive more and are an important constituency of the ruling party.
More details:
Soaring commodity prices amid supply chain bottlenecks and a weaker yen are also squeezing many Japanese businesses, which are facing the strongest cost pressure in four decades. 
While most firms remain reluctant to pass their costs on to the country’s shoppers, who are known for being extremely sensitive to price increases after years of deflation and stagnant wages, there are some exceptions. Soy sauce maker Kikkoman Corp. last week announced a 10% hike on some products, citing higher costs for materials and logistics.

With no immediate prospect of reaching the bank’s 2% inflation target, though, he said the BOJ needs to stick with its easing, even as other central banks change direction.

The economy is regaining momentum following a lull over the summer as a wave of COVID-19 infections driven by the Delta variant battered the nation.
""Demand for labor is very strong and workers are in short supply, so layoffs are very low right now,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 268,000 for the week ended Nov. 13. That was the lowest level since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States more than 20 months ago.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 260,000 applications in the latest week. The smaller decline was because the model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data was less generous last week.
Unadjusted claims dropped 18,183 to 238,850. The decrease was led by Kentucky, likely due to automobile workers returning to factories after temporary layoffs as motor vehicle manufacturers deal with a global semiconductor shortage. There were also big declines in Michigan, Tennessee and Ohio, states that also have a strong presence of auto manufacturers. 
The decreases offset a surge in filings in California.
The seventh straight weekly decline left claims just above the 256,000 level in mid-March 2020, and in a range that is associated with a healthy labor market. Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020.

The improving economic tone was matched by other data from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve on Thursday showing an acceleration in manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region this month.
Factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, reported strong order growth. They were upbeat about business conditions over the next six months and anticipated maintaining a strong pace of capital expenditures in 2022. But labor and raw material shortages persisted, leading to a rapid piling up of unfinished work, even as manufacturers increased hours for workers. 
Factories continued to face higher prices for inputs, which they passed on to consumers.
""We look for voracious goods demand and a plethora of unfilled orders to keep factories pumping out goods at a very healthy pace,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We also expect that businesses will continue to face major supply-chain problems next year, though headwinds should start to ease in the second half of 2022.""
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields dipped.

TIGHT LABOR MARKET
The reports added to a surge in retail sales in October and a sharp rebound in production at factories in suggesting that economic activity accelerated early in the fourth quarter after gross domestic product increased at its slowest pace in more than a year in the July-September period.
Stronger growth could spill over into 2022, with a third report from the Conference Board showing its index of Leading Economic Indicators jumped 0.9% in October after gaining 0.1% in September. 
Leading indicators: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/byvrjknbbve/leadingindicators.png 
The labor market is getting tighter. The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 129,000 to 2.080 million in the week ended Nov. 6, the claims report showed. That was also the lowest level since the mid-March in 2020. 
A total 3.185 million people were collecting unemployment checks under all programs during the week ended Oct. 30. Shrinking unemployment rolls raise hopes that more people will return to the labor force soon. 
Millions of unemployed Americans remain at home even after the expiration of generous federal government-funded benefits, the reopening of schools for in-person learning and companies raising wages.
The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of November's employment report. 
Claims have dropped since mid-October, which would suggest stronger employment growth this month. But workers are scarce, with 10.4 million job openings as of the end of September.

""There is some uncertainty as a key to monthly job growth is labor supply and the Delta variant,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The good news is that the Delta variant's impact on the labor market in November will be less than that seen during the teeth of the recent wave."" 
The economy created 531,000 jobs in October. Employment growth has averaged 582,000 jobs per month this year and the labor force is down 3 million from its pre-pandemic level.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - If we still can't trust the numbers, should economic policymakers and investors just sit tight?
In early September, the New York Federal Reserve suspended its real-time, GDP growth tracker because the wildly distorted economic data of the immediate post-COVID world was simply unreliable. 
""The uncertainty around the pandemic and the consequent volatility in the data have posed a number of challenges to the Nowcast model,"" the New York Fed posted on its site.
While other major institutions have yet to follow suit, the world of economic forecasting remains largely in a state of suspended animation.
A government-mandated world recession is without modern historical precedent. There are no truly comparable models for economists, investors and policymakers to draw on, leaving huge uncertainties about the new world that emerges.
And the biggest casualties have been cyclical or trend-driven analysis which investors have been wedded to for decades.
Put bluntly, you have take any confident prediction of where employment, growth, and inflation are headed over the next year or two with a large pinch of salt.
A look at Citi's economic surprises indexes, which measure the extent to which incoming data is either beating or missing consensus forecasts, shows how erratic the numbers are. 
Between 2003 and February last year - before the onset of the pandemic - the average weekly change in the aggregate G10 surprises index was just 0.03 points. Since March 1 last year, that average change jumped to 0.3 - 10 times larger. 
The index's peaks and troughs have been far more extreme too, meaning the standard deviation of weekly surprises has more than doubled to 17 from 7.5. A low standard deviation shows that data are clustered around the average, and a high reading shows they are dispersed much more widely.
It's a similar pattern across individual economic areas. Comparable figures for the U.S. economic surprises index are lower, but are significantly higher for the euro area, where pandemic-era weekly surprises are 20 times greater than the average over the previous 17 years.
ACTION OR PATIENCE?
Of course, these numbers are heavily skewed by the initial lockdowns in the months following March 2020, which brought large parts of economic activity across the world to a juddering halt, and the surprisingly strong and quick rebound.
Willem Buiter, adjunct professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University and former Bank of England policymaker, agrees forecasting is far trickier now. 
""We have information, even if it is sometimes difficult to interpret. You just have to be more careful interpreting it because the normal cyclical patterns are up in the air, as indeed is our understanding of economic trends,"" he says.
That doesn't mean the textbooks should be rejected entirely, nor should it prevent policymakers from turning to them for guidance on where to turn next. Economic fundamentals still apply.
As Buiter puts it: ""We have to look up words that we haven't had to use before. But we know how to pronounce them.""
But the effects of the pandemic are still skewing the data, nowhere more so than inflation. It is the highest in decades and well above central bank targets in many parts of the world, elevated by supply bottlenecks, shortages, high food and energy prices, and yes, rising demand.
Buiter is part of a fast-growing phalanx of leading academics, financial market heavyweights and former policymakers urging the Fed to rethink its position that inflation is still ""transitory."" 
Before the Great Financial Crisis, the Fed would almost certainly be raising interest rates with annual inflation running at a 30-year high. But the scarring from 2007-09 runs deep, meaning the gap between rock-bottom policy rates and inflation has never been bigger. 

Similarly, the fog of uncertainty clouding visibility of post-pandemic economic data and the policy outlook has rarely been thicker either.
""Acting without clarity is risky,"" said San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly on Tuesday. ""In the face of unprecedented uncertainty, the best policy is recognizing the need to wait. Although this can be hard, in the end, patience is the bravest action we can take.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding tumbled in October while the number of houses authorized for construction but not yet started jumped to a 15-year high, underscoring the disruption to the housing market from an ongoing shortage of materials and labor.
Though the report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed an increase in permits for future homebuilding, the rise was concentrated in the volatile multi-family housing segment. This will do little to alleviate an acute shortage of houses on the market, which has led to record annual gains in home prices.
""Residential housing construction activity continues to flounder,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""There are zoning problems, higher land costs, a lack of labor, and inflation has inflated the cost of raw building materials.""
Single-family housing starts, which account for the largest share of the housing market, dropped 3.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.039 million units last month. The fourth-straight monthly decline pushed starts to the lowest level since August 2020. Homebuilding fell in all four regions, with large decreases in the Northeast, Midwest and West.
The densely populated South, where the bulk of homebuilding occurs, reported a 1.8% drop in single-family starts. 
Graphic: Housing starts and building permits - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gkplgdqqjvb/hsbp.png 
Homebuilding has essentially been treading water this year as builders battle shortages and higher prices of raw materials. A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Tuesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders rose for the third straight month in November, but noted that ""supply-side challenges, including building material bottlenecks and lot and labor shortages, remain stubbornly persistent.""
Lumber, which is used for framing, remains expensive and prices for copper, another essential material in homebuilding, are high. In addition, there were about 333,000 job openings in the construction industry as of the end of September. Some household appliances are in short supply. 
Graphic: Construction job openings and hires - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/klvykdjlgvg/chart_eikon.jpg 
Construction costs jumped a record 12.3% year-on-year in October, according to producer price data published last week. 
The materials squeeze could ease during winter, a typically slow season for homebuilding in the Northeast and Midwest. Slowing demand for houses because of reduced affordability could also help to lessen the pressure on supply.
Residential investment contracted for a second consecutive quarter in the third quarter. It is likely to remain subdued in the final three months of the year.
""Supply-chain bottlenecks will likely limit construction activity in the short term, but the supply picture should look better in 2022,"" said Abbey Omodunbi, a senior economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Declining affordability and rising mortgage rates will soften demand in the next year.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
BUILDING PERMITS RISE
Starts for buildings with five units or more increased 6.8% to a rate of 470,000 units last month. Workers returning to offices and schools reopening for in-person learning, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations, are fueling demand for rental apartments.
With single-family homebuilding declining, overall housing starts slipped 0.7% to a rate of 1.520 million units in October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rebounding to a rate of 1.576 million units. 
Starts have declined from the 1.725 million unit-pace scaled in March, which was a more than 14-1/2-year high.
Still, homebuilding remains underpinned by a severe shortage of previously owned homes on the market, which has resulted in double-digit house price growth. 
The backlog of single-family houses authorized for construction but not yet started jumped 4.8% to a rate of 152,000 last month, the highest since August 2006. Permits for future homebuilding increased 4.0% to a rate of 1.650 million units in October. Single-family permits rose 2.7% to a rate of 1.069 million units, leaving them just above starts. 
Graphic: Delayed building starts - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/znvnekqqmpl/chart_eikon.jpg 
Permits for buildings with five units or more surged 6.5% to a rate of 528,000 units. Housing completions were unchanged at a rate of 1.242 million units. Single-family home completions dropped 1.7% to rate of 929,000 units.
The stock of single-family housing under construction increased 1.4% to a rate of 726,000 units last month, the highest since May 2007. Multi-family homes under construction rose to the highest level in more than 47 years. 

Over time the housing backlogs and more inventory could help to bring more homes on to the market and cool the house price inflation, which has sidelined some first-time buyers. A lot will, however, hinge on the supply of building materials and other inputs as well as labor.
""The recent slowdown in project completions has limited home sales in new communities,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""That said, the growing backlog of projects should keep builders busy for the next couple of years.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated again in October, matching a February 2003 high, led by sharp rises in gasoline and housing prices, data showed on Wednesday, with analysts expecting more heat ahead.
Inflation rose to 4.7%, in line with expectations, up from 4.4% in September, Statistics Canada data showed. It was the seventh consecutive month in which headline inflation topped the Bank of Canada's 1-3% control range.
Prices rose in all eight major component groups for the second month in a row. Analysts said that trend was likely to continue.
""There is more heat ahead, particularly with the Vancouver port disruptions. And I think we are going to get inflation crossing well above 5% by the end of the year,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of capital market economics at Scotiabank.
Rail access to Canada's largest port, the Port of Vancouver, has been cut off by deadly flooding and landslides in the West Coast province of British Columbia.
CPI common, which the central bank calls the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was unchanged at 1.8%. 
""This doesn't change anything for the Bank of Canada. This is in line with their forecast,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities, noting that while inflation is hot, economic growth has fallen short of the central bank's expectations.

The Bank of Canada signaled last month that it could hike its overnight interest rate as early as April 2022, while warning inflation was likely to rise further this year and stay above target through most of next year.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.2% lower at 1.2580 to the greenback, or 79.49 U.S. cents.

177,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 09:27AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- American consumers are showing little sign of returning yet to their normal balance of spending on services over goods, with a heavy reliance on imported products, according to two indicators based on shipping data.
Flexport Inc.’s Post-Covid Indicator shows a reading of 123 for December, up from 122 in November and the 11th straight month above 100 -- the baseline set in mid-2020 to show how consumer spending patterns shifted after the initial coronavirus outbreaks and lockdowns.
For six decades before the pandemic, U.S. household spending on goods declined proportionately as Americans spent more on services. That trend flipped last year amid lockdowns and travel restrictions.
The Flexport index aims to pinpoint the return to pre-pandemic consumer behavior. It anticipates the goods-and-services shares of U.S. personal consumption expenditures as released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and also factors in data from the company’s shipper customers. Goods’ share of PCE averaged about 31% for four years preceding the Covid-19 pandemic, climbing to an average of 34% from June to October 2020.
Conventional wisdom holds that as the pandemic subsides, people will shift back to their usual amount of spending on services like leisure travel and restaurants, relieving pressure on strained global supply chains. Until that happens, the current demand patterns are “likely to leave spending on goods versus services well above pre-pandemic levels, contributing to continued logistics network congestion,” Flexport said on Wednesday.
Separately, the San Francisco-based company said its Trade Activity Forecast calls for growth of U.S. merchandise imports of 15% in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. “Looking further ahead, a slowdown in January and February linked to normal seasonality and the Lunar New Year holiday is expected to be followed by a renewed expansion in demand,” it said.

The Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which tracks repeat sales of single-family homes in 11 major Canadian markets, remained unchanged in October from the previous month. Price growth has been slowing for the last five months. 
""The slowdown in price growth can be linked to the slowdown in housing sales reported in recent months,"" Daren King, an economist at National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF), said in a statement.
""However, prices could start to rise again in the coming months given the very limited supply of properties for sale."" 
Seven of the 11 major markets rose, led by a 0.9% gain in Hamilton, Ontario. Prices were flat in Winnipeg and fell in Montreal, Vancouver and Ottawa-Gatineau. 

On an annual basis, the index was up 15.8%, decelerating for the second consecutive month after it notched record annual growth in August. Halifax led the annual index with a 30.3% gain, while Hamilton registered a 26.5% gain.

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation has hit a 10-year high as household energy bills rocket, bolstering expectations the Bank of England will raise interest rates in December just weeks after it rocked markets by keeping borrowing costs on hold.
Consumer prices rose by 4.2% in annual terms in October, leaping from a 3.1% increase in September, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. 
The BoE and a Reuters poll of economists - none of whom predicted such a big jump - had pointed to a reading of 3.9%.
""Today's inflation data will reinforce the Bank of England's resolve to act,"" Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said.
The pound climbed briefly to a one-week high versus the U.S. dollar and a 21-month high against the euro. [GBP/]
Finance minister Rishi Sunak said rising inflation was not just a British problem and the government was taking action to offset the hit to spending power, even as it scales back most of its coronavirus emergency support.
Britain's inflation rate puts it in the middle of the pack among G7 countries, with annual U.S. consumer price inflation now running north of 6%.
Household energy bills were the biggest driver of inflation following the lifting of a regulatory cap on bills last month, with gas prices paid by consumers up 28.1% in the year to October.
British energy suppliers are grappling with soaring wholesale gas prices that have led to the collapse of a number of energy companies, forcing more than 2 million customers so far to switch providers - often on higher tariffs.
But prices rose across the board with second-hand cars among the biggest drivers of the inflation acceleration.
The BoE - which has a target of 2% inflation - has said higher borrowing costs can do nothing to influence energy prices. But some of its policymakers are concerned that high inflation could harm its credibility in the eyes of the public.
Forecasts by the BoE show it expects inflation to hit around 5% in the coming months before falling back.
The BoE looks poised to become the first of the world's major central banks to raise rates since the coronavirus pandemic swept the global economy. Investors and economists are increasingly predicting that will happen on Dec. 16.
On Monday BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said he was ""very uneasy"" about the inflation outlook and that his vote to keep rates on hold earlier this month had been a very close call.
Futures markets now fully price in a 15 basis-point rate hike in December, and show a roughly two-thirds chance of another 25 basis-point hike in February, taking Bank Rate to 0.5% from its current all-time low of 0.1%.
On Tuesday, data suggested Britain's labour market was withstanding the end of the government's job-protecting furlough scheme, a key factor for the BoE and its decision on rates.
Robert Alster, chief investment officer at wealth manager Close Brothers Asset Management, cautioned, however, against assuming a BoE rate hike next month was a done deal.
""Ultimately, the impact of rising inflation on consumer spending and confidence will be a critical measure of stability, and determine how hawkish the Bank needs to be,"" he said. ""We may well see the rate rise kicked into 2022.""
Ben Lord, a portfolio manager at M&G Investments, said tax rises and less pandemic emergency spending by the government in early 2022, combined with the end of the BoE's bond-buying stimulus programme, posed risks for Britain's economy.

There were signs in Wednesday's data of further inflation pressure in the pipeline. Prices charged by factories rose by more than expected, up 8% compared with October 2020, the sharpest increase since 2011.
Manufacturers' input costs jumped by 13%, the most since 2008, the ONS said.

Eurostat said inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.8% month-on-month in October, for a 4.1% year-on-year surge, in line with an earlier Eurostat estimate. 
The ECB wants to keep inflation at 2.0% over the medium term and has said the inflation surge was temporary. The bank expects price growth to slow during 2022, but admitted it would take longer than initially expected.
Breaking down the year-on-year total, more expensive energy added 2.21 percentage points, services added 0.86 points, food alcohol and tobacco added 0.43 points and non energy industrial goods 0.55 points, Eurostat said.
Without the volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, a measure the ECB calls core inflation, prices rose 0.3% on the month for a 2.1% year-on-year gain. 
An even narrower measure, looked at by many economists, that additionally excludes alcohol and tobacco showed prices rising 0.3% on the month, but only 2.0% on the year.

With inflation already twice its target and likely rising further later this year, the ECB is coming under increased pressure to abandon its ultra easy monetary policy and tackle price growth that is eroding households' purchasing power.
But tightening monetary policy now could choke off the post-pandemic economic recovery, ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Monday, pushing back on calls and market bets for tighter policy.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports snapped seven months of double-digit growth in October due to slowing car shipments, as global supply constraints hit the country's major manufacturers.
The slowing growth shows Japan's vulnerability to supply chain bottlenecks that have been particularly disruptive for the car industry and have clouded the outlook for trade.
Exports rose 9.4% year-on-year in October, Ministry of Finance data showed on Wednesday, slightly below a median market forecast for a 9.9% increase in a Reuters poll. It followed 13.0% growth in the prior month and was the weakest expansion since a decline in February. Car shipments fell 36.7%.
""While carmakers are planning 'revenge production' in November and December, clouds still loom - semiconductor shortages will last until year-end at least, and no one knows if carmakers' plans to avert the impact of chip shortages by adjusting their supply chains would succeed,"" said Ryosuke Katagi, market economist at Mizuho Securities.
""Dragged down by staple cars, sluggish export growth will last for the rest of 2021.""
By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, increased 9.5% in the 12 months to October, slowing from 10.3% in the previous month as car shipments to the country fell 46.8%.
U.S.-bound shipments, another key market for Japanese goods, grew just 0.4% in October, also weighed by declining car exports, which fell 46.4%.
Imports rose 26.7% in the year to October, below forecasts for a 31.9% increase, bringing the trade balance to a deficit of 67.4 billion yen ($586.60 million), compared with the median estimate for a 310.0 billion yen deficit.
Separate government data showed core machinery orders, which serve as a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, were flat in September from the prior month, missing an expected 1.8% gain.
The weaker-than-expected core orders signal corporate Japan's reluctance to commit to firmer capital spending as supply bottlenecks pose a risk to the outlook.
Manufacturers expected core orders to rise 3.1% in October-December, after a 0.7% gain in the previous quarter.
Japan's economy shrank faster than expected in the third quarter due to declining consumption, business spending and exports, which suffered from a resurgence in COVID-19 infections and chip and parts supply disruptions.

The government is expected to announce a fiscal stimulus package worth ""several tens of trillion yen"" on Friday, aimed at easing the pain of the COVID-19 pandemic and reviving the economy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales surged in October as Americans eagerly started their holiday shopping early to avoid empty shelves amid shortages of some goods because of the ongoing pandemic, giving the economy a lift at the start of the fourth quarter.
The solid report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday suggested high inflation was not yet dampening spending, even as worries about the rising cost of living sent consumer sentiment tumbling to a 10-year low in early November. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market and house prices, as well as massive savings and wage gains appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual inflation in three decades.
""It's more important to look at what consumers do than what they say,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""They are concerned about higher inflation, but they are still in good shape and are continuing to spend."" 
Retail sales jumped 1.7% last month, the largest gain since March, after rising 0.8% in September. It was the third straight monthly advance and topped economists' expectations for a 1.4% increase. Sales soared 16.3% year-on-year in October and are 21.4% above their pre-pandemic level.
Several of the top U.S. retailers this week have noted an earlier start to holiday shopping. While this could lead to declines in November and December, economists and retailers expect holiday sales this year will be the best in a while. 
""Today's numbers show that consumers are getting a jump on their holiday shopping,"" said Matthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation in Washington. ""We continue to urge consumers to shop early and shop safely, and we fully expect this holiday season to be one for the record books.""
Retail sales are mostly made up of goods, with services, including healthcare, education and hotel accommodation, making up the remaining portion of consumer spending. The nearly two-year long COVID-19 pandemic has caused an acute shortage of labor, delaying deliveries of raw materials to factories as well as shipments of finished goods to markets.
October's broad increase in sales partly reflected higher prices as monthly consumer inflation surged 0.9% in October, which boosted the annual rate to 6.2%. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher on the data and also as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) forecast a strong holiday quarter. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

BROAD GAINS
Sales were led by motor vehicles, with receipts at auto dealerships advancing 1.8% after gaining 1.2% in September. The rise reflected the first increase in unit sales in six months, as well as higher prices. The tight supply of automobiles because of a global semiconductor shortage is driving up prices.
Sales at service stations increased 3.9%, boosted by more expensive gasoline. Online retail sales rebounded 4.0%. Receipts at building material stores advanced 2.8%. There were also increases in receipts at furniture outlets as well as sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Sales at electronics and appliance stores rebounded 3.8%. 
But sales at clothing stores fell 0.7%. Sales at restaurants and bars were unchanged despite an ebb in COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report. These sales were up 29.3% from last October. 
Economists speculated that either high inflation was forcing consumers to cut back on eating out or that spending had permanently shifted in favor of goods.
""If services spending has largely recovered, strong goods demand increasingly looks to be a structural shift in consumer preferences, rather than a temporary COVID-related outcome,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales shot up 1.6% last month after rising 0.5% in September. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Adjusting for inflation, retail sales are up at a roughly 5% annualized rate from the third-quarter average. 
Core retail sales: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gkvlgdayzpb/retailcore.png 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity rose at a tepid 1.7% rate last quarter. Economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) boosted their fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 5% rate from a 4% pace. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised its estimate by 0.5 percentage point to a 5.0% rate. The economy grew at a 2% rate in the third quarter. 
The economic picture was further brightened by a separate report from the Federal Reserve on Tuesday showing manufacturing output surged 1.2% last month to its highest level since March 2019, after falling 0.7% in September.
""The economy has thrown off whatever lethargy it might have had in the summer, and it is growing quite strongly,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.

Businesses are also making steady progress replenishing depleted inventories, which should help to keep factories humming and support the economy. Business inventories increased 0.7% in September, a third report from the Commerce Department showed.

The value of Japan’s overseas shipments increased 9.4% from a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Finance on Wednesday. Economists had expected a gain of 10.3%. 
The figures come just a couple of days before Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is expected to unveil a package of measures to get the economy back on track, including some steps to shore up Japan’s supplies of semiconductors.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“Looking ahead, we expect exports to drop in November, pressured by softer Chinese demand. Chip shortages also remain a downside risk for exports.”

A weakening export trend places more importance on Kishida coming up with ways to help boost consumer spending in support of the economy rather than relying on external demand. The economy shrank an annualized 3% from July to September, with exports dropping 8.3% from the previous quarter. 
The premier is looking to take steps to normalize activity in the economy now that about three quarters of the population is fully vaccinated. 
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. offered a glimmer of hope last week that global supply chains were recovering from the recent squeeze. After a series of output cuts, Japan’s biggest automaker said all of its domestic production lines will be operating normally in December for the first time in seven months, according to a statement by the company.

184,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 10:11AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Production at U.S. factories rebounded more than expected in October as the drag from Hurricane Ida faded and motor vehicle output picked up, but manufacturing continues to be constrained by shortages of raw materials and labor.
Manufacturing output surged 1.2% last month to its highest level since March 2019, after falling 0.7% in September, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing production rising 0.7%.
Output increased 4.5% compared to October 2020. Manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy, is being underpinned by businesses desperate to rebuild depleted inventories.
Spending shifted to goods from services over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, straining global supply chains. Raw materials such semiconductors are in short supply. Workers are also scarce, hampering the delivery of materials to factories as well as the shipment of finished goods to markets.
Even with spending rotating back to services as coronavirus infections driven by the Delta variant subside, demand for goods remains strong.
Production at auto plants rebounded 11.0% last month after declining for two straight months. Excluding autos, manufacturing output rose 0.6% in October.
Consumer goods production rebounded 1.4%. But machinery production dropped 1.3% because of an ongoing strike at John Deere (NYSE:DE). Last month's jump in manufacturing output combined with a 4.1% rebound in mining and a 1.2% rise in utilities to boost industrial production by 1.6%. That followed a 1.3% drop in September.

Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, increased 0.9 percentage point in October to 76.7%, the highest since January 2019. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector rose to 76.4% from 75.2% in September. It is 3.2 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

Import prices accelerated 1.2% last month after gaining 0.4% in September, the Labor Department said on Tuesday. In the 12 months through October, prices jumped 10.7% after rising 9.3% in September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, increasing 1.0%.
The government reported last week a broad-based surge in both consumer and producer prices in October. Inflation is being fueled by fiscal stimulus and strained global supply chains related to the nearly two-year long COVID-19 pandemic.
Imported fuel prices soared 8.6% last month after increasing 3.9% in September. Petroleum prices advanced 8.1%, while the cost of imported food rose 0.8%. 

Excluding fuel and food, import prices gained 0.3%. These so-called core import prices were unchanged in September and were up 5.0% on a year-on-year basis in October.
The report also showed export prices shot up 1.5% in October after rising 0.4% in September. Prices for agricultural exports rebounded 1.0%. Nonagricultural export prices powered ahead 1.5%. Export prices surged 18.0% year-on-year in October, the biggest increase since the series was first published in September 1983. Prices rose 16.5% from a year ago in September.

186,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. retail sales rose in October for a third month as higher prices boosted merchant receipts and household demand remained resilient. 
The value of overall retail purchases increased 1.7% last month, the most in seven months, following a upwardly revised 0.8% advance in September, Commerce Department figures showed Tuesday. Excluding gas and motor vehicles, sales gained 1.4% in October. The figures aren’t adjusted for price changes.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 1.4% advance in overall retail sales.
The broad-based gain in spending highlights how elevated savings and rising wages have helped Americans sustain a robust pace of merchandise spending. Though total retail sales are well-above pre-pandemic levels, a recent inflation-driven collapse in consumer sentiment risks a future tempering in demand.
U.S. prices are rising at the fastest pace in 30 years as businesses pass on growing labor and input costs to customers, but it’s hard to tell just how much that’s impacting demand since the figures aren’t adjusted for inflation. Inflation-adjusted consumer spending data for October will be released next week.
Results from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and  Home Depot  Inc. (NYSE:HD) earlier on Tuesday showed households are broadly maintaining robust demand for merchandise even as higher inflation squeezes purchasing power. Comparable sales at Walmart in the latest quarter exceeded forecasts while home-improvement retailer Home Depot reported stronger-than-expected results.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's job market withstood the end of the government's furlough scheme last month, according to data which could ease lingering concerns at the Bank of England about the risks of raising interest rates from their pandemic low.
Sterling strengthened as the number of staff on businesses' payrolls in October rose to 0.8% above levels in February 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic hit, and increased by 160,000 on the month.
The Bank of England has been watching closely in case unemployment rose after the job-protecting furlough scheme expired at the end of September.
""Now that today's labour market data shows that hurdle has been cleared, we think the Bank of England has the green light for interest rate lift-off at their December meeting,"" Ambrose Crofton, a global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said.
The BoE's next monetary policy announcement is scheduled for Dec. 16.
But Andrew Goodwin at Oxford Economics, a consultancy, said the BoE might need more time to assess the strains facing many consumers from inflation set to hit almost 5% in April, when workers will also have to pay more tax.
""Given the cost of living challenges facing households and a full assessment of furlough's end arguably needing several months' worth of data, we narrowly think the MPC will delay rate lift-off until February,"" Goodwin said.
The Office for National Statistics said it was possible that people made redundant at the end of the furlough scheme would continue to appear as in work in the data for a few further months, while they worked out their notice period. 
""However, responses to our business survey suggest that the numbers made redundant were likely to be a small share of those still on furlough at the end of September 2021,"" the ONS said.
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DOWN
Official data published by the ONS on Tuesday showed the unemployment rate fell by more than expected to 4.3% for the three months to September from 4.5% before, its lowest since the three months to July 2020. 
Employment rose by 247,000 in the July-September period, more than a predicted increase of 185,000 in the Reuters poll, while the number of unemployed fell by 152,000.
The ONS said average weekly earnings in the July-September period were 5.8% higher than in the same three months of 2020, the smallest annual increase since April.
Excluding bonuses, earnings were 4.9% higher than a year earlier, the smallest rise since the three months to March. 
The ONS estimated the underlying pace of growth in wages - taking into account workers going back on full pay after furlough and how job losses during the coronavirus lockdowns fell most heavily on lower-paid workers - stood between 3.4% and 4.9% for pay excluding bonuses.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey has said Tuesday's jobs data and another release due in four weeks' time will be critical for the central bank's thinking about whether to raise the Bank Rate for the first time since the pandemic struck.
""The anecdotes suggest the transition out of the furlough scheme has not raised unemployment but we don't really know the full story,"" Bailey told lawmakers on Monday. But he added that he thought the labour market was ""considerably tighter"".
Tuesday's data showed job vacancies hit an all-time high of 1.172 million in the three months to October, almost 400,000 more than before the pandemic, although the pace of growth slowed again.
The Resolution Foundation, a think tank, said it was taking only one-and-a-half months on average for an employer to fill a vacancy, matching a record-quick time seen before the pandemic.

""This shows that record vacancies are being driven by the economy reopening, rather than it being impossible to hire staff as some have suggested,"" it said.
Employers in some sectors such as food processing and road haulage say post-Brexit restrictions on workers from the European Union are making it harder for them to fill positions.

The report showed few signs that inflation is coming off the boil. The gauge of prices received climbed 7.3 points to 50.8, while a measure of prices paid for materials increased to 83, the second-highest on record. 
Robust demand is powering factory job growth as well, with the New York Fed’s measure surging 8.9 points to a record 26. The average workweek also advanced.
Delivery times lengthened, and the group’s gauge of shipments advanced to a four-month high.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's economy contracted much faster than expected in the third quarter as global supply disruptions hit exports and business spending while new COVID-19 cases soured the consumer mood, undermining efforts to stoke a virtuous growth cycle.
While many analysts expect the world's third-largest economy to rebound this quarter as virus curbs ease, worsening global production bottlenecks pose increasing risks to export-reliant Japan.
""The contraction was far bigger than expected due to supply-chain constraints, which hit car output and capital spending hard,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""We expect the economy to stage a rebound this quarter but the pace of recovery will be slow as consumption did not get off to a good start even after COVID-19 curbs were eased late in September."" 
The economy shrank an annualised 3.0% in July-September after a revised 1.5% gain in the second quarter, preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) data showed on Monday, much worse than a median market forecast of a 0.8% contraction.
The weak GDP contrasts with more promising readings from other advanced countries such as the United States, where the economy expanded 2.0% in the third quarter on strong pent-up demand.
In China, factory output and retail sales unexpectedly rose in October, data on Monday showed, despite supply shortages and new COVID-19 curbs.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, Japan's GDP fell 0.8% compared with market forecasts for a 0.2% decline.
Some analysts said Japan's heavy dependence on the auto industry meant its economy was more vulnerable to trade disruptions than other countries.
Shinichiro Kobayashi, principal economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting, said automakers make up a large part of Japan's manufacturing sector with a wide range of subcontractors directly affected.
STIMULUS PLAN
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced plans to compile a large-scale economic stimulus package worth ""several tens of trillion yen"" on Friday, but some economists were sceptical about its impact on growth near-term.
The package will feature a plan to urgently strengthen the chip industry while the government will also formulate a strategy for storage batteries, key to the green and digital growth areas, trade minister Koichi Hagiuda said.
However, some analysts were sceptical about the impact of the stimulus.
""The package will likely be a mixed bag of near-term and long-term growth measures, and the focus may be blurred, so it won't have much impact near-term,"" Norinchukin's Minami said.
Consumption fell 1.1% in July-September from the previous quarter after a 0.9% gain in April-June.
Capital expenditure also decreased 3.8% after rising a revised 2.2% in the previous quarter.
Domestic demand shaved off 0.9% point to GDP growth.
Exports lost 2.1% in July-September from the previous quarter as trade was hurt by chip shortages and supply-chain constraints.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect Japan's economy to expand an annualised 5.1% in the current quarter, as consumer activity and auto output pick up.
However, Japanese firms still face risks from higher commodity costs and supply bottlenecks, which threaten to undermine the economic outlook over the short- to mid-term.
Real GDP, which factors in the effects of inflation, won't return to pre-pandemic levels until the second half of 2023, said Takahide Kiuchi, a former Bank of Japan board member who now serves as chief economist at Nomura Research Institute.

""China's slowdown, supply constraints, rising energy prices and a slowdown in inflation-hit Western countries will reduce the pace of growth towards mid-2022,"" Kiuchi said.
""As exports remain severe, Japan's economy will likely undergo moderate growth of around 1%-2% annualised in the second quarter onwards, even taking effects of stimulus into account.""

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's industrial output and retail sales grew more quickly than expected in October, despite fresh curbs to control COVID-19 outbreaks and supply shortages, but the slowing property sector weighed on the economic outlook.
Output grew 3.5% in October from the same period a year ago, official data showed on Monday, accelerating from a 3.1% increase in September. Retail sales growth also picked up.
The industrial output growth beat expectations of a 3.0% year-on-year increase in a Reuters poll of analysts, but remained the second lowest print this year.
The world's second-largest economy had staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic slump, but has since lost momentum as it grapples with a slowing manufacturing sector, debt problems in the property market and COVID-19 outbreaks.
""Economic momentum remained weak in October, with the real estate downturn weighing on industry,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, in a note.
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data also showed retail sales accelerated even as China imposed fresh restrictions to fight a new wave of COVID-19 cases in the north.
Retail sales rose 4.9% year-on-year in October, beating expectations for 3.5% growth and after a 4.4% increase in September.
""Growth will likely weaken in the rest of this year,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. 
""The COVID outbreak has forced more cities to tighten travel restrictions, which will likely affect the service sector adversely in November. The property sector slowdown is getting worse,"" Zhang said, adding this was ""the key risk for the macro outlook in the next few quarters.""
NBS data showed property investment and sales growth continued to slow over January-October compared with the first nine months, and new construction starts measured by floor area fell.
Sentiment in China's property market has been shaken by a deepening debt crisis, with property giant China Evergrande and Kaisa Group grappling with looming defaults.
POLICY MEASURES
China's sprawling manufacturing sector has slowed this year after a blistering recovery from the COVID-19 slump, with electricity shortages and production cuts hampering production in recent months. 
""We expect policymakers to take more easing measures to prevent growth from falling too much,"" said Oxford's Kuijs, adding that weaker demand is driving the broader industry slowdown rather than just supply constraints.
Easing measures should start to have an effect early next year, he said. 
Policy sources and analysts have told Reuters that China's central bank will likely move cautiously on loosening monetary policy to bolster the economy, as slowing economic growth and soaring factory inflation fuel concerns over stagflation.
Signs of stagflation are caused by short-term factors like high international commodity prices, said Fu Linghui, an NBS spokesman, at a briefing in Beijing on Monday. 
Fixed asset investment continued to slow, the NBS data showed, rising 6.1% in the first 10 months from the same period a year earlier, compared with the 6.2% increase tipped by a Reuters poll and the 7.3% rise in January-September.

""We think macro policies are close to a turning point. We expect the government will boost fiscal spending around year end to stabilize the weakening trend in investment,"" said Zhang.
The more upbeat output data stood in contrast to the country's official manufacturing survey for October. China's official purchasing managers' index https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-factory-activity-contracts-second-month-official-pmi-2021-10-31 showed factory activity declined for a second straight month in October, hurt by persistently high raw material prices and softer domestic demand.

Investing.com – China’s industrial output grew surprisingly faster in October, despite the latest wave of COVID-19 cases in the country and supply shortages.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), released earlier in the day, showed that industrial production grew 3.5% year-on-year. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 3% growth while a 3.1% growth was recorded in September.
Retail sales also picked up, with a growth rate of 4.9%, higher than forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicting a 3.5% growth. A 4.4% growth was recorded in September.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9%.
However, fixed asset investment grew 6.1% year-on-year in October, slower than the 7.3% growth recorded in September as well as forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicting a 6.2% growth.
China’s manufacturing sector has slowed down in 2021 due to power shortages and higher raw material prices. But October saw a rebound as power shortages, a key constraint on industrial output in September, eased, with power supply climbing 11.1% in October from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg.
“The national economy was generally stable and maintained the trend of recovery,” the NBS said in a statement. “However, we must be aware that the international environment is still complicated and severe with many unstable and uncertain factors.”
Retail sales benefited from pre-sales ahead of the Single’s Day shopping festival, also, the National Holiday in October drove the catering and accommodation sales, NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said at a briefing.
Meanwhile, concerns about China’s property market remained, as property giants China Evergrande Group and Kaisa Group continue to steer towards looming defaults.
The government is expected to maintain curbs, which might lead to weaker growth into 2022, and GDP growth is also expected to slow down. GDP growth is expected to slow to 3.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021, hit 8% for 2021, and weaken to 5.4% in 2022, according to a Bloomberg survey.
“Growth will likely weaken in the rest of this year,” said Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd. “The slowdown in the property sector continued, which is the key risk for the macro-outlook in the next few quarters.”"

Online property portal Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said the average asking price, which is not adjusted for seasonal variations, stood at 342,401 pounds ($459,057) in November - up 6.3% in annual terms.
Asking prices have fallen in each November since 2007 as the market enters an end-of-year slowdown before activity picks up again after the holidays.
""That is likely to push prices higher again, and increase the competition from other buyers,"" said Tim Bannister, Rightmove director of property data.
A survey of chartered surveyors last week showed house price inflation in Britain picked up last month, propelled by a shortage of sellers that also suggested further price rises lay ahead.
Other surveys have similarly pointed to continued house price growth since July when a year-long exemption from the stamp duty tax on house purchases was halved in scale in England and Northern Ireland and expired altogether in Wales.

Scotland ended the incentive in April and it expired in its entirety in England and Northern Ireland at the end of September.

(Reuters) - The number of Americans voluntarily quitting their jobs rose to a record high in September while job openings stayed stubbornly above pre-pandemic levels, a sign that businesses may have to continue to raise wages in order to attract workers.
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, released on Friday, reflects an uneven economy with strong demand grinding against labor and goods shortages, driving overall inflation to its biggest annual gain in 31 years.
Wage inflation shows few signs of abating even as the daily case rate of coronavirus infections ebbs, with employers in almost every industry competing to lure workers and three million fewer people in the labor force compared to pre-pandemic levels.
The scramble for workers boosted wage growth to an annual increase to 4.9% in October, although this has been outstripped by overall inflation, leading to a fall in real earnings. 
A separate survey by the University of Michigan, also on Friday, showed consternation among consumers with sentiment on the economy falling to a decade low, with few believing policymakers are taking sufficient steps to tackle inflation.
Quits rose by about 164,000 in September, lifting the total to a record high of 4.4 million. The quits rate is seen as a good measure of labor market confidence as workers leave when they are more secure in their ability to find a new job.
There were 56,000 people who quit in the arts, entertainment and recreation industry while 47,000 left in the other services category. State and local government education saw 30,000 departures.
""The continued surge in quits points to wage growth of between 4.5%-5.0%, well above rates that would be consistent with inflation falling sustainably back towards the Fed's 2% target,"" said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York, following the report.
The Federal Reserve has so far resisted calls to take stronger action to combat higher-than-expected inflation, arguing that it remains transitory even if it persists well into next year. The central bank announced at its last meeting that it will begin to taper its massive bond buying program this month, seen as precursor move to raising interest rates from their current level near zero. Investors currently expect a rate liftoff in mid 2022.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, edged down by 191,000 to 10.4 million on the last day of September. Hiring also remained largely unchanged at 6.5 million in September. The number of job openings was little changed in all four regions with vacancies increasing most in healthcare and social assistance, and state and local government, excluding education. 
The government reported last Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 531,000 in October after posting gains of 312,000 in September. Job growth has averaged 582,000 per month this year. 
(GRAPHIC: JOLTS - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/myvmnkbdapr/jolts.png) 
Labor shortages could persist a while longer even as the Delta wave of COVID-19 infections slide from their mid-September high. All-time high savings fueled by government aid, as well as a strong stock market and record house price gains, look set to continue to provide a short-term buffer as workers weigh up when to re-enter the jobs market. Higher-than-normal early retirements are also playing a role.
That said, there is hope that with infections declining and schools fully reopened for in-person learning, more people will rejoin the labor force once excess savings helped by the generous government aid, some of which has ended, is depleted.
CONSUMER SENTIMENT AT DECADE LOW
Fewer Americans are feeling better about the economics outlook, at least in the short term. U.S. consumer sentiment plunged in early November to the lowest level since November 2011 as surging inflation cut into households' living standards, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey showed. Its index dropped to 66.8 in its preliminary November reading from October's final reading of 71.7. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 72.4. 
(GRAPHIC: UMich - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gkplgdjmdvb/umich.png) 
""One-in-four consumers cited inflationary reductions in their living standards in November, with lower income and older consumers voicing the greatest impact,"" Richard Curtin, the survey's director, said in a statement.
There is a ""growing belief among consumers that no effective policies have yet been developed to reduce the damage from surging inflation,"" he added. 
(GRAPHIC: UMich inflation expectations - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gkvlgdbrbpb/umich-inflation.png) 

Consumers see inflation in the year ahead accelerating at a 4.9% pace, the fastest since 2008, though they continue to expect it to abate over the medium term, with the five-year outlook at 2.9%, the survey showed.
The survey's consumer expectations index fell to 62.8 - the lowest since October 2013 - from 67.9 in October. Its gauge of current conditions slid to 73.2 - the lowest since August 2011 - from 77.7.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Malaysia's economy shrank 4.5% in the third quarter, contracting by more than expected after its rebound in the second quarter, but the central bank expects a quick recovery as coronavirus restrictions are eased and economic activities resume. 
The third quarter performance was markedly worse than the median forecast for a 1.3% year-on-year contraction from a Reuters poll of economists.
But Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) said recent indicators suggested a more positive momentum going forward.
A pickup in production and construction activities, an improved labour market, and strong external demand would all support a recovery, the central bank said, projecting economic growth between 5.5%-6.5% in 2022. 
""The growth outlook remains subject to COVID-19 risk factors globally and domestically, stability in global financial markets and gradual easing of supply chain disruptions,"" BNM Governor Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus cautioned during a news conference.
Malaysia is also set to benefit from strong growth among its major trading partners such as China and the United States, higher commodity prices, and robust demand for semiconductors to cater for remote work equipment and business digitalisation, she said. 
A surge in COVID-19 cases and the reimposition of movement curbs have weighed on consumption and investment activity, with the central bank cutting https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/malaysia-cbank-slashes-2021-growth-outlook-covid-19-surge-lockdowns-2021-08-13 the country's growth outlook for 2021 to 3%-4% in August.

Japan’s economy continues to sputter and is expected to have shrunk for the fifth quarter in two years as Prime Minister Fumio Kishida puts the finishing touches on a stimulus package aimed at shoring up the recovery.
Economists estimate gross domestic product contracted an annualized 0.7% in the three months to September, dragged down by private consumption as the country battled a Covid resurgence and global supply-chain constraints that hit production at automakers Toyota and Honda.
After the data’s release on Monday, Kishida is expected to unveil his stimulus measures at the end of the week. A bigger-than-expected contraction could inflate their size.
The economic package will give the clearest indication yet of how aggressively the premier aims to bump up growth over the short run and realize a fairer form of capitalism over the longer term. 
Economists had long expected the wave of infections that occurred around the time of the Tokyo Olympics to weigh on the economy’s performance over the summer as emergency restrictions were extended through September. 
Japan’s recovery has been weaker than all other Group of Seven countries and is expected to stay that way through next year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Still, the consensus view of an overall contraction stems from recent figures showing that, outside the peak of the pandemic, factory production slumped in the summer quarter by the largest margin since the 2011 tsunami. That shows the impact of supply-chain constraints and chip shortages that prompted Toyota to cut output by around 40% in September.
“There was the big negative impact of the state of emergency, as well as a large decline in car-related production,” said economist Harumi Taguchi at IHS Markit. 
An underwhelming performance will set the backdrop for the stimulus package expected on Nov. 19. Surveyed economists expect it to be around 30 trillion yen ($260 billion) in size though much of it could be recycled cash from previous stimulus.
Among the key measures expected are handouts of around $880 for those 18 years old and under, a pay increase for caregivers, and bigger tax incentives for companies that raise pay. Domestic travel subsidies that briefly revived the hospitality sector last year are also likely to be relaunched despite lingering concerns over their potential to spread Covid.
Kishida hopes his measures will also encourage stronger wages that spread the benefits of growth to a wider segment of the population, while nudging firms to take a longer-term perspective.
Economists expect the stimulus package to be helpful, but not a game changer that transforms Japan’s capitalist model. 
“If you look at the suggestions of Kishida’s new capitalism panel, apart from the wage hike efforts, it’s really just a rehashing of past policies dating back to the previous Suga administration and earlier,” said economist Takashi Miwa at Nomura Securities Co.

The Commission said gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro would grow 5.0% this year after a 6.4% recession in 2020. It forecast growth of 4.3% in 2022 and 2.4% in 2023. Its forecast in May for 2021 growth was only 4.3%.
""Our measures to cushion the blow of the pandemic and to ramp up vaccinations across the EU have clearly contributed to this success,"" European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said.
The Commission said inflation would reach 2.4% in 2021, up from 0.3% in 2020, before slowing to 2.2% in 2022 and 1.4 in 2023. The peak in price increases is to come in the last four months of this year, and then slow gradually throughout 2022. 
The fast growth and the gradual withdrawal of emergency government support for the economy will help reduce the aggregate budget deficit of the euro zone to 7.1% of GDP this year from 7.2% in 2020 and then to 3.9% in 2022 and 2.4% in 2023, the Commission forecast.
Public debt, which is to peak at an aggregate 100% of GDP for the euro zone this year, is to fall to 97.9% in 2022 and 97.0% in 2023 -- a faster reduction than forecast in May.

""There are three key threats to this positive picture: a marked increase in COVID cases, most acute in areas where vaccinations are relatively low; rising inflation, driven largely by a spike in energy prices; and supply-chain
disruptions that are weighing on numerous sectors,"" European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic lagged behind that of other rich nations in the July-September period, according to official data on Thursday which underscored the interest rate dilemma facing the Bank of England.
Gross domestic product grew by 1.3%, the weakest three-month growth since Britain was under lockdown in early 2021. 
The Bank of England and a Reuters poll of economists had forecast an expansion of 1.5%.
The Office for National Statistics said Britain's economy remained 2.1% smaller than it was at the end of 2019, a bigger shortfall than in fellow Group of Seven countries Germany, Italy and France. 
The United States has already surpassed its pre-crisis size. Canada and Japan, the other G7 members, have yet to report third quarter growth data but had already regained more ground by the second quarter than Britain had achieved by the third quarter. 
Thursday's data showed British GDP grew by 0.6% in September - stronger than a forecast of 0.4% in the Reuters poll - but estimates for previous months were revised lower.
GDP in July fell by 0.2%, a bigger decline than a previously estimated fall of 0.1%, while output in August was shown rising by just 0.2%, weaker than an originally reported 0.4%.
""Although monthly output rebounded through the quarter from July's contraction this is more likely to reflect a temporary boost from restrictions easing,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. 
INTEREST RATES
The BoE said last week, as it kept interest rates on hold, that recent economic growth had been weaker than it had expected and it would keep a close eye on the state of the labour market after the government's job protection scheme ended on Oct. 1.
Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Markets, a consultancy, said he expected the 0.6% growth recorded in September to quickly fizzle out.
""That's one reason why we doubt the Bank of England will raise interest rates above 0.50% next year,"" he said.
The BoE last week shocked financial markets when it kept its benchmark rate at an all-time low of 0.1% even as it forecast inflation to hit almost 5%, more than double its 2% target.
September's GDP growth was helped by stronger output in the health sector as people got back to visiting their doctors after falling during the pandemic, leading to a 0.7% rise in the services sector from August.
But industrial output fell by 0.4% as gas distribution shrank for a fourth month in a row.
The world's fifth-biggest economy shrank by nearly 10% in 2020, more than most other big rich nations.
But the International Monetary Fund forecast in October that it was on track to have the fastest expansion of any G7 country in 2021 when it was expected to grow by 6.8%.
However, the quick bounce-back from lockdown seen in the spring gave way to slower growth over the summer due to a combination of rising COVID-19 cases, global supply chain problems and post-Brexit shortages of some workers.

The ONS reported a fall in underlying inventories for manufacturers in the July-September period, which it said reflected some of the recent supply chain challenges.
Separate data showed Britain's trade in goods deficit widened by 9 billion pounds in the third quarter to 42.3 billion pounds, driven by rising imports from EU and non-EU countries as exports fell - especially to non-EU countries.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's wholesale inflation hit a four-decade high in October, following a similar spike in China's factory gate prices as supply bottlenecks and rising commodity costs threatened Asian corporate profits.
The rising cost pressures, coupled with a weak yen that inflates the price of imported goods, adds to pain for the world's third-largest economy as it emerges from the consumer slump caused by the pandemic.
""Rising costs are certainly negative for corporate profits,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute. ""If the economy continues to recover, firms may be able to pass on costs (to consumers) at some point,"" he said.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for their goods and services, surged 8.0% in October from a year earlier, exceeding market expectations for a 7.0% gain, Bank of Japan data showed on Thursday.
The increase, which exceeded a revised 6.4% rise in September, was the fastest pace since comparable data became available in January 1981.
Wholesale prices rose for a range of goods including fuel, which spiked 44.5% in October from a year earlier, and timber goods, which saw prices surge 57.0%.
An index gauging yen-based wholesale import prices jumped a record 38.0% in October from a year earlier, a sign recent yen declines were pushing up already high raw material costs.
Japanese firms have so far been cautious about passing on higher costs to consumers on concern cost-sensitive households may hold back on spending. That has kept core consumer prices rising just 0.1% in September from a year earlier.
However, a slim majority of Japanese firms say they do plan to pass on or have passed on commodity costs to customers, a Reuters poll showed, a sign inflationary pressures are increasing.
That could deal a heavier blow to Japanese consumers than those in other countries given weak wage growth, heightening challenges for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in achieving his pledge to distribute more wealth to households.
""With the burden on firms and households increasing, the rise in wholesale prices has a big negative impact on the economy,"" said Toru Suehiro, an economist at Daiwa Securities.
With upper house elections expected next year, Kishida vowed to deliver a range of cash payouts to households as part of a fresh stimulus package to be compiled next week.
Commodity inflation has hit countries across the globe. China's factory gate inflation hit a 26-year high in October, further squeezing profit margins for producers and heightening stagflation concerns.

In the United States, consumer prices posted their biggest rise in 31 years in October, amid signs that inflation could stay uncomfortably high well into 2022.
Despite the new price pressures, Japan has lagged the global shift by central banks to dial back crisis-mode policies with BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda pledging to keep monetary settings ultra-loose until consumer inflation hits the elusive 2% target.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian employment suffered a shock fall in October and the jobless rate jumped as coronavirus lockdowns continued to plague the labour market, though all signs point to a rapid recovery now that the economy is reopening.
Data on Thursday from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed employment fell by 46,300 in October, confounding analysts forecasts of a 50,000 increase.
The unemployment rate climbed to 5.2%, from 4.6%, well above the 4.8% forecast, while participation rose by less than expected to 64.7% with many still unable to look for work.
The surprise likely had much to do with the timing of the jobs survey which was taken from Sept. 26 to Oct. 9 when restrictions in New South Wales were just being eased and Victoria state was still locked down.
As a result, while employment rose by 22,000 in NSW, it fell 50,000 in Victoria and dragged the national result down. Other indicators of the labour market have been much stronger as stay-at-home restrictions were steadily removed.
""The spike in the unemployment rate confirms that there will be some frictional unemployment through the next couple of months,"" said Sarah Hunter, Chief Australia Economist for BIS Oxford Economics.
""But with vacancies still running at record highs this fallout should be largely transitory.""
The soft report knocked the local dollar down 20 ticks to $0.7322 and the market slightly pared bets on an early hike in interest rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
Futures have been pricing in a first rise to 0.25% by June and rates of at least 0.75% by the end of next year, even though the central bank says any move in 2022 is ""extremely unlikely"".
FOCUS ON WAGES
Business surveys show demand for workers running strongly in the past month, while a survey of consumers out this week showed concerns about unemployment were at their lowest since the mid-1990s.
Online job site SEEK reported a 10% jump in ads in October, putting them a whopping 54% above where they were in December 2019 before the pandemic hit.
The number of applications for each job was almost 49% below pre-pandemic levels, an indicator of the tightness of the labour market as international migration has yet to re-start.
While this imbalance had produced pockets of wage heat, there was little sign as yet of the broad-based pick up that policy makers would like to see.
Key data on wages for the third quarter are due on Nov. 17 and any surprise on the high side would support the case for an earlier start to policy tightening.

Analysts look for annual wage growth to pick up to around 2.1%, from 1.7% in the second quarter, but remain well short of the 3%-plus levels the RBA is looking for.
The central bank argues further progress will be slow given the last time wages grew at 3% or more was in early 2013 and liaison with firms show an ingrained reluctance to pay more.

203,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 08:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian unemployment rose in October as the economy shed more jobs, signaling a delay in the labor market’s bounce-back back from a protracted lockdown across the nation’s eastern states. 
The jobless rate advanced to 5.2% from 4.6% in September and above economists’ forecast of 4.8%, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed Thursday. Employment fell by 46,300 roles, its third monthly decline, compared with economists’ estimate for a 50,000 increase. The participation rate edged up to 64.7% in October from 64.5%.
Australia’s benchmark three-year bond yield trimmed an earlier gain to be up 13 basis points at 1.02% while the 10-year yield was up 8 basis points at 1.81%. The Australia dollar erased its advance and dropped 0.1% to 73.20 U.S. cents.
The weaker jobs result is something of a reprieve for the Reserve Bank of Australia, under pressure from the bond market over faster consumer-price growth against a backdrop of rising global inflation concerns. That narrative was only reinforced when U.S. consumer prices rose last month at the fastest annual pace since 1990.
“It may seem counterintuitive for unemployment to rise as conditions are about to improve,” said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS. “However, this shows how unusual lockdowns are, compared with other economic shocks, in how they limit being able to work and look for work.”
The result suggests a hiring hangover from months-long lockdowns in Sydney and Melbourne, with restrictions only lifting in recent weeks. The RBA is running ultra low interest rates to support the economy and ultimately aiming to push down unemployment in order to spark faster wages growth.
The RBA sees this as its best means to return inflation sustainably to the midpoint of its 2-3% target, which policy makers expect will take about two years. Markets are more optimistic on the recovery and are challenging that view by pricing in a tightening cycle beginning next year. 
Today’s jobs report, while only one month, is likely to add ballast to Governor Philip Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) view that rates are only likely to rise from the current 0.1% in 2024.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said a net balance of 70% of its members reported an increase in house prices last month, up from a revised 69% in September.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 65%.
The October survey showed the first increase in the house price balance since May.
Other surveys have also pointed to continued house price growth since July when a year-long exemption from the stamp duty tax on house purchases was halved in scale in England and Northern Ireland and expired altogether in Wales. 
Scotland ended the incentive in April and it expired in its entirety in England and Northern Ireland at the end of September. 
RICS Chief Economist Simon Rubinsohn said expectations of higher Bank of England interest rates were a sideshow to the lack of supply of homes coming to the market. 
Last week the BoE refrained from raising rates at its November policy decision, against the expectations of many investors, but top officials at the central bank have said borrowing costs are likely to go up soon.
""The inventory on agents' books appears to have slipped back towards historic lows and this seems to be underpinning both the current price trend and expectations for the next year,"" Rubinsohn said. 

""Meanwhile although there is likely to be some drop in activity in the immediate aftermath of the expiry of the stamp duty break, most activity indicators currently remain solid. Indeed, the main challenge for buyers looking forward may once again be a lack of choice of property on the market.""
More than two-thirds of surveyors said they expected house prices to continue rising over the next 12 months, the survey showed.

205,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 02:13PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday posted a $165 billion budget deficit for October, 42% lower than the $284 billion shortfall a year earlier as personal and corporate income tax receipts surged on the back of the rebounding economy.
The October deficit was $14 billion below the median estimate among economists polled by Reuters of $179 billion.
Receipts for the first month of the federal government's fiscal year totaled $284 billion, up 19% and a record for the month of October. Individual tax receipts rose 18% to $214 billion, and corporate taxes rose 39% to $21 billion.

A Treasury official said the increases stem from the improvement in the economy after last year's widespread shutdowns from the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered a short but sharp recession. Rebounding employment is driving the increased individual taxes, while improved corporate earnings are fueling the rise in business tax receipts.
Spending also slowed notably from a year earlier, with total outlays of $449 billion, down 14% from October 2020's $522 billion. Lower Medicare outlays, which tumbled by $56 billion, or 44%, were the biggest driver, while the end of enhanced federal unemployment benefits in September was behind a 91% drop in Labor Department spending.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices accelerated in October as Americans paid more for gasoline and food, leading to the biggest annual gain in 31 years, more signs that inflation could stay uncomfortably high well into 2022 amid snarled global supply chains.
Inflation pressures are also brewing in the labor market, where an acute shortage of workers is driving wages higher. The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits fell to a 20-month low last week, other data showed on Wednesday. 
But high inflation is eroding the wage gains, adding to political risk for President Joe Biden, whose approval rating has been falling as Americans grow more anxious about the economy. Broadening inflationary pressures could also complicate the Federal Reserve's communication. The Fed last week restated that high inflation is ""expected to be transitory.""
Both the White House and the Fed have maintained that prices will fall once supply bottlenecks start easing.
""Risks are clearly shifting toward U.S. inflation remaining elevated longer than previously thought, but that doesn't mean that it's permanent,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed could face a situation where higher consumer prices begin to weigh on consumer spending, reducing GDP growth."" 
The consumer price index jumped 0.9% last month after climbing 0.4% in September, the Labor Department said. The largest gain in four months hoisted the annual increase in the CPI to 6.2%. That was the biggest year-on-year rise since November 1990 and followed a 5.4% advance in September.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI shooting up 0.6%. The broad-based increase in prices last month was led by gasoline prices, which surged 6.1% after rising 1.2% in September. Brent crude oil has gained over 60% this year as a recovering global economy is heating up demand. 
Food prices advanced 0.9%, mostly driven by meat, eggs, fish, vegetables, cereals and bakery products. It also cost more to eat away from home. But prices for alcoholic beverages fell.
The government reported on Tuesday that producer prices increased strongly in October, reversing a slowing trend in the monthly PPI that had become entrenched since spring. 
Inflation is heating up again as the economic drag from the summer wave of COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant, fades and supply bottlenecks persist. Trillions of dollars in pandemic relief from governments across the globe fueled demand for goods, leaving supply chains overstretched. 
The nearly two-year long pandemic has upended labor markets, causing a global shortage of workers needed to produce raw materials and move goods from factories to consumers.
Biden in a statement blamed the inflation surge on energy prices and said he had directed the White House National Economic Council ""to pursue means to try to further reduce these costs, and have asked the Federal Trade Commission to strike back at any market manipulation or price gouging in this sector.""
Stocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
BROAD-BASED INCREASE
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI gained 0.6% last month after climbing 0.2% in September. The so-called core CPI was boosted by rents, with owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would receive from renting a home, rising a solid 0.4%. 
The cost of hotel and motel accommodation rose 1.5%. Prices for used cars and trucks rebounded 2.5% after declining for two straight months. New motor vehicle prices increased 1.4%, marking the seventh consecutive month of gains. A global semiconductor shortage has undercut motor vehicle production. 
Healthcare costs increased 0.5%, the largest gain in 17 months. Consumers also paid more for household furnishings, recreation and grooming. The costs of motor vehicle insurance and apparel were unchanged. Air fares fell 0.7%. 
The so-called core CPI jumped 4.6% on a year-on-year basis, the largest increase since August 1991, after being steady at 4.0% for two straight months. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target increased 3.6% year-on-year in September. The U.S. central bank this month started reducing the amount of money it is injecting into the economy through monthly bond purchases.
Economists expect the Fed to start raising interest rates in late 2022.
""The heat seen in rents and across services could make the Fed begin to sweat as they wait out the return in the labor supply and easing of supply constraints over the coming months,"" said Alexander Lin, a U.S. economist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities in New York. ""Clearly the risks are for the timing of rate hikes to be pulled forward."" 
In another report on Wednesday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 267,000 for the week ended Nov. 6.
That was the lowest level since the middle of March in 2020, when the economy almost ground to a halt under the onslaught of mandatory business closures aimed at slowing the first wave of COVID-19 infections. 
Claims, which have now dropped for six straight weeks, are within striking distance of their pre-pandemic level.
The government reported last Friday that the economy added 531,000 jobs in October, with annual wage growth the largest in eight months. The labor force is down 3 million from its pre-pandemic level, making it harder to fill the 10.4 million job openings as of the of August.

Wages are, however, lagging inflation, eroding households' purchasing power. A third report from the Labor Department showed average weekly earnings adjusted for inflation fell 0.9% in October and were down 1.6% year-on-year. 
Supply constraints and high inflation helped to restrict economic growth to its slowest pace in more than a year in the third quarter.

Core inflation meanwhile increased to 5.2% year-on-year last month from 4.8% in September, central bank data showed.
Allen Sandeep of Naeem Brokerage said the monthly increase was driven by a hike in education fees of 12.7% and a 1% rise in the food index, which makes up 32.7% of the inflation index. 
""The inflation reading for October, in our view, is also reflective of the worldwide supply chain distortions, which were obvious on meat, fish, milk, cheese and eggs,"" Sandeep wrote. 
Red meat and poultry prices jumped by 4.6%, milk, cheese and eggs by 2.9%, and fish and seafood by 1.3%, he added.
Non-food inflation dropped to an annual 3.7% in October, its slowest in more than a decade, from 4.6% in September, Capital Economics said in a research note, although it warned that higher energy prices could push inflation higher again. 

""The surge in global energy prices forced the government to hike industrial gas prices by as much as 28% last week,"" the note said.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that wholesale inventories increased 1.4%, instead of 1.1% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers rose 1.3% in August. Wholesale inventories jumped 13.1% in September from a year earlier.
Motor vehicle inventories declined 1.8% after falling 0.3% in August. Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. Wholesale inventories, excluding autos, shot up 1.7% in September. This component goes into the calculation of GDP.
A slower pace of inventory decline in the third quarter accounted for all of the 2.0% annualized increase in GDP growth last quarter. Inventories were depleted in the first half of the year, but COVID-19 pandemic-related shortages are making it difficult to rebuild stocks.
Restocking is expected to underpin manufacturing and economic growth in the fourth quarter. But some economists are starting to worry that the inventory imbalance could derail the economic expansion.

""The current supply-chain disruptions are making it difficult for businesses to manage their inventories,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Therefore, it's possible that businesses are caught with excess inventories in a couple of years as they over-order today to compensate for the delays. This has caused recessions in the past and is a symptom of a boom-bust cycle.""
Sales at wholesalers rose 1.1% in September after falling 0.9% in August. At September's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.23 months to clear shelves, unchanged from August.

The consumer price index increased 6.2% from October 2020, according to Labor Department data released Wednesday. The CPI rose 0.9% from September, the largest advance in four months. 
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 5.9% gain from a year earlier in the overall CPI and a 0.6% increase from the prior month.
Against a backdrop of solid demand, businesses have been steadily raising prices for consumer goods and services at the same time supply chain bottlenecks and a shortage of qualified workers drive up costs. Many economists, including some at the Federal Reserve, expect those price pressures to persist into next year, keeping inflation elevated. 
A report on Tuesday showed prices paid to U.S. producers also accelerated last month, largely due to higher goods costs, and adding to concerns about persistent price pressures across the globe. In China, inflation at the factory level last month increased by the most in 26 years, while consumer prices in Brazil sped up by more than forecast.

BEIJING (Reuters) - New bank lending in China fell sharply in October from the previous month, but not quite as badly as forecast by analysts who expect the central bank to ease monetary policy cautiously due to risks of stagflation.
Data released on Wednesday by the People's Bank of China showed banks extended new loans of 826.2 billion yuan ($129.27 billion) in October, down sharply from 1.66 trillion in September but better than the 800 billion expected in a Reuters poll of analysts.
The new loans were higher than 689.8 billion yuan a year earlier.
""There are some signs that PBOC policy is turning more supportive in response to strains in the property sector. As such, we think this might be the trough in credit growth,"" Capital Economics said in a note. 
""But the usual lags mean that tight credit conditions will remain a headwind to economic activity for a while.""
Outstanding yuan loans grew 11.9% from a year earlier, in line with expectations and hovering at the lowest since May 2002.
Last month, central bank Governor Yi Gang said growth of China's money supply and total social financing were largely in line with nominal GDP growth, and liquidity was ample.
The PBOC is likely to move cautiously on loosening monetary policy to bolster the economy, as slowing economic growth and soaring factory inflation fuel concerns over stagflation, policy sources and analysts said. 
MORTGAGES PICKING UP 
Wen Bin, a senior economist at Minsheng Bank, said he expected the central bank to rely on targeted policy tools in the near term to support small firms and some other sectors.
On Monday, the PBOC said it would provide low-cost loans to financial institutions to help firms cut carbon emissions, supporting China's long-term carbon-neutrality goals.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimated the PBOC could provide funding support of about 1.2 trillion yuan over the coming year.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, fell to 464.7 billion yuan in October from 788.6 billion yuan in September, while corporate loans dipped to 310.1 billion yuan from 980.3 billion yuan, central bank data showed.
""Medium- to long-term household loans exceeded medium- to long-term corporate loans, indicating the pace of housing loan issuance is accelerating,"" said Zhou Hao, senior economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
New mortgage loans reached 348.1 billion yuan in October, up by 101.3 billion yuan from September, the central bank said.
Growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, was at 10.0% in October, unchanged from September. 
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
In October, TSF fell to 1.59 trillion yuan from 2.9 trillion yuan in September. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected October TSF of 1.6 trillion yuan.

Broad M2 money supply grew 8.7% from a year earlier, the central bank data showed, above the Reuters poll forecast of 8.3%. M2 rose 8.3% in September.
China's factory gate inflation hit a 26-year high in October as coal prices soared amid a power crunch in the industrial heartland, further squeezing profit margins for producers and heightening stagflation concerns.

Overall sales in the world's biggest car market were 2.33 million vehicles in October, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.
This time of year, known as ""Golden September, Silver October"", is usually a high point in sales for the industry, with consumers making purchases after staying away from showrooms during the stifling summer months.
One bright spot in the data was the strong sales of new energy vehicles (NEV), which grew 135% in October to 383,000 units, thanks to the government's promotion of greener vehicles to cut pollution. These include battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc sold 54,391 China-made vehicles in October, slightly less than 56,006 the previous month when it hit the highest monthly sales in China since it started production in Shanghai about two years ago, according to data of export, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) released on Monday.

CAAM official Chen Shihua said chip supply is easing in the fourth quarter which is helping the country's auto production to grow gradually.

Investing.com – Chinese inflation rose in October, with factory gate prices rising at their fastest pace in 26 years.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day showed that the producer price index (PPI) grew 13.5% year-on-year. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 12.4% growth and a 10.7% growth was recorded in the previous month.
The jump in PPI growth was due to imported inflation and tight domestic supply of major energy and raw materials, NBS senior statistician Dong Lijuan said in a statement accompanying the data release.
The NBS data also showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.7% month-on-month. Investing.com forecasts predicted a 0.7% growth, while a 0.1% growth was recorded in the previous month.
The CPI grew 1.5% year-on-year in October, with Investing.com forecasts predicting a 1.4% growth and a 0.7% growth recorded in the previous month. This pickup was due to factors such as weather conditions, tight supply of some goods, and rising costs, the NBS statement said.
The higher CPI also suggests that the inflation pass-through from producers to consumers has on the whole been subdued. However, there are signs that cost pressures are increasingly impacting households.
The data “implies broad-based inflation pressure on both the production side and the consumer side,” China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong Ltd. head of macro and strategy research Bruce Pang told Bloomberg.
“Inflationary pressure and the more hawkish stance of monetary policy in other major economies will likely limit China’s room to maneuver for monetary easing.”
The data comes as China’s economic recovery from COVID-19 shows signs of slowing down, with the GDP widely expected to slow further in the fourth quarter from the one-year low of 4.9% reported in the third quarter.
“The acceleration in China’s inflation in October is probably a bit of a sideshow for the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), we don’t expect PBOC to take its eye off the need to cushion a slowdown in the economy. We still expect that it will cut banks’ required reserve ratio by another 50 basis points in the next month or so,” said Bloomberg China economist David Qu."

The producer price index (PPI) climbed 13.5% from a yearearlier, faster than the 10.7% rise in September, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement.
It matched a pace not seen since July 1995 and was faster than the 12.4% forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.
Consumer price rises also quickened, although at a slower pace than factory gate prices. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.5% in October year-on-year, compared with September's 0.7% rise.
The mounting price pressures complicate deliberations for the People's Bank of China, which may now be wary of injecting monetary stimulus too quickly https://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-policy-idUSL4N2RY0AM amid concerns about fanning inflation, even as growth in the world's second-largest economy slows.
""We are concerned about the pass-through from producer prices to consumer prices,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, in a note.
Consumer prices will likely speed up in coming months as firms faced depleted inventories and are forced to pass higher costs onto customers, he added.
""The risk of stagflation continues to rise.""
Slowing economic growth and soaring factory inflation have fuelled concerns over stagflation, which could mean China has to move cautiously on loosening monetary policy.
""Rising CPI inflation and elevated PPI inflation reduces the probability of a PBoC policy rate cut,"" said Ting Lu, Chief China Economist at Nomura.
POWER STING
Upstream industries drove factory gate price rises, with coal mining and washing prices surging 103.7% from a year earlier and prices in the oil and gas extraction industry rising 59.7%.
Restrictions on carbon emissions and soaring prices of coal, a key fuel for electricity generation, led to power rationing and production cuts in recent months, although coal prices have since fallen after government intervention.
""Factory gate inflation is probably close to a peak,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note, citing coal price falls.
Several Chinese food giants have announced increases in retail prices in recent weeks, as rising production costs erode profit margins. Foshan Haitian Flavouring And Food, vinegar producer giant Jiangsu Hengshun and frozen food firm Fujian Anjoy Foods have all hike prices.

The PPI inched up 2.5% on a monthly basis, compared with the 1.2% uptick in September.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, stood at 1.3% rise in October from the previous year, higher than the 1.2% uptick in September.

The producer price index climbed 13.5% from a year earlier, beating economists’ forecasts of a 12.3% gain, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Wednesday. The consumer price index rose 1.5%, the fastest pace since September 2020 and above the projected 1.4% gain.
Producer prices in China have been rising rapidly in the past few months, first due to the global commodity price rally and then output curbs caused by a power crunch nationwide. Consumer inflation is also starting to pick up as weather-related supply problems push up food prices and manufacturers pass on higher costs to retailers. 
The data “implies broad-based inflation pressure on both the production side and the consumer side,” said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong Ltd. “Inflationary pressure and the more hawkish stance of monetary policy in other major economies will likely limit China’s room to maneuver for monetary easing.”

Pork prices, a big driver of CPI, continued to decline in October, although at a smaller magnitude than in the previous month, with deflation in food prices also easing. Vegetable prices have jumped since mid-October following supply disruptions, prompting the government to crack down on hoarders. Vegetable prices rose 15.9% from a year ago, contributing 0.33 percentage point to the increase in CPI, according to the statistics bureau. 
Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, accelerated to 1.3%. 
There are signs that upstream producers have started to pass on rising costs to downstream businesses. Several food companies have already announced price hikes of up to 15%, including Haixin Foods, Anjoy Foods and Jiajia Food, due to rising costs for raw materials.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business confidence fell to a seven-month low in November due to ongoing supply shortages, while sentiment in the services sector hit a three-month high on easing coronavirus curbs, the Reuters Tankan poll showed.
The mood among manufacturers deteriorated for the third month in November, but they became more optimistic about the outlook, according to the monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched Tankan quarterly survey next due on Dec. 13.
The sentiment index among service-sector firms picked up slightly in November, while their three-month outlook also improved, as the government eased coronavirus restrictions from the end of September due to falling COVID-19 cases, the poll found. 
The poll of 502 big and mid-sized companies conducted between Oct. 26 and Nov. 5, of which 254 responded, showed managers remained worried about supply issues and commodity inflation.
""Carmakers' output cuts due to chip shortage and soaring steel prices kept our revenue and profits below expectations,"" said a manager at a machinery company.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell to 13 in November from 16 in October - matching its lowest since April - while the service index rose to a three-month high of 1 from minus 1. 
(For a detailed table of the results, click)
While Japan's economic recovery from the COVID-induced slump has been driven by exports, with consumption hit by coronavirus restrictions, semiconductor shortages and other supply constraints have hurt manufacturers in recent months. Meanwhile, the services sector is being underpinned by a reopening economy.
But services companies in the poll said they had not seen a clear boon for their businesses, with demand lost during the prolonged period of COVID-19 curbs yet to return.
The government lifted its COVID-19 state of emergency restrictions at the end of September, and has since eased some other curbs which remained in place in October in Tokyo and other big cities.
""The economy appeared to have reopened after the lifting of state of emergency,"" said a wholesale company manager. ""But the recovery in demand is still sluggish.""
The BOJ's latest tankan survey released in October showed an unexpected improvement in big manufacturers' business mood thanks to solid global demand.
However, some BOJ board members flagged ongoing supply chain constraints as a downside risk to the Japanese economy at its October policy meeting, where they decided to keep the ultra-easy monetary policy unchanged.
Looking forward, both manufacturers and services companies were more optimistic about their prospects, with the three-month reading among manufacturers rising to 19 from 14 and for services companies to 15 from 14.
Manufacturers' improved outlook was mainly driven by optimism among automakers, who produce Japan's No. 1 export item, even as the industry has been particularly hard hit by supply shortages.
The three-month forward-looking reading among the autos/transport equipment sector rose to +29, from 0 in October.

Manufacturers at large, except those in sectors heavily affected by rising commodity prices, were also more upbeat about their business prospects in February 2022.
""Although our performance hasn't recovered to pre-pandemic levels yet, the impact from COVID-19 has bottomed out,"" a precision machinery maker manager said. ""It's on a path to recovery.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased solidly in October, driven by surging costs for gasoline and motor vehicle retailing, suggesting that high inflation could persist for a while amid tight global supply chains related to the pandemic.
The Federal Reserve last week restated its belief that current high inflation is ""expected to be transitory."" A tightening labor market as millions remain at home is adding to price pressures, which together with shortages of goods sharply restrained economic growth in the third quarter. 
The Fed this month started reducing the amount of money it is injecting into the economy through monthly bond purchases. 
""The acceleration in inflation may not fade as quickly as previously thought, particularly for businesses because of the global supply-chain issues,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Elevated inflation is turning up the heat on the Fed but they haven't shown signs of buckling as they will stomach higher inflation to get the labor market back to full employment quickly."" 
The producer price index for final demand rose 0.6% last month after climbing 0.5% in September, the Labor Department said on Tuesday. That reversed the slowing trend in the monthly PPI since spring. In the 12 months through October, the PPI increased 8.6% after a similar gain in September. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI advancing 0.6% on a monthly basis and rising 8.7% year-on-year.
More than 60% of the increase in the PPI last month was due to a 1.2% rise in the prices of goods, which followed a 1.3% jump in September. A 6.7% surge in gasoline prices accounted for a third of the rise in goods prices. There were increases in the prices of diesel, gas and jet fuel as well as plastic resins. 
Wholesale food prices dipped 0.1% as the cost of beef and veal tumbled 10.3%. Prices for light motor trucks fell as the government introduced new-model-year passenger cars and light motor trucks into the PPI. 
Exorbitant motor vehicle prices have accounted for much of the surge in inflation as a global semiconductor shortage linked to the nearly two-year long COVID-19 pandemic has forced manufactures to cut production, leaving virtually no inventory.
Services gained 0.2% last month after a similar rise in September. An 8.9% jump in margins for automobiles and parts retailing accounted for more than 80% of the increase in services. The cost of transportation and warehousing services jumped 1.7%, also reflecting snarled supply chains.
Surveys from the Institute for Supply Management this month showed measures of prices paid by manufacturers and services industries accelerating in October. Manufacturers complained about ""record-long raw materials lead times, continued shortages of critical materials, rising commodities prices and difficulties in transporting products.""
Data on Wednesday is expected to showed strong gains in consumer prices in October, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Stocks on Wall Street retreated from record highs. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
(GRAPHIC: Inflation- https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/znpnekkokvl/inflation.png) 
PORT CONGESTION 
There is congestion at ports and widespread shortages of workers at docks and warehouses. There were 10.4 million job openings as of the end of August. The workforce is down 3 million from its pre-pandemic level.
Worker shortages were underscored by a report from the NFIB on Tuesday showing almost 50% of small businesses reported job openings they could not fill in October. 
Also on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the U.S. central bank's commitment to maximum employment, telling a virtual conference on diversity and inclusion in economics, finance and central banking that ""an economy is healthier and stronger when as many people as possible are able to work.""
Wholesale prices of apparel, footwear and truck transportation of freight also rose last month as did the costs of food and alcohol retailing, hospital outpatient care as well as machinery, equipment parts and supplies.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices shot up 0.4%. The so-called core PPI gained 0.1% in September. In the 12 months through October, the core PPI rose 6.2%. That followed a 5.9% advance in September.
Construction prices surged 6.6%, the largest gain since the series was incorporated into the PPI data in 2009.
""As companies feel the squeeze from higher energy and labor costs, as well as persistent logistics issues, producer price increases should be robust in the coming months,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
Details of the PPI components, which feed into the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy component, were mixed. The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred measure for its flexible 2% target. Healthcare costs increased 0.4%. Airline tickets rebounded 0.3%, but portfolio management fees dropped 2.2%. 

Though the October CPI data is still pending, economists believed that the core PCE price index moved higher last month after increasing 3.6% year-on-year in September. 
""For now, we think the core PCE price index will be up 3.8% year-on-year in October,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
 
"
218,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers accelerated in October, largely due to higher goods costs, fueling concerns about the persistence of inflationary pressures in the economy.  
The producer price index for final demand increased 0.6% from the prior month and 8.6% from a year earlier, matching forecasts, Labor Department data showed Tuesday. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI rose 0.4% and was up 6.8% from a year ago.
The report underscores how transportation bottlenecks, materials shortages and increasing labor costs have sent prices soaring across the economy in recent months. And with ongoing supply-chain challenges anticipated to linger into 2022, sustained price increases at the producer level presage additional consumer price increases in the coming months.
More than 60% of the headline increase was due to goods, which jumped 1.2%. Higher energy costs, including that for gasoline, drove the gain. The cost of services rose 0.2%.
Other data point to growing price pressures. Compensation surged by the most on record in the third quarter, and a gauge of prices paid by service providers rose to the highest level in 16 years last month. A record 32% of small-business owners said in October they plan to raise compensation in the next three months.
Companies are passing those costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices, fueling inflation further. On recent earnings calls, executives at companies including 3M Co.,  Masco Corp  (NYSE:MAS). and Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK). have spoken about raising prices, or plans to do so, to offset higher costs. 
That may be reflected in a report due Wednesday. The consumer price index is forecast to post its strongest advance on an annual basis since 1990.
‘Very Difficult’
The rapid and sustained increase in inflation has put the Federal Reserve in a challenging position. The central bank announced plans last week to begin tapering asset purchases this month, though Chair Jerome Powell noted balancing high inflation with a labor market that still needs to heal is “very difficult.”
Energy prices rose by the most since March, while the index for food prices declined for the first time in three months. 
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure often preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- rose 0.4% from the prior month. Compared with a year earlier, the gauge increased 6.2%.

Seasonally adjusted exports dropped 0.7% on the month to 112.3 billion euros ($129.75 billion), compared to economists' expectations for no change.
Imports were up 0.1% to 99.2 billion euros, weaker than the 0.6% rise predicted.
Compared to February 2020, the month before the coronavirus pandemic hit Germany, exports were still down 0.3% whereas imports were up 7.8%, the seasonally adjusted data showed.
""Supply bottlenecks are weighing on production, which in turn is holding back exports,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said, adding that this trend would likely continue for the rest of the year.
The trade surplus stood at 13.2 billion euros in September, much lower than during the period before the pandemic, when it often exceeded 20 billion euros each month.
A breakdown of year-on-year trade data showed that German exports to the United Kingdom fell by 10% to 5.7 billion euros and imports from Britain dropped by 20% to 2.3 billion euros.
German exports to China edged down by 0.2% on the year to 8.5 billion euros and exports to the United States jumped 16.2% on the year, to 10.8 billion euros.
""Weaker demand from China is also a cause for concern. A growth spurt will only happen when supply chains function more smoothly. But that will take some time,"" Krueger said.
The weak trade data chimed with a survey of the Ifo economic institute that showed October export expectations fell to the lowest since February as supply bottlenecks have been affecting the industrial sector.

Germany's economy ministry last month cut its exports growth forecast for the year to 8.6% from the 9.2% it had predicted in April, citing a ""historically unique shortage of intermediate goods"" that the manufacturing sector is facing.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' annual economic growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter, putting the country on course to meet its target this year, but it was unlikely to persuade the central bank to move interest rates off their record lows. 
Gross domestic product expanded for a second straight quarter in July-September, although at a much slower pace of 7.1%, after the government reimposed strict curbs to contain a Delta-variant driven surge in COVID-19 cases.
The third quarter growth figure, while weaker than the previous quarter's upwardly revised 12% expansion, easily beat economists forecast of a 4.8% expansion, and made this year's downwardly revised 4.0%-5.0% GDP target well within reach.
""We contained the Delta variant and sustained our economic expansion even as stringent quarantines were in place,"" Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua told a media briefing. 
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy grew 3.8% in September period, versus a 1.4% contraction in the June quarter.
As growth has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, economists expect the central bank to leave its benchmark rate at a record low of 2.0% for some time despite faster inflation. 
A sluggish recovery ""will keep a lid on underlying price pressures and means that the central bank is unlikely to begin tightening policy until 2023"", said Alex Holmes, economist at Capital Economics.
The central bank has two more policy meetings this year, with the penultimate one to be held on Nov. 18.
Annual growth in household spending slowed to 7.1% in the third quarter from the previous quarter's 7.3% growth, but government spending reversed the previous quarter's slump and climbed 13.6% in July-September, government data showed.
Unemployment rose to an eight-month high of 8.9% in September following the reimposition of strict lockdown measures in August. 
In terms of sectoral output, industry and services grew 7.9% and 8.2%, respectively, while agriculture, forestry and fishing declined 1.7% partly due to bad weather and African swine fever outbreaks.

Domestic demand should pick up in the coming months as a decline in COVID-19 cases and rise in vaccination rates should pave the way for a further easing of mobility restrictions, Chua said.
Easing COVID-19 curbs should improve sentiment in the country of 110 million people ahead of an election in May to choose a successor to President Rodrigo Duterte.

223,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 02:12AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers picked up the pace of their spending in October despite concerns about rising inflation, according to a survey published on Tuesday. 
The British Retail Consortium said retail spending rose by 1.3% compared with October 2020, recovering some momentum after growth slowed to just 0.6% in September when a lot of spending shifted away from shops to panic-buying of fuel caused by a shortage of tanker drivers.
""The much-reported squeeze on household spending has yet to materialise as consumers seem happy to carry on shopping,"" said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, which produces the data with the BRC.
Last week the Bank of England predicted rising prices would eat into consumer demand as it forecast that inflation would hit almost 5% in April next year, due in large part to post-lockdown supply chain bottlenecks and surging energy prices. 
Martin said the limited availability of stocks was creating ""strong pricing dynamics"" and meant discounts were unlikely in the Christmas season. 
A separate survey of broader household spending by card payments firm Barclaycard showed consumers increased their spending by 14.2% compared with October 2019.

Spending on entertainment jumped as cinema-goers flocked to see the latest James Bond film and there were also increases in spending on digital subscriptions and on travel as restrictions lifted, Barclaycard said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector sentiment index in October rose to its highest level in nearly eight years after state-of-emergency curbs were eased last month and new COVID-19 cases slid.
The economy watchers' index advanced 13.4 points to 55.5 in October, the highest level since January 2014, the government data showed. It was the second straight month of increase and marked the biggest gain since June 2020.
The index is based on a survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff who are called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends.

The outlook index - based on the watchers' view of the economy for two to three months ahead - gained 0.9 points in October to 57.5, the highest level since November 2013.
The survey was conducted Oct. 25-31 and based on more than 1,800 responses nationwide.

225,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 06:56PM ET</span>",,,,,,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's real wages declined in September for the first time in three months as inflation picked up faster than growth in nominal pay, the government said, a sign of global cost-push inflation starting to affect Japanese households.
In September Japan's core consumer price index (CPI) posted 0.1% growth from a year earlier, the first positive figure since March 2020, driven by rising energy and raw material costs.
Inflation-adjusted real wages, a key gauge of households' purchasing power, fell 0.6% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, the labour ministry said on Tuesday.
It was the first decline in three months after a downwardly revised 0.1% gain in August, due to accelerating consumer price inflation.
The CPI measurement now used by the labour ministry to calculate real wages is different from one closely watched by the Bank of Japan, as the former index still sets its base year to 2015, not 2020, and includes volatile fresh foods but excludes owners' equivalent rent.
This version of CPI posted 0.9% year-on-year growth in September, the fastest pace since December 2019.
Nominal total cash earnings rose for the seventh straight month, up 0.2% in September from a year earlier. It followed a downwardly revised 0.6% advance in August.
Regular pay, or base salary, which makes up most of total cash earnings, was up 0.3% after an upwardly revised 0.5% rise the previous month, the data showed.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, grew 4.4% year-on-year in September, gaining for the sixth straight month but slowing from double-digit figures in three months to July. The apparent slowdown came largely from a statistical effect reflecting narrower drops in the months toward the end of 2020, a government official said.
Special payments, which mainly consist of volatile one-off bonuses, fell 2.3% in September from a year earlier, according to the data.
The following table shows preliminary data for monthly incomes and numbers of workers in September:
----------------------------------------------------------------
Payments (amount) (yr/yr % change)
Total cash earnings 270,019 yen($2,382.17) +0.2
-Monthly wage 263,276 yen +0.3
-Regular pay 245,835 yen +0.1
-Overtime pay 17,441 yen +4.4
-Special payments 6,743 yen -2.3

Number of workers (million) (yr/yr % change)
Overall 51.927 mln +1.1
-General employees 35.710 mln +0.8
-Part-time employees 16.217 mln +1.7
----------------------------------------------------------------
The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who were employed for more than one month at a company that employed more than five people, or 2) those who were employed on a daily basis or had less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted, at a company that employs more than five people.

""High levels of saving and strong consumer sentiment point to a forgiving end to the year after what was for many retailers a difficult first six months due to lockdowns that threatened their existence,"" said HDE chief executive Stefan Genth. 
Online sales, which are expected to grow by 17.3%, to 23.1 billion euros ($26.69 billion), are expected to save Christmas.
The positive outlook comes even as German retailers are staring down the same factors that are hampering other industries: About three-quarters of the companies surveyed by HDE for their forecast said supply bottlenecks could hurt their sales.
Consumer electronics and household appliances may feel the pinch of the global chip shortage, but Genth said that beyond popular video game consoles, it will not lead to empty shelves.
Inflation, which at 4.5% is at its highest level in nearly three decades, could also take a bite out of German customers' gift-giving budget. 
Genth added that how the pandemic plays out over the coming months and the associated safety measures will affect whether the HDE's forecast will be borne out.
Many retailers had to close their doors last winter as the German government tried to stem the pandemic. 
""No one can afford that anymore,"" said Genth, who added that retail stores are not hotspots for the coronavirus' spread.
Germany's infection rate has risen to its highest level https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-coalition-parties-table-coronavirus-draft-law-monday-2021-11-07 since the start of the pandemic, public health figures showed on Monday.

Output fell for a second straight month and drove the trend of lower output in central European economies heavily reliant on the car sector. On Friday, Hungary reported its first year-on-year industrial output decline since January.
Czech production slipped a bigger-than-expected 4.0% year-on-year and by 3.3% month-on-month.
The statistics office said that in the third quarter industrial production growth slowed to 0.2% year-on-year.
""September results reflect especially the reduction of production of cars and their parts,"" said Radek Matejka from the statistics office. ""However, that doesn’t alter the fact that many other (economic activities) in manufacturing continue to be rather successful and their production is on the rise.""
Car production dropped by a third in September, according to the data. 
Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Skoda Auto both faced production halts in the month due to a shortage of chips. 

The Czech economy's recovery slowed in the third quarter, posting year-on-year gross domestic product growth of 2.8% after a rise of 8.1% in the previous quarter, preliminary data showed on Oct. 29.

Investing.com – Chinese export growth beat forecasts but slowed down in October. Increasing global demand ahead of Christmas, a power crunch that is easing and improving supply chains that had been badly disrupted by COVID-19 all contributed to the growth.
Data released on Sunday showed that exports grew 27.1% year-on-year, with forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicting a 24.5% growth and a 28.1% growth reported in September.
However, the overall weakness in domestic demand cast a shadow on imports, which grew 20.6% year-on-year. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com had predicted a 25% growth, while a 17.6% growth was recorded during the previous month.
The strong exports would help to mitigate the weakening domestic economy and give the government greater room for maneuver on economic policy, Pinpoint Asset Management chief economist Zhiwei Zhang told Reuters.
""The government can afford to wait until the year-end to loosen monetary and fiscal policies, now that exports provide a buffer to smooth the economic slowdown,"" he added.
Some recent supply constraints, including a power crunch that had been triggered by a shortage of coal, tougher emission standards, and strong industrial demand, have started easing in recent weeks thanks to heavy government intervention.
Premier Li Keqiang said last week the government would take measures to support the industrial sector as the economy faces renewed downward pressures.
Meanwhile, the data also showed that the trade surplus for October was $84.54 billion, above the $65.55 billion figure in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and September’s $66.76 billion surplus."
230,"<span>Nov 07, 2021 08:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s record trade surplus is cushioning the economy from weakening domestic demand and giving policy makers room to delay stimulus. But it won’t be enough to keep growth from slowing further.
Export growth has exceeded analyst estimates for three straight months, and the trade surplus reached $84.5 billion in October, data on Sunday showed. Problem is, gross domestic product is now so large that overseas demand can’t replace easing investment and consumer spending.
China’s economy has slowed sharply in recent months as efforts to rein in the property market ripple through industries from construction to commodities. A power crunch has forced factories to slow output, while stringent measures to curb virus outbreaks have damped consumption. 
“The government can afford to wait till the year-end to loosen monetary and fiscal policies, now that exports provide a buffer to smooth the economic slowdown,” Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd., said in a note. 
Premier Li Keqiang said last week the economy is facing “new downward pressures” and policies need to be fine-tuned to provide targeted support to areas that need it.
China’s role as the world’s largest exporter meant it benefited as demand for goods rose in the wake of the pandemic. The World Trade Organization raised its projection for global trade growth in 2021 to 10.8% from 8%, the biggest year-over-year jump since 2010. It estimates a 4.7% increase in 2022. 
The persistence of China’s export strength has surprised economists who predicted that global spending on made-in-China goods would ease as more countries re-open this year. That proved premature as the more infectious delta variant spread throughout the world. 
China’s factories won orders this year as large-scale coronavirus outbreaks in countries such as Vietnam, India and Malaysia caused factory closures. The country exported almost no vaccines pre-pandemic, but shipped vaccines worth $11.7 billion in the first nine months of the year. 
Automobile exports more than doubled so far in 2021 as the country emerged as a production hub for electric vehicle manufacturers including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Partly as a result of labor-intensive production of textiles and plastic toys relocating back to China, the nation increased its share of global trade to record levels of 14%-15% this year, according to the CBP World Trade Monitor, published on behalf of the European Commission. 
“Supply chain problems have seemingly been a blessing for China,” said Craig Botham, chief China economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Strong demand means China’s exporters have gained confidence to raise their prices by as much as 10%-20% year-on-year, multiple Chinese factory owners told Bloomberg News.
Economists polled by Bloomberg now expect China’s full-year export growth of over 24%. Still, trade has less of an impact now on China’s growth trajectory. 
In the first three quarters of the year, China’s exports grew 23%. Net exports contributed just 20% of China’s GDP growth over the period, a fraction compared to government and household spending on goods and services, which accounted for 65% of the expansion. 
What Bloombergs Economists Say...
China’s export growth will remain strong in the coming months, but will be “insufficient to counter domestic headwinds from power shortages and a cooling property sector.” 
--Eric Zhu
The surplus on China’s current account - a broad measure of trade - rose to its highest level since 2016 this year, but remained at just 2% of GDP in the latest quarter, well below levels of around 10% seen before the 2008 financial crisis.
While major global central banks are under pressure to roll back stimulus, the People’s Bank of China has had to balance the risk of rising inflation while boosting its economy weighed by power shortages and Covid-related curbs. The country’s Covid-zero approach had led to a tightening of restrictions around travel and social gatherings to contain frequent flare-ups of virus cases.
Fiscal policy will provide the main support to economic growth next year while significant monetary easing is unlikely, according to Huang Yiping, a former central bank adviser. The PBOC has refrained from cutting banks’ reserve requirement ratio since a reduction in July, and has kept policy interest rates steady since early last year.

231,"<span>Nov 07, 2021 06:56PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's export growth slowed in October but beat forecasts, helped by booming global demand ahead of winter holiday seasons, an easing power crunch and an improvement in supply chains that had been badly disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.
However, imports missed analysts' expectations, likely pointing to the overall weakness in domestic demand. 
Outbound shipments jumped 27.1% in October from a year earlier, slower than September's 28.1% gain. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast growth would ease to 24.5%.
Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said the strong exports would help to mitigate the weakening domestic economy, and give the government greater room for manoeuvre on economic policy.
""The government can afford to wait until the year-end to loosen monetary and fiscal policies, now that exports provide a buffer to smooth the economic slowdown,"" he said.
Recent data has pointed to a slowdown in manufacturing. Factory activity shrank for a second month in October, an official survey showed, while growth in industrial output eased to the lowest since March 2020 - the first wave of the pandemic.
EASING CONSTRAINTS
However, under heavy government intervention, some supply constraints have started to ease in recent weeks, including a power crunch that had been triggered by a shortage of coal, tougher emission standards and strong industrial demand.
Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday the government would take measures to support the industrial sector as the economy faces renewed downward pressures.
Imports jumped 20.6% in October from a year earlier, accelerating from a 17.6% gain in September but well below expectations for a rise of 25%.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) data showed the value of crude oil imports grew 56.3% year-on-year, up from 34.9% in September, and the value of coal imports rose 292% on-year, accelerating further from a 234% gain in September, as the global energy crunch and post-COVID economic recovery drove up commodity prices.
China posted a trade surplus of $84.54 billion last month, the highest on record. It was also above the poll's forecast of $65.55 billion and September's $66.76 billion surplus.
The world's second largest economy grew 4.9% in the July-September quarter from a year earlier, the weakest reading since the third quarter of last year.

China's trade surplus with the United States was $40.75 billion in October, Reuters calculations based on customs data showed, down from $42 billion in September.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment increased more than expected in October as the headwind from the surge in COVID-19 infections over the summer subsided, offering more evidence that economic activity was regaining momentum early in the fourth quarter.
But the brightening outlook was somewhat clouded by millions of unemployed Americans who remained at home even as companies are boosting wages, generous government-funded jobless benefits have ended and schools have reopened for in-person learning. The labor force is down 3 million from its pre-pandemic level.
""The dog days of summer are long gone and the U.S. economy is gearing up for an acceleration in growth and activity in the fourth quarter,"" said Brian Bethune, a professor of practice at Boston College. ""Demand for labor is strong, but there is an issue with matching people with the jobs that are available.""
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report's survey of establishments on Friday showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 531,000 jobs last month. Data for September was revised higher to show 312,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 194,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 450,000 jobs.
Employment is 4.2 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. Job growth has averaged 582,000 per month this year.
 
(GRAPHIC: Nonfarm payrolls - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/znvnekbmypl/nfpr.png)
 
President Joe Biden hailed the acceleration after two months of moderate gains, saying the nation needed to ""keep driving vaccinations up and COVID down,"" for ""our economy to fully recover."" Biden said vaccines had ""made the economy the envy of the world.""
Leisure and hospitality businesses led the broad-based increase in hiring last month, with 164,000 jobs created. Payrolls also rose in professional and business services, transportation and warehousing, healthcare, wholesale trade, financial activities as well as mining sectors.
Manufacturing added 60,000 jobs, with 28,000 of the positions at motor vehicle manufacturers, an encouraging sign for an industry that has been hobbled by a global semiconductor shortage. Construction payrolls increased by 44,000 jobs.
But state and local government education shed 65,000 jobs. The government said pandemic-related staffing fluctuations in education have distorted normal seasonal patterns, making the changes in employment in the sector challenging to interpret. Shortages of bus drivers and other support staff have been well documented. Overall government payrolls fell by 73,000 jobs.
The job gains joined rising consumer confidence and services sector activity in painting a more favorable picture of the economy, after the Delta variant of the coronavirus and economy-wide shortages of goods restricted growth in the third quarter to its slowest pace in more than a year.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced it would this month start scaling back the amount of money it is pumping into the economy through monthly bond purchases.
Stocks on Wall Street rallied on the report, lifting the main indexes to record highs. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FALLS
""The solid gain in employment is consistent with a strong quarter for output growth,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Details of the smaller survey of households, from which the unemployment rate is derived were mixed. The unemployment rate fell to a 19-month low of 4.6% from 4.8% in September. The number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or more dropped 357,000 to 2.3 million. They accounted for 31.6% of the 7.4 million people officially unemployed last month.
 
(GRAPHIC: Unemployment - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jnpwexyzepw/ue-duration.png)
 
 
But a modest 104,000 people entered the labor force last month, making it harder for employers to fill 10.4 million jobs that were open as of the end of August. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one was unchanged at 61.6%.
It has remained within a narrow range of 61.4% to 61.7% since June 2020. A small rise in the participation rate among the prime age population and people below 24 years was offset by a drop in the 55 and over age group. Women's participation rate edged up and they took 57.3% of the jobs last month.
 
(GRAPHIC: Labor market participation - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/mopanlkogva/participation.png)
 
The labor market disconnect has been blamed on caregiving needs during the pandemic, fears of contracting the coronavirus, early retirements, massive savings and career changes as well as an aging population and the recently ended expanded unemployment benefits. With many people who moved out of cities during the pandemic yet to return, there could also be a mismatch between the open jobs and location.
There are concerns that the White House's vaccine mandate, which comes into effect on Jan. 4 and applies to federal government contractors and businesses with 100 or more employees, could compound the worker shortages. There has also been a rise in strikes as workers take advantage of the tight labor market to demand more pay and better conditions.
The scramble for workers continued to boost wage growth, with average hourly earnings rising 0.4%. That lifted the annual increase to 4.9% in October, the largest gain in eight months, from 4.6% in September.

This, together with record savings should help to underpin consumer spending over the holiday session, though salaries are lagging inflation and shortages of goods abound. Some economists believe the economy is close to maximum employment.
""Unless people start flocking back into the labor market and the labor force starts to surge, we could very likely reach that level by the end of next summer, if not sooner,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""That means we could see the initial rate hike by early fall. Economists are starting to forecast two rate hikes next year and that is quite possible.""

The numbers reflect an economy that is now regaining momentum after a summer in which the Delta variant of the coronavirus dented the economy and renewed uncertainties in the labor market.
Approximately 3.83 million people were unable to work in October or reported reduced hours due to their business either closing entirely or cutting back operations, down from roughly 5.03 million in the prior month, according to the survey, resuming a downward trend that was interrupted by a rise in August. 
During the survey period, COVID-19 cases in the United States more than halved from their mid-September peak. The highly transmissible Delta variant now makes up more than 99% of cases. 
The number of people who said they did not look for work because of COVID-19 fears also declined to 1.29 million from 1.63 million the prior month, the lowest number since the pandemic began and an encouraging sign for an economy that is struggling with labor shortages.
The figures are derived from an ongoing additional survey of households carried out by the U.S. government that has accompanied the monthly jobs report since the beginning of the pandemic. 
Overall, U.S. job growth increased more than expected in October as the headwind from the surge in COVID-19 infections over the summer subsided, the main report showed, reversing two straight months of disappointing gains.

""It's a sigh of relief after the Delta variant dampened employment the past couple of months and now it’s behind us,"" said David Petrosinelli, a senior trader at InspereX in New York.

COMMENTS:
EDWARD MOYA, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, OANDA, NEW YORK“Today’s number really goes to show that the US economy is accelerating and while the labor market recovery will be long it won't be lasting. You'll see this type of report be extremely positive for equities, but it doesn't really change the Fed’s thinking. Currency markets will be a little more difficult and you're going to see a lot more interesting divergences as we enter the realm of tapering.”
RICK MECKLER, PARTNER AT CHERRY LANE INVESTMENTS IN NEW VERNON, NEW JERSEY
“The positive aspect of it is that investors have been concerned about a slowdown in the economy. We've seen signs that it could be slowing, particularly given the supply chain interruptions, but the (nonfarm payrolls data) suggests that the economy is on track. Investors will take it as a positive sign to continue to invest in stocks. The other side of it, of course, is that it does nothing to cool the potential for inflation. But that seems to be a problem for another day for stock market investors where bond rates fail.
""It’s hard to understand how we can have a high unemployment rate and still have labor shortages. It suggests a real mismatch.”
DAVID PETROSINELLI, SENIOR TRADER, INSPEREX, NEW YORK
“The last couple of months the headline number was a bit disappointing, so this a catch-up number. I don't think it changes much in terms of thinking about what the Fed does in 2022 when rate lift-off is.  But it's a sigh of relief after the Delta variant dampened employment the past couple of months and now it’s behind us.
“I don't know that it changes the picture dramatically because we got tapering announced Wednesday. The one thing that's still a problem is labor participation. It's still a problem that people haven't necessarily fully re-emerged into the workforce. We will see participation go up, but that's still one of the Achilles heels of the job market. Participation is still lagging and that is going to be a headwind.
“This tells me we’re kind of hanging in this range, of 1.5% to 1.7% on the 10-year. Anything that's going to be breakout higher or lower is going to have to be an announcement or a series of announcements or data that leads us away from that. The market expected some bump in hiring. The market is comfortable with where rates are and we’ll have to wait for an inflection point.”
SIMON HARVEY, SENIOR FX MARKET ANALYST, MONEX EUROPE, LONDON
""The market's preconceptions for a strong payrolls report were vindicated with the release, which saw not only an upwards surprise in net employment in October, but a positive revision to September's disappointing reading as well."" 
""With the Fed's forward guidance on rates largely linked to the recovery in the labour market, today' s positive employment data resulted in the U.S. 2-year yield climbing over 2 basis points on the day before moderating somewhat. Widening front-end yield spread drove the reaction in FX markets, with the dollar going bid across the G10 space."" 
""We had warned of asymmetric risk heading into today's payrolls release, given the slip in September's data due to the early initial surveying window. Not only did we expect an upwards revision to last month's data for this reason, but also expected October's net employment figure to come in strong given the tailwinds from improving COVID conditions. Looking ahead, today's payroll release will likely keep the dollar elevated, until improving economic conditions and more hawkish central bank communications return towards the end of the year.""

“It’s hard not to like, this is a really good report overall, particularly when you look from a private sector point of view. It’s 531,000 but 73,000 jobs were lost in government so the private sector is absolutely killing it. The one number that just leaped out at me, which I think it really incredible is transportation, it is above its February 2020 level, so that is really amazing. All we hear about in transportation right now is all these supply chain issues, but at the same time we are hiring a hell of a lot more people here. Warehousing and storage up, transit and ground transportation up, air transport up, truck transport up, the only thing that decreased there was the couriers and messengers so it is truly the careers where you are gaining. That was far and away the best thing I saw in the report.” 
""Yes, there are some supply chain issues but there is so much demand they are still throwing people at that problem and you need to move goods, so at some point that bottleneck will figure itself out.”

    ""I would think that this number would put some upward pressure, particularly on the belly of (the U.S. Treasury) curve as we sort of think the economic numbers are going to have a bigger impact from here now that (U.S. Federal Reserve) Chairman Powell has indicated they're willing to remain patient and struck a dovish tone earlier this week. They're kind of there on the inflation front and the focus is on maximum employment. So I would think that a number like this might bring back some of this market pricing that we saw yesterday as the Bank of England did the surprise hold on rates.""

    ""It seems to be a very good report. Participation rate is up; it was certainly well above expectations. They revised up back months. Unemployment rate falls again. There's not a lot to complain about in the employment report.
    The knee-jerk reaction in the markets was not much. And I'm looking at the fixed income market, and I don't see a lot there, either. The 2/10 (yield) spread came in a little but not much.""
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“(The employment report) was basically inline and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.6%, but that was probably due to the participation rate ticking lower.
""Hourly wages are a little bit higher but nothing to take the wind out of this positive report. Shouldn’t have an impact on yields.
""Bottom line is it’s a good report, showing an acceleration from the previous month.
""It shows that we’re seeing the jobs market healing to the point where we could expect even larger gains next month as more people return to the labor force.""
""If these numbers continue at this pace, we could probably see full employment at the end of the first quarter.” 
TOM PORCELLI, CHIEF US ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK
“Everything moved in the direction you would want it to move. I think it shows some real underlying strength. What’s interesting is I don’t think you need this payroll report, though, to know that because there’s been a host of other labor market metrics that have really driven that point home, whether its ADP, or claims, or the measures of confidence that focus on the labor backdrop. I mean over the last couple of months we’ve seen some real strength here, so in some ways I almost view this payroll report as sort of a catch up, because it has been the laggard.”

""A welcome bounce back in hiring has punched the U.S. dollar's ticket to fresh highs for the year. Still, the buck could see limited upside mileage out of the data because the participation rate has not improved. The participation rate idled at 61.6% which is consistent with people being hesitant about returning to the workforce due to lingering health concerns. The market wants to see people come off the sidelines and return to the labor force.""

""We couldn't get more positive news. Obviously, the market was up a lot prior to this with the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) news, but now this does feel like it's really the end of the pandemic. The next phase of improvement in the labor force is going to come from labor force participation rate increasing, and the Pfizer drug is going to be the catalyst for that.""

Nonfarm payrolls increased 531,000 last month after an upwardly revised 312,000 gain in September, a Labor Department report showed Friday. The unemployment rate fell to 4.6% while the labor force participation rate was unchanged.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 450,000 payrolls gain and for the jobless rate to fall to 4.7%.
The faster pace of hiring shows that more Americans returned to workplaces as Covid-19 cases declined and employers offered higher wages. Some of the payroll growth may have also come after an estimated 7.5 million people lost federal expanded unemployment benefits on Sept. 6.

Retail sales, a proxy for consumer demand, in the 19 countries sharing the euro, fell 0.3% month-on-month in September and were up 2.5% from a year earlier, the European Union's statistics office said.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.3% monthly rise in retail sales and a 1.5% year-on-year increase.
Part of the month-on-month miss, however, may be down to revisions as retail sales in August were now estimated to be up 1% compared with a 0.3% rise reported earlier. 
With energy prices soaring, coronavirus infections rising and supply chain bottlenecks dragging on, consumers are expected to become even more cautious in the coming months, a trend already evident in PMI data that showed business growth slipping to a six-month low in October.
High petrol prices are also expected to curb household purchasing power, leaving families with less to spend on other goods. 

Eurostat said car fuel sales rose 1% on the month while food, drinks and tobacco sales rose 0.7%. But non food sales dropped by 1.5%, including a 1.4% decline in Internet and mail order sales.
Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, recorded the largest, 2.5% drop in retail sales but Finland and the Netherlands were also deep in negative territory.

Authorities do not want genuine buyers to be shut out of the market or developers to face delays in receiving payments due to slow loan disbursements in a market whose health is key to the economy. 
Disbursement has also picked up after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) last month criticised some banks for their ""misunderstanding"" of its debt-control policies in the property sector.
Some lenders had held back issuance of home loans earlier in the year, concerned about being accused of creating debt bubbles at a time when the state was cracking down on new borrowing by developers that had binged on loans, bankers told Reuters. 
Loan issuance also fell after new central bank requirements capping property loans by banks in January.
A Beijing banker said banks that had not breached the caps on mortgage loan requirements had gained extra quotas to lend to home buyers recently, with regulators supportive of buyers with so-called rigid demand, referring to purchasing or renting by individuals who recently married or were seeking low-cost housing.
New home prices barely grew in October, weighed down by weak demand in major cities, a private survey showed on Monday.
A banker in Shanghai said his branch accelerated the hand-out of mortgages in the third quarter. Still, his bank was reminded by authorities that the regulatory stance remained very strict on illegal lending to the sector.
""The mortgage quota hasn't increased for us but the issuance of mortgage is speeding up,"" said another banker in Shanghai. 
The slowdown in mortgage approval has partly contributed to the financial stress faced by developers including the embattled China Evergrande Group. 
Amid ebbing cash-flows, some developers have failed to finish projects, drawing widespread complaints from home buyers and casting a chill on new purchases. 
SHORTER WAIT
""The waiting time for getting mortgages is shorter now, about three to four months compared with six months previously,"" said a realtor surnamed Liu in Shanghai.
Loan approval had also been faster due to fewer home buyers waiting in the queue, said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with property agency Centaline.
In October, banks granted some 150 billion yuan to 200 billion yuan ($31 billion) more property loans than in September, according to a Thursday report from state-backed media outlet Cailianshe, citing unidentified sources.
Analysts also noted an acceleration in the issue of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) by banks, implying banks are given another capital-raising route as they use up funds to lend to home buyers. 
""The issuance of local RMBS reached 77 billion yuan in September,"" said Huatai Securities. 
""Issuance resumed after a two-month halt and rose by a significant amount, which we see as a gesture of (regulatory) guidance.""

As of end-September, outstanding mortgage loans reached 37.37 trillion yuan ($5.84 trillion), central bank data showed.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending fell in September as consumers remained cautious about the COVID-19 pandemic, backing broad consensus that the world's third-largest economy shrank in the third quarter but pointing to an improvement towards year-end.
The data underscored the need for policymakers to shore up domestic consumption as the global supply crunch hits the export-reliant economy.
Spending fell 1.9% year-on-year in September, with the downturn easing slightly after a 3.0% decrease in August, government data showed on Friday. It was also less severe than a median market forecast for a 3.9% slide in a Reuters poll.
In seasonally adjusted month-on-month terms, spending jumped 5.0% in September, marking the first increase in five months, beating expectations for 2.8% growth.
""As the virus situation and foot traffic improved toward end of September, service spending such as entertainment and education recovered, catching up the earlier trend in goods spending,"" said Masato Koike, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
Nationwide coronavirus cases decreased in September after hitting record levels in late August. The government lifted some COVID-19 curbs by end-September, but restrictions such as shorter restaurant hours and caps on large-scale events remained in place in Tokyo and other densely-populated cities until late October.
Many analysts expect the economy to have shrunk in the third quarter. The median forecast for July-September gross domestic product (GDP) growth stood at an annualised contraction of 0.8%, Reuters poll of 18 economists showed on Friday.
Beyond carmakers, supply shortages in semiconductors and other components produced in coronavirus-hit Southeast Asia have caused a ripple effect in other parts of the Japanese economy. Growth in exports has slowed while private consumption stagnated because of slumps in car sales.
The anticipated economic contraction in the third quarter ""will highlight Japan's growth lag"" compared with other major economies such as the United States and Europe, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
The government is due to release a preliminary estimate for July-September GDP on Nov. 15.
To prop up Japan's relatively tepid economic recovery, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida pledged earlier this week to compile a ""large-scale"" stimulus package in mid-November.
Kishida's government and ruling coalition have agreed to provide a cash payout of 100,000 yen ($879.58) to all children up to age 18 as part of the stimulus package, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Friday.

""As consumption picks up thanks to eased virus curbs and car production cuts have bottomed out in October, the fourth-quarter GDP growth will be back to a positive territory,"" Minami said, adding the positive effect of the government's stimulus package will mostly be felt after January 2022.

House prices rose by 0.9% month-on-month in October following a 1.7% rise in September, Halifax said.
It brought the average house price to 270,027 pounds ($364,374)- up 8.1% on October 2020 and marking the strongest annual growth rate for four months.
Although the Bank of England failed to raise interest rates as many investors expected on Thursday, Halifax said likely increases in borrowing costs over the coming months should dampen demand.
""That said, borrowing costs will still be low by historical standards, and raising a deposit is likely to remain the primary obstacle for many,"" said Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax.

""The impact on property prices may also be tempered by the continued limited supply of properties available on the market.""
Like other countries, Britain experienced a stampede for bigger houses outside of city centres during the COVID-19 pandemic, pushing prices higher. Temporary tax breaks on property purchases added to the boom.

The Federal Statistics Office said industrial output fell by 1.1% on the month after an upwardly revised drop of 3.5% in August. A Reuters poll had pointed to a rise of 1% in September.
Compared with the previous quarter, production in the manufacturing sector fell by 2.4% in the third quarter and is currently 9.5% lower than in February 2020, before measures to curb the coronavirus pandemic in Germany began.
The fall in September was driven by a drop in the production in the mechanical engineering, electrical equipment and data processing equipment sectors, the economy ministry said.
""Supply bottlenecks for raw materials and intermediate products that have been going on for a long time are being reflected on a broader front,"" the ministry said.
Thomas Gitzel, an economist at VP Bank, said Germany's industrial production outlook was bleak as companies expect material shortages to persist until the end of next year.
Rising gas and electricity prices were additional negative factors that would weigh on production, he said.

""The coming quarters will remain difficult,"" Gitzel said, adding that Germany's economic output was set to stagnate in the fourth quarter. 
""But it is also clear that when the flow of materials is up and running again, the current situation will turn into its opposite,"" he said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter as restrictions to control a deadly wave of COVID-19 weighed on activity, although recent data suggests growth may be getting back on track in the current quarter.
Southeast Asia's largest economy grew 3.51% in the July-September quarter from the same period last year, below the previous quarter's 7.07% expansion, Statistics Indonesia data showed.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected growth to slow to 3.76%, while government officials had predicted 4.5%.
The main stock index slipped to be 0.15% down in morning trade after rising 0.3% at the open, while the rupiah weakened.
Authorities in Indonesia imposed strict mobility restrictions in July to August in response to a spike in COVID-19 infections.
The virus containment measures hit household consumption, which slowed to 1% in the third quarter from 6% in the previous three months. Private consumption accounts for more than half of the country's gross domestic product.
Exports contributed the most to GDP expansion on the back of an upcycle in commodity prices.
""3Q likely marked the trough for the year, with 4Q growth likely to strengthen as the caseload has since receded and vaccination ramped up, allowing for restrictions to be unwound,"" said Radhika Rao, economist with DBS.
More recent data has shown the economic recovery has regained momentum after curbs were gradually eased in late August, with the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) at an all-time high last month as business disruptions eased.
However, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati has warned that rising global inflation, China's economic slowdown and the prospect of monetary tightening in the United States and the European Union could affect Indonesia's growth outlook.
A drop in coal prices could also dampen the contribution to GDP from exports in the fourth quarter, said Josua Pardede, economist at Bank Permata.
""Going forward, economic growth has to come from the private sector, given that the government is planning to reduce its fiscal deficit level,"" said Fakhrul Fulvian, economist of Jakarta brokerage Trimegah Sekuritas.
The government has said it plans to narrow the budget deficit to 4.85% of GDP in 2022 from about 5.4% this year.
The central bank has also announced plans to unwind its ultra loose monetary policy by gradually reducing the size of excess liquidity in the banking system next year and consider a rate hike at end-2022.

DBS's Rao said Bank Indonesia may have to tighten monetary policy sooner if the Federal Reserve frontloads U.S. rate hikes.
Before the data release, Sri Mulyani had expected full-year GDP growth of 4%, while the central bank's latest forecast was 3.5% to 4.3%. Indonesia's economy shrank 2.07% last year, the first contraction since 1998, due to the impact of the pandemic.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine annual inflation slowed to a three-month low in October, giving the central bank room to keep its policy accommodative for some time to support economic recovery.
The Consumer Price Index rose 4.6% last month from a year earlier, decelerating from 4.8% in September as lower food inflation offset higher energy costs, government data on Friday showed.
October inflation came in near the bottom end of the central bank's 4.5%-5.3% forecast, and below the 4.9% median estimate in a Reuters poll.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, picked up to 3.4% from 3.3% in September.
Inflation averaged 4.5% in January-October, above the year's 2%-4% target range of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).
While inflation is likely to remain elevated and driven by supply-side pressures for the remaining months of 2021, the BSP expects the headline number to return to the same target band in 2022 and 2023.
BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno, in a statement, reiterated the central bank would keep policy accommodative for as long as necessary to guide the economy to recovery.
The BSP has kept its benchmark rate steady at a record low 2.0% since November.
""We are still, for core inflation, within the 2%-4% and that gives the central bank the space to still keep the accommodative policy,"" BDO Unibank chief market strategist Jonathan Ravelas told news channel ANC.
The BSP, meanwhile, said the schedule of its policy announcement will move to 3 p.m. (0700 GMT) from 4 p.m. to align practices with other central banks, which typically announce decisions during trading hours.

The new scheduled takes effect starting with the Nov. 18 policy meeting.
Separately, the statistics agency said the country recorded a trade deficit of nearly $4 billion in September, the biggest since January 2019, as imports rose faster than exports.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's exports fell in September as a semi-conductor chip shortage weighed on motor vehicle and parts production, though that decline was partially offset by record high crude oil exports, Statistics Canada data showed on Thursday.
Imports were down 3.0%, also hit hard by the worsening supply chain issues for motor vehicle and parts. Canada's trade surplus with the world, meanwhile, rose to C$1.86 billion ($1.50 billion), beating expectations of C$1.55 billion.
""The real message here is not demand, demand is very strong. The real issue here is supply chains, and now they're starting to bite on overall trade activity really hard,"" said Peter Hall, chief economist at Export Development Canada.
Hall added that those issues were likely to continue weighing on Canada's manufacturers, particularly the auto sector, for months to come.
""This is just creating chaos,"" he said. ""The best indication that we got (of when) things would actually start to settle down is mid of next year. That's a long way away.""
Exports of motor vehicles and parts fell 17.9% in September from August, while exports of energy products rose 6.1%, buoyed by high crude prices. Imports of motor vehicles and parts were down 13.6% on the month. 
While the decline in imports is technically positive for economic growth, economists noted that the two-way trade slump shows the direness of the supply chain bottlenecks.
""The slump in trade in both directions is a concern as it demonstrates just how big an impact that supply constraints are having, particularly on the motor vehicle sector,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist for Capital Economics.

Capital Economics expects third-quarter annualized GDP growth of little more than 2%, well below the Bank of Canada's 5.5% projection.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in nearly 20 months last week, suggesting the economy was regaining momentum amid a significant improvement in public health, though supply constraints remain.
The tightening labor market is driving up wages as companies scramble for workers, contributing to keeping inflation high. Labor costs surged in the third quarter, other data showed on Thursday, with productivity sinking at its steepest pace in 40 years. The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it would this month start scaling back the amount of money it is pumping into the economy through monthly bond purchases. 
""Firms are reluctant to lay off workers with strong demand and labor in short supply,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""The big open question is what is happening to the millions of people who lost their benefits in September, or saw their benefits drop.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 269,000 for the week ended Oct. 30, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest level since the middle of March in 2020, when mandatory business closures were being enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections. Claims have now declined for five straight weeks.
There were significant declines in filings in Missouri and Florida, which offset increases in California and Kentucky. 
Claims in Kentucky were likely boosted by temporary layoffs in the automobile sector as motor vehicle manufacturers cut production because of a scarcity of semiconductors. 
The summer wave of infections driven by the Delta variant has subsided, encouraging more Americans to travel, dine out, frequent sporting venues and engage in other activities that were curtailed by the resurgence in cases. The Delta variant and shortages of goods contributed to restricting economic growth to its slowest pace in more than a year last quarter. 
Claims, which have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020, are now in a range that is generally viewed as consistent with a healthy labor market. 
The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 134,000 to 2.105 million in the week ended Oct. 23, also the lowest level since the middle of March in 2020. The number of people receiving aid has declined by about 75% since early September when enhanced government-funded benefits expired.
Falling claims augur well for October's employment report, which is due on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely rose by 450,000 jobs. The economy created 194,000 jobs in September, the fewest in nine months.
Stocks on Wall Street were mostly higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.

WORKER SHORTAGE
Expectations for an acceleration in job gains were bolstered by the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday, which showed strong growth in private payrolls in October. The Conference Board's labor market differential - derived from data on consumers' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get - hit a 21-year high.
But relentless worker shortages remain an obstacle. Caregiving needs during the pandemic, fears of contracting the coronavirus, early retirements and career changes as well as an aging population left businesses with 10.4 million unfilled jobs as of the end of August. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday that ""these impediments to labor supply should diminish with further progress on containing the virus, supporting gains in employment and economic activity."" 
There are concerns that the White House's vaccine mandate, which comes into effect on Jan. 4 and applies to federal government contractors and businesses with 100 or more employees, could add to the worker shortages. 
A report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers increased 27.5% in October to 22,822, the highest since May. It said 22% of the layoffs were people who refused to be vaccinated as required by their companies.
""The issue could push people out of the labor force or slow re-entry as people extend their searches for either employers not enforcing the mandate or workplaces where it doesn't apply,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
With workers scarce, companies are raising wages. A second report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, accelerated at an 8.3% annualized rate in the third quarter after rising at a 1.1% pace in the April-June quarter. 
(GRAPHIC: Labor costs surge, but inflation taxes worker earnings - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/zgpomkmyzpd/chart_eikon.jpg) 
Labor costs rose at a 4.8% rate compared to a year ago. The government reported last week that wage growth in the third quarter was the largest on record. Strong wage gains, together with rising rents, pose a challenge to the Fed's narrative that high inflation is transitory.
""The rise will add to concerns about inflation becoming more entrenched and/or the growing risk to profits, as businesses are not able to offset higher wage costs via productivity gains,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Worker productivity fell at a 5.0% rate last quarter, the biggest drop since the second quarter of 1981.

The Commerce Department said that the trade gap surged 11.2% to a record $80.9 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an $80.5 billion deficit. 
Exports tumbled 3.0% to $207.6 billion in September. Goods exports plunged 4.7% to $142.7 billion. The decline was led by industrial supplies, with crude oil exports decreasing $1.0 billion. Capital goods exports also fell. But consumer goods exports were the highest on record. 
Imports rose 0.6% to a record $288.5 billion. Goods imports rose 0.8% to $240.9 billion, also a record high. Imports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest since April 2014. Capital goods imports set record highs, as did non-petroleum imports and imports of other goods. 

Imports are likely to remain high as businesses rebuild depleted inventories.
Trade subtracted from gross domestic product growth in the third quarter, helping to restrain economic growth to a 2% annualized rate, the slowest in more than a year. The trade gap has been a drag on GDP growth for five straight quarters.

The Labor Department said on Thursday that unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at an 8.3% annualized rate last quarter after rising at a 1.1% pace in the April-June quarter. Outside the coronavirus distortions in 2020, the jump in labor costs last quarter was the largest since the first quarter of 2014. 
Labor costs advanced at a 4.8% rate compared to a year ago.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast unit labor costs accelerating at a 7.0% pace. 
The report followed on the heels of news last month that wage growth in the third quarter was the largest on record. The pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, leading to 10.4 million job openings as of the end of August.
Strong wage gains, together with rising rents, challenge the Federal Reserve's narrative that high inflation is transitory.
Inflation is well above the Fed's 2% target. The U.S. central bank announced on Wednesday that it would start trimming its monthly bond purchases this month, but held to its belief about high inflation being transitory. 

Hourly compensation increased at a 2.9% rate in the third quarter after rising at a 3.5% pace in the prior period. The surge in labor costs came at the expense of worker productivity, which fell at a 5.0% rate last quarter. That was the biggest drop since the second quarter of 1981 and followed a 2.4% growth pace in the April-June period. 
Economists had expected productivity would drop at 3.0% rate. Compared to the third quarter of 2020, productivity fell at a 0.5% rate. Hours worked increased at a 7.0% rate last quarter, up from the 5.9% pace logged in the second quarter.

Some, including Target, are planning less hiring than last year, and offering existing staff incentive to work more hours. 
Grocers such as Aldi and Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co. are each aiming to each add 20,000 workers. 
In a sign of confidence about consumer spending this holiday season, retailer  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN). announced plans to add 28,600 workers -- the first seasonal hiring binge since 2017. 
Other Challenger figures showed companies announced 22,822 job cuts in October. Workers’ refusing to comply with vaccine mandates accounted for more than 5,000 cuts in October, second only to dismissals due to closures.

BENGALURU/LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth slipped to a six-month low in October as supply chain bottlenecks and logistical issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic pushed input prices to rise at the fastest rate in over two decades, a survey showed.
Government restrictions are being lifted in the currency bloc but shortages of raw materials in the manufacturing sector are impacting growth and the pent-up demand unleashed across the services industry is waning.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a good gauge of overall economic health, fell to a six-month low of 54.2 in October from 56.2 in September, just below an earlier 54.3 ""flash"" estimate.
""The PMIs suggest the euro zone's economic recovery will slow markedly in Q4 as supply shortages intensified throughout the region, especially for manufacturers,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
""They also show that price pressures are building, even in the periphery.""
A Reuters poll last month suggested growth in the bloc would slow to 1.1% this quarter after expanding 2.0% in Q3.
The services PMI index fell to a six-month low of 54.6 in October from 56.4, a notch lower than the preliminary estimate of 54.7 but still comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
Demand weakened though and the new business index dropped to 55.1 from 55.3.
While euro zone manufacturing activity remained strong last month it was curtailed by supply chain bottlenecks, a survey showed on Tuesday. 
Those bottlenecks have caused the costs of raw materials to soar and the composite input prices index climbed to 73.2 from 70.9, by far the highest since the survey began in mid-1998.
""Inflation will peak at 4.5%. That is very high but likely to abate over the course of next year, we already see promising signs in container shipping for instance,"" said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg.
The supply constraints meant growth slowed in Germany, Europe's largest economy, for a third month and it was a similar picture in France, Spain and Italy.
In Britain, outside the currency union, businesses reported faster growth, data showed on Wednesday, but the Bank of England is likely to be worried about record rises in the costs faced by businesses, which are being passed on to consumers.

The BoE will deliver its most eagerly awaited policy decision in years on Thursday. The bank must choose whether to nudge borrowing costs up from an all-time low or say it is waiting to ensure the post-lockdown economy is ready for a rate hike.
In the United States, a measure of services industry activity surged to a record high last month as declining COVID-19 cases boosted demand although businesses remained burdened by snarled supply chains and the resulting exorbitant prices.

252,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 06:22AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone producer prices jumped in September more than expected, driven by skyrocketing energy costs, recording their highest increase on record in a new sign of strong inflationary pressures in the bloc, public data showed on Thursday.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat estimated that prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 2.7% month-on-month in September for a 16.0% year-on-year jump, in the biggest increases ever recorded for the bloc.
The jump also exceeded expectations, as economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 2.2% monthly rise and a 15.2% surge on the year.
Producers' prices rose sharply amid a fast economic recovery after the most acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, a tightening of global supply chains, and a jump in gas prices.
Energy prices rose 7.7% month-on-month for a 40.7% year-on-year surge, accelerating their increase. However, total industry prices excluding energy rose only 0.6% on the month, slowing from previous months.

The rise in industrial prices mirrors the surge of consumer prices which increased in the bloc annually 3.4% in September, according to Eurostat, which has estimated a 4.1% surge in October.
Producer price rises usually translate into higher prices for consumers that the European Central Bank wants to keep rising at around 2%. The bank and euro zone finance ministers expect the inflation spike to pass in coming months and inflation to slow in 2022.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.6 in October from 52.6 in September, which was its lowest reading since January. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a decline to 52.0.
""There were widespread reports that shortages of materials and staff had disrupted work on site, while rising fuel and energy prices added to pressure on costs. Nonetheless, the worst phase of the supply crunch may have passed,"" IHS Markit economics director Tim Moore said.
The proportion of construction companies reporting delays from suppliers dropped to 54% from 63%, and growth quickened across the housing, commercial and civil engineering sectors, the survey showed.
It added to signs ahead of the Bank of England's interest decision on Thursday that the slowdown in Britain's economy may have moderated last month, with a similar survey of services companies on Wednesday showing a pick-up in growth.
A separate survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed strong orders - especially for infrastructure projects - but construction firms in the third quarter grappled with rising cost pressures and skill shortages.

The IHS Markit survey also pointed to widespread reports of cost increases among construction companies in October, but to the smallest extent for six months.
The all-sector PMI - a combined reading of this week's manufacturing, services and construction surveys - rose to a three-month high of 57.5 in October, up from 54.7 in September.

Full-year sales are expected to stand at 1.66 million vehicles, only 1.9% higher than 2020, when COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions were in place, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.
A total of 106,265 vehicles were registered last month. 

The worldwide chip shortage has forced many brands to cut production and increased the waiting times for some buyers as carmakers grapple with the fallout from the pandemic. 
""The current performance reflects the challenging supply constraints, with the industry battling against semiconductor shortages and increasingly strong economic headwinds as inflation rises, taxes increase and consumer confidence has weakened,"" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.

The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 133.2 points last month compared with a revised 129.2 for September.
The September figure was previously given as 130.0.
The October reading was the highest for the index since July 2011. On a year-on-year basis, the index was up 31.3% in October.
Agricultural commodity prices have risen steeply in the past year, driven by harvest setbacks and strong demand.
The FAO's cereal price index rose by 3.2% in October from the previous month. That was led by a 5% jump in wheat prices, which climbed for a fifth consecutive month to reach their highest since November 2012, FAO said.
""Tighter availability in global markets due to reduced harvests in major exporters, especially Canada, the Russian Federation and the United States of America, continued to put upward pressure on prices,"" FAO said of wheat.
Wheat futures started November at new peaks, with U.S. prices at fresh highs since 2012 and Paris front-month futures at a record high as import demand remained brisk. [GRA/] [GRA/TEND]
World vegetable oil prices jumped 9.6% on the month to set a record high, supported by further strength in palm oil prices as labour shortages in Malaysia continued to hamper production, FAO said. [POI/]
In contrast, global sugar prices eased 1.8% in October, ending a run of six straight monthly rises, according to FAO.
Rome-based FAO cut its projection of global cereal production in 2021, to 2.793 billion tonnes from 2.800 billion estimated a month ago, according to its cereal supply and demand outlook.
That mainly reflected reduced wheat output estimates for Iran, Turkey and the United States, offsetting an increased forecast for coarse grain production.

Expected world cereal output would still represent a record, but would trail projected demand, leading to a fall in forecast cereal stocks, FAO said.
Demand was supported by a raised projection of global cereal trade to a new record, bolstered by increased wheat trade.

Total orders increased by 65% year on year, helped by foreign orders that nearly doubled, reaching 98%.
The jump was partially attributed to the sharp fall last year due to coronavirus pandemic.
But even taking the special effect into consideration, the total number of incoming orders remains a fifth above last year's level, VDMA economic expert Olaf Wortmann said.

IHS Markit's final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services showed activity in the sector dropped to a six-month low at 52.4 in October from 56.2 in the previous month.
The composite PMI index, which comprises both the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 52.0 from 55.5 in September.
The figures suggest the economy is likely to lose further momentum in the final three months of the year after gross domestic product expanded by a weaker-than-expected 1.8% quarter-on-quarter from July through September, IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said.
In addition to supply problems, service providers reported staffing capacity constraints which were also holding back activity, though overall job creation remained robust in the sector.

Price pressures intensified further in the services sector, propelled by a jump in energy costs.
""Goods inflation continues to run well ahead of that of services prices, but the latter is nevertheless now at a record high as firms in the sector pass on a multitude of increasing costs to customers,"" Smith said.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the country's dominant services sector rose to 56.6 points in October from 56.2 in September, in line with an initial ""flash"" forecast of 56.6.
But a composite PMI index, which includes the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 54.7 points in October from 55.3 in September as supply-chain issues caused partly by strict COVID-19 controls which have affected ports hit manufacturing. 
That PMI was also in line with an initial estimate of 54.7.
The PMIs remained above the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction. But IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes warned that the economic recovery was becoming highly disjointed due to supply issues.

""Services output is still rising at a relatively sharp rate by historical standards as activity levels within the economy return to pre-pandemic levels,"" Hayes said. ""Demand conditions are still robust, and firms are adding more staff to the payroll.""
""However, we cannot ignore what's happening over in the manufacturing sector,"" he added.

Some 52% of the more than 3,200 companies with offices abroad said they were satisfied with their business abroad, and 56% said they expected conditions to improve over the next 12 months.
Despite reporting improved business conditions, 50% of surveyed firms cited higher energy and raw material prices as risks to the global economy over the next 12 months.

The companies also said they expected economic activity in China and the United States to deteriorate, the survey showed.
The share of companies citing supply bottlenecks as a risk rose to 54% from 40% in the spring.

260,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 04:13AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BERLIN (Reuters) -Higher demand from abroad drove a weaker-than-expected rise in German industrial orders in September following a plunge in the previous month, suggesting that factories in Europe's largest economy could hike output once supply bottlenecks ease.
Orders for goods ""Made in Germany"" were up 1.3% on the month after a revised fall of 8.8% in August, seasonally adjusted figures from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Thursday.
A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a rise of 2% on the month.
Excluding orders for large-ticket items, bookings were up by only 0.2% on the month in September.
Demand from countries outside the euro zone jumped by nearly 15%, more than offsetting weaker orders from domestic and other clients in the euro zone.
The economy ministry said the industrial orders data of the past months had been distorted by unusually large orders for goods such as planes and ships which massively pushed up the headline figure in June and July.
""All in all, orders in manufacturing were at a high level and exceeded their pre-crisis level of the fourth quarter of 2019 by roughly 13% in the third quarter,"" the ministry said. 
Analysts said the supply chain problems in manufacturing and the lack of microchips in the automobile industry in particular were dampening recent orders activity.
""Without the persistent material shortages, the rise would probably have been higher,"" Alexander Krueger from Bankhaus Lampe said.

With backlogs remaining high and demand still strong, the outlook for the industry remained good, but factories could only process orders if supply logistics improved, he added.
The government has cut its growth forecast for this year to 2.6% but raised its estimate for next year to 4.1% as the supply bottlenecks for semiconductors and rising energy costs delay Germany's recovery.

The government in September ended state of emergency curbs imposed to contain the health crisis, as new cases and deaths came down rapidly that month and the burden on the medical system eased.
""Japanese service sector firms reported that activity returned to expansion territory for the first time in nearly two years,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, whichcompiled the survey.
""Firms continued to build capacity in anticipation of a gradual recovery in demand, despite the rate of job creation easing to a three-month low.""
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 50.7 from the previous month's 47.8, matching a flash reading.
That meant services sector activity stayed above the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the first time since January 2020, before the economy went through its deep COVID-19 slump.
The 20 months of decline was the longest such streak since a 27-month run through March 2010, during the global financial crisis.
Some economists hope a stronger recovery in service sector sentiment will offset a slowdown in output and exports, which are being hit by a persistent global chip and parts supply shortage.

The PMI survey showed the services sector saw the biggest jump in input prices since November 2019, while new and outstanding business remained in contraction despite the expansion in overall business activity.
The composite PMI, which is calculated using both manufacturing and services, expanded for the first time in six months, rising to 50.7 from September's final of 47.9.

LONDON (Reuters) - More than half of small British manufacturers feel under pressure to pay staff more because of labour shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit, a survey showed on Thursday.
The report from consultancies South West Manufacturing Advisory Services (SWMAS) and the Manufacturing Growth Programme (MGP) showed most small- and medium-sized manufacturers had lost skilled staff during the pandemic.
With only a small minority able to find replacement workers, 60% of manufacturers said they either had or would have to increase pay to attract staff.
The Bank of England has been watching pay pressures carefully ahead of Thursday's interest rate decision - a task made more difficult by distortions to official pay data caused by the pandemic.
While wages have risen sharply in some industries like haulage, construction and manufacturing, most workers have not seen significant increases in pay. 
Around 40% of respondents in Thursday's survey cited a shortage of European Union workers after Brexit as a key driver behind the scarcity of labour.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Brexit will help to build a high growth, high pay economy, aided by new restrictions on immigration. 
But economists have warned that pay increases caused by labour shortages will only hurt the competitiveness of British companies - unless a way can be found to raise productivity, a goal that has proved elusive over the last decade.
There were already signs that the cost of supply chain problems and labour shortages had started to hurt profit margins, even though companies expect future sales to improve, Thursday's survey showed.
The ongoing supply chain challenges meant many businesses have had to reallocate and add additional resources to address these issues, said Nick Golding, managing director at SWMAS.

""In fact, respondents are currently having to commit an average of two full-time employees to manage suppliers and customers, a number that often equates to between 5-10% of a SME manufacturer's workforce,"" he said.
Still, 64% of respondents said they expected to expand over the next six months and 52% said they would invest more in equipment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. services industry activity surged to a record high in October likely as declining COVID-19 cases boosted demand, but businesses remained burdened by snarled supply chains and the resulting exorbitant prices.
The significantly improved public health picture appears to be lifting the labor market, with other data on Wednesday showing an acceleration in private payrolls growth last month. The reports suggested the economy was regaining momentum early in the fourth quarter after being restrained by the Delta variant of the coronavirus and shortages last quarter. 
""The recovery is continuing in the fourth quarter, but supply-chain disruptions and hiring difficulties will continue to constrain growth,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Labor supply should pick up in the months ahead, but it will take months for supply chains to return to normal.""
The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing activity index vaulted to a reading of 66.7 last month. That was the highest since the series started in 1997 and followed a 61.9 reading in September. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that the index would edge up to 62.0. The summer wave of infections driven by the Delta variant has subsided, encouraging more consumption of services like air travel and dining out. 
""Demand shows no signs of slowing,"" said Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM services business survey committee. ""However, ongoing challenges, including supply chain disruptions and shortages of labor and materials, are constraining capacity and impacting overall business conditions.""
The ISM survey's measure of new orders received by services businesses soared to a record last month. Spending is shifting from goods to services. Strengthening demand for services boosted hiring in the leisure/hospitality sector, leading to a pick-up in private payrolls. 
Private employment increased by 571,000 jobs last month after advancing by 523,000 in September, the ADP National Employment Report showed. Businesses in the leisure/hospitality industry added 185,000 jobs. Manufacturing employment increased by 53,000 jobs, while construction hiring rose by 54,000. 
Economists had forecast private payrolls would rise by 400,000 jobs. The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the Labor Department's employment report for October, which is due on Friday. But it has a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the Bureau of Labor Statistics' more comprehensive and closely watched employment report because of methodology differences.
Still, the report was consistent with an improvement in other labor market indicators in October, leaving economists confident that overall job growth picked up in October, though persistent worker shortages remain a challenge. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of August. 
According to a Reuters poll of economists, private payrolls likely increased by 400,000 jobs in October. With government hiring anticipated to have rebounded by 50,000, that would lead to overall payrolls rising by 450,000 jobs. The economy created 194,000 jobs in September, the fewest in nine months.
U.S. stocks were trading mixed. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
WORSENING SHORTAGES
Part of the jump in the ISM services sector index in October reflected longer delivery times. The survey's measure of supplier deliveries accelerated to a reading of 75.6 from 68.8 in September. A reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. 
A lengthening in suppliers' delivery times is normally associated with a strong economy and increased customer demand, which would be a positive contribution to the ISM non-manufacturing index. In this instance, however, slower supplier deliveries indicate perennial pandemic-related shortages.
That was underscored by the survey's measure of prices paid by services industries, which raced to 82.9 from a reading of 77.5 in September. Longer delivery times and higher prices mirrored the findings of the ISM's manufacturing survey published on Monday and added to signs that high inflation could be persistent.
The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it would start trimming its monthly bond purchases this month, but held to its belief about high inflation being transitory. Inflation is well above the Fed's flexible 2% target. 
The government reported last week a record surge in wage growth in the third quarter. A report on Tuesday showed the residential rental vacancy rate fell last quarter. Wages and rents are the most sticky components of inflation. 
With raw materials and labor in short supply, unfinished work at services industries continued to pile up.
Though the ISM survey's measure of services industry employment dropped for a third straight month, it remained in expansion territory. At face value, that suggests national job growth remained moderate in October.

But signs the labor market recovery is regaining traction are mounting. Initial claims for unemployment benefits have dropped below 300,000 for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic barreled through the United States about 20 months ago. 
The Conference Board's labor market differential - derived from data on consumers' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get - hit a 21-year high. 
 
"
264,"<span>Nov 03, 2021 01:37PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods unexpectedly rose in September, though manufacturing remains constrained by input shortages.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that factory orders increased 0.2% in September. Data for August was revised down to show orders rising 1.0% instead of 1.2% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders unchanged. Orders gained 17.6% on a year-on-year basis.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the economy, is being driven by still-strong demand for goods despite spending shifting back to services. Businesses are rebuilding depleted inventories, but shortages of labor and raw materials stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic remain challenges. 
The widespread shortages restrained economic growth to its slowest pace in more than a year in the third quarter.
An Institute for Supply Management survey on Monday showed manufacturing activity slowed in October, with all industries reporting record-long lead times for raw materials.
The rise in factory goods orders in September was led by machinery, primary metals and fabricated metal products. But orders for computers and electronic products, transportation equipment as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components fell, likely because of a global chip shortage.
Shipments increased 0.6% after gaining 0.1% in August. Inventories at factories shot up 0.8% in September. Unfilled orders at factories increased 0.7% after rising 0.9% in August.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 0.8% as reported last month.

That suggests a potential rebound in business spending on equipment after it contracted in the third quarter after four straight quarters of double-digit growth, though inflation could cut into the gains. 
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, rose 1.4% as previously reported.

Companies are desperate to hire workers as labor shortages continue to plague production and boost prices. Still, total employment measured by ADP remains well below its pre-pandemic level, suggesting higher wages and sign-on bonuses aren’t doing enough to attract and retain talent in a labor market where jobseekers are increasingly choosy.
The data precede Friday’s monthly employment report from the Labor Department, which is forecast to show that private payrolls increased by 408,000 in October. While the ADP figures don’t always follow the same pattern as the Labor Department’s data, the acceleration could point to a strong October report.
Broad Advances
Service-provider employment increased 458,000 in October, the most since June, led by payrolls at leisure and hospitality companies and professional and business firms.
Payrolls at goods producers rose by 113,000, reflecting the biggest advances in construction and manufacturing hiring since September 2020.
“The job market is revving back up as the Delta-wave of the pandemic winds down,” Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said in a statement. “As long as the pandemic remains contained, more big job gains are likely in coming months.

The hospitality sector led job creation, accounting for just over 25,000 of the 102,474 positions added over the month, Social Security Ministry data showed, continuing a hiring spree at bars and restaurants seen in the third quarter.
After a dismal summer for tourism last year, widespread vaccinations and looser restrictions allowed for a tentative recovery this year. 
Some 4.7 million foreign travellers visited in September, up four-fold from last year but around half pre-pandemic levels, with numbers continuing to hold up later into the season as restrictions also ease elsewhere making holidays more appealing.
Speaking on Cadena Ser Radio, Economy Minister Nadia Calvino described the latest employment statistics as ""very positive"".
""We expect this trend to continue to accelerate over the course of November,"" she said, adding that employment had recovered to pre-pandemic levels.
The number of registered jobseekers edged down 0.02% from September, Labour Ministry data showed, slowing sharply from previous months' declines but marking the first time unemployment has fallen in October since 1975.
By sectors, joblessness fell in services, construction and industry but jumped by 5.1% in agriculture, the data showed.
Overall, some 3.26 million people remain out of work, about 570,000 fewer than a year ago. Third-quarter jobs data released last week showed more than 20 million people were working in Spain for the first time since 2008.

Despite optimism over the solid employment figures, Spain's economic recovery appears shakier than previously thought. 
Third-quarter economic growth missed expectations after an weak second quarter and inflation is at its highest rate in three decades, potentially jeopardising the government's target to return to pre-pandemic output levels by the end of the year.

Mortgage lender Nationwide said house prices rose by 0.7% in monthly terms in October after a 0.2% rise in September. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to another 0.2% increase.
The increase left house prices 9.9% higher than a year previously, although this marked the weakest annual growth rate since April.
Overall the survey underlined the strength of Britain's housing market during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even the gradual withdrawal of tax breaks on property purchases over the last few months has failed to seriously dampen momentum.
""We expect house prices to continue to beat expectations in the near term before a gradual rise in mortgage rates applies the brakes in the second half of 2022,"" said Andrew Wishart, property economist at Capital Economics.
The outcome of Thursday's Bank of England interest rate decision is one determinant of house prices in the months ahead.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 48.8 in October from 50.5 in September, below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
""A resurgence in virus cases hit the sector further as client demand weakened and new business fell for the first time in 2021,"" said Sian Jones, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Foreign demand returned to growth at the start of the fourth quarter, however, with new export orders up slightly. 
Service providers registered a renewed decrease in employment as they sought to cut costs. Although only marginal, the fall in workforce numbers was the second in three months. 
Inflationary pressures remained marked in October, with the pace of increase in input costs reaching a four-month high amid higher utility and supplier prices. 

""We currently expect consumer prices to rise by 6.4% on the year in 2021, with the Bank of Russia hoping that their recent 0.75% increase in the policy rate will quell steep upticks in prices,"" Jones said.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched down to 48.7 - below the 50.0 threshold that separates growth from contraction - from 48.9 in September.
""There were growing concerns among firms that supply disruption will intensify in the coming months and potentially limit the economic recovery, leading to a substantial fall in output expectations from September's record high,"" IHS Markit said.
""Difficulty acquiring a vast array of raw materials and components forced non-oil companies in Egypt to reduce their output levels."" 
Input stocks fell by their fastest since June 2020 as firms drew down inventories to support business activity, IHS Markit added. 
The sub-index for future output expectations tumbled to 65.0 from 85.7 in September with the worsening supply chain disruption apparently weighing heavily on firms. 
""Firms were particularly concerned that high inflation could lead to a slump in demand and reverse the economic recovery,"" IHS Markit economist David Owen said.

The new orders sub-index dropped to 48.7 from 49.1 in September, while the output sub-index declined to 47.5 from 48.9.

It was also above the series average of 56.9 and with the exception of the September reading was the fastest pace of growth since November 2019. The output sub-index rose to 62.1 in October from 61.2 in November.
""October PMI data showed the non-oil sector recovering at a rapid pace. Growth in output was the strongest seen for nearly four years, driven by a marked rise in client demand as the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions continued to boost economic activity,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
""New order growth ticked down from September's recent high but remained strong, particularly compared to those seen since the start of the pandemic.""
Non-oil private firms in Saudi Arabia continued to have a positive outlook for future business, with hopes pinned on expectations of further improvement in demand. The sentiment was the second highest of the year but slightly weaker than in September and still below the series average since April 2012.

""The rate of purchase cost inflation sharpened during October, giving further signs that rising commodity prices are feeding through to firms' balance sheets. With confidence towards sales prospects running strong, businesses were able to pass on costs to customers with the quickest rise in output prices since August 2020,"" Owen said.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), leapt to 55.7 in October from 53.3 in September on the back of higher spending and tourism. 
It was above the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction and the first reading since the start of the pandemic that was above the series average, now at 54.1.
""The Expo 2020 finally began in the UAE at the start of October and brought a highly welcome upsurge in growth across the non-oil private sector,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit. Expo was delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The output sub-index rose to 61.1 in October from 57.1 in September while new orders also rose markedly compared to September's reading.
""The increases in both output and new business were sharp and the most marked since July 2019. In addition, the boost to sales led more companies to predict a rise in activity over the next 12 months, as optimism jumped to the highest level since the beginning of the pandemic,"" Owen said.
Business capacity in the non-oil sector was under renewed pressure due to rising new orders, leading to a fourth consecutive month of growing backlogs of work, albeit expanding at a marginally softer pace than in September.

Growth in the employment sub-index was slight and only a notch higher than in September, remaining below the series average.
""The key test for the UAE economy will be whether this initial uplift in demand from the Expo can be sustained over the coming months.

Investing.com – China’s services sector activity expanded at a faster pace in October as demand remained strong. However, rising inflation weighed on business confidence for the year ahead.
Data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin services purchasing managers index (PMI) was 53.8, higher than the 53.4 recorded during the previous month. The index remained above the 50-mark indicating growth.
The data from the private survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, contrasted with the National Bureau of Statistic’s non-manufacturing PMI, which was a lower-than-expected 52.4. In the manufacturing sector, the Caixin manufacturing PMI was 50.6, and the manufacturing PMI was 49.2.
The services sector has made a slower recovery from COVID-19 than its manufacturing counterpart as it remains more vulnerable to virus outbreaks, with the associated mobility curbs clouding the outlook for a rebound in consumption in the months to come.
The “Zero Covid” strategy pursued by China has hit leisure and tourism businesses hard as the country deals with its latest COVID-19 outbreak. Cities with cases, or those with concerns about the virus’ spread, have closed entertainment venues, restricted tourism, and delayed cultural events.
Input prices also rose for the 16th month in a row, and at the fastest pace since July 2021, thanks to rising labor and raw material costs. However, solid demand allowed firms to pass some of the costs to consumers.
But persistent inflationary pressures and concerns about supply chains also drove business confidence to its lowest level in four months.
""Supply and demand recovery both retained momentum. Employment was more or less stable. Gauges for prices were high,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe told Reuters.
""Policymakers should not only take effective measures to stabilize commodity supplies and prices, but also pay close attention to downstream firms, especially small and midsize ones."""

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.8 in October - the highest since July - from 53.4 in September. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The improved readings in the private survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, stood in contrast with an official survey, which showed the expansion in the services sector lost some steam.
Analysts say the services sector, which has been slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, is more vulnerable to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks in the country, clouding the outlook for the much anticipated rebound in consumption in the months to come.
China's leisure and tourism businesses have been feeling the heat from the country's zero tolerance COVID-19 strategy to contain infections since late October. Cities with cases, or those with concerns about the virus, have closed entertainment venues, restricted tourism or delayed cultural events.
A sub-index for new business edged up to 54.1 from 53.1 in September, bolstered by rising export orders that contracted the month before. 
Input prices also expanded for the 16th month in a row and at the fastest pace since July due to rising labour and raw material costs. Solid demand allowed firms to pass some of the costs to consumers, driving an uptick in prices that charged to the highest in three months. 
However, persistent inflationary pressures and concerns about supply chains drove business confidence to the lowest in four months, the survey showed.
Caixin's October composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, edged up to 51.5 from 51.4 the previous month.

The unemployment rate fell to 3.4% in the quarter ending September, Statistics New Zealand data showed, far lower than a forecast of 3.9% by economists polled by Reuters. 
""The strong decline in unemployment brought the rate down to New Zealand's lowest rate on record, matching December 2007, when it was also 3.4%,"" work and wellbeing statistics senior manager Becky Collett said. 
Wage growth was strong in the quarter with the private sector labour cost index (LCI) recording a 0.7% lift, though just below a forecast 0.8% increase.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that the rental vacancy rate fell to 5.8% last quarter, the lowest since the second quarter of 2020. That was down from 6.2% in the April-June period and 6.4% a year ago.
The collection of data was affected by the coronavirus last year and part of 2021. The Census Bureau, which compiles the report, said the pandemic-related restrictions on data collection had ended in almost all areas in the third quarter, adding that less than 0.5% of cases were affected.
The rental vacancy rate is being closely watched as the debate over whether the current phase of high inflation is transitory heats up. Rents increased by the most since 2001 in September, helping to boost consumer prices that month. 
Rents are one of the sticky components of inflation, which is running well above the Federal Reserve's flexible 2% target. Workers returning to offices and schools reopening for in-person learning, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations, are boosting demand for rentals following a slump as Americans fled cities for suburbs and other lower-density locations early in the pandemic.
In the third quarter, the median asking rent for vacant units was $1,203. That was down from $1,228 in the second quarter, but up from $1,160 a year ago. Rental vacancy rates were lowest in the Northeast and West and higher in the South and Midwest. 

The homeownership rate was little changed at a seasonally adjusted 65.4% last quarter. In the third quarter, the median asking sales price for vacant homes was a record $285,500. 
High home prices amid tight supply could keep demand for rentals elevated.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing activity remained strong last month but was curtailed by supply chain bottlenecks and logistical problems which sent input costs soaring, a survey showed on Tuesday.
Ongoing disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, alongside a shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers, has caused product shortages and left factories struggling to get the raw materials they need.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to an eight-month low of 58.3 in October from September's 58.6, shy of an initial 58.5 ""flash"" estimate but still comfortably above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Thursday and seen as a good guide to economic health, dropped to 53.3 from September's 55.6, its lowest reading since June last year.
""Overall, the demand side continues to be very strong so that's a positive sign,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
""But input shortages and transportation problems are continuing to hurt the manufacturing sector and those issues appear to be here to stay for the foreseeable future.""
Supply chain issues and rising inflation hit French, German and Spanish factories but Italian manufacturing recorded healthy expansion, growing at its strongest rate since June, earlier surveys showed.
And in the United States manufacturing activity slowed, a survey showed on Monday, with all industries reporting record-long lead times for raw materials, indicating stretched supply chains continued to constrain economic activity in the world's largest economy.
However, Asia's factory activity stepped up a gear in October as emerging economies saw COVID-19 infections subside, although rising input costs, material shortages and slowing Chinese growth clouded the outlook, Monday data showed. 
Those shortages meant suppliers were able to jack up their charges, and the input prices index for the euro zone climbed to 89.5 from 86.9, the highest since the survey began in mid-1997.
Although the bloc's economy continued to boom over the summer as activity rebounded after coronavirus lockdowns, inflation is also blowing past expectations, official data showed last week.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde acknowledged last Thursday that inflation would be high for even longer but pushed back against market bets that price pressures would trigger an ECB interest rate hike as soon as next year.
""There are huge upward pressures on input prices and costs more generally, and these are likely to lead to high prices for consumers over time,"" said Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics.

The outlook for factories has been clouded by shortages of semiconductors and raw materials that are hitting the German auto industry particularly hard.
The shortages, coupled with rising energy prices, have forced manufacturers to pass the added costs on to consumers, raising fears of an inflation spiral that dampens both cosumption and growth.
""According to surveyed businesses, the well-documented slowdown in autos production is dragging down other parts of the manufacturing economy with it, as firms in that sector scale back orders for components and materials,"" said Phil Smith, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.

""Worryingly, the supply problems took a turn for the worse in October, with lead times on purchases lengthening to the greatest extent for three months,"" he said, adding that cost inflation has crept up towards record highs seen in the summer.

The index remained above the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions, but IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes said supply chain problems could continue to weigh on the sector.
IHS Markit added that manufacturing output had declined in France for the first time since January as a result of problems with supplies of key goods, caused partly by strict COVID-19 controls which have affected ports.

""Because firms cannot secure the inputs needed to make their products, orders are now also falling as clients are facing lengthy delays on orders or are unable to get components and other items needed to turn semi-finished goods into finished goods,"" said Hayes.

LONDON (Reuters) - The end of Britain's furlough programme has not led to a surge in new job-seekers, according to data that suggests unemployment is unlikely to rise sharply and could bolster the case for a Bank of England interest rate hike.
Research by recruitment website Indeed, seen by Reuters ahead of publication, shows only a small increase in the proportion of British workers who say they are urgently looking for a new job.
So far there have been no official figures on what has happened to workers who were still on furlough when the scheme ended on Sept. 30. Britain's Office for National Statistics estimates between 900,000 and 1.4 million employees were furloughed in late September, up to 700,000 of them full-time.
Uncertainty about how the end of furlough will affect Britain's economy is a key reason why some BoE policymakers think it would be better to wait than to raise interest rates this week.
Last week, government budget forecasters predicted unemployment would rise to 1.8 million people or 5.25% of the workforce in the final quarter of this year, up from 4.5% in the three months to August. 
But Indeed's survey of 5,000 working-age British people, conducted in mid-October, showed no big jump in job-seekers.
The proportion of people who said they were ""actively looking, urgently"" for a job rose to 7.7% of the workforce in October from 7.0% in September and 6.8% in July, when Indeed started the survey. The share of people ""actively looking, not urgently"" for a new job rose to 17.9% from 17.3%.
Indeed said the increase in active job-seekers between October and September was not statistically significant.
""The fact that urgent job search hasn't shot up suggests that the hopes many people had on the employers' side that the end of furlough would flood the labour market with candidates is probably not going to materialise,"" Indeed economist Pawel Adrjan said.
WORKERS RETURN TO EMPLOYERS
British employers reported record job vacancies in September. An inability to fill job vacancies in sectors with tough working conditions - such as lorry driving and food processing - led to empty fuel pumps last month and gaps on supermarket shelves.
Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank said on Monday that 60% of firms planned to bring back all their remaining furloughed staff, while 30% would reinstate more than half.
Separate research by Indeed shows Britain is in the middle of the pack internationally in terms of the rebound in job postings after the pandemic.
Job postings in Britain as of Oct. 22 were 35% above their level in February 2020. Australia had the biggest increase in job postings, up 71%, and the United States was in third place with a 48% rise. Belgium, Switzerland and Spain saw single-digit increases and recruitment in Israel was flat.
Sectors that remained in the doldrums included aviation, tourism and beauty, as well as some accountancy and sales jobs.

The timing of increases in job ads closely tracked the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions, which in turn followed vaccination rates in most countries.
""Public health is absolutely critical for economic recovery and labour market health,"" Adrjan said.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's consumer inflation accelerated to a near 10-year peak in October, forcing the central bank to revise up its 2021 price projections and reinforcing the case for another interest rate hike this year.
The consumer price index (CPI) jumped 3.2% from a year earlier in October, government data showed on Tuesday, the fastest growth since January 2012 and sharply higher than a 2.6% rise in September.
That matched a 3.2% increase tipped by analysts in a Reuters survey and remained above the central bank's 2% target for a seventh straight month.
The breakdown of data showed the cost of petroleum surged 27.3%, while that of housing rentals and outdoor dining increased 1.8% and 3.2%, respectively, on year.
That puts the Bank of Korea's (BOK) monetary policy board under pressure to raise the base rate further at the Nov. 25 meeting, following its first rate hike in almost three years in August.
Governor Lee Ju-yeol last month flagged further tightening could come as soon as November to curb rising inflation and household debt.
Hours after the data release, the BOK said it expects annual CPI growth for the whole of 2021 to hover above its 2.1% forecast released in August.
The central bank will announce the revision of forecasts at its November meeting.
Meanwhile, the finance ministry said it will buy back 2 trillion won ($1.70 billion) of treasury bonds to stabilise local bond markets, after rate hike bets led to a selloff in bonds, pushing up the benchmark 10-year treasury bond yield to the highest since August 2018 last week.
Tuesday's data also showed core CPI rose 2.4% year-on-year, the fastest growth since December 2015 and up from 1.5% in September.
Month-on-month inflation rose 0.1%, slowing from September's 0.5% rise but in line with forecasts.
New rules aimed at moving South Koreans toward ""living with COVID-19"" came into effect on Monday and are expected to boost consumer spending, with curfews on restaurants and cafes being lifted.

The government also decided to temporarily cut domestic tax on key oil products by 20%, which is expected to help consumers save up to 2.5 trillion won over a six-month period.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in October, with all industries reporting record-long lead times for raw materials, indicating that stretched supply chains continued to constrain economic activity early in the fourth quarter.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Monday also hinted at some moderation in demand amid surging prices, with a measure of new orders dropping to a 16-month low. Still, demand remains strong as retail inventories continue to be depressed, which should keep manufacturing humming. 
According to the ISM, ""companies and suppliers continue to deal with an unprecedented number of hurdles to meet increasing demand."" The government reported last week that the economy grew at its slowest pace https://www.reuters.com/business/us-economy-slows-sharply-third-quarter-weekly-jobless-claims-new-19-month-low-2021-10-28 in more than a year in the third quarter because of widespread shortages tied to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""Stress in U.S. supply chains isn't abating, lending downside risk to our forecast for GDP growth in the near term and a clear upside risk to the forecast for inflation,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
The ISM's index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 60.8 last month from 61.1 in September. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would fall to 60.5.
The ISM reported 26 commodities were in short supply in October, some for as long as 13 straight months. That compared to 24 in September.
The economy is struggling with shortages across industries as global supply chains remain clogged. Supply constraints were worsened by a wave of coronavirus infections driven by the Delta variant over the summer, especially in Southeast Asia. Congestion at ports in China and the United States was also causing delays in getting materials to factories and retailers.
The motor vehicle industry has been the hardest hit amid a global semiconductor shortage. Transportation equipment manufacturers in the ISM survey said they had diverted chips ""to our higher-margin vehicles and stopped or limited the lower-margin vehicle production schedules."" 
Other industries are also hurting. Manufacturers of computer and electronic products reported ""extreme delays"" and that ""getting anything from China is near impossible."" Food manufacturers said ""rolling blackouts in China starting to hurt shipments even more."" Makers of electrical equipment, appliances and components said though demand remained strong, production continued ""to be held back by supply chain issues."" 
The ISM survey's measure of supplier deliveries increased to a reading of 75.6 last month from 73.4 in September. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries. Economists and businesses expect supply chains could remain tight through 2022.
Longer waits for materials meant high inflation at the factory gate persisted. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers accelerated to 85.7 from a reading of 81.2 in September. Prices increased for 48 commodities last month, with only prices for wood falling. Prices for products like steel have increased for 15 consecutive months.
These higher costs are being passed on to consumers which, together with surging wage growth, is raising concerns that high inflation could be more persistent rather than transitory as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly argued. The government reported on Friday that wage growth in the third quarter was the strongest on record.
Fed policymakers are due to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to announce that it will start reducing the amount of money it is injecting into the economy through monthly bond purchases.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
'SHIFTING PARADIGM'
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index dropped to 59.8 last month, the lowest reading since June 2020 when COVID-19 lockdowns were in effect, from 66.7 in September. Factories have plenty of unfinished work. 
""One interpretation of this dramatic fall could be manufacturers facing a shifting paradigm that accepts supply constraints as a new reality,"" said Kurt Rankin, an economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
""Demand does not appear to be abating, raising the question of whether businesses' patience and profitability potential is becoming exhausted and that new inventory management techniques and the promise of fewer goods on offer could be emerging.""
Factories hired more workers, with employment expanding for a second straight month. Though manufacturers said they were still struggling to find workers, there were hopeful signs.
According to the survey, ""an increasing percentage of comments noted improvements regarding employment, compared to less than 5% in September."" It also noted that ""an overwhelming majority of panelists indicate their companies are hiring or attempting to hire."" 
This, combined with a jump in consumers' perceptions of the labor market last month, suggests employment gains accelerated in October after the economy created the fewest jobs in nine months in September. Worker shortages, however, remain a constraint. There were 10.4 million unfilled jobs at the end of August.
The Labor Department is scheduled to publish its closely watched employment report for October on Friday.

A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending dropped 0.5% in September, which was blamed on shortages and Hurricane Ida in late August.
Still, the spending composition was not as weak as the government had assumed in its advance third-quarter GDP estimate last week. That led some economists to anticipate that third-quarter GDP growth could be revised up to about a 2.2% rate from the published 2.0% pace when the government releases its second estimate later this month.

The Commerce Department said on Monday that construction spending dropped 0.5% after edging up 0.1% in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending gaining 0.4%.
Construction spending increased 7.8% on a year-on-year basis in September. The government reported last week that gross domestic product increased at a 2.0% annualized rate, stepping down from the April-June's robust 6.7% pace.

Investment in private non-residential construction like gas and oil well drilling fell 0.6% in September. Spending on structures declined for a second straight quarter in the July-September period, led by commercial and healthcare structures.
Spending on public construction projects tumbled 0.7% in September after increasing 1.2% in August. Outlays on state and local government construction projects fell 0.4%, xxx federal government spending plunged 4.3%.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 57.7 in October from 57.0 in September, its highest reading since March when it notched a record-setting level of 58.5.
It was the 16th straight month that the PMI was above the 50 threshold marking growth in the sector.
""Latest PMI data revealed that Canada's manufacturing sector performed strongly,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. ""New orders rose at a quicker pace in October, and firms continued hiring activity to meet their existing orders.""
The new orders index rose to 55.3 from 54.5 in September, while the employment measure was up at 53.2 from 52.8.
Canada has regained all the jobs it lost in the pandemic, while the Bank of Canada last week became the first central bank from a G7 country to exit quantitative easing and signaled it could hike interest rates as soon as April.
Price measures stayed at elevated levels and lead times lengthened, with the index of suppliers' delivery times falling to its lowest level in the 11-year history of the data.

But stocks of purchases rose at the fastest pace on record as firms sought to protect against future supply shocks and manufacturers remained upbeat, with the future output index climbing to the highest since April 2018.
""Canada's manufacturing sector has performed well over the course of the year, which was reflected in sentiment,"" Patel said. ""Anecdotal evidence suggests firms are gearing up for another busy 12 months of trading.""

The seasonally adjusted manufacturing PMI slipped to 65.4 points in October from 68.1 in September but remained well within growth territory.
""Procurement problems are likely to be among the factors
contributing to a slowdown in output. Suppliers' delivery times
are still rising, albeit somewhat less broadly than in the previous months. Moreover, purchase prices are widely increasing, with 82% of the respondents facing higher costs for input materials,"" said economist Claude Maurer at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), which helps compile the index.
Procurement uncertainties have prompted businesses to
replenish inventories, with stocks of finished goods now
being topped up as well as stocks of purchases, he added. 
""Higher inventories are something of a double-edged sword for companies, as while they allow goods to be dispatched quickly when demand rises, they become a burden when demand drops. Given the generally positive momentum at present, the trend in inventories is probably a favourable sign for the time being,"" Maurer said.
The pace of workforce expansion was relatively muted despite solid levels of capacity utilisation and widespread scarcity problems. Only a quarter of businesses were recruiting staff. 

The service sector PMI, which is more focused on domestic
consumption, also edged lower in October, but momentum remained higher than average and prices were climbing on a broad scale.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asia's factory activity stepped up a gear in October as emerging economies saw COVID-19 infections subside, but rising input costs, material shortages and slowing Chinese growth cloud the outlook, business surveys showed on Monday.
Policymakers in the region face pressures on multiple fronts as they steer their economies out of the pandemic-induced doldrums while also trying to keep prices under control amid rising commodity costs and parts shortages.
China's factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in four months in October, the private sector Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed on Monday, as dwindling COVID-19 cases drove up domestic demand.
But a sub-index for output showed production shrank for the third straight month due to power shortages and rising costs, falling in line with Sunday's official PMI that showed factory activity in October shrinking.
""Shortages of raw materials and soaring commodity prices, combined with electricity supply problems, created strong constraints for manufacturers and disrupted supply chains,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.
Factory activity in October expanded in Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia as operations gradually normalised after being hit by shutdowns caused by a spike in COVID-19 infections.
Taiwan saw manufacturing activity growth accelerate on robust chip demand, while Japan's factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in six months in October in an encouraging sign for the world's third-largest economy.
India's factory activity expanded at its quickest pace in eight months in October, pointing to an extended business recovery in Asia's third-largest economy.
In a sign of the patchy nature of the region's recovery, however, South Korea's factory activity rose at the slowest pace in 13 months in October on shrinking output and softer demand.
Material shortages and delivery disruptions drove up Japan's input prices by the most in over 13 years.
""While October Manufacturing PMIs point to a strong rise in manufacturing output, industry is likely to be working through huge backlogs of orders for many months to come and resulting supply shortages further afield are set to persist,"" said Alex Holmes, emerging Asia economist at Capital Economics.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan PMI in October rose to 53.2 from 51.5 in the previous month, expanding for the ninth consecutive month.
South Korea's PMI, by contrast, fell to 50.2 in October from 52.4 in September, though it managed to stand above the 50-mark threshold that indicates expansion in activity, for a 13th straight month.

Vietnam's PMI rose to 52.1 from 40.2 in September, while that of Indonesia increased to 57.2 from 52.2, the surveys showed. Malaysia's index stood at 52.2, up from 48.1.
Asia's emerging economies have lagged advanced economies in recovering from the pandemic's pain as delays in vaccine rollouts and a spike in Delta variant cases hurt consumption and factory production.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.6 in October - its highest level since June. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the index to remain unchanged from September at 50.0. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The relative strength in the Caixin PMI contrasts with an official survey released on Sunday which showed China's factory activity shrank for a second month.
Analysts attributed the divergence to the different samples and survey periods. But even the more bullish Caixin survey, which focuses on smaller firms in coastal regions, showed a sub-index for output showed production shrank for the third consecutive month and at a faster rate than in September.
New export orders fell for a third straight month, countering a rise in a sub-index for new orders to 51.4 from 50.8 in September.
""The Caixin manufacturing PMI managed to reflect the partial normalisation of power supply in October,"" said Ting Lu, chief China Economist at Nomura, although he added it failed to capture the massive power blackouts in September. 
""We need exercise caution when interpreting both the official and Caixin PMI due to their imperfect performance."" 
This year, China's sprawling manufacturing sector has been tested by COVID-19 outbreaks, higher costs, production bottlenecks, and more recently, power rationing.
A power crunch triggered by a shortage of coal, tougher emissions standards, and strong industrial demand had led to widespread curbs on electricity usage, hurting factory output. 
But the situation began to improve in October under heavy government intervention. 
Still, input prices rose at their fastest pace since December 2016, partly due to higher energy and transport costs, while gains for price charged also accelerated to the highest since May, adding to concerns about the emergence of stagflation.
To help struggling manufacturers, China's cabinet said on Wednesday that the government will defer some taxes for manufacturers for three months from November.
Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, warned that a new wave of COVID-19 outbreaks in many central and western regions since late October could deal a fresh blow to economic activity. 

""It is critical to balance the goals of controlling the outbreaks and maintaining normal economic activity,"" said Wang. 
China's economic growth is likely to slow to 5.5% in 2022 from an expected expansion of 8.2% this year, a Reuters poll showed.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean exports marked an eighth straight month of double-digit growth in October, propelled by post-lockdown recoveries in major markets, which pushed up demand for Korean chips and petrochemical products.
Exports surged 24.0% in October from a year earlier, faster than the 16.7% growth from September but missing the 27.0% growth seen in a Reuters poll.
Asia's fourth-largest economy is widely considered a bellwether for global trade as it is the first to release export data among major trading economies.
Imports jumped at a faster 37.8% on-year, also accelerating from a 31.0% expansion in September.
The $55.83 billion of exports logged in September was a record in terms of monthly shipments, but the pace of growth will slow in the coming months with the post-lockdown recovery now past its peak, said Park Chong-hoon, an economist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank of Korea.
""Export growth will slow to between 10% and 20% in the coming months, as the base effect fades,"" Park said. ""Having said that, demand for South Korean products will remain strong as we see in shipment volume.""
By destination, exports to all nine major trade partners including China, the United States and Europe, increased for a seventh month in a row, a statement from the trade ministry showed.

A breakdown by items showed exports of semiconductors soared 28.8% in October from a year earlier while petrochemical products surged 138.1%. 
Exports of cars, however, declined 4.7% on-year, due to chip shortages and base effects from last year, the statement said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian home prices raced to fresh heights in October, piling pressure on the country's central bank to open the door to an interest rates rise well before the current projection of 2024.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) holds its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday and speculation is rife it will soften or drop a commitment to keep yields on its April 2024 target bond at 0.1%, effectively signalling an earlier hike in cash rates.
""Yield curve control (YCC) is extraordinary policy that semi-ties the central bank’s hands, limiting forward flexibility,"" said Nomura economist Andrew Ticehurst. ""With the pandemic crisis passing, the case for extraordinary forward guidance naturally weakens.""
Highlighting those pressures were figures from property consultant CoreLogic on Monday, which showed home prices rose 1.5% in October, up a steep 21.6% on last year. That was the fastest pace since 1989, while Sydney boasted an annual gain of 25%.
Ticehurst thought the RBA would likely bring forward the guidance date to, say April 2023, and perhaps shift from a fixed target of 0.1% to a range of 0.1-0.5%. 
""A range is easier to hit than a target point, and the RBA could regard this as a somewhat-elegant and partial exit,"" argued Ticehurst. ""The more aggressive option would be to simply drop it entirely, ripping the band-aid off in one go.""
Such a move would be a drastic course change given the RBA was only recently chastising market for pricing in any risk of a rate rise this side of 2024.
Investors have since gone far further, as futures imply a real chance of a hike to 0.25% by April next year and rates above 1.0% by year end.
The yield on the April 2024 bond is all the way up at 0.81% after the market suffered its worst routs in decades as the RBA declined to defend the 0.1% target.
The selloff was triggered last week by data showing annual core inflation rose a surprisingly strong 2.1% in the third quarter, taking it back into the RBA's 2-3% target band almost two years earlier than policy makers expected.
Much of the jump was due to the surging cost of housing construction, fuelled by global supply bottlenecks and a rush to build in a red-hot market.
The property boom has been a windfall for household wallets and consumer confidence, but has also stirred concerns about affordability and debt as prices run far ahead of wages.
Australia's main banking regulator responded last month by announcing a modest tightening of lending standards, with the threat of more action if the market failed to cool.
The RBA had resisted pressure to raise rates to restrain the market, arguing it would only slow the economy and cost jobs, but some pullback in stimulus now seems certain.
""We expect YCC to be removed on Tuesday and a full pivot to outcomes-based guidance in its absence,"" said Tapas Strickland, a director of economics at NAB.
NAB also expects the RBA to end its A$4 billion-a-week ($3.01 billion) bond buying campaign in February and now sees a first rate rise in mid 2023, rather than in 2024.
The central bank will also update its economic forecasts in a report to be released on Friday, which should see an upward shift in inflation and economic growth for next year.
While coronavirus lockdowns almost certainly caused a sharp contraction in the economy in the third quarter, world-beating rates of vaccinations have allowed most restrictions to be lifted.

Figures from ANZ on Monday showed job advertisements had already rebounded by 6.2% in October to be almost back to where they were in June, auguring well for a tighter labour market and higher wages growth.

Investing.com – Chinese factory activity grew at its fastest pace in four months in October, according to a business survey. Stronger demand contributed to the growth, but power shortages and rising costs hampered production.
The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was at 50.6, higher than the 50-figure in both forecasts prepared by Investing.com and reported during the previous month. The index was at its highest level since June 2021 and above the 50-mark indicating growth.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Sunday showed that the manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs were at a lower-than-expected 49.2 and 52.4 respectively in October.
However, growth in China’s manufacturing sector has slowed down thanks to COVID-19 outbreaks, higher costs, supply-chain bottlenecks, and power rationing. The rationing also led to a power crunch, thanks to a coal shortage, tougher emissions standards, and strong industrial demand, further denting factory output.
""To sum up, manufacturing recovered slightly in October from the previous month. But downward pressure on economic growth continued,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe told Reuters.
""Supply strains became the paramount factor affecting the economy. Shortages of raw materials and soaring commodity prices, combined with electricity supply problems, created strong constraints for manufacturers and disrupted supply chains.""
In an effort to provide some relief, China's cabinet said on Wednesday that the government will defer some taxes for manufacturers for three months from November 2021.
The latest wave of COVID-19 outbreaks in China since late October 2021 could also deal a fresh blow to economic activity, warned Wang. ""It is critical to balance the goals of controlling the outbreaks and maintaining normal economic activity,"" he said.

China’s economy showed signs of further weakness in October as power shortages and surging commodity prices weighed on manufacturing, while strict Covid controls put a brake on holiday spending.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 49.2, the National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday, the second month it was below the key 50-mark that signals a contraction in production. The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, dropped to 52.4, well below the consensus forecast.
The PMIs show the economy is under pressure from both the supply and demand side. Manufacturers are struggling with electricity shortages and rising costs, while consumer spending remains weak as the government’s Covid-zero approach means a tightening of restrictions around travel and social gatherings to contain frequent flare-ups of virus cases.
“Looking forward to November, the non-manufacturing PMI could drop significantly on the new wave of Covid-19 and China’s increasingly harsh zero-Covid policy, while the manufacturing PMI could remain weak due to shocks from both the supply and demand sides,” Ting Lu, chief China economist at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc., wrote in a note.
Another worrying sign in the data was the pick-up in inflationary pressure in October. Both input and output prices for manufacturers jumped, suggesting producers are passing on higher costs to customers. Producer-price inflation is already at its highest level in almost 26 years. 
“The jump of output price index in October is alarming,” Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd., said in a note. “This could lead to higher pressure on CPI inflation, and limit the space of monetary policy easing.”
The turmoil in the property market is another big drag on the economy. Housing sales have dropped, home prices are falling and the debt crisis at property developer China Evergrande Group is spilling over to the industry. 
Economists have been gradually downgrading their growth forecasts for the fourth quarter and the full year as risks mount. The consensus is for growth of 3.5% this quarter, with Nomura saying there could be further cuts closer to its prediction of 3%.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
Given the supply driven nature of the slowdown, the authorities are likely to continue an approach of modest and sector-specific growth support. 
There could be further liquidity support -- we still see possibility of a another cut in the reserve requirement ratio by the year-end, on top of accommodation via open market operations.
-- Chang Shu, chief Asia economist

A set of earliest available indicators tracked by Bloomberg also showed the economy remains under pressure. 
The slowdown turns the focus back to the People’s Bank of China and whether it will take any action to spur growth. The central bank has refrained from cutting the reserve requirement ratio since a surprise reduction in July and has kept policy interest rates unchanged since early last year.
At the same time, it’s injected almost a trillion yuan of funds into the banking system in the past two weeks through open-market operations to cope with month-end demand for cash.
Ping An Securities Co. Ltd. chief economist Zhong Zhengsheng said there’s less room for monetary easing given higher inflation pressure and more hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve and Bank of England. Fiscal and industrial policies will be the focus going forward, while monetary policy will provide stable liquidity and support targeted sectors, Zhong said in a report Sunday.
The NBS’s senior statistician, Zhao Qinghe, said in a statement that manufacturing demand and production both weakened in October. Smaller businesses, which are mostly in downstream sectors, face greater pressure, with the sub-index for these companies remaining below the 50 mark for a sixth month.
Consumers in general chose to spend the seven-day National Day public holiday in October at home or in nearby places due to virus and weather factors, according to Zhao. 
On the plus side, exports have boomed, with recent South Korean trade data signaling ongoing strong global demand that’s helped to underpin manufacturing. The new export orders index increased to 46.6 from 46.2, gaining for the first time since March. The sub-index has been below 50 since May.
Trade conditions still need further monitoring as the recovery from the pandemic in major economies has slowed recently, Zhao said.

""October data provided proof that ongoing raw material shortages and supply chain issues began to bite in the South Korean manufacturing sector ... (pointing) to a broad stagnation in operating conditions,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at HIS Markit.
Output returned to contraction in just two months, with the sub-index at 46.6, having shrunk at the sharpest rate since July 2020 due to significant shortages of materials, notably semiconductors and other electrical components.
Total new orders and export orders barely grew, with respondents highlighting slowing international demand and difficulties in sourcing freight and container capacity.
Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) rises in raw material costs amid severe shortages resulted in further rises in costs at South Korean manufacturers, with input prices rising at the sharpest pace in three months.
That led firms to pass higher costs on to clients, also pushing factory gate inflation to a three-month high.
In an effort to protect margins, firms were seen reducing staffing levels for the first time in eight months.

Meanwhile, firms continued to worry about the ongoing shortages and disruptions, with business confidence easing to its weakest level since September 2020.

LONDON (Reuters) - British business sentiment fell slightly in October after touching its highest since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic the month before, a survey by Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank showed on Monday.
Lloyds said its business confidence barometer fell to 43% in October from 46% in September but was well above its long-run average of 28%, despite rising energy bills and supply chain difficulties.
The survey chimed with the relatively upbeat flash purchasing managers' index published on Oct. 22 and may give Bank of England policymakers confidence to raise interest rates on Thursday for the first time since the start of the pandemic.
""While economic optimism saw a slight dent in October due to rising costs and the on-going supply chain issues, it is clear that firms are still feeling relatively buoyant,"" Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said.
The BoE's chief economist, Huw Pill, has said he expects inflation to reach 5% in the coming months - more than twice the BoE's target - and that a rate rise would be a live question at the central bank's meeting this week.
But other policymakers have said the BoE can do little to tame the short-term surge in energy costs that is pushing up inflation, and they are more concerned about residual weakness in the job market as the government ends its furlough programme.

Britain's Office for National Statistics estimates that between 900,000 and 1.4 million employees were still partly or fully on furlough when the programme ended on Sept. 30.
Lloyds said 60% of the firms it surveyed between Oct. 1 and Oct. 15 planned to bring all their remaining furloughed staff back to work, while 30% intended to bring back over half.

The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction. Analysts had expected it to come in at 49.7. 
China's sprawling manufacturing sector has steadily slowed this year, with output in September growing at its most feeble pace since March 2020 due to environmental curbs, power rationing and higher raw material prices. 
In line with the softer headline PMI, a subindex for production slipped to 48.4 in October from 49.5 in September. A subindex for new orders also contracted for a third month, coming in at 48.8. 
""About one-third of the surveyed companies listed insufficient demand as their biggest difficulty, indicating inadequate demand had restricted their production,"" said Zhang Liqun, an analyst at the China Logistics Information Center. 
More worryingly, a subindex for output prices rose to 61.1, the highest since 2016 when the statistics bureau started publishing the indicator, suggesting rising inflationary pressures while broader economic growth slows. 
""The production index has dropped to the lowest level since it was published in 2005, excluding the global financial crisis period in 2008/09 and the COVID outbreak in February 2020,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. 
""The output price index rose to the highest level since it was published in 2016. These signals confirm that China's economy is likely already going through stagflation.""
POLICY TIGHTROPE
Factory gate inflation rose to a record last month on soaring commodity prices but weak demand capped consumer inflation, forcing policymakers to walk a tightrope between supporting the economy and further stoking producer prices.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect the People's Bank of China to refrain from attempts to stimulate the economy by reducing the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve until the first quarter of 2022.
""Production remains weak, indicating the demand problem may be relatively large, and some easing of policy is still needed,"" said Zhou Hao, senior economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
The official non-manufacturing PMI in October eased slightly to 52.4 from 53.2 in September, when services swung back to expansionary at the end of a COVID-fraught summer. 
New clusters of COVID-19 returned in October, especially in the north, which could again disrupt economic activity and deal yet another blow to the services sector because of tough restrictions to contain the disease. 
""Due to the impact of the epidemic and weather, consumers were more inclined to spend their holidays at home or travel for short distances,"" said Zhao Qinghe, a senior NBS statistician, in an accompanying statement.

While the transport sector including air and railway services expanded, the growth was relatively weak, Zhao said.
China's official October composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, stood at 50.8, down from September's 51.7.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's services sector grew at a slower pace in October, official data showed on Sunday, as China combats small-scale COVID-19 outbreaks hitting mainly the north. 
The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.4 in October from September's 53.2, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. 
Analysts say the services sector, which was slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, is more vulnerable to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks, clouding the outlook for the much anticipated rebound in consumption in the months to come.

The CBI's monthly growth indicator - which pulls together surveys of output from manufacturers, retailers and other services companies - rose slightly to +29 from +27 in September, after hitting its highest since 2014 in August at +34.
""Given the headwinds business has faced, achieving above average growth for the past six months shows real resilience in the UK economy,"" CBI lead economist Alpesh Paleja said.
Many British petrol stations ran dry at the start of October, the most visible example of bottlenecks in the economy as it emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic and faces shortages of workers such as tanker drivers and rising energy prices.

Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility upgraded its growth forecast last week to predict an expansion of 6.5% this year and 6.0% in 2022, as the economy recovers from its historic slump of nearly 10% in 2020.
Many investors expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates this week for the first time since the start of the pandemic, although some economists expect it to hold fire until there is clearer news on the health of the job market.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased solidly in September, but was partly flattered by higher prices, with inflation remaining hot as shortages of motor vehicles and other goods persisted amid global supply constraints.
Inflation pressures are broadening out, with other data on Friday showing employers boosted wages by the most on record in the third quarter as they competed for scarce workers. The industry-wide surge could undercut Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's long-held view that high inflation is transitory. 
The strength in consumer spending at the end of last quarter, together with falling COVID-19 infections and recovering consumer confidence bode well for a pickup in economic activity in the final three months of the year, though shortages and more expensive goods pose risks. The economy grew at its slowest pace in more than a year in the third quarter.
""The economy has a supply problem not a demand problem,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""The economy has money to burn and that is why inflation will be hard to extinguish."" 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.6% last month after rebounding 1.0% in August, the Commerce Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.5%.
Spending was driven by demand for services such as healthcare, dining out as well as hotel and motel accommodation amid declining cases of the coronavirus Delta variant. A wave of infections over summer worsened worker shortages at factories, mines and ports, further stressing supply chains. 
Services spending increased 0.6% after advancing 0.7% in August. That offset a 0.2% drop in outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods, which largely reflected a decrease in new motor vehicle sales. 
Outside the shutdown in spring 2020, which severely depressed output, the third quarter was the worst period for motor vehicle production since early 2009 because of a global shortage of semiconductors. Auto inventories have been run down and some shelves are bare, curbing spending and boosting prices.
Price pressures remained strong in September, reducing consumers' buying power. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, climbed 0.2%. That was the smallest gain since February and followed a 0.3% rise in August. 
In the 12 months through September, the so-called core PCE price index increased 3.6% for a fourth straight month. The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.3% after gaining 0.6% in August.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower after dismal results from mega-cap firms Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) reignited concerns of labor and supply shortages. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
WAGES SURGING
The Fed is expected to announce at next week's policy meeting that it will start reducing the amount of money it is pumping into the economy through monthly bond purchases.
The consumer spending and inflation data was included in the advance gross domestic product report for the third quarter published on Thursday. 
Growth in consumer spending braked to a 1.6% annualized rate after double-digit gains in the previous two quarters. That restricted economic growth to a 2.0% rate, the slowest since the second quarter of 2020, when the economy suffered a historic contraction in the wake of stringent mandatory measures to contain the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
Strong inflation pressures were underscored by a separate report from the Labor Department on Friday showing the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, surged 1.3% in the third quarter. 
The largest gain since the first quarter of 2001, when the government started tracking the series, reflected an increase across industries and followed a 0.7% rise in the April-June period. Labor costs powered ahead 3.7% on a year-on-year basis, the largest rise since the fourth quarter of 2004, after increasing 2.9% in the second quarter. 
The ECI is viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Economists had forecast the ECI advancing 0.9% in the third quarter.
Wages and salaries soared a record 1.5% last quarter after increasing 0.9% in the April-June quarter. They were up 4.2% year-on-year. Benefits gained 0.9% after rising 0.4% in the second quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, creating an economy-wide acute shortage of workers. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of August.
""While we expect wage growth to slow over the second half of 2022, as more workers return to the jobs market, the near-term pressure on labor costs will keep inflation elevated over the next few quarters and make it difficult to settle back to the Fed's 2% target anytime soon,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Solid wage growth and ample savings should help to support consumer spending and keep the economic expansion going. Though the Commerce Department data showed personal income tumbling 1.0% in September, that largely reflected the expiration of government-funded unemployment benefits. 

Wages increased by a strong 0.8% last month. The saving rate fell to a still-high 7.5% from 9.2% in August.
Household wealth is at record highs, thanks to a strong stock market and high house prices, positioning consumers to boost spending when supply improves. Consumers also accumulated at least $2.5 trillion of excess savings during the pandemic.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy shrank 0.2 percent in the third quarter from the previous three-month period, the first quarterly decline since recovery from the pandemic began, preliminary data from national statistics agency INEGI showed on Friday.
Service sector activity in the country was roiled during the summer from a resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic, while global supply chain disruptions have weighed on a recovery in manufacturing, notably in key sectors like carmaking.
The seasonally-adjusted contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) over the July-September period compared with a consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for growth of 0.1%, and followed surprisingly weak data for August.
Nikhil Sanghani, an analyst at Capital Economics, said the latest figures left GDP 2.3% below pre-pandemic levels, though he suggested the August data may be revised up and noted the economy was ""heading in the right direction"" going into October.
""But the bigger picture is that the recovery will still struggle from here,"" Sanghani said in a research note. 
""Global component shortages will keep auto production depressed in the near term, a slowdown in the U.S. will constrain external demand, and domestic demand will remain subdued owing to the lack of policy support,"" the note said.
The economy's sluggish performance risks creating a dilemma for Mexico's central bank, which has embarked on a series of rate increases as inflation surged well above its 3% target. However, its board has been split over whether to hike rates.
A breakdown of the GDP figures showed the contraction was led by weakness in the tertiary sector, which covers services, and which declined by 0.6% compared with the second quarter.
Secondary activities, which include manufacturing, rose by 0.7%, while primary activities such as farming, fishing and mining, also advanced by 0.7%, the data showed.
The dent to growth is a setback to Mexico, which during the pandemic suffered an economic contraction last year of 8.5%, its sharpest slump since the 1930s Great Depression.
The main hit came in the second quarter of 2020. Since then, Mexico had posted four consecutive periods of quarterly growth, including an increase of 1.5% during the April-June period.
Mexico's finance ministry said it was sticking to its forecast for growth of 6.3% this year despite the economy's third quarter performance.

Compared with the same quarter a year earlier, Mexico's economy grew 4.6 percent in unadjusted terms, INEGI said.
Final third-quarter GDP figures for Latin America's second-biggest economy are due to be published on Nov. 25.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Canadian economy most likely underperformed expectations in the third quarter amid ongoing supply chain woes and a brutal drought, official data suggested on Friday, prompting analysts to forecast the Bank of Canada could move slower on rate hikes.
The economy expanded by 0.4% in August, missing estimates, and looked set to show no growth in September, when supply chain issues crimped auto exports and retail sales declined, Statistics Canada said. 
The agriculture sector, hit hard by hot and dry conditions, is also weighing on economic activity.
Third quarter annualized GDP rose by just 1.9%, Statscan said in a flash estimate, much less than the 5.5% forecast by the Bank of Canada on Wednesday, when it signaled a rate hike could come as soon as April 2022.
Even though the central bank and Statistics Canada use slightly different ways of measuring GDP, analysts said the third quarter projections made an early hike less likely.
""This reduces the chance of the Bank hiking interest rates as soon as the second quarter next year,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics. Economic activity, which remains about 1% below pre-pandemic levels, is unlikely to close that gap until early 2022, he added.
Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, noted the preliminary third quarter data revealed the impacts of global supply chain difficulties on the ability of the goods sector to meet orders.
""The supply bottlenecks are both raising inflation and impeding growth at the same time,"" he said in a note, adding Canada could enjoy stronger growth and softer inflation in 2022 if the challenges eased. 
The Bank of Canada expects inflation, which touched an 18-year high at 4.4% in September, to rise further this year and then average 3.4% in 2022, above its 1-3% control range.

The Canadian dollar was trading 0.4% lower at 1.2387 to the greenback, or 80.73 U.S. cents. Investors continued to price in a first rate hike in March.
The August gain of 0.4% was behind analyst estimates of 0.7%, as agriculture weighed. Overall, 15 of 20 industrial sectors posted increases, with services-producing industries up by 0.6% while goods-producing industries declined 0.1%.

The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, surged 1.3% last quarter after rising 0.7% in the April-June period, the Labor Department said on Friday. The largest gain since 2001 reflected an increase across industries. 
Labor costs powered ahead 3.7% on a year-on-year basis, the largest rise since the fourth quarter of 2004, after increasing 2.9% in the second quarter.
""While wage increases were initially concentrated in lower wage industries, more recently wage pressures have been broadening across industries,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""Upward pressure on wages reaching relatively higher wage industries would suggest a greater chance that rising labor costs, along with rising prices for various other inputs, are passed on through higher consumer prices.""

304,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 06:37AM ET</span>",,,,,,"TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's economy grew at its slowest pace since the second quarter of 2020 in the July-September period as coronavirus curbs to contain a local COVID-19 outbreak hit consumption, but exports and investment remained strong.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 3.8% in third quarter from a year earlier after a 7.43% rise in the April-June period, preliminary data from the statistics agency showed on Friday, coming in just below the 4% increase forecast in a Reuters poll.
That was the smallest growth since the second quarter of 2020, when the economy gained 0.35%.
""(GDP growth was) mainly attributed to better-than-expected domestic investment as well as continuous expansion of exports,"" the agency said in a statement.
""But consumption was weak due to the impact from epidemic curbs, which partially offset growth.""
As a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan's economy has outperformed many of its regional peers during the COVID-19 pandemic as it benefited from robust demand for its tech exports during the work-and-study-from-home trend.
Government restrictions to contain a rise in COVID-19 cases from mid-May helped trigger a 5.49% decline in consumption in the third quarter. But economists expect consumption to rebound as the government has since lifted most of those restrictions, having managed to contain the outbreak.
""With the recent COVID-19 outbreak under control and the vaccine rollout gaining momentum, consumption should recover,"" said Gareth Leather, senior Asia economist at Capital Economics.
Meanwhile, Taiwan's economy continues to benefit from strong global demand for its high-tech goods and chips, while domestic investment has also underpinned economic activity.
Total exports soared 30.12% year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms in the third quarter, the agency said, adding investment in manufacturing capacity expansion and renewable energy was increasing, without providing further details.
""A backlog of orders will keep Taiwan's exporters busy for some time yet. Meanwhile, the surge in demand for semiconductors is leading to a boom in investment, which will continue to support GDP,"" Leather added.
2021 OUTLOOK
ANZ said it had revised higher its GDP growth forecast to 6.0% in 2021 thanks to strong investment in the third quarter.
That was in keeping with official forecasts, with both the government and the central bank betting on 6.0% growth in 2021. The economy expanded 3.12% in pandemic-hit 2020.
Statistics official Wu Pei-hsuan said as long as international demand for the island's products persists, both Taiwan's exports and production could keep their ""strong growth momentum"" next year. 
Pent-up demand in countries emerging from lockdowns has boosted sales, while microchip prices are surging due to a global shortage.
A global shortage of chips for everything from cars to consumer electronics has also bolstered demand for made-in-Taiwan semiconductors, with producers rapidly expanding capacity.
One potential risk could be a slowdown in the economy of China, Taiwan's top trading partner. The world's second-largest economy grew at its slowest pace in a year in the third quarter, hurt by power shortages, supply bottlenecks and sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks.

Taiwan's central bank has kept interest rates at record lows since the last cut in March 2020, and analysts say it is unlikely to increase them until later next year at the earliest, and only after an eventual U.S. rate hike.
Taiwan's revised GDP figures, including growth estimates for the full year, will be released in November.

Heavy rains that flooded key northern producing regions pushed up the prices of vegetables, fuelling concern over food prices at a time when consumers must brace for a hike in energy costs ahead of winter.
Local authorities must ""strengthen responsibility and make ensuring stable production and supplies of vegetables an important task,"" the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said on its website.
The prices of vegetables have jumped in some regions since late September, fuelled by factors such as disastrous weather, rising costs of production, coronavirus control measures and power curbs, the ministry added.
The call comes as Beijing focuses on food security after the COVID-19 pandemic, as the world’s top consumer struggles with an unpreceded power crunch that has pushed up production costs.

The ministry asked local governments to ensure sufficient emergency stockpiles of vegetables. It urged them to stabilise prices, and ensure supplies during autumn and winter, particularly during festive occasions such as the Lunar New Year, the Spring Festival and the Winter Olympics.
It also urged preparation of emergency plans to cushion against the impact of bad weather and diseases.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI)is expected to rise to 49.7 in October, just above a reading of 49.6 in September, according to the median forecast of 23 economists polled by Reuters. A reading below 50 indicates contraction from the previous month.
China's economy rapidly recovered from a pandemic-induced slump last year, but momentum has weakened in recent months, with the vast manufacturing sector facing heightened costs and production bottlenecks, and more recently, electricity rationing.
Power curbs should have eased slightly after policymakers moved to bring down coal prices, although overall factory activity is still likely to have shrunk, said analysts at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank.
""The authorities introduced steps to boost coal supply and raised the price cap for power supply to promote electricity production and contain demand from high-energy-consuming industries,"" they said.
September factory gate inflation rose to a record on soaring commodity prices, but weak demand capped consumer inflation, forcing policymakers to walk a tight rope between supporting the economy and further stoking producer prices.
China is also dealing with ongoing small-scale coronavirus outbreaks, which could disrupt economic activity. Health authorities reported 64 new confirmed coronavirus cases for Oct. 28, with local infections concentrated in the country's north.
Profits at China's industrial firms rose at a faster pace in September despite surging prices and supply bottlenecks, thanks mainly to stellar growth in mining and raw materials industries although some businesses struggled to shake off the high costs.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect the People's Bank of China to refrain from attempts to stimulate the economy by reducing the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve until the first quarter of 2022.

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big andstate-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector,will be released on Sunday.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Monday. Analysts expect the headline reading will stay at 50, the same as the month before, with activity stable.

Europe's largest economy grew by 1.8% quarter on quarter in adjusted terms, the Federal Statistics Office said. That fell short of a forecast for 2.2% in a Reuters poll.
Growth in the second quarter was revised up to 1.9% from 1.6%, and the economy remains 1.1% below its pre-pandemic level.
Supply shortages are preventing some manufacturers with full order books from producing at full capacity, and rising energy prices are driving up consumer prices, raising concerns of weak growth as winter approaches.
But the economy is expected to remain in growth territory as sectors like gastronomy, tourism and entertainment shuttered for months during the pandemic cater to pent-up demand.

The 1.8% quarterly expansion reflects strong activity in the services sector during the summer months, Fritzi Kohler-Geib of KfW bank said.
""Without the stubborn material bottlenecks that restricted the producing sector in particular, the growth in economic output could have been even higher,"" she wrote in a note. ""Unfortunately, the supply-side distortions will probably only ease next year.""

Flash data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed gross domestic product expanded by 2% in the third quarter from the second and by 2.7% from the same period in 2020. Economists polled by Reuters expected a 2.7% quarter-on-quarter expansion and a 3.5% annual growth.
Crucially, private spending decreased 0.5% quarter on quarter as Spaniards held on to savings built up over a year of subdued consumption.
Despite strong growth from the hospitality and retail sectors over summer, key industries like real-estate and financial services slowed down.
Angel Talavera, head of European Economics at the Oxford Economics consultancy, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that the growth was ""quite disappointing"" and that he expected future revisions.
At the start of the quarter Spain was still grappling with its most recent wave of COVID-19 infections, which it has since reined in through widespread vaccination. 
National statistics are still distorted by the effects of a strict lockdown imposed in the second and third quarters of 2020. 
In September the INE slashed its final second-quarter growth figure to 1.1%, less than half its initial estimate, prompting the central bank to say it would lower its forecasts for the full 2021 significantly.
Rising inflation, which reached a nearly 30-year high in October on soaring energy costs, has cast further doubt on the speed and scale of Spain's recovery from a historic 10.8% slump last year. 
However, the government has stuck to its bullish predictions for a return to pre-pandemic GDP levels by the end of the year and expects 6.5% annual growth in 2021, followed by an even higher 7% in 2022.

The Economy Ministry said the latest data put Spain in a good position to face up to a fourth quarter likely to be marked by rising energy prices and supply bottlenecks. 
Buoyant third-quarter jobs data released on Thursday, which saw Spain surpass 20 million people employed for the first time since 2008, provided some basis for optimism.

A Reuters poll of 24 analysts had forecast a 2.1% expansion for the July-September period
The INSEE national statistics agency said the third-quarter growth meant France's economy was close to getting back to its level before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
Analysts at investment bank ING hailed the third-quarter figures as ""excellent news"" but warned they could represent a peak for the year as the global economy battles inflationary concerns and supply chain problems.
""The peak has been reached and from now on, economic growth will start to slow,"" ING said.
Spiralling energy prices in October saw France's EU-harmonised rate of inflation jump to 3.2% year-on-year (vs 2.7% the previous month) as the cost of energy leapt 20.1%, INSEE reported.
Month-on-month prices rose 0.5%, it added.
Central banks around the world have been signalling tighter policy amid rising prices, though European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Thursday pushed back against market bets that price pressures would trigger an interest rate hike as soon as next year.
She identified higher energy prices, a global mismatch between recovering demand and supply, and one-off base effects such as the end of a cut in German sales taxes as the three main factors temporarily driving euro zone inflation.
INSEE has forecast the French economy to grow 6.25% for 2021.

The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index was likely little changed at 49.7 this month from 49.6 in September, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Readings below the 50-mark signal contraction. The National Bureau of Statistics is scheduled to release the data at 9 a.m. Sunday in Beijing. 
An electricity crunch that began in September extended into this month, although probably eased as the government rolled out a slew of measures to contain the crisis. On top of that, consumer spending remains weak and manufacturers are battling higher prices. 
“The biggest problem for manufacturing is that domestic demand and consumption is still quite weak, and it’s been sluggish for the entire year,” said Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY) in Singapore. 
Soaring commodity costs pushed up producer inflation to its highest level in almost 26 years in September, and a set of data tracked by Bloomberg Economics indicates a further pickup in prices this month. That’s squeezing profits of downstream producers, like consumer-goods makers.  
On the plus side, export demand remains strong, as recent South Korean trade data showed, providing a boost to manufacturing. China’s exports reached a monthly record of $306 billion in September. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
China’s October PMIs are likely to show mild cross-currents in a generally still-sluggish economy. The manufacturing sector may have avoided further weakening but likely remained in contraction with no signs of an imminent turnaround. The non-manufacturing sector probably slowed.

The non-manufacturing index, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, likely softened to 53 from 53.2 in September. The repeated Covid outbreaks and tighter virus control rules have weighed on consumer sentiment, while construction activity is under pressure from a slowdown in government infrastructure spending and a crackdown on the property sector. 
Economists have cut their fourth-quarter growth forecasts sharply because of the property turmoil and power shortages, with a further slowdown expected next year. 
A set of earliest available indicators tracked by Bloomberg signaled the risk of a further downturn this month, with car and housing sales dropping again even as exports continue their strong performance and the government seeks to allay concerns over growth.

Industrial production last month fell 1.8% year-on-year, Statistics Korea data showed on Friday, missing forecasts for 1.4% growth and down from a 9.7% expansion in August. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, output fell 0.8%, missing a median 0.3% decline forecast and following a 0.7% drop in August.
A breakdown of data showed production of cars shrank 9.8% from a month earlier, while that of semiconductors and electrical equipments also slumped 1.6% and 5.2%, respectively.
""September industrial output was weak as global supply chain disruptions were seen weighing on production in the manufacturing industry and on fewer working days,"" said Oh Chang-sob, an economist at Hyundai Motor Securities.
The country's biggest carmaker Hyundai Motor Co reported a lower-than-expected profits on Tuesday as the global chip crisis drove down vehicle shipments and said it will take a long time to get back to normal chip supplies.
That comes just weeks after its global chief operating officer said the automaker aims to develop its own chips to reduce reliance on chipmakers.
Separately, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd on Thursday said it expects component shortages to affect chip demand in the current quarter, even as it reported the highest quarterly profit in three years.
On an annual basis, production for cars and metal products plunged 24.2% and 16.9%, respectively, offsetting a 30.6% expansion in semiconductors.

Friday's data also showed service sector output expanded 1.3% month-on-month in September, while retail sales jumped 2.5%, helped by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions at home.

The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Thursday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, decreased 2.3% last month to 116.7. Pending home sales fell in all four regions. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts, which become sales after a month or two, would be unchanged. Pending home sales dropped 8.0% in September on a year-on-year basis. Scarce inventory has led to double-digit growth in home prices.
""Some potential buyers have momentarily paused their home search with intentions to resume in 2022,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.

Demand for housing surged early in the coronavirus pandemic amid an exodus from cities to suburbs and other lower-density locations as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and online schooling. The buying frenzy has abated as workers return to offices and schools reopened for in-person learning, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations.
The high cost of homes is squeezing first-time buyers out of the market. The NAR reported last week that the share of first-time buyers in September was the smallest since July 2015.

Madrid (Reuters) -Spanish inflation surged to a 29-year high in October as national consumer prices rose 5.5% year-on-year, flash data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed on Thursday, threatening the economic recovery.
Inflation sped up from 4.0% in September and is running at its fastest pace since September 1992, when the peseta weakened against the deutschmark and the rate reached 5.8%.
Driving the surge was an increase in energy costs and, to a lesser extent, in prices for package holidays and vehicle fuels and lubricants.
Soaring electricity prices play such a prominent role that the gap with core inflation, which excludes energy and food, is the highest since records began in 1986.
Inflation has risen across the euro zone in recent months, but to a lesser extent. The region's harmonised annual rate was 3.4% in September. 
Spanish core inflation, at 1.4% in October, is the indicator that most concerns experts and central banks in anticipating possible changes in monetary policy.
While the government argues price rises are transitory, economists fear they could trigger second-round effects on wages and erode corporate competitiveness.
Falling unemployment, driven by a sharp increase in hospitality hiring over the summer, is likely to exacerbate price pressure.
Industrial prices reached their highest level since 1977 after jumping 23.6% year-on-year in September, according to INE data published this week.
And, potentially compounding the effect, Spain is set to raise pensions in line with inflation and increase the minimum wage and public salaries in 2022.
Responding to elevated energy prices, the Funcas thinktank on Wednesday trimmed its 2021 economic growth forecast to 5.1% from 6.3%.
INE data also showed Spain's EU-harmonised consumer price index rose by 5.5% in October on an annual basis, the highest reading since the series began in 1997. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 4.8% price increase.
Spain's central bank expects relatively high inflation rates to continue over the coming months although the underlying causes are transitory, Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said on Monday.

Elevated energy costs could persist through the winter as cold weather boosts demand and oil and gas storage levels are relatively low, he said.
Spain recently approved a package of measures to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on consumers, but watered down the bill after fierce opposition from utilities.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Sweden's economy grew more quickly than expected in the third quarter, as a vaccine rollout accelerated and COVID-19 curbs were lifted, a preliminary estimate from the Statistics Office showed on Thursday.
GDP expanded by 1.8% in the third quarter from the previous three-month period, outperforming a forecast of 1.3% in a Reuters poll. The economy grew 4.7% compared to the third quarter last year.
The Swedish economy has bounced back more rapidly from the pandemic than many others in Europe, with activity returning to pre-COVID-19 levels in the second quarter.
Sweden, which never went to lockdown during the pandemic, lifted almost all remaining curbs and recommendations at the end of September.
Bottlenecks and global supply chain issues have hit some manufacturers and raised questions over how long the economy can keep going at full speed. Several Swedish car and truck makers were forced to halt production in August due to semi-conductor shortages.
""The growth numbers are strong, especially considering that shortages of goods hampered growth,"" Nordea wrote in a research note. ""Coupled with higher inflation, this makes a reduction of the Riksbank’s stimulus measures more likely.""
The pace of headline inflation in Sweden picked up to its highest level in more than a decade in September. The Riksbank, which believes price pressure will subdue next year, expects to hold its balance sheet unchanged in 2022 and for the benchmark repo rate to remain at 0% until at least the final quarter of 2024.

Separate figures from the National Institute of Economic Research showed Swedish consumer confidence fell to 103.1 in October from 106.6 in the previous month, but manufacturing confidence rose to a historically strong 128.5 from 126.1.
Retail sales fell 0.3% in September compared to the previous month but rose 4.8 percent compared to the same month last year.

Crude oil imports in the world's third largest oil consumer and importer rose 16% to 17.61 million tonnes from a year earlier, according to data on the website of the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.
""India's September crude oil imports climbed to highest levels since April, a sign that the reopening of the economy continues,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA.
""Indian refiners see crude demand roaring back as driving picks up and on expectations for a strong return of international travel in November."" 
Reliance Industries Ltd, the operator of the world's biggest refining complex, imported nearly 12% more oil in September than in August.
Factory activity in Asia's third-biggest economy improved last month, with recovery expected to continue for at least a few more months supported by ultra-easy monetary policy.
On a monthly basis, crude oil imports increased 1.3% versus August. 
Earlier this month, data showed fuel consumption and refiners' crude oil throughput ticked higher in September from the preceding month.
Oil product imports jumped about 13% to 3.50 million tonnes from a year earlier and exports were up about 3%. 

Of the 4.94 million tonnes of exports in September, diesel continued to hold a major share at 2.79 million tonnes, up 4.5% year on year and 7.3% higher from August. 
India holds surplus refining capacity and exports refined fuels as well.

Outbound shipments were seen growing 27.0% year-on-year, according to the median forecast in a poll of 14 economists, much faster than the 16.7% recorded in September.
""Exports were still supported by semiconductor demand, but the lack of (even) further acceleration might be evidence of supply bottlenecks,"" said Oh Suk-tae of Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Data from last week showed exports for the first 20 days of October surged 36.1% from the same period a year earlier, with those of semiconductors and petroleum products soaring 23.9% and 128.7% respectively.
Overall exports to major trading partners also continued to expand over Oct. 1-20, with those to China, the United States and European Union rising 30.9%, 37.1% and 42.1% respectively.
Economists in Thursday's poll also saw South Korea's total imports growing 40.1% year-on-year in October. That would compare with 31.0% in September.
""We expect a decline in the trade surplus in October mainly due to a rise in imports ... as the recent surge in energy prices probably supported imports,"" Oh said.
The government will publish full-month trade data on Monday at 9 a.m. local time (0000 GMT).
In the same Reuters poll, 12 economists projected consumer price index (CPI) this month to jump 3.2% from a year earlier, the fastest rise since January 2012 and greater than September's 2.5%.
""Consumer inflation would have risen on soaring energy prices ... and low base last year due to the government's subsidies on phone bills,"" said economist Park Sung-woo at DB Financial Investment.
""Despite the oil tax cut, the fourth quarter CPI growth will remain high on upside pressures on energy prices during the winter season,"" he said.

South Korea decided to temporarily lower tax on key oil products by 20% for six months to mitigate impact from surging energy prices.
Some 17 economists also estimated industrial output in September shrank a median 0.7% from August.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased to a record high in September and shipments surged, pointing to strong business spending on equipment, though stretched supply chains likely hampered overall economic growth in the third quarter.
Slower growth expectations were reinforced by other data from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing the goods trade deficit widening sharply last month, with exports slumping. While wholesale inventories increased, stocks at retailers fell as supply at auto dealerships continued to decrease rapidly amid a global semiconductor shortage.
The reports, which came ahead of the government's snapshot of third-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, had some economists ratcheting down their growth estimates. The economy is believed to have expanded at the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2020, when it suffered a historic contraction in the wake of stringent mandatory measures to contain the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
""The third quarter may be the weakest quarter for economic growth in over a year, but you would never know it looking at business capital spending setting records this month,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Business is looking past the slowdown in consumer spending in the third quarter and betting consumers will return to the shops and malls later this year and clear the shelves.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.8% last month to an all-time high. These so-called core capital goods orders advanced 0.5% in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders gaining 0.5%.
There were increases in orders for machinery, primary metals and fabricated metals products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell as did those for computers and electronic products, likely because of the worldwide chip shortage. 
Shipments of core capital goods shot up 1.4% last month after rising 0.6% in August. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.
Business spending on equipment has recorded double-digit growth for four straight quarters. While economists expect another strong quarter in the advance third-quarter GDP report on Thursday, the pace probably moderated because of the acute motor vehicle shortage, which has undercut auto purchases. 
High inflation due to strained supply chains is seen eating into the growth in equipment investment.
""Squaring this nominal increase in shipments with the run-up in producer prices for private capital goods takes away some of the optimism,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
SUPPLY BOTTLENECKS
The COVID-19 pandemic shifted demand towards goods as well as causing severe labor disruptions, resulting in unprecedented bottlenecks in the supply chain, which economists and businesses expect to persist through the first half of 2022.
The backlog of core capital goods hit a record high in September. That should keep manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the economy, humming.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, fell 0.4% after advancing 1.3% in August. They were weighed down by a 2.3% decline in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 3.8% jump in August. That largely reflected motor vehicle shortages, which resulted in orders declining 2.9% after tumbling 3.9% in August. 
Orders for the volatile civilian aircraft category plunged 27.9% after soaring 63.9% in August. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received 27 aircraft orders last month compared to 53 in August. Unfilled orders of durable goods rose 0.7% after advancing 0.9% in the prior month.
The flow of goods has also been disrupted by the supply constraints. In another report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit increased 9.2% to a record $96.3 billion in September. Goods exports dropped 4.7%, with motor vehicle exports tumbling 2.0%. 
Outside the shutdown in spring 2020, September was the worst month for motor vehicle production since 2010. There were also sharp decreases in exports of capital goods and industrial supplies last month. Goods imports gained 0.5%. But motor vehicle imports plunged 7.7%. 
The wider goods trade deficit prompted economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to lower their third-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 2.9% annualized rate from a 3.0% pace. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) trimmed its forecast by half a percentage point to a 2.75% rate.
Those estimates are within the range of forecasts in a Reuters survey of economists, which predicted the economy growing at a 2.7% rate in the third quarter. That would be a step-down from the 6.7% rate notched in the second quarter. 
The Commerce Department report also showed wholesale inventories increased 1.1% last month. But retail inventories fell 0.2%, pulled down by a 2.4% plunge in stocks at auto dealerships. Retail inventories, excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.6%

Inventories were depleted in the first half of the year. Economists believe the pace of decline lessened in the third quarter, accounting for the bulk of expected GDP growth. Trade has been a drag on GDP growth for a year, while inventories have subtracted from output for two straight quarters.
""Trade flows will continue to see pandemic-related disruptions, broken supply chains, shortages as well as delays, but should eventually rebalance as these effects diminish and global economies come back online more completely,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, in White Plains, New York.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Vegetable prices are surging in China after heavy rain swamped crops this month, fuelling concern over food prices at a time when consumers must brace for a hike in energy costs in the run-up to winter.
Unusually heavy rains drenched northern swathes of China in September and early this month, flooding the top vegetable-growing province of Shandong.
""All the vegetables are dead in the ground,"" said Zhou Rui, a farmer who cultivates about 7 hectares (17 acres) in the Juancheng county of the province. 
There was little left to pick after fields of spinach, cabbage and coriander were flooded, she added, while some farmers had not replanted as the weather had already become too cold.
The price of spinach has jumped to 16.67 yuan ($2.61) per kg this week from 6.67 yuan in late September, a price index published in the provincial vegetable trading hub of Shouguang showed.
The prices of broccoli, cucumbers, and cabbage have also more than doubled in recent weeks.
The rocketing prices are a hot topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), with many users saying vegetables now cost more than pork, the nation's staple meat.
""Coriander is now 17.8 yuan per half kilo, it really is more expensive than pork!"" wrote one user in the eastern province of Anhui. 
The rise, at a time of growing scrutiny for inflation, is worrying government officials in Beijing who are keen to ensure sufficient food supplies ahead of winter.
The average wholesale price of vegetables in the capital has jumped by 39.8% since last month, while some leafy vegetables rose more than 50%, the city government said on Tuesday. 
Authorities in Beijing have warned that prices could rise further in the next few weeks, as the city looks further south to source its vegetables when temperatures fall and high energy prices boost transport costs.
High vegetable prices are unlikely to push up overall consumer price inflation, but they come as soaring fuel costs look set to be gradually passed on to consumers.
""It's a very sharp increase, so it's very noticeable,"" said Darin Friedrichs, senior Asia commodity analyst at StoneX. ""We may see consumers budgeting purchasing of other things in response."" 
Higher energy prices are also pushing up operating costs for greenhouses, in addition to record prices this year for fertiliser.
""Our natural gas prices are up at least 100% and we think they could triple during Chinese New Year,"" said Xu Dan, manager of the HortiPolaris greenhouse in Beijing, referring to China's most important holiday, due next February. 
""I have to find a way to increase our energy efficiency. You can't ask consumers to pay three times the price.""

Chinese coal prices have gained nearly 190% this year on tight supplies following tough safety checks and graft investigations in key mining regions, while heavy rains flooded dozens of northern coal mines.

321,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 04:10AM ET</span>",,,,,,"PARIS (Reuters) -French consumer confidence in October fell back below its long-term average on Wednesday as households fretted about the impact of rising prices on their ability to save in the future.
Six months from a presidential election, the data will be closely watched by the government which has tried in recent weeks to cap energy and electricity prices and help lower income families pay winter heating bills and cope with inflation.
The INSEE official statistics agency said consumer sentiment fell 2 points to 99 in October from 101 in September. Fourteen analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a figure of 101 for the October reading.
Spiralling energy prices have led to a pick-up in inflation in Europe. Prime Minister Jean Castex last week announced a 100 euro grant to help lower income families cushion the pain of rising gas, electricity and gasoline prices.
The grant was on top of an expansion of France's voucher scheme to aid households with their heating costs during cold winter months and curbs on electricity rates. 
Even so, some families https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/bleak-houses-families-struggle-foot-frances-soaring-energy-bills-2021-10-26 say they are cutting back on groceries, refuelling their cars less and using the heating more sparingly to make ends meet. 

The INSEE data showed a sharp fall (-9 points) in household's confidence in their ability to save and a more moderate dip in sentiment about their future outlook.
On a more positive front for President Emmanuel Macron, consumer concerns about unemployment again fell heavily as the economy bounces back from the COVID pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly rose in October as concerns about high inflation were offset by improving labor market prospects, suggesting economic growth was picking up after a turbulent third quarter.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumers eager to buy a home and big-ticket items such as motor vehicles and major household appliances over the next six months. The share of Americans planning to go on vacation was the largest since February 2020, just before the nation was slammed by the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
A resurgence in coronavirus cases over the summer, driven by the Delta variant, and supply-chain constraints related to the pandemic restrained economic activity last quarter. 
""Consumers are more upbeat after a rocky third quarter and this argues for a strong finish for the economy in 2021,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Consumers know the tight labor market has their backs. Those forecasting a recession from the drop in the confidence late in the summer will have to back off that call.""
The consumer confidence index increased to a reading of 113.8 this month from 109.8 in September, ending three straight monthly declines. The measure, which places more emphasis on the labor market, remains below its peak of 128.9 in June. The rise contrasted with the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, which showed sentiment falling early this month.
The rebound in confidence coincided with an ebb in coronavirus infections. Consumers were upbeat about both current conditions and the short-term outlook. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that the index would dip to 108.3. 
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, raced to a reading of 45 this month, the highest in 21 years, from 43.5 in September. 
This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's closely watched employment report.
Combined with declining new claims for unemployment benefits, it raises hopes that job gains picked up this month after employers hired the fewest workers in nine months in September. Slower job growth has been blamed on pandemic-related labor shortages. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of August.
""This is another sign that job growth reaccelerated in October,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""It points toward a decline in the unemployment rate in October.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
HITTING THE ROAD
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months jumped to 7.0%, the highest in 13 years, from 6.5% last month.
Despite perceptions of high inflation, consumers planned to step up spending. Buying intentions for motor vehicles rebounded from a nine-month low. More consumers intended to purchase household appliances like washing machines, television sets and refrigerators over the next six months. 
Some economists speculated that higher prices were forcing consumers to bring forward purchases to avoid paying even more for goods. The rebound suggested consumer spending would regain steam after an apparent sharp deceleration last quarter.
Economists believe the government's snapshot of third-quarter gross domestic product growth on Thursday will likely show that consumer spending stalled last quarter after growing at a robust 12% annualized rate in the April-June period. 
With spending weak, third-quarter GDP growth estimates are mostly below a 3% rate. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. The anticipated slowdown would reflect widespread shortages, including for goods such as motor vehicles and some household appliances, as well as the Delta variant's hit to spending on services like air travel and hotel accommodation.
""Slower growth doesn't imply a weak economy,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""There is nothing soft about it, at least when it comes to demand.""  
Consumer spending this quarter is also likely to be boosted by increased demand for travel. The percentage of consumers saying they plan to take a vacation in the next six months increased to 47.6%. That was the highest figure since the pandemic started and was up from 42.3% in September. 
They mostly planned trips in the United States and intended to either drive or fly to their destinations.
There was good news on the housing market. In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes surged 14.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 800,000 units in September.
The Conference Board survey showed consumers more inclined to buying a home over the next six months. The housing market could get a lift from a moderation in house price inflation.
A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller's 20 metropolitan area home price index rose 19.7% on a year-on-year basis after a record 20% jump in July.

Signs that house price growth has peaked were evident in a fourth report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency that showed house prices rose 18.5% in the 12 months through August after surging by a record 19.2% in July.
""The slowing acceleration in home prices suggests that buyer fatigue is setting in, particularly among higher-priced homes where the acceleration in price growth from the previous month has been larger compared to low-tier homes,"" said Selma Hepp, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers, itching for a change of scene after more than a year-and-a-half of constricted pandemic life, are as eager to travel as at any time since COVID-19 sent the world into rolling waves of lockdowns, and now a record number of Americans plan to get out of the country in the next six months.
Nearly 48% of consumers plan a vacation in the next half year, a survey from the Conference Board released on Tuesday showed. That is the highest positive response rate to the every-other-month question included in the economic research group's benchmark consumer confidence survey since February 2020, the month before the coronavirus triggered a short but deep recession.
Travel and leisure activities were the hardest hit by coronavirus lockdowns. They began improving notably early this year on the back of COVID-19 vaccinations but tailed off over the summer and early fall as the Delta variant swept through the country, especially regions with the lowest inoculation rates such as the South that are also popular vacation destinations.

https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/TRAVEL/znvnezoaopl/chart.png 
Lynn Franco, the Conference Board's senior director of economic indicators, said in a statement the increase this month was ""a reflection of the ongoing resurgence in consumers' willingness to travel and spend on in-person services.""
That indication came as consumer confidence overall rose unexpectedly in October, snapping a three-month skid that had been triggered largely by the summer's Delta wave and by concerns over rising inflation.
While by far most people plan a trip somewhere in the United States - and by car - a record 16.8% said they are headed to a foreign country between now and next April. That tops the previous record of just under 15% in the October 2017 survey and is roughly double the series historic average of 8.4% dating to the 1970s. 
For a graphic on Headed to distant shores:

With fewer people planning to travel by air, the surge in foreign travel plans may in part reflect the pending relaxation of restrictions at the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-open-border-with-canada-starting-early-november-buffalo-news-2021-10-13, the two countries most easily reached by motor vehicle from the United States.
Indeed, nearly 35% of those planning a getaway of any sort say they will travel by automobile, the fourth-highest percentage since the Conference Board launched the vacation-plans supplement to its survey in 1978.
Of those planning to get away, just 19.6% plan to get aboard an airplane, the lowest percentage since the Conference Board's survey in February. That is more than 3 percentage points lower than the average over the past decade and 10 points below the record of greater than 30% in August 2019. 
The number of passengers proceeding through airport security over the latest weekend totaled roughly 5.8 million, more than double the volume from a year earlier but still only about 85% of the passenger volumes from the comparable period in 2019, the latest Transportation Security Administration data showed.

New home sales jumped 14.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 800,000 units last month, the highest level since March, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. August's sales pace was revised down to 702,000 units from the previously reported 740,000 units. Sales increased in the populous South, as well as in the West and Northeast. They, however, fell in the Midwest. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for more than 10% of U.S. home sales, increasing to a rate of 760,000 units. Sales dropped 17.6% on a year-on-year basis in September. They peaked at a rate of 993,000 units in January, which was the highest since the end of 2006. 
Demand for housing surged early in the COVID-19 pandemic amid an exodus from cities to suburbs and other low-density locations as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and online schooling. The buying frenzy has abated as workers return to offices and schools reopened for in-person learning, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations.
The median new house price accelerated 18.7% in September to $408,800 from a year ago. Sales continued to be concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. Sales in the under-$200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for only 2% of transactions.
About 74% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built. There were 379,000 new homes on the market, unchanged from in August. Houses under construction made up 62.5% of the inventory, with homes yet to be built accounting for about 28%. 
Builders are being hamstrung by shortages of key inputs like copper and steel because of strained supply chains. Lumber for framing remains expensive, while labor and some household appliances are also scarce. 

The government reported last week that housing starts and building permits fell in September.
At September's sales pace it would take 5.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 6.5 months in August.

LONDON (Reuters) - Full-time earnings in Britain rose by the most since 2008 in April, up by 4.3% from a year earlier, although the government's furlough scheme and other distortions related to COVID-19 probably pushed up growth, official data showed on Tuesday.
The Office for National Statistics' annual earnings survey is normally the gold standard of British labour market data, covering many more workers than its monthly figures.
But both series have been affected by the government's furlough programme - under which millions of workers had temporarily reduced pay rather than becoming unemployed - and the fact that job losses were concentrated among the low paid.
Tuesday's data paints a robust picture for pay growth that is similar to that of the monthly figures which the Bank of England is watching closely for signs of longer-term inflation pressures as it considers whether to raise interest rates next week.
Median full-time weekly pay in April of 611 pounds was 4.3% above its level a year earlier in cash terms and 1.7% higher after adjusting for inflation.
However, median full-time annual earnings in the 12 months to April were 0.6% lower than in 12 months to the end of April 2020 at 31,285 pounds ($43,023), reflecting lower pay during the pandemic.
""Pay increased for most workers in 2021, but particularly those that were most affected by the pandemic in 2020, most notably younger employees, men and the lowest-paid occupations,"" the ONS said.
Pay for 'elementary occupations' such as cleaning and labouring jobs rose by 7.7%, while pay for managers and directors showed no change.
Another factor pushing up pay at the bottom of the wage scale was a 2% rise in the minimum wage to 8.91 pounds an hour in April. The government announced on Monday a 6.6% rise in the minimum wage to 9.50 pounds an hour from April 2022.
Britain's gender pay gap - the difference between average hourly earnings for men and women - widened to 7.9% for full-time workers in April 2021 from 7.0% in April 2020, but was below its pre-pandemic level of 9.0% the ONS said.
The gender pay gap does not measure the difference in pay between men and women doing the same job, and nor does it adjust for differences in average qualifications, experience or the sectors men and women work in.

The gender pay gap stayed close to zero for full-time workers aged under 40, but older women were paid around 12% less than men of the same age. Previous analysis had linked this to fewer women than men moving into high-paid managerial roles, the ONS said.

The CBI's monthly distributive trade survey showed the headline sales balance for retailers picked up to +30 in October from +11 in September which was its lowest level since March, when many retailers were closed during a COVID-19 lockdown.
Economists polled by Reuters poll had mostly expected a reading of +13.
Sales were expected to pick up a bit more in November although retailers were keeping an eye on the latest rise in coronavirus cases in Britain.
But the survey's measure of stock adequacy sank to -23 in October, the seventh month in a row that it hit an all-time low. The shortages were expected to ease only moderately in November.
""Disruption to supply chains, combined with staff shortages and uncertain public health conditions mean retailers are finding it difficult to plan for the winter ahead,"" CBI economist Ben Jones said.

Finance minister Rishi Sunak should help the sector by reforming the business rates tax system when he announces a half-yearly budget plan on Wednesday, Jones said.
The CBI has long argued that the system is out of date and penalises companies which invest in energy efficiency.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace in the third quarter, as subdued private consumption and weak construction and facility investment offset robust exports.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in the third quarter, the Bank of Korea (BOK) data showed on Tuesday, the slowest in five quarters and following a 0.8% rise in the preceding three months. It also fell short of the 0.6% growth tipped in a Reuters survey.
Private consumption, which generates nearly half of South Korean GDP, contracted 0.3% in the September quarter after a 3.6% rise in the second quarter, while construction and facility investments also swung to declines of 3.0% and 2.3%, respectively.
Exports grew 1.5%, recovering from the June quarter's 2.0% contraction, on strong sales of semiconductors and petroleum products.
""The toughened social distancing measures and impacts from the heat wave and rising raw material prices that continued over the third quarter seem to have limited the recovery in domestic demand ... but exports were seen propping up the economy,"" Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said.
From a year earlier, the economy expanded 4.0%, in part because of the low base last year, while both exports and imports picked up further on global economic recovery.
That was, however, a significant slowdown from the second quarter's 6.0% growth, and missed market forecast growth of 4.2%.
""The data does not diverge much from the August projection. Annual growth of 4% will be possible should the economy expand 1.04% on a sequential basis during the fourth quarter,"" a senior BOK official Hwang Sang-pil told reporters.
The BOK currently sees the economy growing 4% for the whole of 2021 after shrinking 0.9% last year.
Economists, however, are concerned global supply chain disruptions and inflation pressures may pose risks to the fourth-quarter outlook.
""The near-term outlook for exports and manufacturing sector is likely to be clouded by sustained concerns about the global supply bottleneck,"" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY)'s economist Oh Suk-tae said.
But the economy could regain steam as the government aims to scrap the COVID-19 curbs by early 2022, which could add a further boost to consumption. The three-phase scheme begins on Nov. 1.

""With the transition to a new COVID-19 scheme in November, the expansion in private consumption will contribute to the economic recovery, while the oil tax cut announced earlier today will also help boost consumption,"" Hwang said.
The finance ministry said it will temporarily cut down domestic tax on key oil products by a record 20% to reduce pressures from surging oil prices.

The companies signed up for $9.2 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $8.7 billion a year earlier. Borrowings rose 8% from August.
""Supply chain disruptions and inflation concerns continue, with the Fed poised to gradually ease its asset purchases in the near term,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said in a statement.
""For now, liquidity is abundant and businesses are acquiring the productive equipment necessary to respond to customer demand in a variety of market sectors,"" he said.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 76.3%, unchanged from August.

BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -German business morale deteriorated for the fourth month running in October as supply bottlenecks in manufacturing, a spike in energy prices and rising COVID-19 infections are slowing the pace of recovery in Europe's largest economy from the pandemic.
The Ifo institute said on Monday that its business climate index fell to 97.7 from an upwardly revised 98.9 in September. This was the lowest reading since April and undershot the 97.9 consensus forecast in a Reuters poll.
The weaker-than-expected business sentiment survey was followed by a grim outlook from Germany's central bank, which said in its monthly report that economic growth was likely to slow sharply in the fourth quarter.
The Bundesbank added that full-year growth was now likely to be ""significantly"" below its 3.7% prediction made in June.
""Supply problems are giving businesses headaches,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said, adding that capacity utilisation in manufacturing was falling.
""Sand in the wheels of the German economy is hampering recovery.""
Half of all industrial companies are planning to hike prices due to the continuing supply problems, which is a record high in the survey, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
The bottlenecks for intermediate goods and raw materials are spilling over from manufacturing to other sectors of the economy too, such as retailing, meaning not every Christmas present will be available for delivery in time, Wohlrabe added.
The supply problems would slow down growth to roughly 0.5% in the fourth quarter, Wohlrabe said.
The German economy expanded by 1.6% quarter-on-quarter in the three months from April to June.
The Federal Statistics Office will publish a flash estimate for GDP growth in the third quarter on Friday. Analysts predict a quarterly expansion of 2.2% from July to September.
The government on Wednesday is likely to slash its forecast for economic growth this year, after leading institutes cut their joint forecast to 2.4% from 3.7% last week. For 2022, the institutes predict 4.8% growth.
""The coronavirus crisis has turned into a scarcity crisis,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said.
In addition to the supply problems, the spike in gas and energy prices is complicating the recovery, Gitzel added.
Other analysts pointed to rising COVID-19 infections in Germany, which could lead to renewed restrictions for retailers, bars and restaurants over the winter months.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Joerg Kraemer said companies were expecting politicians to react to the latest increase in coronavirus infections with new restrictions.

In addition, the current coronavirus wave is leading to factory closures, especially in Asia, which will exacerbate the material shortages in Germany, Kraemer added.
""The German economy is unlikely to grow much in the fourth quarter. Stagflation is on the horizon for this quarter at least,"" he said.

332,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 03:29PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -The U.S. budget deficit totaled $2.772 trillion during fiscal 2021, below the prior year's record shortfall but still reflecting a second straight year of massive spending to support households and businesses through the coronavirus pandemic, the Treasury Department said on Friday.
The United States posted a deficit of $3.132 trillion in fiscal 2020, when the federal government first started spending frantically in response to the pandemic. The $360 billion drop in the deficit - the first decrease in six years - reflected the rebound in economic activity this year as rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines and relief payments to households helped to fuel a powerful recovery from last year's recession.
""Today's joint budget statement is further evidence that America's economy is in the midst of a recovery,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement issued with the acting head of the Office of Management and Budget, Shalanda Young.
The U.S. economy is on track to grow by as much as 6% this year in a rebound spurred by the emergency measures enacted under the current administration of Democratic President Joe Biden and his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump. Combined with the launch of vaccines against COVID-19 late last year and an end to lockdowns over the course of this year, the federal programs have unleashed a wave of consumer spending that is powering the fastest growth since the 1980s.
Receipts for the full fiscal year, which runs from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30, totaled $4.046 trillion, an increase of $626 billion, or 18.3%, from fiscal 2020, with higher individual and business income taxes from an improving economy fueling the rise, Treasury said.
Fiscal 2021 outlays jumped by $266 billion, or 4.1%, to $6.818 trillion, with the increase driven by continued spending from legislation enacted to support the economy through the pandemic, the department said.
In September, the final month of the government's fiscal year, the U.S. budget deficit was $62 billion, roughly half the gap of the $125 billion in September 2020, the Treasury said. That was the smallest monthly deficit recorded so far during the pandemic and the lowest since January 2020.
Receipts last month totaled $460 billion, up 23% from $373 billion a year earlier. September outlays were $521 billion, a 5% increase from $498 billion last year.

The annual deficit reflected the toll inflation is inflicting on U.S. taxpayers. 
The cost to service the U.S. debt rose by $40 billion in fiscal 2021 but only because of an increase on inflation compensation outlays on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS. With annual inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index running above 5% for several months now, the Treasury paid out $113 billion above what it did in 2020 to compensate TIPS investors.

LONDON (Reuters) - A key market gauge of euro zone inflation expectations rose above the ECB's inflation target of 2% for the first time in seven years on Friday, just as the central bank weighs how to proceed with stimulus when its pandemic-era support ends.
The so-called five-year, five-year forward inflation swap jumped by as much as 10 basis points to 2.0528%, the highest since 2014.
Prices have soared this year on supply bottlenecks and spiking energy prices, with euro area inflation hitting a 13-year high in September.
Peter McCallum, rates strategist at Mizuho, said the ECB, which tracks the market inflation gauge, will probably be keen to talk down the rise at its policy meeting next Thursday.
""It's not in their interests to have (the breakeven) too high just because of what that implies for where outright yields are and where financial conditions are.""
After undershooting its inflation target of ""close to, but below 2%"" for years, the ECB adopted a 2%, symmetrical inflation target in July which will allow it to tolerate temporary overshoots.
Though market pricing suggests inflation will reach target over the longer term, the ECB maintains that the current rise in inflation is transitory and projects a fall to 1.5% by 2023.
That means it wouldn't be able to raise interest rates for years to come and policymakers have started to push back against the higher rates money markets are pricing in from next year.
Friday's spike in breakeven rates, which measure the difference between nominal and inflation-linked real bond yields, was driven by a fall euro area real yields to a record low around -1.87%.
In Germany, real yields also fell to a record low and the breakeven rate rose to around 1.91%, the highest since 2013.
Analysts said inflation fears were pushing real yields down, as inflation-linked bonds are bought by investors to hedge the risk.
But low real yields can also imply that investors expect a grim economic growth outlook down the line.
""The main question here is why real yields are so low, particularly taking into account the solid... growth outlook we have to think about,"" said Florian Spaete, senior bond strategist at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments.
Though growth is expected to be high this year, economic risks are rising and purchasing manager indices on Friday showed euro zone business activity slowed this month as firms grappled with soaring costs due to supply-chain constraints.
Germany's 10-year nominal yield briefly touched the highest since May 2019 at -0.069%, but by 1506 GMT was unchanged on the day at -0.10%, with the five-year five-year forward also retreating back below 2%.
Later on Friday, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) will review Greece's credit rating, with analysts expecting no change to the country's BB rating, which is two notches below investment-grade.

Greece's rating is particularly significant as without an investment-grade rating or ECB policy change it would fall out of the bank's bond purchases once its pandemic stimulus ends next year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business activity increased solidly in October, suggesting economic growth picked up at the start of the fourth quarter as COVID-19 infections subsided, though labor and raw material shortages held back manufacturing.
Data firm IHS Markit said on Friday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rebounded to a reading of 57.3 in the first half of this month from 55.0 in September. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector.
A resurgence in coronavirus infections, driven by the Delta variant, weighed on demand for services in consumer-facing businesses like restaurants, hotels and air travel. Together with shortages across nearly all industries, the flare-up in infections curbed economic activity. 
Gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter are mostly below a 3% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. The government is due to publish its snapshot of third-quarter GDP next Thursday.
The pick up in business activity this month was driven by the services sector. The IHS Markit survey's flash services sector PMI rebounded to a reading of 58.2 from 54.9 in September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 55.1 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Services industry businesses reported that unfinished work piled up at the fastest clip since the data firm started tracking the series 12 years ago. This was despite companies boosting hiring. Businesses still complained about difficulties finding workers. 
There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of August. About 7.7 million people were officially unemployed in September. The labor market disconnect has been blamed on the recently ended expanded unemployment benefits, people dropping out to become care givers because of the pandemic as well as fears of contracting the coronavirus. COVID-19 has also led to early retirements and career changes. 
With supply constraints showing no signs of abating, services businesses reported paying higher prices for inputs, supporting views that inflation was probably not as transitory as has been argued by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 
Raw material shortages restrained manufacturing activity this month. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI fell to a seven-month low of 59.2 from a reading of 60.7 in September. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 12% of the economy, dipping to 60.3. 
Factory production rose at its slowest pace since July 2020. Like their services industry counterparts, manufacturers reported paying more for inputs, and are passing on the higher costs to consumers, which could keep inflation hot for a while. 

The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 3.6% year-on-year in August. The U.S. central bank has a flexible 2% target.
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co announced on Tuesday that it would raise prices of some of its grooming, oral and skin care products in the United States to defray higher commodity and freight costs. Unilever (NYSE:UL) warned on Thursday its prices would have to rise further because of rising costs, including surging energy prices.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy unexpectedly regained momentum in October, despite surging costs and mixed consumer signals, according to surveys on Friday that could tempt the Bank of England to raise interest rates for the first time since the pandemic.
The preliminary ""flash"" IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers' Index rose by the largest amount since May to hit 56.8, up from 54.9 in September. By contrast, a Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a further slowdown to 54.0.
Sterling rose to the day's high so far against the dollar after the data, which contrasted with earlier figures showing a record fifth straight monthly fall in retail sales in September, despite panic-buying of petrol late in the month.
However, IHS Markit's chief business economist, Chris Williamson, said the unexpected rebound in the PMI should not be viewed as a green light for the BoE to raise rates on Nov. 4.
""The service sector is clearly in something of a sweet spot,"" he said. ""Rising COVID-19 case numbers pose a downside risk to growth in the coming months, potentially deterring some services-oriented activity ... and potentially leading to the renewed enforcement of health restrictions as winter draws in.""
Market researchers GfK said households this month were the gloomiest since the last lockdown in February, due to higher prices, shortages in shops and petrol stations and a big increase in the number of coronavirus cases.
Britain reported more than 52,000 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday alone, the highest since a wave of the Delta variant in July and more than anywhere else in Europe.
SERVICES STEP UP
IHS Markit said the rise in the PMI was driven by Britain's services firms as consumers and businesses spent more due to the rollback of pandemic restrictions. Travel firms in particular benefited from a relaxation of COVID-19 testing rules.
By contrast, retailers - who are not covered in Britain's PMI - have seen sales fall non-stop since a record high in April as supply-chain difficulties worsened and spending options widened as pubs, restaurants and hotels reopened.
Service sector activity outpaced manufacturing output by the widest margin since 2009 as factories struggled again with shortages of supplies and staff and recorded barely any growth.
The PMI for the services sector rose to 58.0, its highest in three months, while the manufacturing PMI's output component sank to its lowest since February at 50.6.
Higher wages and the worsening supply shortages resulted in the fastest increase in average costs since the combined composite index was launched in January 1998. Separate PMIs for the services and manufacturing sectors showed prices charged by firms rose by the most since these individual series began more than 25 years ago.
With inflation set to hit more than double its 2% target soon, the BoE is expected to raise borrowing costs soon as it tries to make sure that rising inflation expectations do not become embedded in British businesses' pricing decisions.
The Bank of England's new chief economist, Huw Pill, said in an interview published late on Thursday that the question of raising interest rates was ""live"" for the central bank's November meeting, and that he would not be surprised to see inflation exceed 5% early next year. 
The Confederation of British Industry said on Thursday that manufacturers were raising prices by the most since 1980 in the face of some of the biggest increases in costs and labour shortages since the 1970s.
September's retail sales data showed the biggest increase in prices since December 2011, and GfK said a record proportion of the public expected inflation to accelerate over the next 12 months.

But many economists think the BoE would still do better to wait until Britain's economy has returned to its pre-pandemic size before raising rates, especially as finance minister Rishi Sunak is expected to set out tighter budget rules next week.
""The risk is that by tightening monetary policy too quickly, some of the temporary economic damage from the pandemic becomes permanent,"" said Thomas Pugh, an economist at accountants RSM UK.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's government land sales slumped for a second month in a fast-cooling property sector as cash-strapped developers stayed on the sidelines, adding pressure on local authorities dependent on such auctions for income. 
The value of land sales nationwide fell 11.15% to 570.3 billion yuan ($89 billion) from a year earlier, according to Reuters calculations of finance ministry data released on Friday, after sinking 17.5% in August.
The slump comes as tighter regulations on borrowing by private developers since the summer of 2020 have increasingly eroded demand for land, after it reached a record high last year.
Private developers have bought at least 120.8 billion yuan of land in an ongoing round of land auctions held by 22 major cities, down about 80% from the first round in March-June, according to a Reuters analysis of public notices on the sales.
On average, land sales account for about a fifth of local government revenues. An extended sale slump could hurt local fiscal finances and investments as China's economy further slows while fending off contagion risks from the highly-indebted developer China Evergrande Group.
""The credit environment has rapidly declined since June, and financing for developers has been particularly difficult,"" said Lu Wenxi, chief analyst at property agency Centaline. 
Even for developers that have managed to sell homes, they have to wait for months before receiving the funds from buyers, as it typically takes three or four months before mortgage loans are disbursed, Lu said. 
Revenue from government land sales rose 8.7% to 5.36 trillion yuan in the first nine months of 2021, data from the finance ministry showed on Friday, slowing from 12.7% growth in January-August.
""The 31 provinces in (mainland) China are not equally dependent on land revenue,"" said Moody's (NYSE:MCO) analyst Amanda Du.
""The eastern coastal regions have high land values and low direct debt burdens, so even if there is a certain decline in land revenue, the impact is limited, because they have other relatively strong tax revenue or other incomes to compensate.""
But other regions that already have large funding gaps and high leverage, and are more dependent on land sales at the same time, will face pressure, she said.
Land sales hit 8.4 trillion yuan in 2020, equal to Australia's annual gross domestic product, helping to stabilise local economies in a pandemic year.
STATE SUPPORT
Heightened concern over the indebtedness of developers such as Evergrande Group led Beijing in August 2020 to introduce the so-called ""three red lines"" - financial requirements that developers must meet in order to get new bank loans.
The grim financing landscape has cast a pall over the sector this year, with capital-starved real estate companies putting a pause on new projects and scaling back on purchases of land from local governments.
Their retreat has paved the way for state-controlled developers to dominate sales. 
In Hefei, a populous eastern city in Anhui province targeted by speculative buyers and real estate companies in recent years, private developers bought 14.8% less land by value in the current round of auctions versus the first. 
By contrast, state developers increased their purchases by 75.9%, according to the Reuters analysis. 
But even cash-rich state developers have not yet managed to push monthly land sales back into positive territory. 
""In the fourth quarter, land revenue will continue to decline,"" Centaline's Lu said. 
""Now, the downward channel has obviously opened, and the market is already in a downward cycle.""
Prices of new homes stalled for the first time in September, according to Reuters calculations of official data released on Thursday. 
That bodes ill for the market in October, with autumn typically a peak season for sales.

LONDON (Reuters) - Nearly one in five vehicles sold in the European Union in the third quarter was an electrified model as sales continued to soar while fossil-fuel cars slumped, according to sales data released on Friday by a trade organization. 
The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA, which represents major European car, truck, van and bus makers, said that battery electric and plug-in hybrid model sales across the European Union made up just under 19% of all sales.
Battery electric vehicle sales jumped nearly 57% to more than 212,000 units, while plug-in hybrid models rose nearly 43% to more than 197,000 units. 
This is a slower pace of growth than in 2020 when sales almost trebled from a low base.
But it compares with a 35% drop in sales for petrol cars - which still are the biggest sellers and account for nearly 40% of overall sales - and a more than 50% drop for diesel cars during the quarter. 
Less than a decade ago, diesel cars made up more than 50% of sale in the EU, but accounted for under 18% of all cars sold in the third quarter.

As well as having to meet stringent new EU carbon emissions targets, car makers and consumers have benefited from government subsidies for electric vehicles. 
The European Commission has also proposed an effective ban on fossil-fuel vehicles from 2035, aiming to speed up the switch to zero-emission electric vehicles as part of a broad package of measures to combat global warming.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose in September for the first time since the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, a sign that rising energy and raw material costs are gradually pushing up inflation.
Analysts expect rising fuel costs to accelerate consumer inflation in coming months, though any increase will be modest compared with other advanced economies as sluggish wage growth weighs on consumption and keeps firms from hiking prices much.
""Looking through artificial distortions and one-off hits, we expect underlying inflation to peak just shy of +1.0% early next year before falling back,"" said Tom Learmouth, an economist at Capital Economics.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food prices but includes fuel costs, rose 0.1% in September from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, matching a median market forecast. It was unchanged in August.
The gain was driven mostly by a 7.4% spike in energy costs, which was the biggest annual rise in nearly three years. Gasoline costs surged 16.5% in September from a year earlier.
Processed food and durable goods also saw prices perk up, though the increase was more than offset by a 44.8% plunge in telecommunication fees as cellphone carriers slashed charges.
Analysts expect core consumer inflation to head toward 1% in coming months as recent rises in crude oil costs are seen pushing up electricity bills with a lag of three to five months.
But many of them doubt such cost-push inflation will lead to broader, sustainable price growth.
""The reopening of Japan's economy could lift service spending and foster price rises,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""But Japanese households tend to shift to cheaper goods when the price hike continues, which in turn may induce a price-cut battle among companies,"" he said.
The data will be among factors the Bank of Japan will consider at next week's policy meeting, when it releases fresh quarterly growth and inflation projections.

Japan has not been immune to global commodity inflation, with wholesale prices surging at a 13-year high of 6.3% in September, putting pressure on corporate profit margins and raising the risk of unwanted consumer price hikes.
But consumer inflation has been stuck around zero as firms remain reluctant to pass on costs to households, reinforcing expectations the BOJ's 2% target will remain elusive.

LONDON (Reuters) -Growth in euro zone business activity slowed this month as firms faced soaring costs due to supply-chain constraints, while the bloc's dominant service industry struggled amid ongoing COVID-19 concerns, a survey showed on Friday.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a good gauge of overall economic health, fell to a six-month low of 54.3 in October from 56.2 in September.
That matched the lowest forecast in a Reuters poll which had predicted a more modest drop to 55.2 but was still comfortably above the 50-mark which separates growth from contraction.
""The October PMIs are consistent with our view that economic growth in the euro zone will slow markedly in the fourth quarter, and that inflation will rise further in the coming months,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.
Supply chain bottlenecks caused by the coronavirus pandemic, alongside a shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers, meant the input prices index jumped to 73.1 from 70.9, by far the highest since the survey began in mid-1998.
Growth in activity slowed in Germany, Europe's largest economy, while in France an expansion in the dominant services sector was offset by weakness among manufacturers, as supply chain issues impacted business.
In Britain, outside the euro zone, the economy unexpectedly regained momentum, although cost pressures rising there by the most in more than 25 years could encourage the Bank of England to raise interest rates for the first time since the pandemic. [GB/PMIS]
The BoE is expected to become the first major central bank to raise interest rates in the post-pandemic cycle, a recent Reuters poll found, but economists thought the first hike would not come until early next year, later than markets are pricing in. [ECILT/GB]
PRICE PRESSURES
A PMI for the euro zone services industry fell to 54.7 from 56.4, its lowest since April, and below a 55.5 Reuters poll forecast.
But firms took on staff at the fastest rate since in over 14 years. The employment index rose to 56.0 from 54.1.
Manufacturing activity remained robust and the factory PMI only inched down from September's 58.6 to 58.5 although an index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, dropped to 53.2 from 55.6, its lowest since June 2020.
Prices for the raw materials factories need increased at a record pace, and while manufacturers passed some of those costs to customers, they were unable to transfer the whole burden. The output prices index climbed to 72.3 from 70.4, its highest since IHS Markit began collecting the data in late 2002.

That suggests the recent surge in inflation won't be dissipating anytime soon, raising question marks over the European Central Bank's view the upswing would be transitory.
""The combination of slowing growth momentum and building inflationary pressure could exacerbate divisions within the ECB's Governing Council ahead of next week's policy meeting, although the December meeting remains the one to watch,"" said Hussain Mehdi at HSBC Asset Management.

LONDON (Reuters) -British retail sales unexpectedly fell for a fifth month in a row last month, despite a rush of motorists filling their cars with fuel, adding to signs that Britain's economic recovery is losing momentum.
Sales volumes dropped by 0.2% in September, official figures showed on Friday, as supply-chain problems led to gaps on store shelves. It marked the longest run of consecutive monthly falls since the series began in 1996 and bucked economists' expectations in a Reuters poll for a rise of 0.5%.
This softness adds to the conundrum faced by the Bank of England over whether to counter rapidly rising inflation by raising interest rates next month, or instead to wait for the economy to recover more of the ground it lost to the pandemic.
""Overall, the data support our view that the economic recovery stalled in September,"" said Bethany Beckett, UK economist at Capital Economics.
Retail sales rebounded strongly in the first part of the year as lockdown restrictions eased first for shops. But they have fallen steadily since a peak in April, partly as people spent more on holidays and eating out after social-distancing restrictions were relaxed more generally.
In the three months to September sales fell 3.9%, which the Office for National Statistics said would reduce broader economic growth in the third quarter by 0.2 percentage points.
Compared with before the pandemic, sales volumes are 4.2% higher, but they are 1.3% below where they were a year ago.
EMPTY SHELVES
Supply-chain bottlenecks led to gaps on some supermarket shelves, and many petrol stations ran out of fuel in late September and early October as shortages of tanker drivers led to queues of cars trying to fill up.
""Labour shortages across the supply chains, on farms, factories, warehouses and lorry drivers, all threaten to derail this recovery,"" the British Retail Consortium's chief executive, Helen Dickinson, warned after the data.
Petrol sales in September exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time, but there was a sharp drop in sales of household goods such as furniture and lighting, the ONS said.
Consumer price inflation is also accelerating sharply, due largely to higher energy prices, and the BoE predicts it will exceed 4% around the end of this year, double its target level.
A narrower measure of inflation used in the retail sales data rose to 3.7% in September, its highest since December 2011.
The prospect of higher prices -- as well as a more recent upsurge in COVID-19 cases -- has dampened consumers' mood. GfK reported earlier on Friday that its long-running sentiment survey showed the lowest morale since February, when Britain was still in lockdown.
Retailers also face a dilemma over how much they should pass on cost rises to consumers. Discount chain Poundland and online fashion retailer Boohoo both warned of lower profit margins in recent weeks.
The BRC said three out of five retailers expected prices to rise before Christmas.

Another online fashion retailer, ASOS (LON:ASOS), parted ways with its chief executive last week amid fears that supply chain pressures and consumers returning to pre-pandemic behaviour would reduce profits by 40% next year.
Friday's ONS data showed online spending remained strong overall at 28% of total retail sales in September, up from 20% before the pandemic. But it is far below its peak of 37% in January when high-street shops were closed during lockdown.

LONDON (Reuters) -A record proportion of the British public thinks inflation will accelerate over the next 12 months, according to data that could further boost expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next month.
Some 48% of people surveyed this month by consumer research firm GfK expected prices to increase more rapidly over the next 12 months, up from 34% in September, the figures seen exclusively by Reuters showed.
It marked the highest share since records began in January 1985, when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and more than a decade before the BoE became operationally independent.
The surge in inflation expectations follows a month of rocketing gas prices that have caused the collapse of several British energy suppliers, leaving households faced with the prospect of hefty bills in 2022.
Global supply chain problems as the world economy reopens from COVID-19 lockdowns and labour shortages, exacerbated by Brexit, have added to Britain's recent inflationary tilt.
The BoE's new chief economist, Huw Pill, said inflation in Britain could surpass a ""very uncomfortable"" 5% and the question of whether to raise interest rates was a ""live"" one at its Nov. 4 meeting, the Financial Times reported.
Private sector economists increasingly expect the BoE will become the first major central bank to raise borrowing costs. [ECILT/GB]
""More and more shoppers expect that costs for goods and services will jump dramatically in the next 12 months,"" said Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK.
""This rapid increase will impact our ability to shop and save, and our willingness to spend at a time when our incomes are outpaced by inflation.""
The public are generally poor predictors of inflation but central banks watch their expectations for signs that consumers are losing confidence in authorities' ability to keep price rises in check.
A similar surge in public inflation expectations in the euro zone in 2011 helped to persuade the European Central Bank to raise interest rates twice that year - although it quickly reversed course.
Economists say those rate hikes were a mistake and some think the BoE is at risk of doing the same amid signs of a slowing economic recovery. Retail sales fell unexpectedly in September for a fifth month running, data showed on Friday.
On Sunday BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said the BoE would have to act if it saw a surge in inflation expectations in the medium term. Last month the BoE defined medium-term inflation expectations as five to 10 years from now.
While the GfK's gauge of inflation expectations covers the only the next 12 months, the scale of the move is likely to catch the eye of members of the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee.
The data are collected as part of GfK's monthly Consumer Confidence Index, which dates back to the early 1970s. The overall confidence index fell in October to an eight-month low.
""Consumers are already nervous about the state of their personal finances. The spectre of rising costs can only add to that growing concern,"" Staton said.

Before Brexit, GfK's price expectation figures were freely available as part of the European Commission's monthly consumer surveys of EU countries, but have not been publicly available since the start of the year.
The survey of 2,000 Britons was conducted Oct. 1-13.

Manufacturers struggled with supply chain disruptions and surging raw material demand that fuelled the sharpest rise in input prices in more than 13 years, as the health crisis continues to impact the global economy.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.0 in October from a final 51.5 in the previous month.
Key survey components showed output and new orders expanded thanks in part due to stronger overseas demand.
""Private sector businesses... noted an increase in aggregate new business for the first time since April, assisted by a quicker rise in export orders,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.
""That said, firms continued to highlight sustained supply chain pressures and material shortages.""
The au Jibun Bank Flash Services PMI Index rose to a seasonally adjusted 50.7 from the prior month's final of 47.8.
That meant services sector activity stayed above the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the first time since January 2020, before the economy went through its deep COVID-19 slump.

""Panel members commonly associated the slight recovery to a reduction in COVID-19 cases and looser pandemic restrictions,"" said Bhatti.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Composite PMI, which is estimated by using both manufacturing and services, rose to 50.7 from September's final of 47.9, marking its highest since April.

The GfK Consumer Confidence Index fell for a third month in a row to -17 in October, its lowest since February, from -13 in September. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of -16.
Fuel and food shortages, a jump in inflation, the prospect of higher interest rates and climbing COVID-19 cases were all making consumers gloomier, Joe Staton, GfK's client strategy director, said.
""Against a backdrop of cheerless domestic news ... it is not surprising that consumers are feeling down-in-the mouth about the chilly winter months ahead,"" he said.
Shoppers were also less keen to make big purchases in the run-up to Christmas, he added.
The loss of confidence among Britain's consumers complicates the job for the Bank of England as it weighs up when to raise interest rates for the first time since the start of the pandemic.

Inflation is on course to surpass 4%, more than double the BoE's target, but the pace of the economy's recovery from its pandemic shock has slowed and the number of COVID-19 cases is the highest in Europe.
The central bank is due to announce its next policy decision on Nov. 4.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a 19-month low last week, pointing to a tightening labor market, though a shortage of workers could keep the pace of hiring moderate in October.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed unemployment rolls shrinking significantly early this month. There is cautious optimism that the expiration of federal government-funded benefits on Sept. 6 will broaden the pool of labor in the coming months.
""Hiring demands remain robust, and the short supply of potential workers should make employers think twice about cutting payrolls,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 290,000 for the week ended Oct. 16, the lowest level since the middle of March in 2020, when the nation was in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It was also the second straight week that claims remained below 300,000 as employers hold on to workers in the face of an acute labor shortage. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 300,000 claims for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims, which economists say offer a better read of the labor market, tumbled 24,293 to 256,304 last week. A jump of 17,570 in filings in California was offset by notable declines in Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, New York, Kentucky and the District of Columbia. 
Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. A 250,000-300,000 range for claims is seen as consistent with a healthy labor market. The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 122,000 to 2.481 million in the week ended Oct. 9. That was also the lowest level since the middle of March in 2020.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
The pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, leading to a staggering 10.4 million job openings as of the end of August even as about 7.7 million people were officially unemployed in September. A range of factors has been blamed for the disconnect, including lack of childcare, expanded unemployment benefits, early retirements and career changes.
Though schools have reopened for in-person learning and the expanded unemployment benefits ended, there was no boost to the labor force last month. About 183,000 people dropped out, leading to a decline in the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one.
WIDESPREAD SHORTAGES
But with the number of people receiving unemployment checks under state and federal government programs falling by about 9 million since early last month, economists are betting they will start trekking back to the labor market. The total number of people collecting unemployment checks under all programs dropped 369,992 to 3.279 million during the week ended Oct. 2. 
""Presumably many of these workers will be looking for work soon, if they haven't already started to, this will help alleviate some of the current labor shortages in the economy,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for the nonfarm payrolls component of October's employment report. Filings dropped significantly between the September and October survey weeks, implying a pickup in employment growth this month. 
Claims data, however, has not been a reliable indicator of employment growth over the past year because of the upheaval caused by the pandemic. Nonfarm payrolls increased by just 194,000 jobs in September, the fewest in nine months. 
Labor shortages are occurring across all industries, and are causing congestion at ports and hurting production at factories as well as leaving shelves empty and fanning inflation.
The paucity of workers was echoed on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve's ""Beige Book"" report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide, which showed ""employment increased at a modest to moderate rate in recent weeks, as demand for workers was high, but labor growth was dampened by a low supply of workers.""
Shortages of workers and raw materials have led economists to anticipate that gross domestic growth slowed to as low as a 0.5% annualized rate in the third quarter after accelerating at a 6.7% pace in the April-June quarter.
Slowing activity because of the inputs crunch was underscored by a separate survey from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday that showed manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic regions grew at a moderate pace in October. 
Factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, reported strong orders growth as well as a building up of unfinished work. They were upbeat about business conditions over the next six months and anticipated higher capital expenditures in 2022.
The soft growth patch was also highlighted by a third report from the Conference Board showing its index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.2% in September, the smallest gain in seven months, after increasing 0.8% in August. 
""Anecdotal evidence suggests that bottlenecks are not easing, and survey evidence indicates that many businesses anticipate disruptions to last throughout 2022,"" said Evan Karson, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

There was, however, some good news from the housing market. A fourth report from the National Association of Realtors showed existing home sales jumped to an eight-month high in September. But the share of first-time buyers was the smallest in six years as tight inventory kept home prices elevated.
""Lack of homes for sale, compared with strong demand for owner-occupied residences, will continue to push house prices higher,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""It will be difficult for existing home sales to rise significantly in coming months."" 
 
"
346,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 10:06AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON(Reuters) - U.S. home sales surged to an eight-month high September, but higher prices as supply remains tight are squeezing out first-time buyers from the housing market.
Existing home sales increased by 7.0% - the largest increase in a year - to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.29 million units last month, the highest level since January, the National Association of Realtors said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales rising to a rate of 6.09 million units. Sales rose in all four regions. 
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, dropped 2.3% on a year-on-year basis. 
Demand for housing surged early in the coronavirus pandemic amid an exodus from cities to suburbs and other low-density locations as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and online schooling. The buying frenzy has abated as workers return to offices and schools reopened for in-person learning, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations. 
Though house price growth appears to be slowing amid an ebb in bidding wars, it remains strong. The median existing house price increased 13.3% from a year ago to $352,800 in September. That was the smallest gain this year. The moderation in house price inflation was because more smaller homes were sold last month. First-time buyers accounted for 28% of sales, the smallest share since July 2015, and down from 31% a year ago.
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide on or before October 8 that was published on Wednesday said ""residential real estate activity was unchanged or slowed slightly but the market remained healthy, overall.""

There were 1.27 million previously owned homes on the market last month, down 0.8% from August and 13% from a year ago. There is a huge backlog of houses that are yet to be built because of shortages of inputs and labor. That could boost housing inventory when the supply constraints ease.
At September's sales pace, it would take 2.4 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 2.7 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - For Delhi resident Suman Milind, rising prices in India are casting a long shadow this year over the upcoming Diwali festival of lights.
The 33-year-old homemaker is tightening her purse strings and altering her spending habits, thanks to soaring costs of fuel, transport and many manufactured items, coupled with stagnant incomes due to the pandemic.
""Earlier we used to get four or five boxes of dry fruits during festivals, but now we hardly get one or two. Because of the high prices,"" said Milind, adding that her family has reduced spending on food too by cutting back on meat to just once a week compared to several times a week earlier.
Millions of Indian households are facing similar strains on their budgets ahead of Diwali, which this year falls in early November and marks the country's busiest shopping season for consumer goods.
Many are foregoing big-ticket purchases such as television sets and jewellery this festive season, according to half a dozen people Reuters spoke to and a consumer survey by Mumbai-based consultancy Axis My India, threatening to slow an economy recovering strongly from the worst of COVID-19. 
Pump prices of petrol and diesel are up nearly 35% from a year ago and cooking gas by more than 50%, severely hitting more than three-quarters of households, economists said. 
""The sky-rocketing prices of petrol, cooking gas are unbearable when our earnings are still down by nearly 30% from the pre-pandemic period,"" said Sultan Singh Tomar, 53, who supplies incense sticks and kitchenware to shops in New Delhi on his scooter.
He said his petrol bill was up by 600 rupees ($8) from a year ago and refilling the cooking gas cylinder was costlier by 400 rupees.
Tomar is among millions of people working in the informal sector who dipped into savings during the pandemic and are now forced to pare back household spending.
For months India's consumer-price-based inflation stayed above the central-bank's comfort level of 6% driven by a rise in food prices. 
In September the consumer price index eased to 4.35%, helped by a softening of food prices which make up nearly half of the index. Economists said that painted a better picture than what households are actually facing.
According to an October report by Axis My India on consumer spending trends, more than 88% of respondents in a survey said they will not be buying air conditioners, televisions, washing machines or jewellery this festival season and nearly half said they will make low-ticket purchases such as clothes.
There is not much that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government can do to alleviate the pain as global crude oil prices hit a three-year high at $85 a barrel, piling up the pressure on a country that imports 80% of its oil.
Bidisha Ganguly, chief economist at industry chamber, Confederation of Indian Industries, said federal and state governments should cut fuel taxes, the highest among the major economies, as higher fuel prices posed a risk of building up of medium term inflationary pressures.
""(Otherwise) corporate earnings will be impacted in sectors where producers are unable to pass on the cost increases,"" she said, adding global shortages were already driving up commodity costs for many products. 
REDUCED FOOTFALLS
Private economists have warned that annual wholesale-price-based inflation - a proxy for producers' prices - staying in double digits for sixth months in a row could further fuel inflationary pressures as companies pass on rising costs to consumers.
Already some retailers said rising raw material costs were impacting their sales.
""Our sales are not even half of what we used to have during the festival period,"" said Kawaljit Singh, who sells utensils from a shop in Chandani Chowk in the old quarter of Delhi.
He said a rise in prices of metals like steel and copper had pushed up prices of utensils, cookers, festival lighting and gift items by 15%-20% in the last four-five months. 
Because of rising prices and other market uncertainties, Delhi-based company auditor Lalit Vats said his family had downgraded to non-branded products and visited the wholesale markets to hunt for bargains.

""Government can talk about easing of inflation, but people know that costs of every item has gone up,"" lamented his mother Anita Vats.

LONDON (Reuters) -British manufacturers raised prices by the most since 1980 over the past three months as they sought to pass on rapidly rising costs for raw materials and manage acute labour shortages, a long-running survey showed on Thursday.
The figures from the Confederation of British Industry are likely to fuel concerns at the Bank of England that short-term inflation pressures risk getting entrenched and could force it to start raising interest rates as soon as next month.
Supply-chain bottlenecks have hit economies worldwide as they begin to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, but Britain has been harder hit due to new post-Brexit barriers to trade and immigration that took effect at the start of this year.
""From higher material costs to labour shortages, manufacturers continue to face a number of serious global supply challenges hampering their ability to meet strong demand,"" CBI deputy chief economist Anna Leach said.
Thursday's quarterly CBI survey showed manufacturers raised prices at the fastest rate since April 1980 in the three months to October. Expectations for price growth in the coming quarter also rose to their highest in more than 40 years.
Costs faced by manufacturers rose at the fastest pace since 1980 in the three months to July and slowed only slightly in the latest quarter. The survey's gauge of cost expectations for the quarter ahead rose to its highest since 1977.
Supply-chain bottlenecks mean manufacturers are reporting the lowest-ever level of stocks, and the proportion reporting that a shortage of skilled labour is holding back activity is its highest since 1974.
Last month the BoE warned inflation was likely to rise above 4% at the end of this year and stick there until the second quarter of 2022, largely due to a surge in natural gas prices that has hit manufacturers and consumers alike.
Energy prices have risen further since, and investors are betting the BoE will become the first major central bank to raise interest rates on Nov. 3 after its next meeting.
The picture for demand is more mixed. The CBI data showed the rate of growth in orders slowed in October to its lowest since April as well as a big fall in optimism.

Rising COVID-19 cases, the end of the government furlough programme and a higher cost of living mean many economists think consumer demand is set to weaken - and also that the BoE will defer a rate rise until early next year. 
But the quarterly figures from the CBI still show better-than-average optimism among manufacturers, alongside expectations that demand will pick up and that output will continue to grow at an above-average pace.

In its regular six-month report on the region, the lender estimated that the economies of Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia could grow 4.1% in 2022 and 3.8% in 2023.
""A faster-than-expected recovery is really driven by two main factors: domestic re-opening triggered by various robust recovery in domestic consumption and tourism-related demand and then very strong external conditions,"" said Richard Record, the lead country economist for the Western Balkans.
Record said that risks for maintaining the growth aligned with the same factors if they were reversed, meaning that consumption, remittances and tourism would be affected in the case of new pandemic-related lockdowns or international restrictions on movement. 
In addition, the Western Balkan countries lag European neighbours when it comes to COVID-19 vaccination, with rates below 40% in most countries, except for Serbia and Kosovo.
Record said that the depleted fiscal space and high debt levels will continue to weigh on the region, and that political uncertainty will delay a recovery in both domestic and foreign investment that the region needs to boost potential output.
The bank also said that the labour market was recovering at a slower pace than the economy, and that structural reforms were needed to address job creation and economic transformation, including green transition.

Record said the report focused closely on macro-fiscal challenges and drivers of greening the region's growth, which called necessary but not easy to manage.
""The reality is that business as usual is no longer an option, because we are seeing changing of external preferences,"" Record told Reuters.

LONDON (Reuters) -British public borrowing fell by almost half in the first six months of the current financial year from a post-World War Two high a year earlier, when the economy faced the full force of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Thursday's official data will be welcome news for finance minister Rishi Sunak, who is due to present fresh budget forecasts on Oct. 27. 
These are expected to show borrowing in the 2021/22 financial year is on track to come in around 40 billion pounds ($55 billion) below the last forecasts made in March, thanks to faster economic growth.
But Sunak is expected to squeeze spending for many government departments after last year's historic pandemic spending surge. 
""At the budget and spending review next week I will set out how we will continue to support public services, businesses and jobs while keeping our public finances fit for the future,"" Sunak said after Thursday's data.
Britain's budget deficit soared last financial year to its highest since World War Two at 15% of GDP, but is expected to drop to just over half that this year due to the end of emergency economic support and stronger tax revenues.
Some economists say Sunak's focus on keeping a lid on spending is a risk for the economy which, after a rapid recovery in the first half of this year, has slowed markedly in recent months. COVID-19 cases are also rebounding sharply. 
""The rumours are that the Chancellor will still keep a very tight grip on the public finances in next Wednesday's budget to try and bring down borrowing even quicker and build a fiscal war chest to deploy ahead of the 2024 election,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
BORROWING TRIPLE PRE-CRISIS LEVEL
Public sector borrowing for the first six months of the 2021/22 year dropped to 108.1 billion pounds, down by 101.2 billion pounds from April-September 2020, but is still more than triple its level before the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics said.
Public borrowing for September alone fell to 21.778 billion pounds ($30.1 billion), slightly below the 22.6 billion pounds forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. 
August's reading was revised down by almost 4 billion pounds to 16.824 billion pounds, reflecting stronger corporation tax revenue and lower spending on public services and the job furlough support programme than initially estimated.
Compared with a year earlier, tax revenue in the past six months has risen by 20% while day-to-day spending is 6% lower.
Last month Sunak announced a 12 billion-pound tax rise on workers and employers, starting next year, to fund health and social care. Next week's budget will include further longer-term plans to bring the budget closer to balance.
Thursday's data showed public sector net debt totalled 2.219 trillion pounds, equivalent to 95.5% of gross domestic product and just below a peak of 96.7% in May and June, which was the highest since 1963.
While rock-bottom interest rates have kept debt servicing costs near record lows so far, Britain's large stock of index-linked bonds mean interest bills are now rocketing as inflation rises. Interest payments have risen by just over 50% compared with a year earlier, the ONS said. 

The Bank of England has signalled it is moving towards its first interest rate hike since the pandemic.

The monthly survey by Kantar Public published on Thursday showed 39% of people were finding it harder to meet their monthly budget than a year ago, up by nine percentage points from September's poll.
Seven in 10 respondents worried that fresh food and fuel prices would rise over the next few months, Kantar said.
The share of people concerned about not being able to afford to keep their home warm during the winter months also climbed by nine points between September and October to 62%.
British utility bills rose earlier this month as a price cap on the most widely used tariffs increased by around 12%.

The country's most widely followed measure of inflation dipped slightly to 3.1% in September but the Bank of England has said it is likely to top 4% soon. It is considering when to raise interest rates from their all-time low of 0.1%.

Tax income rose 23.1% to 78.2 billion euros in September compared to last year, when the coronavirus pandemic was having a devastating impact on Europe's largest economy. Over the first nine months of the year, the combined tax take of central and regional government was up 9.1% at 541 billion euros.
While Germany's recovery from the pandemic has been strong, recent supply chain bottlenecks and resulting inflationary pressures have seen growth forecasts for this year being cut back.
But the ministry said it expected this effect to be temporary.

""Healthy order books give us reason to expect strong recovery impulses from industry and thanks to that strong overall economic growth,"" the ministry wrote.
It added that while inflation had picked up pace recently - hitting a 28-year high of 4.1% in September - it expected ""significantly more moderate inflation rates"" next year.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated to an 18-year-high in September, driven by high gas prices, soaring housing costs and rising food prices, data showed on Wednesday, putting the focus on the Bank of Canada ahead of a rate decision next week.
Inflation increased to 4.4%, beating the average analyst estimate of 4.3%, to reach its fastest clip since February 2003, Statistics Canada data showed. It was the sixth consecutive month in which headline inflation topped the central bank's 1-3% control range.
""It suggests there is still momentum at the margin in terms of inflationary pressures that can't be just dismissed on base effects and other factors. So it's still a sustained overshoot,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank.
Governor Tiff Macklem has said the Bank of Canada sees hot inflation as temporary, though last week he predicted supply chain bottlenecks meant it would probably take a bit longer than previously expected to come down. 
The last time annual inflation reached 4.4% was in February 2003, when it hit 4.7%. The Bank of Canada had hiked rates three times through 2002 to 2.75% and would raise the key rate to 3.0% in March 2003 and 3.25% in April.

Analysts expect the bank to hold rates at its Oct. 27 meeting, while also tapering its quantitative easing program to stop adding new stimulus.
""The Bank of Canada has been pretty adamant that they think this current inflationary surge is transitory. I don't think this will change their mind,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities.

CPI common, which the Bank of Canada calls the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was flat at 1.8%, while the other two measures of core inflation posted gains. 
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% higher at 1.2319 to the greenback, or 81.18 U.S. cents, a near three-month high.

Countries around the world are grappling with hot inflation amid supply chain hurdles and labor shortages as restrictions are eased and tightened with each new wave of the coronavirus, leading to choppy demand and supply bottlenecks.
Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said on Wednesday he would step down more than five years early, issuing a last warning about the risks posed by inflation.

356,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 09:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Interest rates on the most popular type of U.S. home loan shot to a six-month high last week as global rates continued their march higher against a bout of stiff inflation and expectations that central banks will back further away from their pandemic-era easy-money policies.
The contract rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage climbed to 3.23% in the week ended Oct. 15 from 3.18% the week before, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported on Wednesday in its weekly survey of conditions in the U.S. home lending market. That was the highest level since early April and is up by more than a quarter percentage point since the end of July.
The increase in rates helped drive overall mortgage-application volumes down by 6.3% to the lowest since July, led by a 7.1% drop in refinancing applications, the MBA said. Refinancing application volumes are also at their lowest since July, just fractionally above their lowest levels since early 2020.
Applications for loans to buy a home fell 4.9% to the lowest since early September.

""Purchase activity declined and was 12% lower than a year ago,"" said Joel Kan, MBA's Associate Vice President of Economic and Industry Forecasting. ""Insufficient housing supply and elevated home-price growth continue to limit options for would-be buyers.""
How quickly that situation is resolved remains the big unknown in the U.S. residential real estate market. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that U.S. homebuilding unexpectedly fell in September and residential construction permits dropped to a one-year low amid acute shortages of raw materials and labor.
Meanwhile, global interest rates continue to grind upward as central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve signal the days of crisis-era accommodation are nearing their end in the face of inflation rates running at their highest in decades due to supply bottlenecks and labor shortages. 

The Fed is broadly expected at its next meeting in two weeks to announce plans to start scaling back its purchases of $120 billion a month of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities as a first step toward a normalization of policy.
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, the most influential benchmark security in determining mortgage interest rates, hit its highest since May on Wednesday and has climbed nearly half a percentage point since late July.

""It's very likely to be close to the peak on CPI, given the pattern of base year effects that we're looking at. We think we're going to start to see moderation. It's gonna be slow, but we think we're gonna see a little bit of relief. At the same time the continued strong prints on inflation are seeping into expectations and we saw that pretty clearly in the Bank of Canada's business outlook survey this week - both businesses and consumers. So, this is something that still has... the Bank of Canada on alert. It's not like it's going to hike in a hurry, but they're watching that very closely to make sure that it doesn't get out of control.""
""There's the potential for them (the central bank) to adjust or tweak their forecasts higher on inflation and maybe signal something like we'd be looking at maybe more mid-2022 for the first hike, as opposed to sometime in the second half of the year. There are some ingredients. The labor market has also proved the COVID situation is better handled, so maybe (there is) less of a downside risk from that. I think (the Bank of Canada) might take that step. Do they do that now, or do they want to give themselves another couple months and maybe change their guidance in January? It's so up in the air. So I'd say it's a close call, but it's a live possibility."" 
DEREK HOLT, VICE PRESIDENT OF CAPITAL MARKETS ECONOMICS, SCOTIABANK
""It suggests there is still momentum at the margin in terms of inflationary pressures that can't be just dismissed on base effects and other factors. So it's still a sustained overshoot, in terms of the freshest evidence.""
""The average core reading, pushing up again to 2.7(%) on the month, getting uncomfortably into the upper end of the Bank of Canada's target range, overall reinforces expectations of a shift to reinvestment at the next meeting and set up rate hikes in the second half of next year.""
ANDREW KELVIN, CHIEF CANADA STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES
""We do see these inflationary pressures continue to work through the economy. We did see the core measures tick up as well on average, which does speak to growing underlying pressures. But, the Bank of Canada has been pretty adamant that they think this current inflationary surge is transitory. I don't think this will change their mind.""

""If you look at the governor's comments recently, they do still believe that there is good reason to believe that this is all related to a complicated reopening process. They have signaled that they expect inflation to be elevated into the middle of next year and they are evidently comfortable with that.""
""It's a question of at what threshold would they start to become uncomfortable and that's not an obvious thing to figure out from the fundamentals if you think that the surge is transitory.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation slowed unexpectedly last month but the decline was probably only a temporary respite for consumers and is unlikely to deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates, possibly as soon as next month.
Consumer prices rose by 3.1% in annual terms in September, easing back from August's 3.2% increase, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to inflation of 3.2% in September although 11 of the 34 analysts who took part predicted a slowdown.
Overall, the figures did little to change expectations that the BoE will become the first of the world's major central banks to raise rates, with investors increasingly betting it will do so on Nov. 4 after its next policy meeting.
Yael  Selfin, KPMG UK's chief economist, said despite the slight slowdown in inflation it had topped 3% for two months in a row, hurting the spending power of households some of whom could also face higher mortgage costs if BoE hikes rates.
""We expect further increases in inflation from October, which could reach around 4% by the end of the year, with the recent rise in wholesale energy prices passed on to households,"" Selfin said.

Hospitality was the largest drag on inflation last month - the result of the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" restaurant meal subsidy scheme launched in August 2020 dropping out of the annual comparisons. Prices for diners rose sharply in September last year after the scheme expired.
But prices for consumer goods continued to rise, while food prices fell more slowly than in September last year.
Last month the BoE said it expected inflation to rise slightly above 4% in the last quarter of 2021 but since then energy prices have continued to rise sharply. 
On Sunday, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey sent a latest signal that the British central bank was gearing up to raise rates for the first time since the onset of the coronavirus crisis as the risks from inflation mounted.
The ONS data suggested more inflation pressure on the way.
Prices of goods produced by factories rose again, led by a jump for metals and machinery as well as surging energy prices.
""Road freight costs for UK businesses also continued to rise across the summer,"" ONS statistician Mike Hardie said. 
ACT IN HASTE...
Some economists think the BoE risks making a mistake if it raises rates now because many of the inflation pressures in the British economy are global in nature and beyond its influence.
""Domestically generated inflation remains relatively weak in these data,"" said economist Benjamin Nabarro from Citi.
He said the strain on prices was likely to ease in the second half of 2022.
The increase in inflation in the year to September was driven by a relatively small number of items, with motor fuels and second-hand cars accounting for about a quarter of the annual inflation rate.

""The big questions for policymakers now are just how temporary these price pressures will be, and whether they'll translate into stronger pay growth,"" said Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank.
""Britain's recent history suggests that high inflation feeds through into real wage falls instead – a lesson families can ill-afford to learn for a third time in a decade.""

359,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 05:17AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - More expensive energy and services boosted euro zone inflation as expected in September, data showed on Wednesday, with core inflation also higher.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said consumer prices in the 19 countries using the euro rose 0.5% month-on-month in September for a 3.4% year-on-year rise, as earlier estimated by Eurostat.
While the headline number was well above the European Central Bank's target of 2%, the overshoot was mainly a result of a 17.6% year-on-year surge in energy prices and a 2.0% rise in the costs of food, alcohol and tobacco.
Without these volatile items, or what the ECB calls core inflation, prices grew 0.4% month-on-month for a 1.9% year-on-year increase, faster than the 1.6% annual rise in August.

Eurostat said energy prices were responsible for almost half of the overall year-on-year inflation reading, adding 1.63 points to the final result. Services added another 0.72 points and prices of non-energy industrial goods a further 0.57 points.
The ECB expects consumer prices will start easing again in 2022.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's new home prices stalled for the first time since February 2020 in September, as the chill in the property market intensified amid tightening credit due to an ongoing crackdown on speculative investment.
The average new home price in 70 major Chinese cities was unchanged in September month-on-month, compared with 0.2% growth in August, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Wednesday.
Some analysts said prices fell 0.08%, or even 0.1%, based on their respective calculations, which can vary slightly due to different formulas used. The NBS did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The data showed 27 cities reported month-on-month gains, compared with 46 in August, the lowest since February 2020 at the height of China's COVID-19 outbreak. 
In September, some cities intensified their campaigns to drive speculators out of the property market. In Xiamen, the southeastern city further tightened property curbs on top of existing measures, prohibiting first-time home buyers from reselling their properties for five years.
The tougher restrictions, along with tighter rules on borrowing for property purchases, have weighed on near-term demand, analysts said. 
""Real estate credit tightening - with home loans down by 510 billion yuan ($79.8 billion) year-on-year in the third quarter - was the biggest reason for the overall market freeze,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with property agency Centaline. 
Chinese leaders, fearful that a persistent property bubble could undermine the country's long-term ascent, are likely to maintain tight property curbs, although analysts say they could soften some tactics as needed.
Compared with a year earlier, China's new home prices grew 3.8% in September, the slowest in nine months, easing from a 4.2% increase in August. 
Compounding concerns about the sector are the debt problems of China Evergrande, the country's second-largest developer, which is scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers.
Tens of thousands of Chinese developers had borrowed heavily to build homes during a surge in the property market between 2016 and 2018. But they are now facing a liquidity crunch amid tighter regulations on fresh borrowing, leaving many projects incomplete.
""Many developers have recently been exposed to a liquidity crunch, leading buyers to worry about buying buildings that are forever unfinished,"" Zhang said. 
""It is expected that in the fourth quarter of 2021, the markets in most cities will enter an obvious adjustment cycle.""
Vice Premier Liu He said on Wednesday that while there are some problems in the property market, overall risks are controllable, according to domestic media. 
Liu said reasonable demand for capital was being met, adding that he expected the property market to continue to develop in a healthy way overall, domestic media reported.
SMALLER CITIES
Price declines have particularly hammered smaller cities with persistent population outflows or uncertain economic prospects, leading to a build-up in local housing inventories.
Luzhou in Sichuan province and Dali in Yunnan province saw month-on-month price declines in seven out of nine months so far this year, the most out of all the 70 major cities tracked by the statistics bureau. 
In Taiyuan, the capital of northern Shanxi province, new home prices fell in six out of the nine months. 
""Many new homes are under construction in Taiyuan, and there is a backlog of homes that hasn't been sold,"" said a Taiyuan resident surnamed Hou, 24. 
""Previously, just opposite my home, there was construction on a plot for nearly two years, and there were several work suspensions during that time.""
Even China's largest cities are starting to weaken. 
New home prices fell for the second month in Guangzhou, while Tianjin and Chengdu saw their first monthly declines this year in September. Prices in Beijing stalled. 

""If there is no significant easing of mortgage loans from October onwards, price wars will be the main buzzword in the real estate market in the fourth quarter,"" said Zhang.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's export growth weakened to its slowest in seven months in September, while a surge in imports added to worries that pandemic-led global supply chain snags could derail the country's fragile economic recovery.
Exports are losing steam at a time when a weaker yen and a spike in oil prices have pushed up import costs, hurting resource-poor Japan's terms of trade and potentially undermining Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's pledge to correct wealth gaps.
The trade data will be among factors the Bank of Japan will scrutinise when it releases fresh quarterly growth and inflation projections at its policy meeting later this month.
Exports rose 13.0% in September from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed on Wednesday, compared with a median market forecast for an 11.0% rise, as car shipments tumbled 40.3%, the first drop in seven months.
While ahead of forecasts, export growth weakened from 26.2% in the previous month and was the slowest since February.
""While the effect of auto production cuts will abate once supply bottlenecks are resolved, fundamental concerns for growth peak-outs in the United States and China are unchanged,"" said Kota Suzuki, economist at Daiwa Securities.
""Exports will still be in the weak state for a while.""
Shipments to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 10.3% in September year-on-year, led by semiconductors and plastic materials, while car exports fell 71.9%.
U.S.-bound exports, another key destination for Japanese goods, fell 3.3% to mark the first decline in seven months, as demand for cars and airplanes weakened.
Imports, meanwhile, jumped 38.6% in the year to September, following the prior month's 44.7% gain, driven by increased costs for oil, coal and medicines. 
Imports have now risen for eight straight months, fuelling concerns that a recent yen weakening and surging oil prices are adding to the cost of living in Japan.
""Rising import prices hurt the terms of trade for Japanese companies,"" said Ryosuke Katagi, market economist at Mizuho Securities. ""As consumer price inflation remains stagnant in Japan, companies cannot pass on the soaring costs to consumers, damaging corporate profits.""
Japan's trade balance swung into a deficit for a second straight month at 622.8 billion yen ($5.43 billion), with the yen-based cost of imports the highest since November 2018.
The data may add to worries among policymakers hoping for an export-led recovery, while rising import costs will stoke fears of stagflation, or a combination of rising inflation and stagnating growth.
Policymakers are under pressure to maintain Japan's economic recovery from last year's pandemic-induced doldrums, despite additional strains from a resurgence of the pandemic in other parts of Asia.

The world's third-largest economy is expected to have expanded a meagre 0.8% in the third quarter, a Reuters poll showed, as parts shortages and supply constraints caused by Asian factory shutdowns disrupted automakers.

363,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 10:01PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s home prices fell for the first time in six years as a property slump deepens in the world’s second-largest economy. 
New-home prices in 70 cities, excluding state-subsidized housing, slid 0.08% in September from August, the first drop since April 2015, National Bureau of Statistics figures showed Wednesday. Values in the secondary market declined 0.19%, down for a second month.
A slump in the home market is becoming more evident as developers including China Evergrande Group struggle to raise money and buyers stay away. Falling prices may fuel a vicious cycle by further weakening demand, worsening the cash shortage at builders and forcing them to offer bigger discounts.
September is traditionally a peak season for the home market. Yet residential sales tumbled 17% by area, investments slid for the first time since early 2020, and the rate of failed land auctions climbed to the highest since at least 2018. 
Read more on the impact of land auction flops
The downturn has continued into this month. Existing-home sales plunged 63% from a year earlier in the first 17 days of October, according to a  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. note Monday. 
“The new-home market faces relatively big downward pressure in the short term,” Yang Kewei, a research director at China Real Estate Information Corp., said before the figures were released. “The effects of price discounts are waning.” 
Fears of contagion from the crisis at Evergrande have intensified after a surprise default by Fantasia Holdings Group Co. and a wave of credit rating downgrades at other developers. Yields on Chinese high-yield dollar bonds, which are dominated by builders, have climbed to their highest in about a decade, hurting a key funding channel for the sector.
That will have a knock-on effect on the broader economy, since  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). estimates the property sector and related downstream industries make up almost a quarter of gross domestic product. 
Still, China’s central bank has said risks posed to the domestic economy by Evergrande can be contained. The property firm’s trouble “casts a little bit of concern,” People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said at a virtual meeting of the Group of 30 on Sunday.

(Reuters) - Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries rose for a fifth straight month in August and hit a record high, but the pace of increase slowed, data from the Treasury Department showed on Monday.
Foreign investors held $7.56 trillion of Treasuries as of the end of August. In July, foreign holdings of Treasuries stood at $7.54 trillion, the previous record according to Refinitiv Datastream, and up from $7.5 trillion at the end of June.
Gennadiy Goldberg, rates strategist for TD Securities, said the slower rate of increase likely reflected foreign buyers taking stock of less-volatile trading for U.S. debt during August.
The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note started the month at 1.237% and finished August slightly higher at 1.307% after trading within a narrower range than in July.
""Given that rates stabilized (In August) you saw a more mixed buying and selling picture than before,"" Goldberg said of the foreign purchase pattern.
U.S. Treasury yields are low by historic standards but higher than government bond yields in many other major countries, boosting their attractiveness to foreign investors.
Monday's data showed Japan remained the largest non-U.S. net holder of Treasuries with $1.32 trillion in August, up from $1.31 trillion at the end of July. Second-placed China had $1.05 trillion of U.S. Treasuries at the end of August, down from $1.07 trillion a month earlier.

Net foreign purchases of long and short-term U.S. Securities and banking flows totaled $91 billion for August, down from $164.1 billion in July.
Of the August amount, net foreign private inflows were $125 billion, down from $166 billion in July. Net foreign official outflows were $34 billion, compared with outflows of $2.1 billion in July.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding unexpectedly fell in September and permits dropped to a one-year low amid acute shortages of raw materials and labor, supporting expectations that economic growth slowed sharply in the third quarter.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed the gap between completed houses and those still under construction was the largest on record last month. Robust demand as global economies emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic is running against worker shortages, straining supply chains and fanning inflation. Nearly every industry in the United States is experiencing shortages.
""Momentum in demand still appears to be positive,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""But supply is struggling to catch up given higher input costs and shortages that remain headwinds for builders."" 
Housing starts dropped 1.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.555 million units last month, the lowest level since April. Data for August was revised down to a rate of 1.580 million units from the previously reported 1.615 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would rise to a rate of 1.620 million units. Lumber prices are rising again after tumbling from record highs set in May. Building materials, like windows and electric breaker boxes, are in short supply.
Prices for copper, another essential material in home building, have soared more than 16% since the end of September, buoyed by decades-low supplies. The pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, leading to shortages of workers needed to produce and move raw materials and finished goods to markets.
Starts have declined from the 1.725 million unit-pace level scaled in March, which was more than a 14-1/2-year high.
Single-family starts, which account for the largest share of the housing market, were unchanged at a rate of 1.080 million units last month. Single-family homebuilding rose in the West and Midwest, but fell in the Northeast and the densely populated South, also likely depressed by Hurricane Ida, which caused unprecedented flooding. Starts for buildings with five units or more dropped 5.1% to a rate of 467,000 units last month.
A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Monday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders rising further in October, but noted that ""builders continue to grapple with ongoing supply chain disruptions and labor shortages that are delaying completion times.""

COMPLETIONS LAG
Last month's decline in homebuilding followed on the heels of news on Monday that production at U.S. factories fell by the most in seven months in September. Residential investment likely remained weak in the third quarter after contracting in the April-June quarter. 
Gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter are mostly below a 3% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. 
The housing market was boosted early in the coronavirus pandemic by an exodus from cities to suburbs and other low-density locations as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and online schooling, leading to three straight quarters of double-digit growth in residential spending. That tailwind is ebbing as workers return to offices and schools reopened for in-person learning, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations. High inflation is also lifting mortgage rates. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to an average of 3.05% last week from 2.99% in the prior week, according to data from mortgage giant  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Though still low by historical standards, rising borrowing costs could make homeownership less affordable for some first-time buyers. House prices notched record double-digit growth on an annual basis in July.
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Tuesday showed mortgage applications for new home purchases decreased 16.2% in September from a year ago. Applications were down 4% on a month-on-month basis. The average loan size hit a record $408,522, underscoring the higher construction costs.
With building costs mounting, permits for future homebuilding plunged 7.7% to a rate of 1.589 million units last month, the lowest level since September 2020. Single-family permits fell 0.9% to a rate of 1.041 million units. 
Permits for buildings with five units or more plummeted 21.0% to a rate of 498,000 units. 
Housing completions dropped 4.6% to a rate of 1.240 million units, the lowest level since August 2020. Single-family home completions were unchanged at a rate of 953,000 units. 
The stock of housing under construction increased 1.3% to a rate of 1,426 million units last month, the highest since February 1974. That led to a record wide gap between completed homes and houses under construction.

Also highlighting the supply constraints, the number of houses authorized for construction but not yet started raced to a record high last month.
""The backlog of starts – which reflects numerous supply-side constraints, including high input costs and difficulty attracting skilled workers – should underpin housing construction in the months ahead,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

China, the world's biggest auto market, is promoting NEVs, which includes battery electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, to combat pollution and support the country's car technologies.
The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said earlier this month that NEV sales in China are likely to rise to 3 million units this year, up from 1.4 million last year.
""This year's overall NEV sales slightly exceeded our expectations,"" He said, adding he was surprised by the surging sales of hybrid vehicles and micro electric vehicles. 
""Given the current sales performance, I'm actually more confident about the industry's NEV penetration rate growth in 2025,"" He said. 

NEV sales made up 11.6% of China's overall market in the first nine months this year, CAAM said.
Asked about the chip supply shortage that has impacted the global auto industry, He said chip supply will remain a challenge in the next 12 months, but things will ""gradually get better.""

368,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. housing starts decreased in September, driven by a pullback in multifamily construction, as lingering supply-chain constraints, shortages of skilled labor and elevated materials costs continue to challenge builders.
Residential starts fell 1.6% last month to a 1.56 million annualized rate, according to government data released Tuesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 1.62 million pace.
Applications to build, a proxy for future construction, fell 7.7% to an annualized 1.59 million units in September. That’s the largest monthly decline since February. 
Cheap borrowing costs and a pandemic-fueled migration to the suburbs supported housing demand and construction through late 2020 and earlier this year. But high materials costs, unpredictable supply-chain delays and labor shortages have strained builders’ ability to keep up with still-solid demand in more recent months.
Single-family starts were unchanged in September at an annualized 1.08 million units as multifamily starts -- which tend to be volatile and include apartment buildings and condominiums -- decreased 5% to 475,000. 
Meanwhile, the report indicates builders are making little headway on project backlogs. The number of single-family homes authorized for construction but not yet started -- a measure of backlogs -- edged lower to 144,000 in September but remains near a 15-year high.
While high construction costs helped fuel a surge in prices that has cooled buyer interest somewhat, builders remain generally optimistic. A gauge of homebuilder sentiment rose to a three-month high in October -- holding well-above pre-pandemic levels -- a separate report showed Monday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Production at U.S. factories fell by the most in seven months in September as an ongoing global shortage of semiconductors depressed motor vehicle output, further evidence that supply constraints were hampering economic growth.
Manufacturing production last month was also weighed down by the lingering effects of Hurricane Ida, which also severely disrupted output at mines. The report from the Federal Reserve on Monday followed on the heels of data last week showing a solid rise in inflation in September. Though retail sales rose last month, that reflected higher prices for motor vehicles. 
""While the hurricane disruption and weather effects will fade, labor and product shortages are still worsening, which will continue to weigh on manufacturing output over the coming months and quarters,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.
Manufacturing output dropped 0.7% last month, the largest decline since February. Data for August was revised down to show production falling 0.4% instead of rising 0.2% as previously reported. It was only the second time since April 2020, when mandatory closures of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections, that manufacturing output fell for two straight months. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing production edging up 0.1%. Output increased 4.8% compared to September 2020. Manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy, remains underpinned by businesses desperate to replenish stocks after inventories were drawn down in the first half of the year amid strong demand for goods.
Spending shifted to goods from services over the course of the pandemic, straining supply chains. The rotation back to services, such as travel and dining out, has been slowed by a resurgence in coronavirus infections over the summer, driven by the Delta variant.
Production at auto plants tumbled 7.2% after dropping 3.2% in August. The global shortage of microchips is forcing automakers to cut production. There is also a shortage of workers at ports, which is causing congestion and holding up the delivery of raw materials. 
Motor vehicle assembly dropped to an annualized rate of 7.78 million units, the lowest since April 2020, from a pace of 8.82 million units in August. 
Graphic: Motor vehicle production slumps, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/zjvqkendkvx/chart_eikon.jpg 
""Supply issues limiting production will likely continue to limit consumption of autos, with latest industry guidance suggesting shortages could last well into 2022,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
Excluding autos, manufacturing output dropped 0.3%. The Fed said Hurricane Ida, which devastated U.S. offshore energy production in late August, contributed 0.3 percentage point to the drop in manufacturing output. 
With autos and consumer energy products output tumbling, consumer goods production fell 1.9% last month. There were, however, increases in the production of primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components as well as furniture and related products. 
Nondurable goods output dropped 1.0%, with large decreases in chemicals, petroleum and coal products.
Overall, manufacturing output increased at a 5.3% rate in the third quarter after growing at a 5.0% pace in the second quarter. Motor vehicle and parts production rebounded at an 8.6% rate as manufacturers scrapped annual plant closures for retooling over summer to manage their chip supply. Motor vehicle output plunged at a 24.6% pace in the second quarter.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
SILVER LINING
A shortage of motor vehicles helped to drive up inflation in September, through very high prices, and flattered retail sales. The dearth of automobiles is also frustrating efforts to rebuild inventories. The combination of higher inflation, which is cutting into consumer spending, and moderate inventory build has led economists to anticipate that economic growth slowed sharply in the third quarter.
The Atlanta Fed is estimating that gross domestic product growth braked to a 1.2% annualized rate last quarter. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter.
""Perhaps a silver lining in this difficult supply environment today is that manufacturers will have plenty of work ahead of them once they are able to secure the inputs and help they need,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Labor and building material shortages are also impeding the housing market. A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Monday showed sentiment among single-family homebuilders rising in October amid strong demand. But builders complained that ""ongoing supply chain disruptions and labor shortages are delaying completion times and putting upward pressure on building material and home prices."" 
Last month's decline in manufacturing output combined with a 2.3% decrease in mining and a 3.6% drop in utilities to pull down industrial production by 1.3%. The largest drop in industrial output in seven months followed a 0.1% dip in August. Mining was weighed down by the aftermath of Ida, while demand for utilities subsided following a warmer-than-usual August.
Industrial production rose at a 4.3% rate in the July-September quarter, notching its fifth straight quarter of growth of at least 4%.

Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, fell 0.6 percentage point in September to 75.9%. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector dropped 1.0 percentage point to 75.2%. It is 4.4 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

370,"<span>Oct 18, 2021 10:06AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Confidence among U.S. single-family homebuilders rose by the most in nearly a year in October as customer traffic improved for a second straight month, although builders remain concerned that the shortages that are driving up materials prices will hurt home affordability.
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose 4 points - the most since November 2020 - to 80 this month. The reading topped the median estimate of economists in a Reuters poll of 76 and the increase pushed the index to a three-month high. 
A reading above 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as good than poor. 
""Builders are getting increasingly concerned about affordability hurdles ahead for most buyers,"" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. 
Nonetheless, all three subindexes improved, and conditions were seen as better in all four regions tracked in the monthly survey.
The current conditions index rose 5 points to 87, the highest since June; the index measuring sales expectations for the next six months rose 3 points to 84, the highest since last December; and the customer traffic index improved by 4 points - the most since February - to 65.

Dietz said affordability may also be tested with interest rates expected to rise in coming months as the U.S. Federal Reserve begins to remove its pandemic-era support for the economy. The Fed is widely expected to announce plans to start cutting its purchases of $120 billion a month of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed debt as early as its next meeting in just over two weeks, although any rate hike by the central bank is seen further away.
Still, home loan interest rates have already begun to rise, with the average 30-year mortgage rate climbing to 3.18% in early October, the highest since June, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy hit its slowest pace of growth in a year in the third quarter, hurt by power shortages and wobbles in the property sector, highlighting the challenge facing policymakers as they seek to prop up a faltering recovery while reining in the real estate sector.
Gross domestic product expanded 4.9% from a year ago, missing forecasts, as attempts by Beijing to curb lending to the property sector exacerbated the fallout from electricity shortages which sent factory output back to levels last seen in early 2020, when heavy COVID-19 curbs were in place.
The world's second-largest economy had staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic slump but the recovery has lost steam from the blistering 18.3% growth clocked in the first quarter.
Under President Xi Jinping, a drive to make structural changes that address long-term risks and distortions, which has involved crackdowns on the property sector and technology giants, as well as carbon emission cuts, has taken a toll.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) cut their fourth quarter forecast by 1.2 percentage points to 3.5% on the disappointing data. Analysts at ANZ cut their forecast for China's 2021 GDP growth to 8.0% from 8.3%.
Policymakers will now have to balance the impact of those structural changes with steps that will shield the economy and tame contagion risks from a debt crisis at major developer China Evergrande Group.
""In response to the ugly growth numbers we expect in coming months, we think policymakers will take more steps to shore up growth, including ensuring ample liquidity in the interbank market, accelerating infrastructure development and relaxing some aspects of overall credit and real estate policies,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics.
A Reuters poll of analysts had expected GDP to rise 5.2% in the third quarter.
The weak numbers sent the yuan and most Asian stock markets lower amid broader investor concerns about the world economic recovery.
In Europe, China-exposed luxury stocks including LVMH,  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and Hermes fell about 3% each, also hurt by Xi's call for the expansion of a consumption tax. 
POLICY-DRIVEN
China, still an avowedly socialist country, has pledged to reduce inequality after years of breakneck growth but may have to tread cautiously to avoid derailing a private sector that has been a vital engine of growth and jobs, analysts say.
In an essay in the ruling Communist Party journal Qiushi last week, Xi called for progress on a long-awaited property tax that could help reduce wealth gaps.
New construction starts in September slumped for a sixth straight month, NBS data showed, the longest spate of monthly declines since 2015, as cash-strapped developers reined in investment and paused projects following tighter borrowing limits.
Meanwhile, the industrial sector has been hit by power rationing triggered by coal shortages, as well as environmental curbs on heavy polluters like steel plants and floods over the summer.
Overall industrial output rose just 3.1% in September from a year earlier, marking the slowest growth since March 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic.
Aluminium output declined for the fifth consecutive month and daily crude steel output hit the lowest level since 2018.
Bucking the negative trend, retail sales grew 4.4%, faster than forecasts and the 2.5% growth in August, and the surveyed nationwide jobless rate fell from 5.1% to 4.9%.
""Most of the (negative) factors are policy-driven... the economy is having a lot of pain points and these pain points are not going away soon because policies are here to stay, and therefore it will continue into 2022,"" said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING.
On a quarterly basis, growth eased to 0.2% in July-September from a downwardly revised 1.2% in the second quarter.
Premier Li Keqiang said last week that China has ample tools to cope with economic challenges despite slowing growth, and expressed confidence in hitting full-year development goals.
On Sunday, People's Bank of China governor Yi Gang said the economy is expected to grow 8% this year.

Still, the central bank is expected to remain cautious about monetary easing due to worries about high debt and property risks.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect the People's Bank of China to refrain from attempts to stimulate the economy by reducing the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve until the first quarter of 2022.

The median forecast from a poll of 17 economists expects export orders to jump 17% from the year-ago period. Forecasts for growth ranged from 6.5% to as high as 26%.
Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asia's exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.
The island nation's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, leapt 17.6% from a year earlier to $53.5 billion in August, a strong performance but less than forecast on unexpectedly weaker demand for new smartphones. 

Taiwan's manufacturers, including the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, are a key part of the global supply chain for technology giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Investing.com – China’s economy grew at its slowest pace in a year in the third quarter of 2021, with a global energy crunch, supply chain bottlenecks, and an unsteady property market also adding pressure on policymakers to bolster a faltering economic recovery.
Data released earlier in the day said that the GDP grew 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, against the 0.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 1.3% growth. The GDP grew 4.9% year-on-year, lower than the 5.2% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 7.9% growth recorded in August 2021.
China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) ongoing debt crisis, supply chain delays, and the energy crunch are emerging as big challenges for China to overcome.
""The domestic economic recovery is still unstable and uneven,"" National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) spokesperson Fu Linghui said at a briefing on Monday.
The slow growth is in contrast to the country’s impressive economic recovery from COVID-19 in 2020, boosted by effective virus containment and increasing overseas demand for Chinese manufactured goods.
""In response to the ugly growth numbers we expect in coming months, we think policymakers will take more steps to shore up growth, including ensuring ample liquidity in the interbank market, accelerating infrastructure development and relaxing some aspects of overall credit and real estate policies,"" Oxford Economics head of Asia economics Louis Kuijs told Reuters.
Developer China Evergrande Group’s debt woes continue, and worries about a potential spillover of credit risk from China's property sector into the broader economy also continue to mount.
Meanwhile, industrial production grew 3.1% year-on-year in September, lower than the 4.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 5.3% growth.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's September new construction starts slumped for a sixth straight month, the longest spate of monthly declines since 2015, as cash-strapped developers put a pause on projects in the wake of tighter regulations on borrowing. 
New construction starts in September fell 13.54% from a year earlier, the third month of double-digit declines, according to Reuters calculations based on January-September data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. 
That marks the longest downtrend since declines in March-August 2015, the last property malaise. 
When the sector recovered in 2016 after authorities loosened their grip on purchases and development, tens of thousands of real estate firms borrowed heavily to build homes. 
But as regulations tightened again this year, many of them have started to face a liquidity crunch, which was then worsened by sharply weaker demand due to tighter restrictions on speculative purchases. 
Property sales by floor area dropped 15.8% in September, down for a third month, according to Reuters calculations based on the statistics bureau's data. 
The slowdown in the sector was also underscored by a 3.5% drop in property investments by developers in September, the first monthly decline since January-February last year at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in China.
""All the data are poor,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with property agency Centaline. 
""Financing is hard, sales are tough, so of course, there has been no enthusiasm to build. For the first time in history, developers are encountering two blockages - blockages in sales and blockages in financing.""
The potential collapse of highly indebted real estate firms such as China Evergrande Group have raised concerns about systemic risks to the broader economy. The real estate sector accounts for a quarter of China's gross domestic product. 
Authorities will try to prevent problems at Evergrande from spreading to other real estate companies to avoid broader systemic risk, Yi Gang, governor of China's central bank, said on Sunday.
On Friday, a central bank official said the spillover effect of Evergrande's debt problems on the banking system was ""controllable.""
""There is a likelihood that housing policies may loosen in the fourth quarter, and that would ease the pessimism in the property transaction data,"" said Yan Yuejin, director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution. 
On Friday, representatives from 10 Chinese property companies met government regulators to ask for an ""appropriate loosening"" on policy restrictions, financial news outlet Yicai reported.
China's real estate shares have fallen 22% so far this year. On Monday, they were down 2.6% as of 0300 GMT.

In the first nine months, property investment rose 8.8% from a year earlier, slowing from 10.9% growth seen in January-August. 
Funds raised by China's property developers grew 11.1%, slower than the 14.8% rise seen in the first eight months.

COMMENTARY:
WOEI CHEN HO, ECONOMIST, UOB, SINGAPORE
""The numbers are actually much weaker than what we thought... I think in the fourth quarter it will be even slower because we will see more impact from the energy crunch.
""It's quite clear that the energy crunch has had a larger impact on industrial production than what the market was expecting.
""Going forward it will be a challenging environment for China - if you look at the energy crunch (and) the crackdown on the property sector, which is having a quite a big impact on the economy. We are probably going to downgrade our full-year growth (from 8.6%) to closer to 8%.""
CHAOPING ZHU, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, SHANGHAI 
""At the beginning of this year, the Chinese government set an annual goal of 6% GDP growth, leaving sufficient room for fundamental reforms aiming to improve the country's long-term growth potential. However, short-term shocks seem inevitable when a variety of policy measures have been introduced in a short period since July.
""The intensive implementations of decarbonisation policies, education burden reduction, internet regulation, as well as escalating property market control, weighed on domestic consumption and investment. As a result, the policy pendulum is swinging back to supportive measures, although the degree might be moderate and the direction for long-term reforms will not be changed.""
SELENA LING, CHIEF ECONOMIST, OCBC BANK, SINGAPORE
""Headwinds are on the production side, especially with the current power crunch, increasing regulatory scrutiny and also the downside risks to the property market.
""2022 growth is likely to slow further, closer to a low 5% handle... it's back to a domestic demand story (and) retail sales is a bright spot. The probability of an imminent RRR cut has diminished post-PBOC conference and the full MLF rollover last week.""
IRIS PANG, CHIEF ECONOMIST, GREATER CHINA, HONG KONG, ING
""It's within my expectations, but the direction is almost all down.
""Retail sales figures show there is still huge demand for jewellery, which makes me think that people are not willing to buy properties and are trying to find alternatives.
""Automobile sales are in contraction - this also reflects that the economy is not really solid, if people don't want to buy big-ticket items. Another thing that I usually use to gauge the average consumer is clothing, and clothing is under contraction ... and this makes me think the average consumer is now saving more than spending.
""Most of the (negative) factors are policy-driven... the economy is having a lot of pain points and these pain points are not going away soon because policies are here to stay, and therefore it will continue into 2022 -- unless international borders fully reopen, that will give a new engine for all economies.""
ZHIWEI ZHANG, CHIEF ECONOMIST, PINPOINT ASSET MANAGEMENT, HONG KONG 
""Q3 data showed further signs that the risk of stagflation is rising. GDP growth year-on-year dropped below 5%. The quarter-on-quarter growth dropped to 0.2%. The QoQ growth is at the slowest level except for Q1 last year when COVID broke out.
""Yet the unemployment rate declined, which is puzzling. This suggests the government may not feel the urgency to launch stimulus and boost growth. The PBOC press conference last week also sent signals indicating that the monetary policy stance will not change significantly. Without a meaningful policy change, growth in Q4 would likely slow further.""
KEN CHEUNG, CHIEF ASIAN FX STRATEGIST, MIZUHO BANK, HONG KONG
""On the monetary policy front, the PBOC downplayed the easing bias and is more likely to implement targeted easing measures to replace the broad RRR cut in Q4. Yet, the increasing downside risk for China growth in Q4 should still dent RMB sentiment and we expect the CNY to fall back to 6.50 at year-end.""
LOUIS KUIJS, HEAD OF ASIA ECONOMICS, OXFORD ECONOMICS, HONG KONG
""We think the electricity shortages and production cuts will become less of a problem later in Q4. In line with our expectation, senior policymakers have started to stress growth and we expect them to start calling for the pursuit of climate targets on a more measured timeline.
""But, while we don't expect Evergrande's problems to trigger a Lehman moment, we think the pending real estate downturn will continue to weigh substantially on growth in the coming months, while lingering COVID caution should continue to lead to be a drag on consumption. As a result, we forecast only 3.6% y/y GDP growth in Q4.
""In response to the ugly growth numbers we expect in the coming months, we think policymakers will take more steps to shore up growth, including ensuring ample liquidity in the interbank market, accelerating infrastructure development and relaxing some aspects of overall credit and real estate policies.""
BACKGROUND:
* China's economy has rebounded from the pandemic but the recovery is losing steam, weighed by faltering factory activity, persistently soft consumption and a slowing property sector.
* Signs of further slowing in the economy put pressure on the central bank to ease policy, but analysts said concerns over debt and property bubble risks may delay any meaningful steps.
* Global worries about a possible spillover of credit risk from China's property sector into the broader economy have intensified as major developer China Evergrande Group wrestles with more than $300 billion of debt.
* Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has said China has ample tools to cope with economic challenges despite slowing growth, and the government is confident of achieving full-year development goals.
* China's economy is ""doing well"", but faces challenges such as default risks for certain firms due to ""mismanagement"", the People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said on Sunday.
* The country's export growth surprisingly accelerated in September as still solid global demand offset some of the pressures on the economy.

* Economists expect China's GDP to grow 8.2% this year. This is slower than an 8.6% rise forecast in a July poll, but would still be the highest annual growth in a decade. The economy expanded 2.3% in pandemic-hit 2020.
* China has set an annual GDP growth target at above 6% this year, below analysts' expectations, giving policymakers more room to cope with uncertainties.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) -New Zealand's Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.2% in the third quarter, beating expectations and surging at the fastest pace in over a decade driven by housing-related costs and other supply constraints, data released on Monday showed.
CPI rose 2.2% in the quarter ending September from a rise of 1.3% in the second quarter, the biggest quarterly movement since a 2.3% rise in the December 2010 quarter, Statistics New Zealand said in a statement.
Annual inflation surged 4.9% compared to a rise of 3.3% in the previous quarter, also the biggest annual movement in more than a decade. 
The data beat analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll and forecasts of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), both of which put the quarterly inflation rise at 1.4%, lifting annual inflation to 4.1%.
The main drivers were housing-related costs, such as construction of new houses and local authority rate, Statistics New Zealand said in its statement. 
Vegetable prices was the second major driver along with transport costs and fuel prices. New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, has been in lockdown since mid-August to stamp out an outbreak of the Delta variant of coronavirus.
The New Zealand dollar jumped, touching $0.7103, as traders anticipated more monetary policy tightening by the central bank in response to the higher than expected inflation. 
RBNZ hiked rates earlier this month, and signalled further tightening to come, as it looks to keep inflation near its target 1-3% range, and to cool a red-hot housing market.

""We had already expected the RBNZ to continue hiking rates despite the Auckland lockdown,"" said Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics.
""But the strength in consumer prices in Q3 will surely nudge the Bank towards an even more aggressive hiking cycle,"" he said.

In a report, the association's research unit CSC forecast gross domestic product (GDP) would rise 6.1% this year and 4.1% next year, going above pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2022. 
In April the research unit had said Italy's GDP would be up 4.1% in 2021.
Its forecasts for this year are now just above the 6% expected by the national unity government lead by Mario Draghi. 
Last year the COVID-hit economy contracted by 8.9%, the steepest recession in Italy's post-war history. The firm pick-up now in place is seen resulting in lower-than-expected public deficit and debt ratios this year.
The CSC report cautioned that, starting from the last quarter of this year, GDP growth would have a more ""moderate profile"".
It said that its estimates took into account Italy's multi-billion euro recovery plan, partly funded by the European Union.
It added that, despite the ""positive perspectives"", the forecasts had downside risks that were linked to the possibility of new COVID-19 restrictions, the lack of raw materials that could bog down production and more structural inflation. 

Confindustria President Carlo Bonomi said that recovery was well underway but that it was important to ""keep the guard up"".
""Italy must go back to growing at a yearly pace of at least 1.5-2%, an achievable goal, equal to the annual growth registered between 1997 and 2007,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose in September in part as more expensive motor vehicles boosted receipts at auto dealerships, but there are fears that supply constraints could disrupt the holiday shopping season amid continued shortages of goods.
Given the partial lift from inflation, the surprise increase in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department on Friday did little to change economists' expectations that consumer spending probably stalled in the third quarter. Inflation-adjusted sales, which rose moderately last month, are what is included in the calculation of gross domestic product. 
""The solid retail sales report reflects both consumer resilience and escalating prices,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""The main concern now is that supply-chain disruptions and microchip shortages appear to be spreading, limiting selection and tamping down goods demand."" 
Retail sales rose 0.7% last month. Data for August was revised higher to show retail sales increasing 0.9% instead of 0.7% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would slip 0.2%. Consumer prices increased 0.4% on a monthly basis in September suggesting the so-called real retail sales rose 0.3% last month. 
An ongoing global shortage of microchips is forcing automakers to cut production, leading to a scarcity of inventory at showrooms, which is boosting prices. The semiconductor shortage has also impacted the supply of electronics and appliances. Congestion at ports because of a dearth of workers has also meant fewer goods on shelves heading into the holiday shopping season, limiting choice for buyers.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced that the Port of Los Angeles would join the Port of Long Beach, two of the country's busiest, in expanding round-the-clock operations to unload an estimated 500,000 containers on cargo ships offshore.
Spending shifted to goods from services over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, straining supply chains. The rotation back to services, such as travel and dining out, has been slowed by a resurgence in coronavirus infections over the summer, driven by the Delta variant. 
Retail sales are mostly made up of goods, with services, including healthcare, education and hotel accommodation, making up the remaining portion of consumer spending. 
Economists expected consumers to start their holiday shopping early to avoid empty shelves, which would probably keep retail sales higher in October. Spending remains strong despite consumer sentiment shifting lower, thanks to strong household wealth and rising wages from a tightening labor market.
A survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumer sentiment slipped further in early October because of the endless pandemic and the political wrangling in Washington over raising the federal government debt limit as well as more spending for infrastructure and social programs. 
""Strength this month and next could be a result of well-telegraphed supply shortages leading consumers to begin holiday-season shopping earlier than usual,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""This effect, as well as potentially binding supply limitations, could subsequently result in a drop in retail sales in November and December.""
Retailers are cautiously optimistic that shortages will not derail the holiday season.
""We have seen record imports this year and are confident that collectively we can work through these challenges to ensure a healthy and happy holiday season,"" said Matthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation in Washington.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

AUTO RECEIPTS RISE
In September, sales at auto dealerships rose 0.5% after decreasing 3.3% in August. With unit sales declining, the increase in receipts reflected higher prices. 
The average price of a new motor vehicle topped $45,000 for the first time ever in September, according to a report this week from Kelley Blue Book, a vehicle valuation and automotive research company in California.
Online retail sales rose 0.6%. Sales at clothing stores jumped 1.1%. More workers returned to offices after the Labor Day holiday and may have needed a new wardrobe after more than a year of working from home. Receipts at building material stores nudged up 0.1% and furniture outlets gained 0.2%. 
Sales at service stations surged 1.8% because of higher gasoline prices. There was also an increase in receipts at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. 
With coronavirus infections ebbing, the flow of traffic to restaurants and bars increased, lifting sales 0.3%. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report. Sales at electronics and appliance stores dropped 0.9%.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 0.8% after increasing 2.6% in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
Economists believe consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was flat in the third quarter after a robust 12.0% annualized growth pace in the April-June period. Consumer spending growth estimates for the third quarter are mostly below a 2.0% rate.

That also suggests GDP growth braked sharply in the July-September quarter from the second-quarter's 6.7% pace. Growth estimates for the third quarter range from as low as a 1.3% rate to as high as a 4.0% pace. Some of the anticipated slowdown in growth reflects the fading stimulus from trillions of dollars in pandemic relief from the government.
""Inflation will take a major bite out of third-quarter real consumer spending growth,"" said Shannon Seery, an economist for  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""The main challenge for the fourth quarter will be finding everything on the shopping list as the supply chain crisis worsens.""

Business inventories rose 0.6% after a similar gain in July, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. August's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
Inventories increased 7.4% on a year-on-year basis in August. Retail inventories gained 0.1% in August as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.4% rise in July. Motor vehicle inventories dropped 1.4% instead of 1.5% as estimated last month.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.6% as estimated last month.
Business inventories were depleted in the first half of the year, but shortages amid persistent supply bottlenecks because of the COVID-19 pandemic and congestion at ports in the United States and China are making it difficult to rebuild stocks. 
That has contributed to third-quarter GDP growth estimates being slashed to as low as a 1.3% annualized rate from as high as a 7% pace. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter.

Wholesale inventories increased 1.2% in August. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.6%.
Business sales dipped 0.1% in August after increasing 0.5% in July. At August's sales pace, it would take 1.26 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.25 months in July.

The government's Insolvency Service said 1,446 companies registered for insolvency last month, up 56% from a year ago but still down 4% on September 2019.
Company insolvencies - including voluntary liquidations, administration and bankruptcies - fell sharply last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused big backlogs in courts. Some businesses that would have folded also received support from government programmes.
The bulk of the insolvencies in September comprised creditor voluntary liquidations.

""This suggests that directors are choosing to close their businesses after deeming their financial survival unlikely after 18 months of trading through a pandemic,"" said Nicky Fisher, deputy vice president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3.
Individual insolvencies showed a similar pattern. While bankruptcies were still down compared with a year ago, debt relief orders - a form of insolvency for people with debts of less than 30,000 pounds ($41,000) - rose to their highest since around the start of lockdown.

Import prices rose 0.4% last month after falling 0.3% in August, the Labor Department said on Friday. In the 12 months through September, prices shot up 9.2% after advancing 8.9% in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, increasing 0.6%.
The government reported this week that strong food prices and rents pushed up consumer inflation in September, while higher energy costs kept producer prices elevated. The price of Brent crude has shot above $80 a barrel.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said the external trade surplus of the 19 countries sharing the euro was 4.8 billion euros in August compared to 14.0 billion euros a year earlier. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 16.1 billion euro surplus.
Adjusted for seasonal swings, the trade surplus was 11.0 billion, Eurostat said.
Eurostat said the European Union's trade deficit in energy in the January-August period grew to 151.9 billion euros from 108.7 billion euros in the same period of 2020. 
The EU's trade deficit with Russia, its main energy supplier surged to 37 billion euros in the first eight months of this year from 12.9 billion in the same period of 2020. Similarly, trade with Norway, another EU gas and oil supplier, swung to a deficit of 2.4 billion euros from a surplus of 3.6 billion euros.

The impact of energy offset a surge in the surplus in trade with Britain after Brexit, which moved to 93.1 billion euros in the January-August period from 65.6 billion euros in the same period last year, when Britain was still part of the single market under the Brexit transition period.
Also the EU trade surplus with the United States rose sharply to 110 billion euros from 92.6 billion euros thanks to a steep rise in exports.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's energy crisis deepened on Friday as cold weather swept into much of the country and power plants scrambled to stock up on coal, sending prices of the fuel to record highs.
Electricity demand to heat homes and offices is expected to soar this week as strong cold winds move down from northern China. Forecasters predict average temperatures in some central and eastern regions could fall by as much as 16 degrees Celsius in the next 2-3 days.
Shortages of coal, high fuel prices and booming post-pandemic industrial demand have sparked widespread power shortages in the world's second-largest economy. Rationing has already been in place in at least 17 of mainland China's more than 30 regions since September, forcing some factories to suspend production and disrupting supply chains. 
The most-active January Zhengzhou thermal coal futures hit a record high of 1,669.40 yuan ($259.42) per tonne early on Friday. The contract has risen more than 200% year to date.
The three northeastern provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang and Liaoning - among the worst hit by the power shortages last month - and several regions in northern China including Inner Mongolia and Gansu have started winter heating, which is mainly fuelled by coal, to cope with the colder-than-normal weather.
Beijing has taken a slew of measures to contain coal price rises including raising domestic coal output and cutting power to power-hungry industries and some factories during periods of peak demand. It has repeatedly assured users that energy supplies will be secured for the winter heating season. [B9N2QE019]
But power shortages are expected to continue into early next year, with analysts and traders forecasting a 12% drop in industrial power consumption in the fourth quarter as coal supplies fall short and local governments give priority to residential users. 
Graphic: China power rationing map - https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-POWER/jnvweyzazvw/chart.png 
Earlier this week, China in its boldest step in a decades-long power sector reform said it would allow coal-fired power prices to fluctuate by up to 20% from base levels from Oct. 15, enabling power plants to pass on more of the high costs of generation to commercial and industrial end-users.
Steel, aluminium, cement and chemical producers are expected to face higher and more volatile power costs under the new policy, pressuring profit margins. Data on Thursday showed factory-gate inflation in September hit a record high.

China aims to be ""carbon neutral"" by 2060 and Beijing has been trying to reduce its reliance on polluting coal power in favour of cleaner wind, solar and hydro. But coal is expected to provide the bulk of its electricity needs for some time.
China is not the only nation struggling with power supplies, which has led to fuel shortages and blackouts in some countries. The crisis has highlighted the difficulty in cutting the global economy's dependency on fossil fuels as world leaders seek to revive efforts to tackle climate change at talks next month in Glasgow.
China will strive to achieve carbon peaks by 2030, Vice Premier Han Zheng said in a video message at the Russian Energy Week International Forum, according to state-run news agency Xinhua late on Thursday.

He also said that China and Russia are important forces leading the energy transition and they should cooperate and ensure smooth progress of major oil and gas pipeline and nuclear power projects.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's September trade surplus was larger than expected as exports surged on the back of booming commodity prices, government data showed on Friday, cementing hopes for a quick economic recovery.
The resource-rich country booked a September trade surplus of $4.37 billion, data from the country's statistics bureau showed. That was above the median estimate of $3.84 billion, according to analysts polled earlier by Reuters. 
Indonesia recorded an all-time high surplus of $4.74 billion in August. It has posted a trade surplus every month since May 2020.
Analysts said robust exports should cushion the economic impact of Indonesia's devastating COVID-19 wave in the third quarter. 
The trade surplus would also help Southeast Asia's largest economy narrow its current account deficit, making its financial market less vulnerable to capital outflows and allowing the central bank to keep monetary policy accommodative for longer.
""The surplus is still large because of skyrocketing commodity prices, which is positive for our economy and the (U.S. dollar) liquidity outlook,"" said Fakhrul Fulvian, chief economist at Trimegah Sekuritas. 
""This means Bank Indonesia will keep interest rates steady next week,"" he added, referring to a central bank policy meeting scheduled to take place from Monday to Tuesday. 
Bank Indonesia is expected to keep its main policy rates unchanged until the third quarter of 2022, according to a new Reuters poll.
September exports grew 47.64% to $20.60 billion from a year earlier, compared with the poll's 51.57% growth forecast. 

Shipments of coal and copper remained strong, each rising more than 160%, while overseas sales of palm oil products, steel and oil and gas also registered high growth. 
September imports rose 40.31% to $16.23 billion, versus the poll's 50% forecast, with consumer goods imports surging nearly 60%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped below 300,000 last week for the first time in 19 months, further evidence that a shortage of workers was behind slower job growth rather than weakening demand for labor.
With the second straight weekly decline reported by the Labor Department on Thursday, initial claims are now in the zone that is generally associated with healthy labor market conditions. But the labor market faces challenges from shortages of workers and raw materials, which are fueling inflation.
""The data support the narrative that businesses are increasingly reluctant to let go of workers amid a severe supply shortage,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""But it is still not clear if the expected supply surge that failed to materialize in August and September will appear going forward.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 36,000 to a seasonally adjusted 293,000 for the week ended Oct. 9. That was lowest level since mid-March 2020, when the nation was in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
There were decreases in unadjusted claims in Florida, Texas and Tennessee. Applications increased in California, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri and Michigan. Part of the rise in Michigan was likely due to the idling of assembly lines by some motor vehicle manufacturers because of a global chip shortage. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 319,000 claims for the latest week. The drop last week was the biggest since late June. A 250,000-300,000 range for claims is seen as consistent with a healthy labor market. Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. 
The government reported last Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by only 194,000 jobs in September, the fewest in nine months. The cooling in employment growth is mostly due to a dearth of workers as well as a skills mismatch, with government data on Tuesday showing there were 10.4 million job openings at the end of August.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.

SHRINKING UNEMPLOYMENT ROLLS
More people are coming off the state unemployment rolls, indicating strong demand for labor. The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid plunged 134,000 to 2.593 million in the week ended Oct. 2, also the lowest level since mid-March 2020.
The total number of people collecting unemployment checks under all programs dropped 523,426 to 3.649 million during the week ended Sept. 25. That reflected the lapse of federal government-funded unemployment benefits last month.
Labor shortages, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, are also prevalent in other advanced economies, clogging the supply chains. There is hope that more Americans will rejoin the labor force, with coronavirus infections driven by the Delta variant declining, schools fully reopened for in-person learning and expanded benefits expired.
But amid increased self employment and massive savings as well as early retirements, thanks to a strong stock market and record house price gains, the labor pool could remain shallow for a while. Labor shortages are snarling the supply chain because there are fewer workers to produce raw materials and goods as well as shipping them to markets, fanning inflation.
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose 0.5% in September, the smallest gain in nine months, after increasing 0.7% in August. Economists had forecast the PPI gaining 0.6%. 
Graphic: Inflation: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/zjvqkewdzvx/inflation.png 
A 1.3% jump in prices of goods accounted for nearly 80% of the increase in the PPI. Goods prices, which advanced 1.0% in August, were boosted by energy products like gasoline, residential electricity and gas fuels. 
The price of Brent crude has shot above $80 a barrel. Electric and natural gas prices have also risen, indicating that energy costs could remain elevated.
Wholesale food prices rose 2.0%, lifted by beef. Services gained 0.2% as an 11.6% jump in margins for fuels and lubricants retailing was partially offset by a 16.9% plunge in airline tickets. There were also increases in the wholesale prices of machinery and equipment, motor vehicles and parts as well as truck transportation of freight.
In the 12 months through September, the PPI accelerated 8.6%, the largest year-on-year advance since November 2010 when the series was revamped, after surging 8.3% in August.
The report followed on the heels of news on Wednesday of a solid increase in consumer prices in September, driven by strong gains in food and rents as well as a range of other goods.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Sept. 21-22 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed some U.S. central bank officials ""expressed concerns that elevated rates of inflation could feed through into longer-term inflation expectations of households and businesses.""
But producer inflation could be nearing its peak. Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices nudged up 0.1% last month after gaining 0.3% in August. In the 12 months through September, the core PPI increased 5.9% after accelerating 6.3% in August. 

Healthcare costs rose 0.2% and portfolio management fees jumped 1.2%. Airfares, healthcare and portfolio fees feed into the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target. With the CPI and PPI data in hand, economists are estimating that the core PCE price index rose 0.1% in September, which would keep the year-on-year increase at 3.6%.
""There's no question producers are struggling with supply chain issues and labor shortages, so it's way too early to call the relatively low increases in core PPI a harbinger of a new trend,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York.

387,"<span>Oct 14, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers rose in September at a more moderate pace, suggesting a respite from the supply chain pressures and materials shortages that have driven up the cost of production.
The producer price index for final demand increased 0.5% from the prior month and 8.6% from a year earlier, Labor Department data showed Thursday. Excluding volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI rose 0.2% and was up 6.8% from a year ago.
The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.6% month-over-month advance in the overall PPI and an 8.7% gain in the core figure.
The PPI has climbed steadily this year as interruptions in supply networks and constraints that include shortages of materials and labor, drive up production costs. Firms have passed along at least some of those costs to their customers, which explains a recent acceleration in consumer prices. 
A separate report Wednesday showed prices paid by consumers rose in September by more than forecast, posting the largest annual gain since 2008.
Countries around the world are experiencing higher inflation. In China, the world’s largest exporter, a gauge prices paid to factories rose last month by the most since 1975.
Recent U.S. inflation data reinforce the Federal Reserve’s plan to soon start pulling back monetary support, especially as bottlenecks show little signs of abating. Minutes from last month’s Fed policy meeting showed that officials assessed that if the economic recovery remains on track, “a gradual tapering process that concluded around the middle of next year would likely be appropriate.”

Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs totaled 293,000 in the week ended Oct. 9, a decrease of 36,000 from the prior week, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a slight decrease to 320,000 applications.
Continuing claims for state benefits dropped to 2.6 million in the week ended Oct. 2.
Claims have marched lower as the economy recovers, boosting demand for labor to keep up with consumers. The latest surge of coronavirus cases hasn’t led to widespread layoffs as firms look to hire more workers and retain those they already have.
Still, September was the slowest month of job growth this year in the U.S. as the end of pandemic unemployment benefits and back-to-school didn’t lead to a sizable increase in hiring. That, along with lingering supply-chain issues, has led several economists to cut their forecasts for third-quarter growth, which is reported later this month.
The dearth of childcare has proved to be a major hurdle as the number of women on payrolls fell last month for the first time since December 2020.

389,"<span>Oct 14, 2021 07:26AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's September factory gate inflation rose to a record on soaring commodity prices, but weak demand capped consumer inflation, forcing policymakers to walk a tight rope between supporting the economy and further stoking producer prices. 
The producer price index (PPI) rose 10.7% from a year earlier in September, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Thursday, the biggest rise since the bureau started compiling the data in 1996. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected a 10.5% rise, after a 9.5% increase in August. 
Producer prices have risen due to output curbs caused by a power crunch at a home and a months-long global commodity price rally. But Chinese businesses have been reluctant to pass on the higher costs to local customers due to already soft orders. 
Data on Thursday showed consumer inflation eased last month, weighed by weak demand for goods from clothing to household appliances, as well as a decline in volatile food prices. 
Tang Jianwei, chief macroeconomics analyst at BOCOM, said China's mixed inflation picture posed a dilemma for the country's monetary authorities. 
""On one side, the relatively weak domestic demand requires a certain degree of easing to support a recovery in demand and on the other side, record high PPI restricts the room of easing,"" said Tang Jianwei, chief macroeconomics analyst at BOCOM.
Underpinning producer prices, global commodity prices surged in recent months driven by increased demand for coal and metals as economies around the world reopened after being shut due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Labour shortages and transportation bottlenecks have also lifted prices globally.
Adding to the price pressures in China, widespread power cuts in September disrupted output across the cement, steel，and aluminum industries, and even halted production at numerous factories including many supplying big global brands such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). China's power crunch has stemmed from a coal shortage amid efforts to meet decarbonisation goals and record prices of the fuel. 
Prices rose in 36 out of 40 industrial sectors last month, up from 32 sectors in August, the data showed. Prices in mining and coal jumped 74.9%, up sharply from August's 57.1% rise.
But the consumer price index rose 0.7% year-on-year in September, slowing from a 0.8% increase in August and below a forecast for a 0.9% rise in the Reuters poll.
""Bottlenecks in the supply side continue to exist and the demand was weak so producers cannot pass through the costs. This is a painful process the Chinese economy has to go through,"" said Zhou Hao, senior EM economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
China's economic growth is expected to slow to 5.2% year-on-year in the third quarter from 7.9% in April-June, a recent Reuters poll showed.
MEASURES 
Rising price pressures come even as Beijing has taken a raft of measures to curb record-high coal prices and ease the country's power crunch, including urging coal miners to boost output and manage electricity demand at industrial plants.

Consumer prices rose 4% year-on-year in September, the fastest pace since September 2008, according to data from INE, compared to 3.3% in August. The monthly inflation rate was 0.8%. 

Electricity prices rose almost 11% during the month and are up 44% in the 12 months through September, the INE said in its more detailed second reading report.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian employment fell sharply for a second month in September as coronavirus lockdowns forced firms to lay off workers, while the jobless rate was held down by another big drop in the number of people looking for work.
Policy makers are counting on a recovery in coming months as rapid progress in vaccinations has allowed restrictions to ease in Sydney, with Melbourne and Canberra soon to follow.
Relief was sorely needed with Thursday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showing employment fell by 138,000 in September, on top of a 146,100 drop in August.
The jobless rate edged up to 4.6%, from 4.5%, but has been artificially held down by the restrictions which prevent people looking for work and being counted as unemployed.
""The low national unemployment rate continues to reflect reduced participation during the recent lockdowns, rather than strong labour market conditions,"" said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labour statistics at the ABS.
The participation rate fell 0.7 percentage point in September to 64.5%, a long way from a record high of 66.2% hit in June. As this shift unwinds, the unemployment rate could well rise in the next few months even as employment recovers.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cautioned that unemployment will likely top 5% by year end, though it is optimistic activity will pick up quickly as the lockdowns ease.
The central bank still believes the jobless rate will need to get down to 4% or lower to drive a sustained, and much needed, lift in wages and inflation.
Speaking on Thursday, RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle noted that while the labour market had enjoyed a strong recovery ahead of the lockdowns, wages remained stubbornly subdued with very few workers getting annual rises over 2%.
The RBA has long argued pay growth above 3% was needed to get inflation into its 2-3% target band, after years of undershooting.

Debelle said the lack of a pick up in wages and inflation meant Australia did not have to follow some other developed nations in paring back policy stimulus.
Markets have recently started to wager the RBA might hike interest rates late next year, while the bank itself continues to say a move is unlikely until 2024.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its house price balance fell to +68 in September from a downwardly revised +72 in August, matching economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll.
Britain's housing market, like those in many other big economies, has boomed over the past year as the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased demand for properties with more space.
British house prices got an extra boost from a tax break on property purchases which expired at the start of this month. 
Mortgage lender Halifax reported last week that prices in September were 7.4% up on the year, including a hefty 1.7% monthly jump, the largest since 2007.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased solidly in September as Americans paid more for food, rent and a range of other goods, putting pressure on the Biden administration to urgently resolve strained supply chains, which are hampering economic growth. 
With prices likely to rise further in the months ahead following a recent surge in the costs of energy products, the report from the Labor Department on Wednesday could test Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's repeated assertion that high inflation is transitory. Powell and the White House have blamed supply chain bottlenecks for the high inflation. 
Supply chains have been gummed up by robust demand as economies emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to more than $10 trillion in global economic stimulus, about half of it in the United States. The coronavirus pandemic has caused a global shortage of workers needed to produce raw materials and move goods from factories to consumers. 
President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-cite-progress-unsnarling-supply-chain-meeting-with-labor-industry-2021-10-13 that the Port of Los Angeles would start operating around the clock, following the Port of Long Beach's lead, to ease congestion. Retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc as well as shipping companies FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and UPS also agreed to move goods 24 hours a day and seven days a week.
""Inflation is no longer 'transitory,'"" said Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""Supply-chain bottlenecks are getting worse. The logjam is unlikely to ease anytime soon despite the latest intervention by the White House."" 
The consumer price index rose 0.4% last month after climbing 0.3% in August. Food prices jumped 0.9% after increasing 0.4% in the prior month. The largest rise in food prices since April 2020 was driven by a surge in the cost of meat. 
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would receive from renting a home, increased 0.4%. That was the biggest gain in five years and followed a 0.3% rise in August. Rent of primary residence shot up 0.5%, the largest advance since May 2001. 
Rents are rising as demand for housing in cities rebounds after a pandemic-induced exodus to suburbs and other low-density locations. Economists expect rents, which account for nearly a third of the CPI, will be a major source of inflation in the months ahead.
""If shelter prices continue to pick up steam, it could mean higher inflation is more baked in than originally thought,"" said Will Compernolle, senior economist at FHN Financial in New York.
Food and rents accounted for more than half of the increase in the CPI. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the overall CPI would rise 0.3%.
In the 12 months through September, the CPI increased 5.4% after advancing 5.3% on a year-on-year basis in August.
Though gasoline prices rose moderately relative to August, prices at the pump have accelerated after the price of Brent crude shot above $80 a barrel. Natural gas prices have also surged.
Major U.S. stock indexes closed higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Yields on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to changes in interest rates, rose.
NEW CARS MORE EXPENSIVE
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI climbed 0.2% after edging up 0.1% in August. In addition to rents, the co-called core CPI was lifted by a 1.3% increase in the cost of new motor vehicles, which marked the fifth straight month of gains above 1%.
A global semiconductor shortage has forced auto manufacturers to cut production. The average price of a new motor vehicle topped $45,000 for the first time ever in September, according to Kelley Blue Book, a vehicle valuation and automotive research company in California.
There were also increases in the prices of household furnishings and operations, with furniture and bedding posting the biggest gain since March 1988. Consumers also paid more for motor vehicle insurance.
Though prices for airline fares and used cars and trucks fell, economists expected a rebound, noting that air travel was picking up as infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus subside. Auction data pointed to rising prices for used motor vehicles.
The so-called core CPI rose 4.0% on a year-on-year basis last month, matching the gain in August.
Accelerating wage growth is also exerting upward pressure on inflation. The government reported last week that average hourly earnings increased by the most in seven months on a year-on-year basis in September because of worker shortages. 
With the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs hitting a record high https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-job-openings-fall-still-high-104-million-august-2021-10-12 in August and at least 10.4 million unfilled positions, wage inflation is set to rise further.
Minutes of the Fed's Sept. 21-22 policy meeting, which were released on Wednesday, showed some U.S. central bank officials ""expressed concerns that elevated rates of inflation could feed through into longer-term inflation expectations of households.""
Fed officials signaled https://www.reuters.com/business/patient-or-aggressive-fed-policymakers-split-inflation-response-2021-10-13 they could start reducing the central bank's massive bond-buying program in mid-November, the minutes showed.
Strong inflation, if persistent, could force the Fed to increase interest rates.
""Stickier more persistent factors are becoming more prevalent, which the Fed is more likely to respond to,"" said Michelle Meyer, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities in New York.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 3.6% in the 12 months through August, rising by the same margin for a third straight month. 

September's data is due later this month. The Fed last month upgraded its core PCE inflation projection for this year to 3.7% from the 3.0% it projected in June.
Rising inflation, which is eroding consumers' purchasing power, and supply constraints led economists to anticipate that economic growth braked to below a 3% annualized rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the April-June quarter.

396,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid by U.S. consumers rose in September by more than forecast, resuming a faster pace of growth and underscoring the persistence of inflationary pressures in the economy.
The consumer price index increased 0.4% from August, according to Labor Department data released Wednesday. Compared with a year ago, the CPI rose 5.4%, matching the largest annual gain since 2008. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, so-called core inflation rose 0.2% from the prior month.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.3% monthly gain in the overall measure and a 0.2% advance in the core rate.
A combination of unprecedented shipping challenges, materials shortages, high commodities prices and rising wages have sharply driven up costs for producers. Many have passed some portion of those costs along to consumers, leading to more persistent inflation than many economists -- including those at the Federal Reserve -- had originally anticipated.
The pickup in price growth seen last month reflected higher food and shelter costs. Meantime, measures of used cars and trucks, apparel and airfares cooled.
The report will likely reinforce the Fed’s inclination to soon start tapering its asset purchases, especially as the supply-chain challenges plaguing businesses show little signs of abating. Minutes from last month’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting -- out Wednesday afternoon -- will provide further insight on policy makers’ views toward progress on employment and inflation goals for tapering.
A New York Fed survey out Tuesday showed U.S. consumers’ expectations for inflation continued to rise in September, with 1-year and 3-year expectations accelerating to record highs.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy returned to growth in August after contracting for the first time in six months in July, keeping intact financial market bets that the Bank of England will begin raising interest rates before the end of the year.
Gross domestic product grew by 0.4% in August - a shade under market expectations in a Reuters poll of economists - after it was revised down to show a drop of 0.1% in July when staff absences linked to the Delta variant of COVID-19 peaked.
""The economy picked up in August as bars, restaurants and festivals benefited from the first full month without COVID-19 restrictions in England,"" Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics, said.
Financial markets were little changed after the data, which showed a mixed picture on the impact of supply chain difficulties that have pushed up inflation and hurt growth.
The BoE, facing a jump in inflation, looks set to be the first major central bank to raise interest rates since the start of the pandemic. Investors are betting on a rise to 0.25% by the end of December, up from its all-time low of 0.1%.
After the latest official data, Britain's economy is now within 0.8% of its pre-pandemic size - a much smaller gap than when the last monthly figures were released thanks to upward revisions to output growth earlier in the year.
Still, the economy remains around 5% smaller than if growth had continued on its 2010-2019 trajectory uninterrupted by the pandemic - unlike the United States which had almost closed that gap as of the second quarter of 2021. 
GRAPHIC-UK GDP remains almost 5% below pre-COVID trend https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/lgvdwllodpo/Pasted%20image%201634122592331.png 
Britain's economy shrank by 9.7% in 2020, its joint-biggest drop in 300 years and matching the annual decline in 1921, when the economy was still reeling from the cost of World War One.
The International Monetary Fund forecast on Tuesday that Britain was on track to have the fastest expansion of any country in the G7 group of rich nations, growing by 6.8% this year, although the outsize scale of last year's slump means it will still take longer to recover than most of its peers.
SLOWING REBOUND
Britain's economy expanded rapidly in the first half of 2021 helped by the fast initial roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines. 
But this has slowed due to a wave of coronavirus cases and global supply chain chaos which in Britain has been exacerbated by new post-Brexit restrictions on trade and immigration.
Growth in the three months to August slowed to its weakest since April at 2.9%.
Chip shortages which had hampered carmakers eased in August, the ONS said, helping manufacturing return to growth, but car output was still more than 14% below a peak in February.
Supply-chain shortages were most visible in construction, where output fell for a second month in a row due to rising costs and shortages of steel, concrete, timber and glass.
The economy is also likely to have taken a further hit in September from temporary shortages of fuel at many petrol stations in England - caused by a lack of tanker drivers - and the impact of a surge in natural gas prices.
Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said expectations that the BoE would act imminently looked misplaced.
""The continuation of modest GDP growth in August should convince the MPC that the economy does not need to be cooled immediately by raising interest rates,"" he said.
GDP would need to grow by an implausible 2.2% in September for it to match the BoE's forecast in August for growth of 2.1% in the third quarter as a whole, he added.
Separate data from the ONS suggested the impact of Brexit on trade between Britain and the European Union was easing.

Imports of goods from EU countries remained lower than those from non-EU countries for an eighth month in a row but the gap was the narrowest since Britain left the bloc's single market on Jan. 1. 
The data showed a similar picture for British goods exports to the EU, the ONS said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's export growth unexpectedly accelerated in September, as still solid global demand offset some of the pressures on factories from power shortages, supply bottlenecks and a resurgence of domestic COVID-19 cases.
The world's second-largest economy has staged an impressive rebound from the pandemic but there are signs the recovery is losing steam. Resilient exports could provide a buffer against growing headwinds including weakening factory activity, persistently soft consumption and a slowing property sector. 
Outbound shipments in September jumped 28.1% from a year earlier, up from a 25.6% gain in August. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast growth would ease to 21%. 
""Exports have continued to outperform and accelerate, even after omitting the impact of base effects,"" said Erin Xin, Greater China economist at HSBC, adding that earlier shipments of holiday consumer products in light of global supply chain disruptions may be behind the continued strength in exports.
Other analysts said power rationing in September may not have affected exports yet, but could constrain production and inflate costs for Chinese manufacturers in the months to come. 
Power shortages caused by a transition to clean energy, strong industrial demand, and high commodity prices have halted production at numerous factories including many supplying firms such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) since late September. 
Factories in eastern provinces of Guangdong and Zhejiang, both major export powerhouses, have been asked to stagger their production throughout the week, and many owners are complaining about the chaos the curbs have brought to work schedules.
Previously, factories could operate at night but now the ban is 24 hours on days of rationing, said King Lau, who helps manage a metal-coating factory in the export city of Dongguan. The factory was asked to stop using government electricity on three working days this week.
However, Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics is optimistic the export outlook in the coming quarters remains solid, despite near-term headwinds. 
""We generally expect these disruptions to ease over the coming months, as we expect senior policymakers to stress growth and to call for the pursuit of climate targets on a more measured timeline.""
""Further out, we think exports should be underpinned by the ongoing global economic recovery and a gradual easing of global supply-chain disruptions next year.""
Recent data has pointed to a slowdown in production activity. China's manufacturing PMI unexpectedly shrank in September as industrial firms battled with rising costs and electricity rationing.
Furthermore, the property sector, a key driver of growth, is reeling from the increasing defaults of Chinese developers, with real estate sales tumbling and new construction starts slowing. 
Reuters latest poll shows analysts have lowered their expectations for China's full-year growth to 8.2% from 8.6% seen in July, with a further slowdown to 5.5% in 2022. On a quarterly bsis, growth in the third quarter might have cooled to just 0.5% from 1.3% in April-June.[ECILT/CN]
But analysts said concerns over high debt levels and property bubble risks may delay any further central bank policy easing into next year.
Many analysts are expecting the central bank to inject more stimulus by cutting the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves to help small and medium-sized enterprises.
IMPORTS SLOW
China's September imports rose 17.6%, lagging an expected 20% gain in a Reuters poll and 33.1% growth the previous month. 
""The breakdown showed a broad-based decline across all good types, though it was particularly pronounced for inbound shipments of semiconductors,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
""Lower import volumes of industrial metals add to evidence that environmental curbs and cooling construction activity are weighing on heavy industry.""
However, China's energy demand is rapidly rising. 
Coal imports in September rose to the highest this year as power plants scrambled for fuel to boost electricity generation to ease the power crunch and replenish inventories ahead of the winter heating season.
Natural gas imports in September also rose to their highest since January this year.

China posted a trade surplus of $66.76 billion in September, versus the poll's forecast for a $46.8 billion surplus and $58.34 billion surplus in August.
Its trade surplus with the United States rose to $42 billion, Reuters calculations based on the customs data showed, up from $37.68 billion in August.

Exports grew 28.1% year-on-year, with forecasts prepared for Investing.com predicting a 21% growth and the 25.6% gain recorded during the previous month.
Although China took the lead in economic recovery from COVID-19, challenges such as the high demand for raw materials and supply chain bottlenecks have caused the recovery to slow down and dimmed the country’s economic outlook.

Imports grew 17.6% year-on-year, but the growth was lower than the 20% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 33.1% growth. Meanwhile, China’s trade balance was at $66.76 billion, higher than the $46.80 billion in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the $58.34 billion surplus recorded in August.
The People’s Bank of China is also widely expected to inject more stimulus by cutting the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later in 2021, in order to help small and medium-sized enterprises.
Although China has largely contained the latest COVID-19 outbreaks involving the more infectious Delta variant, its ""zero-tolerance"" COVID-19 policy and stretched international shipping capacity could be constraints, some investors told Reuters.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly fell in August, underlining persistent pressure on businesses and the broader economy as firms struggle to shake off the drag from the coronavirus pandemic.
The Cabinet Office data on Wednesday showed core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 2.4% in August from the previous month, dragged down by the biggest decline in orders from manufacturers in more than five years.
The contraction compared with July's 0.9% rise, while a Reuters poll of economists had predicted 1.7% growth.
In comments accompanying the data, the government downgraded its assessment on machinery orders for the first time in six months, saying a recovery in the series appeared to be stalling.
""The picture has been 'solid manufacturers and weak non-manufacturers' so far, but the gap is narrowing,"" Masato Koike, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute said.
The export-oriented manufacturing sector faces headwinds ranging from a global economic slowdown to supply chain bottlenecks, while service-oriented non-manufacturers have a clearer path to recovery as the domestic COVID-19 situation improves, Koike added.
The orders data came about a week after the inauguration of new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, after his predecessor Yoshihide Suga saw his support undermined by surging coronavirus infections and protracted restrictions.
While Japanese firms have so far provided momentum to the economy's recovery through solid output, exports and capital expenditure, the outlook points to a bumpy ride.
Manufacturers' sentiment dropped to a six-month low in October due to an enduring supply shortage and soaring material costs, the Reuters Tankan showed on Wednesday.
Following an annualised 1.9% gross-domestic product (GDP) growth in the second quarter, analysts forecast a smaller gain in Japan's July-September GDP, indicating sluggish - if not shrinking - private consumption.
By sector, manufacturers' orders declined 13.4% month-on-month in August, marking the first decline in five months, due to by weaker demand from sectors such as electronic machines, production machines and shipmakers. It was the biggest fall since February 2016.
Orders from non-manufacturers increased 7.1% after a 9.5% dip in July, led by demands from wholesale and retail sellers and logistics companies.
External orders, which are not counted as core orders, fell 14.7%, slipping after 24.1% growth in the previous month.
""The results were weaker ... but it didn't indicate machinery orders will extend declines ahead,"" said Shintaro Inagaki, senior market economist at Mizuho Securities.

""Concerns like the chip shortage and recent commodity price inflation are not something that continue long-term, but they are likely to be dispelled by next spring.""
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those for ships and electric utilities, expanded 17.0% in August, the data showed, reflecting a double-digit decline in the same month in 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted a 14.7% jump.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans voluntarily quitting their jobs surged to a record high in August and there were more than 10 million vacancies, pointing to a tightening labor market that could help to keep inflation high as companies raise wages to lure workers. 
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Tuesday was another reflection of an economy that is battling labor and raw material shortages in nearly every industry, which are crimping growth.
""There are help-wanted posters in every shop window on Main Street, and the lack of workers is exacerbating the supply disruptions throughout the nation that is lighting a match to the fire of inflation,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""The labor market has already recovered.""
Quits increased by about 242,000 in August, lifting the total to a record 4.3 million. There were 157,000 people who quit in the accommodation and food services industry while 26,000 left in the wholesale trade business. State and local government education saw 25,000 departures.

People are most likely leaving their jobs for fear of contracting COVID-19. The number of quits increased in the South and Midwest regions, which have borne the brunt of the summer wave of coronavirus infections driven by the Delta variant. 
Vaccinations rates are low in the South and Midwest and some states like Florida and Texas have banned mask mandates.
The quits rate shot up to an all-time high of 2.9% in August from 2.7% in July. The quits rate is normally viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. The higher quits rate suggests wage inflation will likely continue to build up as companies scramble for workers, who have unlimited choice. 
""These readings are also consistent with strong demand for labor, with people feeling confident in their abilities to get new jobs and not many layoffs taking place,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Inflation is way above the Federal Reserve's flexible 2% target, while gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter are mostly below a 3% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter.
Stocks on Wall Street were weaker on worries over the impact of inflation on upcoming third-quarter earnings. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
STRONG LABOR DEMAND 
Though employment remains 5 million jobs below its peak in February 2020, economists believe that number probably is not a true reflection of the labor market's health as the shortfall includes people who have retired. 
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped 659,000 to a still-high 10.4 million on the last day of August. Data for July was revised to show 11.1 million unfilled jobs instead of the previously reported 10.9 million. 
Despite August's decline, which economists attributed to the coronavirus infections over summer hampering activity in the consumer-facing services industries, vacancies were the second- highest on record and were 49% above their pre-pandemic level. There were 0.8 people per job opening in August.
""The JOLTS report continues to suggest that the labor market isn't as loose as the current 5 million jobs shortfall would indicate,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
JOLTS https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/akpezaqrdvr/jolts.png 
There were 224,000 fewer vacancies in the healthcare and social assistance sector. Job openings in the accommodation and food services industry fell by 178,000. States and local government education vacancies dropped by 124,000 positions.
Regionally, job openings fell in the Northeast and Midwest. The job openings rate dropped to 6.6% from 7% in July.
The government reported last Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by only 194,000 in September, the smallest gain since December 2020, after increasing 366,000 in August.
The scarcity of workers was underscored by a separate survey from the NFIB on Tuesday showing 51% of small business owners reported job openings they could not fill in September, a record high reading for the third straight month.
Hiring decreased by 439,000 jobs to 6.3 million in August. The largest decline since December 2020 was led by the accommodation and food services industry, where payrolls dropped by 240,000 jobs. Hiring at state and local government education declined by 160,000 jobs. 
The decrease in hiring was more pronounced in the Midwest region. The hiring rate fell to 4.3% from 4.6% in July.
With COVID-19 infections declining and schools fully reopened for in-person learning, there is hope that more people will rejoin the labor force. The labor squeeze could also ease in the months ahead following the expiration of federal government-funded benefits in early September.

Businesses and Republicans blamed these expanded benefits for the record job openings. But amid increased self employment and all-time high savings as well as early retirements, thanks to a strong stock market and record house price gains, the labor pool could remain shallow for a while.
""Longer-term issues remain as many people who worked in low- paying jobs with variable hours, particularly in leisure/hospitality, may be unwilling to go back to these types of positions,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

LONDON (Reuters) -British employers increased their payrolls to a record high in September, shortly before the end of the government's wage subsidies scheme, potentially encouraging the Bank of England's progress towards a first post-pandemic interest rate hike.
The number of workers on companies' books rose by the most on record in data going back to 2014, up by 207,000 from August.
Employers turned to recruitment agencies to find staff and hotel and food firms created jobs as they recovered from COVID-19 lockdowns.
Separate official data published on Tuesday showed the unemployment rate edged down to 4.5% in the three months to August from 4.6% in the May-July period, as expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
The BoE is gearing up to become the first major central bank to raise rates since the coronavirus crisis struck. Inflation is heading towards 4% or higher -- above its 2% target. 
But the BoE is watching to see how many people became unemployed after the end of the furlough programme that subsidised wages to keep people employed during the pandemic.
About 1 million people are likely to have been on the scheme when it ended on Sept. 30, according to an estimate by the Resolution Foundation think tank.
Hussain Mehdi, macro and investment strategist at HSBC Asset Management, said the data left open the possibility of a BoE rate increase before the end of the year.
""A decent October jobs report could open the door to a hike as soon as the December meeting,"" he said. 
The BoE is also monitoring pay growth as it tries to gauge how persistent a recent jump in inflation is likely to be.
Average weekly earnings in the June-August period were 7.2% higher than in the same three months of 2020, slowing from the previous reading of 8.3%.
Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 6.0%, also losing some momentum.
The ONS estimated the underlying pace of wage growth, taking into account how job losses during the lockdowns affected predominantly lower-paid workers, was between 4.1% and 5.6% for regular pay in nominal terms.
That compared with regular pay growth of about 3% just before the pandemic hit.
SHORTAGE OF JOB CANDIDATES
A record-high level of vacancies pointed to a shortage of candidates for jobs after the pandemic and Britain's post-Brexit controls on workers from the European Union which has made it harder for some employers to find staff. A shortage of fuel tanker drivers led to the supply of petrol and diesel being disrupted this month. 
But there were still signs of caution on the part of employers, who hired many more part-time workers than full-time staff in the three months to August.

The Resolution Foundation said the widest measure of economic activity – hours worked – remained 2.7% down on pre-pandemic levels, but the gap was likely to be closed in next month's data.
""Though wage growth looks almost unbelievably strong right now, there are big questions over whether it will remain strong enough over the coming months to prevent real wages from falling this winter,"" said Nye Cominetti, a Resolution Foundation economist.

407,"<span>Oct 12, 2021 03:40AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's auto sales slumped 19.6% in September from a year earlier, industry data showed on Tuesday, falling for a fifth consecutive month as a prolonged global shortage of semiconductors and a domestic power crunch disrupt production.
This time of year, known as ""Golden September, Silver October"", is usually a high point in sales for the industry, with consumers making purchases after staying away from showrooms during the stifling summer months.
Sales in the world's biggest car market totalled 2.07 million vehicles in September, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed. 
The sales drop was due to the domestic power crunch caused partly by the shortage of coal and prolonged global chip shortage that has forced many major automakers to idle or curtail production, said Chen Shihua, a senior official at CAAM.
He added that the chip supply shortage eased in China last month and that the industry body now expects the supply to improve further in the final three months this year but constraints would remain.
One bright spot in the data was the strong sales of new energy vehicles (NEV), which more than doubled in September to 357,000, thanks to the government's promotion of greener vehicles to cut pollution. These include battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which is making Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles in Shanghai, sold 56,006 China-made vehicles in September, the highest since it started production in Shanghai about two years ago, and up 27% from 44,264 in August.

Chinese EV makers Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) Inc delivered over 10,000 vehicles each last month. Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) said it sold 10,126 ID. series EVs in China in September.
Another CAAM official, Xu Haidong, said NEV sales likely to hit three million units this year, up from 1.4 million last year.

LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers increased their spending in September at the slowest pace since January, when the country was stuck in a coronavirus lockdown, as they worried about a shortage of fuel, according to a survey published on Tuesday.
The British Retail Consortium said retail spending lost more momentum last month, rising by just 0.6% compared with September 2020, much weaker than August's 3.0% increase.
""There are signs that consumer confidence is being hit as the fuel shortages, combined with wetter weather, had an impact in the second half of the month,"" BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said. ""This had a bigger effect on large purchases such as furniture and homeware.""
Much of the country saw panic-buying of fuel last month as a shortage of tanker drivers led to disruption of supplies. The government has blamed this on problems facing the global economy as it reopens after lockdown, but critics say it also reflects Britain's tougher post-Brexit immigration rules.
A separate survey of broader household spending by card payments firm Barclaycard showed consumers increased their spending on fuel by 11.1% compared with September 2019, the biggest such increase in more than two years.
Overall consumer card spending grew by 13.3% compared to the same period in 2019, Barclaycard said.
Its surveys currently do not compare sales with 2020 because of distortions caused by the pandemic lockdowns.
Almost half of Barclaycard's respondents reported seeing empty spaces on the shelves, reflecting the shortage of truckers, and 18% said they found it harder than usual to find fresh fruit and vegetables. 
Spending growth on non-essential items slowed, which might be a sign some consumers were starting to cut back on discretionary purchases as inflation rose, Barclaycard said.
Nine out of 10 respondents were concerned about the impact of inflation on their household finances, something the Bank of England will note as it considers when to raise interest rates for the first time since the pandemic hit. The proportion who felt optimistic about the economy fell to 31% from 37% in August.

But there were signs of a return to something resembling normality for some sectors hit hardest by lockdowns.
Spending at pubs and bars rose as newly reunited colleagues went out and takings at cinemas, theatres and concert halls also rose. Struggling travel agents and airlines saw the scale of their sales falls narrow.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's wholesale inflation hit a 13-year high in September as rising global commodity prices and a weak yen pushed up import costs, putting pressure on corporate margins and raising the risk of unwanted consumer price hikes.
Rising input costs are adding strain for manufacturers already hit by supply constraints and clouding the outlook for the world's third-largest economy, which relies on exports to cushion the blow from soft consumption, analysts say.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, surged 6.3% in September from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed on Tuesday, exceeding market forecasts for a 5.9% gain.
The increase accelerated from a revised 5.8% rise in August to its fastest pace since September 2008, the data showed.
""If rises in raw material costs accelerate, companies selling final goods prices will see profits squeezed. As Japan is a net importer of fuel, such cost-push inflation could hurt the economy,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior economist at Daiwa Securities.
Rising oil prices pushed up petroleum and coal costs by 32.4% in September, while prices of wood products spiked 48.3%.
An index gauging yen-based wholesale import prices surged a record 31.3% in September from a year earlier, suggesting a weak yen - usually a boon to the economy by lifting exports - could hurt growth by squeezing the bottom line for corporations.
""A double whammy of declining yen value and rising energy costs could be a huge blow to Japan's economy,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.
Still, analysts doubted whether the rise in wholesale prices would trigger a spike in Japan's consumer inflation, as seen in other economies.

""Most of the rise in wholesale prices will be absorbed by companies with the impact on consumers likely marginal, such as through higher gasoline costs,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
Core consumer inflation was flat in August from the previous year, well short of the BOJ's 2% target, as weak household spending keeps firms from raising prices.

The New Zealand Treasury said it had a budget deficit of NZ$4.6 billion ($3.2 billion) in the year to end June 2021, compared with a shortfall of NZ$15.1 billion forecast just a few months ago in May.
Revenue was higher and expenditure lower than forecasted as economic activity rebounded strongly and unemployment fell much more quickly than expected.
That allowed the government to borrow less than planned so that net core debt amounted to 30% of gross domestic product, instead of the 34% originally forecast in the 2020/21 budget.
Minister of Finance Grant Robertson said the current year would be impacted by the recent outbreak of the Delta variant that has forced a lockdown of the country's largest city, Auckland.

""However, the 2020/21 Crown accounts on the back of a solid result in 2019/20 put New Zealand in a strong position to support social and economic recovery and development,"" he said in a statement.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese households' inflation expectations rose in the three months to September, a survey showed on Monday, suggesting a global rise in raw material costs may be affecting perceptions in a country worried about the risk of deflation.
The ratio of Japanese households that expect prices to rise a year from now stood at 68.2% in September, up from 66.8% three months ago, a quarterly central bank survey showed.
The median projection of inflation a year from now stood at 3.0% in September, up from 2.0% in June, the survey showed.
There is uncertainty, however, on how lasting the shift in public sentiment could be. The ratio of households seeing prices rising five years from now slid to 78.1% in September from 79.3% in June.
More households expect economic conditions to worsen a year from now, the survey showed, underscoring concerns that the lingering impact of the coronavirus pandemic could weigh on consumption.
In a sign households are already feeling the effects of rising food and grocery costs, 61.5% said they saw prices rise from year-before levels, up from 56.4% in June.
The survey was conducted on 2,209 households between Aug. 6 and Sept. 1.
Japan's economy, the world's third largest, is gradually recovering helped by robust external demand, though consumption has been hobbled by state of emergency curbs to contain the rise in COVID-19 infections. The measures were lifted on Sept. 30.

Soft household spending has kept consumer inflation hovering around zero in Japan, contrary to other major economies that have seen prices spikes on strong demand and supply bottlenecks.
Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe deployed his ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies in 2013 to pull Japan out of nearly two decades of grinding deflation. While consumer prices have perked up since then, inflation remains distant from the Bank of Japan's 2% target due partly to weak household spending.

The rate remains well within the target range of between 5% and 9% set by the central bank, which next meets on Oct. 28 to decide interest rates. 
""Monthly inflation is higher than we had anticipated. It's mainly explained by the jump in vegetable and meat prices. The food index is up 3.5% month on month,"" said Allen Sandeep of Naeem Brokerage. 
Headline inflation was last this high in January 2020, when it reached 7.17%. 
Egypt's fuel pricing committee also raised domestic prices in a quarterly review on Friday, indicating that more price rises may lie ahead.
""We expect inflation in October to maintain its monthly momentum, with the seasonal spending accompanying the school season coupled with the inflationary impact of the introduced increase in fuel prices,"" Beltone analyst Alia Mamdouh said in a note. 
Naeem Research by contrast predicted inflation could lessen in October. 
""We expect annual inflation to cool down, given favourable base year impacts (contributing -1.9%) and a slower increase in monthly inflation,"" it said in a note. 
""Our calculations indicate that the latest gasoline price hike (of EGP0.25/litre) would have less than a 30 bps (basis point) impact on monthly CPI.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Canadian economy posted a monster jobs gain in September, pushing employment back to its pre-pandemic levels, and the jobless rate hit an 18-month low, Statistics Canada data indicated on Friday.
Analysts said the figures showed the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was gaining pace but predicted the Bank of Canada would want to see sustained evidence of strength before adopting a more aggressive stance on the timing of interest rate hikes.
Statistics Canada reported a net gain of 157,100 new jobs, all of them in full-time employment. The jobless rate dipped to 6.9%, the lowest level since February 2020.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the country would add 65,000 new jobs in September and its unemployment rate would fall to 6.9% from 7.1% in August.
Canada has now returned to the employment levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic started last year, having regained the 3 million jobs it lost during the crisis, Statscan said.
""It's very solid and shows that Canada is doing well in that fourth wave,"" said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Group, saying the central bank might announce later in October that it is further tapering its quantitative easing program.
All the job gains came in full-time employment, which posted an increase of 193,600 new jobs, and were split evenly between the public and private sectors. The economy shed 36,500 part-time positions.
The Bank of Canada slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.25% last year and says it will not consider raising them again until the economy has absorbed excess slack, which it expects to occur in the second half of 2022.
Due to population growth, there are still 276,000 more people unemployed than there were in February 2020.
""The Bank of Canada is still going to want to see more improvement from here because their goal isn't just to get back to the pre-pandemic jobs number, it (is) to get back to the pre-pandemic employment population ratio,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities.
The Canadian dollar touched its strongest level since Aug. 11 at 1.2490 per greenback, or 80.06 U.S. cents, up as much as 0.5% on the day. Separately, data showed U.S. employment increased far less than expected in September.

Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, noted that while the number of hours worked were up 1.1%, they remained 1.5% below their pre-pandemic level.
""While the headline print likely seals the deal for another taper from the Bank of Canada later this month, there's still a ways to go to fully heal the labor market,"" he said in a note.

414,"<span>Oct 08, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. added fewer jobs than forecast for a second month in September, signaling weakness in the labor market recovery and complicating a potential decision by the Federal Reserve to begin scaling back monetary support before year end.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 194,000 last month after an upwardly revised 366,000 gain in August, a Labor Department report showed Friday. The unemployment rate fell to 4.8%, while average hourly earnings jumped.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for a 500,000 rise in September payrolls.
Consecutive months of sluggish job growth indicate a tug of war between employers -- starved for workers to meet demand -- and candidates have been slow to return to the workforce. Nonetheless, school reopenings and the end of expanded federal unemployment benefits should lead to a pickup in hiring in coming months at a time when companies are boosting pay.
The jobs figures risk not satisfying the Federal Reserve’s “substantial further progress” criteria for labor market improvement, indicating the central bank could delay its plan to begin tapering asset purchases by year-end.
Chair Jerome Powell said after last month’s policy meeting that “a reasonably good employment report” for September would be needed meet that test.
Vaccine mandates put into place by employers and governors in states including California and New York in recent weeks could also be contributing to churn in the labor market and adding to hiring challenges.

415,"<span>Oct 08, 2021 05:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan’s exports grew faster than even the most bullish economist forecast last month, fueled by ongoing global demand for semiconductors.  
Exports rose 29.2% in September from a year earlier to a record $39.7 billion, according to a statement from Taiwan’s Ministry of Finance on Friday. That compares to a median estimate of 25% in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Imports surged 40.4% to $33.2 billion, the second highest reading on record. The trade balance widened to $6.5 billion, it’s highest since October last year. 
Taiwan’s overseas shipments have been on a tear ever since rebounding from a dip during the initial months of the global Covid-19 outbreak last year. September’s figures benefited from resurgent worldwide demand, especially for electronic devices and new technologies such as 5G, according to the ministry’s statement. The decision by several major chipmakers to raise prices in recent months also bolstered figures. 
The growth was underpinned by strong figures from the island’s largest company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Earlier Friday it reported a record NT$414.7 billion ($14.8 billion) in quarterly sales for the three months through September, bolstered by global demand for computer chips amid an ongoing shortage in the silicon that power everything from cars to smartphones. 
The company’s September sales rose 20% versus a year ago to NT$152.7 billion.
But economists are increasingly warning that Taiwan’s streak of stellar export growth may be about to end. 
“Monthly exports are expected to gradually decrease in the next quarter and into the start of next year as well.” Woods Chen, chief economist at Yuanta Securities Invest Consulting, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. “It is unlikely that export growth will go back to how it was in the third quarter.” 
Chen estimated exports to slow to 17% in the fourth quarter and 6% in the first quarter of 2022. 
Exports are likely to continue expanding in the final quarter of 2021, according to the finance ministry’s statement, fueled mainly by the launch of new consumer electronics products, infrastructure projects in major countries, and the overall expansion of the global economy.
Shipments will likely grow by between 21% and 25% in October, the finance ministry’s Beatrice Tsai said in a briefing in Taipei Friday. 
“I expect a moderation in export growth in the fourth quarter as there are some early signs of softening demand for consumer electronic products,” Michelle Lam, an economist at Societe General SA, wrote via message Friday. “However, Taiwan’s leading position in foundry and the continued semiconductor shortage means it will be manageable.”

The sluggish data weighed on the outlook for China's overall retail sales, which have slowed much more sharply than expected when new COVID-19 outbreaks struck a handful of Chinese cities over summer.
The seven-day holiday in China from Oct. 1-7 to mark National Day is one of the busiest travel periods in the country and a bellwether for consumer demand in the world's second-largest economy.
Domestic tourism revenues totalled 389.06 billion yuan ($60.36 billion), the official People's Daily reported on Thursday, the last day of the holiday, citing data from China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism. 
That was down 4.7% year-on-year and still under 60% of the revenues recorded in the same week before the pandemic.
""The spend weakness was attributable to the relatively soft prices of travel products and a shift toward short-haul trips,"" Citi wrote in a note. 
""The recovery of consumption has been sluggish post the pandemic, and the road ahead may still be bumpy, given lingering public health risks. While the Delta wave has been contained, the risks of importing infections and local outbreaks remain."" 
RISKS FOR GROWTH
The sluggish Golden Week data bode ill for retail sales in October, and add downside risks to China's economic growth outlook, Nomura said in a note. 
Third-quarter gross domestic product data are due out with September's retail sales figures on Oct. 18.
China has largely contained the spread of the coronavirus since it first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, adopting a zero tolerance approach that is becoming economically more costly due to the disruptions of business and industry. 
The ministry also logged 515 million domestic tourist trips across China over the seven days, representing a year-on-year decline of 1.5% and was just over 70% of pre-pandemic levels. 
Flight bookings for a majority of popular tourist cities were slightly lower than a year earlier, China's aviation regulator said on Friday. 

Air passenger traffic over the holiday fell 19.6% from 2020 levels, the regulator's data showed.

Investing.com – China’s services sector made a return to growth in September as a major COVID-19 outbreak in the eastern province of Jiangsu was brought under control. Although providing support to a stalled economic recovery, the risk remains that more COVID-19 outbreaks could hamper the recovery again.
The Caixin services purchasing managers index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was 53.4 in September, compared to the previous month’s 46.7 figure. The Caixin survey, which focuses on the private sector, also rose above the 50-mark indicating growth and away from more-than-one-year lows.
The non-manufacturing PMI, released by the National Bureau of Statistics at the end of September, was at 53.2.
The services sector has been slower to recover from COVID-19 compared to the manufacturing sector. It is also more susceptible to shocks from COVID-19 outbreaks, which impact consumption and travel, and the outlook for a rebound remains uncertain.
""In view of this, in the coming months, the government should focus on improving epidemic prevention and control and alleviating supply-side pressure,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe told Reuters.
""It should also find a balance among multiple objectives, such as promoting employment, holding raw material prices stable, ensuring a stable and orderly supply, and meeting targets for controlling energy consumption.""
Input prices increased for the 15th consecutive month in September and also increased at a faster pace. RIising labor, freight, and raw material costs, which drove factory activity into contraction last month, contributed to these increases, according to the Caixin survey."

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.4 from 46.7 in August, pulling away from the lowest level seen since the height of the pandemic last year. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. 
The better readings in the survey, which focuses more on smaller firms in coastal regions, are in line with findings in an official survey last week which also showed the services industry returned to activity growth.
Analysts say the services sector, which was slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, is more vulnerable to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks in the country, clouding the outlook for the much anticipated rebound in consumption in the months to come. 
""In view of this, in the coming months, the government should focus on improving epidemic prevention and control and alleviating supply-side pressure,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.
""It should also find a balance among multiple objectives, such as promoting employment, holding raw material prices stable, ensuring a stable and orderly supply, and meeting targets for controlling energy consumption.""
Sub-indexes of new business, prices charged, and employment all bounced back to expansionary territory in September, although new export business shrank again, touching the lowest in seven months due to the surging pandemic overseas. 

Input prices increased for the 15th straight month in September and rose at a faster pace, driven by rising labour, freight and raw material costs, the survey found, an issue that drove factory activity into contraction last month.

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said firms were still seeking to hire in September but staff availability fell sharply again, pushing up starting salaries for permanent and temporary workers by the most in the survey's 24-year history.
REC Chief Executive Neil Carberry said competition for staff was widespread, from food processing and logistics - including the acute shortage of truck drivers which led to Britain's recent fuel supply crisis - to office-based jobs. 
""We have all seen how labour shortages have affected our everyday lives over the past few weeks, whether that's an empty petrol station or fewer goods on supermarket shelves,"" he said.

Carberry urged the government to do more to encourage business investment, relax post-Brexit immigration rules, avoid barriers to international trade and improve skills training.
The BoE has said there is a growing case for its first interest rate increase since the coronavirus pandemic struck last year with inflation expected to top 4%. It is watching measures of pay growth carefully as it gauges whether the rise in inflation prove to be transitory as it has predicted.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped by the most in three months last week, suggesting the labor market recovery was regaining momentum after a recent slowdown, as the wave of COVID-19 infections began to subside.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed the number of people on state unemployment rolls plunging to an 18-month low in late September. 
Improving labor market conditions bode well for the government's closely watched employment report for September and also provide ammunition for the Federal Reserve, which signaled last month it could begin reducing is monthly bond buying as soon as November.
""The labor market is back on track after a few weeks of rising claims threw a question mark into the markets' understanding of just how solid the economic outlook really is,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""The Fed has the evidence it needs to start paring back its emergency stimulus purchases when it meets next month."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 38,000 to a seasonally adjusted 326,000 for the week ended Oct. 2. That was the biggest drop since late June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 348,000 claims for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims, which economists say offer a better read of the labor market, tumbled 41,431 to 258,909 last week. California led the drop in claims last week. There were also decreases in Michigan, Ohio, Washington DC and Missouri. They offset notable increases in Pennsylvania and Virginia. 
Claims had increased for three straight weeks as California moved people to another program following the expiration of federal government-funded aid on Sept. 6, to allow the recipients to collect one additional week of benefits. 
There had also been increases in filings related to the idling of assembly plants in some states by automakers as they managed their supply of semiconductors amid a global shortage. 
A resurgence in COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant, also disrupted activity in the high-contact services sector. That suggested some moderation in labor market conditions in the prior weeks, which was confirmed by a separate report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers increased 14% to 17,895 in September. 
Still, layoffs were down 85% compared to September 2020.
In the third quarter, employers announced 52,560 job cuts, the fewest since the second quarter of 1997 and down 23% from the July-September period.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
SUPPLY WOES
Layoffs last month were led by companies in the healthcare/products sector, with 2,673 announced cuts. Since the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccine received full-FDA approval, many healthcare facilities have implemented vaccine mandates, which have led to the firing of non-compliant workers.
Ongoing strains in the supply chain saw industrial goods manufacturers laying off 2,328 workers in September, while warehousing businesses reported 1,936 job cuts. There were 1,679 job cuts in the services sector. 
But the rise in layoffs was dwarfed by an explosion in planned hiring, in part as retailers gear up for the holiday season. The Challenger report showed companies announced plans to hire 939,790 workers compared to only 94,004 in August.
With companies eager to hire, more people are coming off the state unemployment rolls. The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid tumbled 97,000 to 2.714 million in the week ended Sept. 25. That was the lowest level since mid-March 2020.
The total number of people collecting unemployment checks under all programs dropped to 4.172 million during the week ended Sept. 18 from 5.027 million in the prior week. That reflected the end of extended benefits last month, which economists hope will increase the labor pool.
The pandemic forced some people to drop out of work to become caregivers. Others are reluctant to return for fear of contracting the coronavirus, while some have either retired or are seeking career changes. That has left employers desperate to fill a record 10.9 million job openings as of the end of July.
The worker shortages have impacted job growth, though there is optimism that hiring picked up in September. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 500,000 jobs last month. 
Estimates range from as high as 700,000 jobs to as low as 250,000, reflecting the mixed labor market indicators in September. A survey from the Conference Board last week showed consumers' views of current labor market conditions softened. 
While the Institute for Supply Management's measure of manufacturing employment rebounded last month after contracting in August, its measure of services industry employment slipped.

The economy created 235,000 jobs in August, the fewest in seven months. The unemployment rate is forecast dipping to 5.1% in September from 5.2% in August. 
""Going forward, the combination of easing labor supply constraints, strong labor demand and an improving COVID outlook should spur further labor market progress,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) also projected record global cereal production in 2021, but said this would be outpaced by forecast consumption. 
FAO's food price index, which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 130.0 points last month, the highest reading since September 2011, according to the agency's data.
The figure compared with a revised 128.5 for August. The August figure was previously given as 127.4.
On a year-on-year basis, prices were up 32.8% in September.
Agricultural commodity prices have risen steeply in the past year, fuelled by harvest setbacks and Chinese demand.
The FAO's cereal price index http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en rose by 2.0% in September from the previous month. That was led by a near 4% increase for wheat prices, with the UN agency citing tightening export availabilities amid strong demand. [GRA/] [GRA/TEND]
""Among major cereals, wheat will be the focus in the coming weeks as demand need to be tested against fast rising prices,” FAO Senior Economist Abdolreza Abbassian said in a statement. 
World vegetable oil prices were up 1.7% on the month and showing a year-on-year rise of about 60%, as palm oil prices climbed on robust import demand and concerns over labour shortages in Malaysia, FAO said.
Palm oil futures have rallied further in early October to hit record highs as a surge in crude oil markets has lent further support to vegetable oils used in biodiesel. [POI/]
Global sugar prices rose 0.5% in September with concern over adverse crop weather in top exporter Brazil partly offset by slowing import demand and a favourable production outlook in India and Thailand, according to FAO.
For cereal production, FAO projected a record world crop of 2.800 billion tonnes in 2021, up slightly from 2.788 billion estimated a month ago. 

That would be below world cereal use of 2.811 billion tonnes, a forecast revised up by 2.7 million tonnes from a month earlier mainly to reflect increased wheat use in animal feed, FAO said in a cereal supply and demand note http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/csdb/en.
Global cereal stocks were expected to ease in 2021/22 but would still be at a comfortable level, FAO added.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German industrial output suffered its steepest drop in August since April last year, due to supply chain disruptions that are holding back growth in Europe's biggest economy and hitting the auto sector particularly hard, official data showed on Thursday.
The Federal Statistics Office said industrial output fell by 4.0% on the month after an increase of 1.3% in July. A Reuters poll had pointed to a decline in August of 0.4%.
""Manufacturers continue to report production constraints due to supply shortages of intermediate products,"" the office said in a statement.
Production of cars and car parts fell by 17.5% on the month.
German car companies are struggling to meet a post-pandemic surge in demand since the start of the year, due to a lack of microchips and other intermediate products.
Carmaker BMW said its group deliveries were down 12.2% in the third quarter, hit by the microchip crunch.
On Tuesday, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) truck boss Martin Daum said he expected the global chip shortage to continue to affect production next year.
""We will definitely deliver less than we could have sold, and that also applies to next year,"" he said, adding that it was impossible to say how big the shortfalls would be.
""It's a fight for every chip,"" he added.
Official data released on Wednesday showed German industrial orders fell more than expected in August on weaker demand from abroad following two months of unusually strong gains due to major contracts.
However, the Munich-based Ifo economic institute said separately that its survey of production expectations rose in September.
""Order books are still full, only materials bottlenecks are causing problems at the moment and dampening production plans somewhat,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank, said ""if the flow of materials gets going again, the conditions are in place for a strong upturn in industrial activity.""
Carsten Brzeski, at ING, said that for now it looked like that upturn would ""come rather later than sooner.""

Separately, prices for newly built residential buildings rose by 12.6% on the year in August, their biggest rise since November 1970. German consumer prices rose by rose by 4.1% year-on-year last month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in September as COVID-19 infections started subsiding, boosting hiring at restaurants and other high-contact businesses.
The ADP National Employment Report released on Wednesday supported expectations that job growth picked up last month, though it has a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched employment report.
September's employment report due on Friday will garner more attention after the Federal Reserve signaled last month that it would likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November. Fed Chair Jerome Powell believes the economy is one ""decent"" monthly employment report short of meeting the U.S. central bank's threshold for tapering its bond buying program.
""It looks like the gain in employment will qualify as 'decent',"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that the first estimate from the ADP is not a particularly good predictor of official payrolls."" 
Private payrolls increased by 568,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment Report showed. Data for August was revised lower to show 340,000 jobs added instead of the initially reported 374,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 428,000 jobs.
Employment gains averaged 410,000 jobs in the third quarter, a slowdown compared to the second-quarter average of 748,000. Last month, the leisure and hospitality industry added 226,000 jobs after creating 155,000 positions in August. 
Manufacturing payrolls increased by 49,000 jobs, while hiring at construction sites also rose by 49,000. Job gains in other sectors were modest. Large firms accounted for the bulk of job creation, followed by medium-sized companies. Small business hiring climbed by 63,000 jobs after rising 61,000 in August. 
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. It has a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employment report because of methodology differences.
Stocks on Wall Street fell as the ADP report fanned fears that the Fed could tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.

MORTGAGE RATES RISING
Expectations that the Fed will soon start to withdrew some of the monetary support to the economy have boosted mortgage rates, hurting refinancing activity and demand for home purchase loans. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed mortgage applications dropped 6.9% last week from the prior week.
Refinance applications tumbled 9.6% from the previous week and were down 16% from a year ago. Applications for loans to buy a home dropped 1.7% from a week ago. The 30-year mortgage fixed rate rose four basis points to 3.14% last week, the highest since July. 
Graphic: MBA, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/zgpombqmrpd/mba.png 
The pick-up in private payrolls suggests the economic expansion remains on track even as gross domestic product growth appears to have slowed sharply in the third quarter because of the resurgence in COVID-19 infections in summer and relentless shortages that have undercut motor vehicle sales.
The Atlanta Fed is predicting that GDP growth braked to a 1.3% annualized rate in the July-September quarter. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. 
""Stronger job growth in September could indicate that the drag on hiring from the recent increase in coronavirus cases is fading,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 473,000 jobs in September. The economy created 235,000 jobs in August, the fewest in seven months. Estimates range from as high as 700,000 jobs to as low as 250,000. The unemployment rate is forecast dipping to 5.1% from 5.2% in August.
But labor market indicators were mixed in September. A survey from the Conference Board last week showed consumers' views of current labor market conditions softened. 
The number of people on state unemployment rolls fell in mid-September relative to mid-August. The Institute for Supply Management's measure of manufacturing employment rebounded last month after contracting in August. But the ISM's gauge of services industry employment slipped, with businesses reporting that ""labor shortages (were) experienced at all levels.""

The economy is experiencing an acute shortage of labor as the pandemic forced some people to drop out of work to become caregivers. Others are reluctant to return for fear of contracting the virus, while some have either retired or are seeking career changes. 
There were a record 10.9 million job openings at the end of July. Economists are cautiously optimistic that the labor crunch will start easing in the fall and through winter after the expiration in September of federal government-funded unemployment benefits, which businesses and Republicans blamed for the worker shortage.

MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Automotive production in Brazil and Mexico, Latin America's two largest economies, plummeted in September, dragged down by an industry-wide semiconductor chip shortage and railroad blockades in Mexico, data showed on Wednesday.
Brazilian auto production was down 21.3% to 173,287 units in September from the same month in 2020, when the industry was scrambling to resume production from a coronavirus-induced shutdown, Brazilian automakers association Anfavea said.
In Mexico, auto output plunged 33.30% from September 2020 to 208,092 vehicles, while auto exports fell by 24.18% to 195,294 units, data from national statistics agency INEGI showed.
""All of this is due to the shortage of semiconductors, which at this point is affecting all levels of production for all participants in the domestic market,"" said the head of the Mexican Automotive Industry Association (AMIA), Fausto Cuevas.
A semiconductor chip shortage is causing major auto production cuts around the globe and auto industry officials have warned the problem is getting worse.
In the latest fallout from the chip shortfall, Japanese automaker Nissan (OTC:NSANY) told Reuters it plans to carry out temporary stoppages at two Mexican plants for several days in October due to adjustments needed to manage the situation.
AMIA's Cuevas forecast Mexican automotive exports would decline between 3.8% and 4.2% this year from 2020 and projected production to fall by between 4.7% and 5%, saying Mexico's auto industry would only return to pre-pandemic levels in 2024.
A senior executive at Mexico's Automobile Distributors Association (AMDA) said analysts were forecasting that supply and demand for semiconductor chips would be in balance around the second quarter of 2022.
Compounding carmakers' woes in Mexico have been 86 days of railroad blockades as of Oct. 5 in the western state of Michoacan, home to the key port of Lazaro Cardenas, according to analysis by Grupo Financiero BASE.
Automakers in Brazil lowered projections for sales, output and exports this year, blaming a shortage of parts and a slow economic recovery.

Anfavea, which represents global carmakers such as General Motors (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Fiat in Brazil, now expects sales of new automobiles in Brazil to either fall by 1% or rise by no more than 3% this year. In July, the association had forecast 13% sales growth from 2020.
Vehicle sales in Brazil fell 10.2% in September from August to 155,075 units, according to Anfavea. Still, automotive output in Brazil did rise 5.6% in September from August.

Retail sales, a proxy for consumer demand, in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.3% month-on-month in August and were unchanged from a year earlier, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.8% monthly gain and a 0.4% year-on-year increase.

Eurostat said food, drinks and tobacco sales fell 1.7% month-on-month and by 1.9% year-on-year, holding back the overall index even though sales via mail order and internet shot up.

The figures published by the Federal Statistics Office showed orders for goods 'Made in Germany' were down by 7.7% on the month in seasonally adjusted terms. A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a drop of 2.1% on the month.
German car companies are struggling to meet a post-pandemic surge in demand since the start of the year due to a lack of microchips and other intermediate products which is holding back the recovery of Europe's largest economy.
The steep drop on the month was partly caused by previous orders for planes, ships and other large vehicles which had pushed up orders by 4.9% in July and 4.6% in June, the office said.
Without this distorting effect, industrial orders were down by 5.1% in August.
Another reason for the weaker-than-expected headline figure was lower demand from abroad, especially from clients outside the euro zone area.
The economy ministry also pointed to an unusually strong decline in orders for cars which it partly linked to special holiday effects in some regions with large automobile factories.
Nonetheless, overall industrial orders remained at a historically high level and were already 8.5% above their pre-crisis levels of February 2020, the month before Germany was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ministry said.
""The result is a shock at first glance, but given the overall high level, it hurts less than in normal times,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said.

The main problem in German manufacturing is still the lack of semiconductors and other intermediate products as the supply chain problems still prevent orders from being processed.
""Order cancellations will therefore tend to increase. With no easing of the supply bottlenecks in sight, industry will continue to suffer,"" Krueger added. ""Industry will continue to be a drag on growth in the fourth quarter.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity nudged up in September, but growth is being restrained by a persistent shortage of inputs and the resulting high prices as the pandemic drags on.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Tuesday reported that ""ongoing challenges with labor resources, logistics, and materials are affecting the continuity of supply."" Hopes for an easing in the supply chain bottlenecks were dashed by a resurgence in COVID-19 infections over summer, driven by the Delta variant. Ports in China and the United States are also experiencing congestion. 
""We don't expect supply-side constraints to start easing meaningfully until mid-2022,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Solid demand and less Covid wariness will keep services growing, but the expansion will be capped by the supply side's limited ability to meet demand.""
The ISM's non-manufacturing activity index edged up to a reading of 61.9 last month from 61.7 in August. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 60.
Seventeen services industries, including retail trade, public administration as well as finance and insurance reported growth. Only agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting saw a decline in activity. 
Accommodation and food services businesses reported increased transportation bottlenecks, which were ""resulting in longer lead times and missed appointments."" Transportation and warehousing businesses said ""demand far outweighs supply for goods and services."" 
In the public administration industry, businesses complained about rising costs for both supply and service inputs, which they said ""have the potential to significantly impact our operations through the end of the year, especially if seasonal trends prove exceptionally strong."" 
Spending is shifting from goods to services like travel and other high-contact activities as the economy normalizes after being severely disrupted by the pandemic, thanks to vaccinations against the coronavirus.
The survey's measure of new orders received by services businesses inched up to 63.5 last month from a reading of 63.2 in August. Its gauge of supplier deliveries dipped to a reading of 68.8 last month from 69.6 in August. A reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. With supply still tight, prices remained high. A measure of prices paid by services industries rose to 77.5 from a reading of 75.4 in August.
That mirrored the findings of the ISM's manufacturing survey published last Friday and suggested that high inflation could persist through 2022. The Federal Reserve last month raised its projection for its key inflation measure to 3.7% this year. That was up from the 3.0% projected in June. 
The personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 3.6% year-on-year in August - well above the U.S. central bank's flexible 2% inflation target.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

SLOWER GROWTH
But even as the services industry pushes ahead, evidence is mounting that economic growth slowed significantly in the third quarter. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed the trade deficit surged 4.2% to a record $73.3 billion in August. Economists had forecast the trade gap widening to $70.5 billion. 
Trade balance https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/akvezqbqxpr/tradebal.png 
The report followed on the heels of government data last Friday showing high inflation sharply cutting into consumer spending in July, with a moderate rebound in August. 
Following the trade data, the Atlanta Fed cut its third-quarter gross domestic product estimate to a 1.3% annualized rate from a 2.3% pace.
The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. Trade has subtracted from GDP growth for four straight quarters. 
Imports shot up 1.4% to a record high $287.0 billion, led by consumer goods such as pharmaceutical preparations, toys, games and sporting goods. There was also a rise in imports of industrial supplies and materials. 
But a global shortage of semiconductors which is hampering production at auto plants resulted in imports of motor vehicles, parts and engines decreasing $1.5 billion. 
The rise in imports, mostly the result of businesses rebuilding depleted inventories, suggests an apparent slowdown in consumer spending last quarter was probably temporary.
""There is a huge backlog of foreign-made consumer goods waiting to get into the U.S. supply chain, on ships waiting to be unloaded at U.S. ports, at foreign ports waiting to get onto those ships, and at foreign factories waiting to get to port,"" said Bill Adams, a senior economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""That will keep goods imports high through at least November.""
Exports gained 0.5% to $213.7 billion in August, the highest since May 2019, lifted by industrial supplies and materials such as nonmonetary gold and natural gas. But motor vehicles exports fell as did capital goods like civilian aircraft and industrial machinery.
Persistent shortages saw a build-up of unfinished work at services industries in September. Companies continued to hire more workers, though the pace slowed a bit from August, likely reflecting difficulties finding workers. 
Companies complained about ""employee flight to better-paying jobs and lack of a pipeline to replace."" The ISM survey also found that ""labor shortages (were) experienced at all levels."" 

The survey's measure of services industry employment dipped to a reading of 53.0 last month from 53.7 in August.
There is an acute shortage of labor as the pandemic forced some people to drop out of work to become caregivers. Others are reluctant to return for fear of contracting the virus, while some have either retired or are seeking career changes. There were a record 10.9 million job openings at the end of July.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's trade surplus with the world widened in August, easily beating analyst expectations, as strong exports of energy products outweighed a drop a two-way trade for motor vehicles and parts, data showed on Tuesday.
The country's trade surplus was C$1.94 billion ($1.54 billion) in August, well ahead of the average analyst estimate of a surplus of C$430 million and up from a surplus of C$736 million in July. 
Exports rose 0.8%, led by energy products - which rose to their highest level since March 2014 - and metal and non-metallic mineral products, which outweighed a drop in motor vehicle and parts exports.
Imports, meanwhile, fell by 1.4%, mostly on a decline in motor vehicle and parts imports.
""As we expected, the global chip shortage continued to impact production in that (motor vehicle) sector,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, in a note.
""The fact that the wider-than-expected surplus was largely the result of more weakness in goods imports than anticipated will likely blunt any impacts from the data on the Canadian dollar,"" he added.

WASHINGTON(Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity nudged up in September, but growth is being restrained by a persistent shortage of inputs and the resulting high prices as the pandemic drags on.
The Institute for Supply Management said on Tuesday its non-manufacturing activity index edged up to a reading of 61.9 last month from 61.7 in August. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 60. A resurgence in COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant, has delayed an anticipated upswing in demand for services like travel and other high-contact activities.

The survey's measure of new orders received by services businesses inched up to 63.5 last month from a reading of 63.2 in August. 
Like other segments of the economy, the services sector is grappling with shortages of raw materials and labor. There are little signs that these headwinds will recede anytime soon.
The ISM survey's measure of supplier deliveries dipped to a reading of 68.8 last month from 69.6 in August. A reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. With supply still tight, prices remained high. A measure of prices paid by services industries rose to 77.5 from a reading of 75.4 in August.
That mirrored the findings of the ISM's manufacturing survey published last week Friday and suggested that high inflation could persist through the end of the year. The Federal Reserve last month raised its projection for its key inflation measure to 3.7% this year. That was up from the 3.0% projected in June. 
The personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 3.6% year-on-year in August - well above the U.S. central bank's flexible 2% inflation target.
There was a steady build-up of unfinished work at services industries last month. Companies continued to hire more workers, though the pace slowed a bit from August. That likely reflects difficulties finding workers. 
The economy is experiencing an acute shortage of labor as the pandemic forced some people to drop out of work to become caregivers. Others are reluctant to return for fear of contracting the virus, while some have either retired or are seeking career changes. 

There were a record 10.9 million job openings at the end of July. The ISM survey's measure of services industry employment dipped to a reading of 53.0 last month from 53.7 in August.
Economists are cautiously optimistic that the labor crunch will start easing in the fall and through winter following the expiration in September of federal government-funded unemployment benefits, which businesses and Republicans blamed for the worker shortage.

LONDON (Reuters) -Business growth across Europe remained strong last month but elevated inflationary pressures put a dent in demand while ongoing supply issues constrained activity, issues which are likely to continue, a survey showed on Tuesday. 
Although many restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic have now been lifted in the region, firms are suffering from shortages of staff, raw materials and transport.
HIS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, sank to 56.2 last month from August's 59.0, although still well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction and just above a 56.1 ""flash"" estimate.
On Friday, a euro zone manufacturing PMI showed growth remained robust in September but activity suffered from supply chain bottlenecks, and the bloc's dominant service industry also saw the pace of expansion slow.
A PMI for the services sector fell to 56.4 from 59.0, its lowest since May, while the new business index dropped to 55.3 from 57.9.
""Today's data confirm the services sector remains on the path of recovery, but the pace of expansion softened. Despite the momentum remaining solid, inflationary pressures and supply-side disruptions weigh on the outlook,"" said Maddalena Martini at Oxford Economics.
""Looking forward, we see these downside risks to remain towards the end of 2021.""
Demand fell to a five-month low as firms passed on part of rising input costs, which rose at a record pace, to consumers. The composite output prices index rose to 59.1 from 58.3, not far from survey highs set in the summer months.
Activity in Germany's services industry continued to grow strongly in September, but the recovery from the pandemic lost momentum as catch-up effects waned and more companies were affected by supply bottlenecks.

In France, services growth slipped as inflationary pressures and COVID-19 protocols had an impact on businesses. Italian and Spanish services growth also slowed.
Meanwhile, in Britain - outside the currency union - the post-lockdown economic recovery avoided losing further momentum last month but companies increased prices at the fastest pace on record, adding to signs of rising inflation. [GB/PMIS]

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the auto industry continued to be plagued by a global shortage of semiconductors used in the production of cars.
""This is a desperately disappointing September and further evidence of the ongoing impact of the Covid pandemic on the sector,"" said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes.
With widespread panic-buying at the petrol pumps late last month caused by a shortage of goods vehicle drivers, the SMMT said more than 32,000 battery-powered cars were registered last month - a new record.

Hawes said a massive investment in public recharging facilities was needed to keep pace with consumer demand for electric cars.
British licence plates denote the age of a vehicle and update every March and September - meaning these are usually bumper months for car registrations as buyers like to show they have the newest model.

435,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The prices paid by customers in the U.K. services sector rose at the fastest pace on record last month as the nation’s supply-chain crisis accelerated inflationary pressures in the economy. 
With energy prices spiraling and a shortage of staff in haulage, agriculture and meat processing causing significant disruption, U.K. firms have been forced to pass the rapid rises in costs to consumers, according to a survey by IHS Markit. 
That resulted in the fastest increase in prices charged since the survey began in 1996. Worse may be to come, with the figures not fully reflecting the full impact of the U.K.’s fuel crisis at the end of September. 
Markit’s report is the latest to highlight how supply-chain issues are increasingly filtering through to consumers, exacerbating a looming cost of living crisis this winter. It could also be a warning sign for Bank of England policy makers, who already expect inflation to reach more than 4% by the end of this year, and are poised to tighten policy should price rises become entrenched. 
”Tight constraints on business capacity and rampant supply chain uncertainty meant that service providers have become more willing to pass on higher costs to customers,” said Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit.
Many businesses are “reporting more frequent reviews of pricing due to escalating cost increases by suppliers,” he said 
The supply constraints also pulled down the pace of growth within the U.K.’s dominant services sector, with Markit saying supply-chain shortages were increasingly leading to lost business opportunities.
New orders rose at the slowest pace since the winter lockdown. The firm’s index of growth in the industry stood at 55.4 last month, slightly above an earlier estimate but well below the recent peak of 62.9 seen in May.

The final reading of the IHS Markit/CIPS composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which combines Britain's services and manufacturing sectors, edged up to 54.9 from 54.8 in August, the first time it did not fall since May.
The reading was also higher than the preliminary estimate for September of 54.1.
While the figure represented strong overall growth for companies, shortages of staff, raw materials and transport led to the slowest growth in new orders since shortly before the lifting of coronavirus lockdowns in early 2021.
Some companies said the scheduled end on Sept. 30 of a tax break for home-buyers contributed to the slowdown in new orders.
Backlogs of work grew as firms struggled to fill their vacancies and a slowdown in job creation from a record high in August reflected some redundancies ahead of the expiry of the government's furlough scheme at the end of the month. 
Companies raised the prices they charged at the fastest pace since the composite index was launched in 1999. Input costs also rose sharply for services firms but they grew more slowly for manufacturers.

The Bank of England is watching closely for any signs that the recent rise in inflation might prove longer-lasting than it has predicted. Last month the BoE said the case for an interest rate hike had strengthened as inflation pressure mounted.
IHS Markit said the data had yet to fully reflect the inflationary impact of Britain's fuel crisis and surging energy prices at the end of the month.

IHS Markit's final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the services sector fell to 56.2 from 60.8 in August, still well above the 50 threshold which separates growth from contraction and a bit better than a flash reading of 56.0. 
IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said the survey suggested Germany was heading towards a more moderate period of economic growth in the final months of the year.
""Our current forecasts are for a 3.0% quarter-on-quarter rise in GDP in Q3, followed by a 1.2% gain in Q4,"" Smith said.
The German economy shrank by 2.0% quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of the year and then expanded by 1.6% quarter-on-quarter in the three months from April to June.
The composite PMI index, which comprises both the services and manufacturing sectors, eased to 55.5 from 60.0 in August, reflecting the continued recovery of the manufacturing sector. The reading was better than a flash figure of 55.3.

""The loss of momentum is partly natural as activity gets closer to pre-pandemic levels,"" Smith said, adding that the drag on growth from materials shortages was also becoming more noticeable, impacting services firms directly and also via a slowdown in manufacturing.
Coupled with inflationary pressures, the threat of further spillover effects to other parts of the economy is dampening service providers' growth expectations, Smith said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's trade surplus unexpectedly grew to a record in August as strength in liquefied natural gas and coal exports more than offset a pullback in iron ore prices, a windfall to mining profits and tax receipts. 
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Tuesday showed the surplus on international trade jumped to A$15.1 billion ($11.0 billion) in August, from A$12.7 billion the month before. That was the highest on record and confounded analysts' forecasts of a drop to A$10.3 billion.
Exports climbed 4.1% in the month to A$48.5 billion led by LNG, hard coking coal and thermal coal, courtesy of strong energy demand in Asia. Both prices and volumes were higher, eclipsing a sharp fall in prices for iron ore, Australia's number one export earner.
Demand for energy in Asia has only got hotter as shortages of electricity in China led to blackouts and countries compete for LNG and coal shipments ahead of winter.
Australian goods exports to China alone stood at A$18.6 billion in August, up 55% on a year earlier and showing little impact from ongoing trade and political tensions with Beijing. 
Imports fell 1.5% in August to A$33.4 billion, with the drop mainly in capital goods while consumption good imports were led higher by cars.
Trade in services remains around half of pre-pandemic levels with Australia's international borders still shut to tourists and students.

The ABS said that due to problems with sourcing reliable data on services it would stop reporting the figures from January, while seeking means to improve the statistics.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand business confidence dropped in the third quarter as the latest COVID-19 lockdown in the country hurt sentiment, a private think tank said on Tuesday.
A net 11% of firms surveyed expected general business conditions to deteriorate, compared with a net 7.0% positive reading in the previous quarter, the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research's (NZIER) quarterly survey of business opinion (QSBO) showed.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, 8% expected business conditions to worsen, versus 9.0% expecting an improvement in the previous period. The survey's measure of capacity utilisation was 96.1%, from the previous quarter's 94.9%.
Demand was still holding up, but the negative impact of the current COVID-19 community outbreak had affected business confidence, NZIER said in its report.
New Zealand's biggest city, Auckland, continues to be in lockdown since the highly infectious Delta variant of COVID-19 entered the country in mid-August. Some restrictions will be eased from Wednesday.
""Uncertainty over how the latest outbreak will evolve and how much longer containment restrictions will remain in place looks to have dented confidence and led to more caution amongst businesses towards investment,"" the report said.

The business outlook data comes ahead of an interest rate decision by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) on Wednesday. 
The central bank is widely expected to hike rates for the first time in seven years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods accelerated in August, pointing to sustained strength in manufacturing even as economic growth appeared to have slowed in the third quarter because of shortages of raw materials and labor.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that factory orders increased 1.2% in August. Data for July was revised higher to show orders rising 0.7% instead of gaining 0.4% as previously reported. Orders have now increased for four straight months. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders gaining 1.0%. Orders shot up 18.0% on a year-on-year basis.
""Factory orders continue to climb, a good sign for manufacturing,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""However, manufacturing is still being tested by the global supply-chain issues.""
Shortages held back shipments of factory goods, which barely registered a 0.1% gain in August after advancing 1.5% in July.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the economy, is being driven by still-strong demand for goods despite spending shifting back to services. Businesses are rebuilding inventories, which were depleted in the first half. 
An Institute for Supply Management survey last week showed manufacturing activity steadily expanding in September, but noted that ""companies and suppliers continue to deal with an unprecedented number of hurdles to meet increasing demand.""
According to the survey all industries were ""impacted by record-long raw materials lead times, continued shortages of critical materials, rising commodities prices and difficulties in transporting products.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
SLOWER GDP GROWTH
Input shortages and the resulting high prices, worsened by the latest wave of COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant, likely caused a sharp slowdown in gross domestic product growth in the third quarter. 
Data last Friday showed high inflation sharply cutting into consumer spending in July, with a moderate rebound in August. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP growth braking to a 2.3% annualized rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. 
The increase in factory goods orders in August was led by computers and electronic products, fabricated metal products, transportation equipment as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components. But there were decreases in machinery and primary metals orders.
With shipments barely rising, inventories at factories rose 0.6% in August after a similar gain in July. Unfilled orders at factories jumped 1.0% after rising 0.5% in July.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, gained 0.6% in August instead of advancing 0.5% as reported last month. Momentum has, however, slowed in recent months.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, rose 0.8%. Core capital goods shipments were previously reported to have increased 0.7% in August.

Business spending on equipment was robust in the second quarter, notching the fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth. That contributed to hoisting the level of GDP well above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
""Incorporating data from the factory goods report and other related measures, we continue to believe that real equipment spending fell noticeably in the third quarter and that the real change in business inventories was close to zero that quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

Tax revenues have proven more resilient than many forecast during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the reopening of almost every part of the economy from a third lockdown in recent months has led to a sharp rise in most categories.
VAT receipts, which are collected every second month, were 13.7% ahead of target for the month of September, a similar level to July when the hospitality sector opened again. That brought the cumulative VAT total for the year to date to 7.7% above forecast.
The amount of VAT collected so far this year is also 1% higher than in the first nine months of 2019, before the pandemic struck.
Corporate tax returns, which are mostly collected from the country's large multinational sector and have more than doubled to record levels since 2014, were 14.8% or 1 billion euros ahead of expectations at the end of September. 
The largest category, income tax, was 0.8% ahead of target.
With spending 3.2% below forecast, the exchequer recorded a lower deficit of 9.2 billion euros on a 12-month rolling basis.

The government is likely to run a lower budget deficit this year than the 5.1% of gross domestic product it forecast in July, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe indicated last week.

WASHINGTON(Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending surged in August, but outlays adjusted for inflation were weaker than initially thought in the prior month, reinforcing expectations that economic growth slowed in the third quarter as COVID-19 infections flared up.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday, which showed inflation remaining hot in August, raised the risk of consumer spending stalling in the third quarter, even if spending accelerates further in September. Inflation-adjusted, or the so-called real consumer spending is what goes into the calculation of gross domestic product. 
""Third quarter consumer spending is on track for only a scant gain,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""If COVID cases keep falling and sentiment turns positive, there is scope for a more solid finish to this tumultuous year."" 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rebounded 0.8% in August. Data for July was revised down to show spending dipping 0.1% instead of gaining 0.3% as previously reported. 
Consumption was boosted by a 1.2% rise in purchases of goods, reflecting increases in spending on food and household supplies as well as recreational items, which offset a drop in motor vehicle outlays. A global shortage of semiconductors is undercutting the production of automobiles. 
Goods spending fell 2.1% in July. Spending on services rose 0.6% in August, supported by housing, utilities and health care. Services, which account for the bulk of consumer spending, increased 1.1% in July. Spending is shifting back to services from goods, but the resurgence in coronavirus cases, driven by the Delta variant, crimped demand for air travel, hotel accommodation and sales at restaurants and bars.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.6% in August. 
Inflation maintained its upward trend in August, though price pressures have probably peaked. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, climbed 0.3% after increasing by the same margin in July. In the 12 months through August, the so-called core PCE price index increased 3.6%, matching July's gain. 
The core PCE price index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target. The U.S. central bank last week upgraded its core PCE inflation projection for this year to 3.7% from 3.0% back in June. 
The Fed said it would likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November and signaled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has maintained that high inflation is transitory, told lawmakers on Thursday that he anticipated some relief in the months ahead. 
Still, inflation could remain high for a while. A survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Friday showed manufacturers experienced longer delays getting raw materials delivered to factories and paid higher prices for inputs in September. 
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
SLOWING GROWTH
High inflation is cutting into spending. Real consumer spending rose 0.4% in August following a downwardly revised 0.5% drop in July. With the August and July data in hand, economists predicted that growth in consumer spending would probably brake to around a 1% annualized rate in the third quarter. 
Consumer spending grew at a robust 12.0% rate in the April-June quarter, accounting for much of the economy's 6.7% growth pace. The level of GDP is now above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
The Atlanta Fed cut its GDP estimate for the quarter to a 2.3% rate from a 3.2% pace. Slower growth was reinforced by a third report from the Commerce Department showing construction spending flat in August.
""Even with the softening growth picture, we continue to expect the Fed to announce the start of tapering at the early November meeting,"" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The economy remains supported by record corporate profits. Households accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic. Coronavirus infections are trending down, which is already leading to a rise in demand for travel and other high-contact services. Businesses need to replenish depleted inventories, which will keep factories humming.
A fourth report from the University of Michigan showed consumer sentiment ticked higher for the first time in three months in September. But a survey from the Conference Board this week showed consumer confidence dropping to a seven-month low in September.
Though personal income gained only 0.2% in August after rising 1.1% in July as an increase in Child Tax Credit payments from the government was offset by decreases in unemployment insurance checks related to the pandemic, wages are rising as companies compete for scarce workers. Wages rose 0.5% in August, which should help to keep spending supported. 

With inflation high, real disposable income dropped 0.3% after increasing 0.7% in July. The saving rate fell to a still-high 9.4% from 10.1% in July.
""Households still have plenty left in the tank given rising employment and wages, soaring net worth and massive excess savings,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""However, rising prices are eating into spending power, compounding the ongoing lack of supply.""

446,"<span>Oct 01, 2021 10:10AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity picked up further in September, but factories experienced longer delays getting raw materials delivered and paid higher prices for inputs. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Friday its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 61.1 last month from 59.9 in August. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 59.6.
Some of the surprise rise in the ISM index, however, was due to a jump in the survey's measure of supplier deliveries to a reading of 73.4 last month from 69.5 in August. 
A reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries, but a lengthening in suppliers' delivery times is normally associated with a strong economy and increased customer demand, which would be a positive contribution to the ISM index. But in this case slower supplier deliveries indicate persistent supply shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
That was underscored by a rebound in the survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers to a reading of 81.2 from an eight-month low of 79.4 in August. The Federal Reserve last week raised its projection for its key inflation measure to 3.7% this year. That was up from a median of 3.0% projected back in June. The U.S. central bank has a flexible 2% inflation target. 
Aside from the technical lift from the supplier deliveries measure, manufacturing is strong. 
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index held at a reading of 66.7 last month. Manufacturing is being underpinned by businesses desperate to rebuild stocks after inventories were depleted in the first half of the year. 
The survey's measure of customer inventories remained in contraction territory in September. 

A gauge of factory employment rebounded last month after falling in August to its lowest level since November. That suggests manufacturing payrolls growth likely picked up in September after slowing in the prior month. 
The Labor Department is scheduled to issue its closely watched employment report next Friday.

Canada continues to battle a Delta-driven fourth wave of coronavirus infections, while pandemic restrictions have contributed to bottlenecks globally.
""Material scarcity led to higher prices, shipping delays, and subsequent increases in incomplete work,"" Patel said. ""Anecdotal evidence suggests firms sought to clear their backlogs but a lack of skilled workers hindered productivity.""

The measure of outstanding business accumulated matched the series high from June 2018, rising to 56.6 from 55.6 in August, while the indexes for input prices and output prices climbed to the highest levels on record.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - Indian utilities are scrambling to secure coal supplies as inventories hit critical lows after a surge in power demand from industries and sluggish imports due to record global prices push power plants to the brink.
Over half of India's 135 coal-fired power plants have fuel stocks of less than three days, government data shows, far short of federal guidelines recommending supplies of at least two weeks. 
(Graphic: India's coal shortage crisis https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-COAL/SHORTAGE/zdvxoddbapx/chart_eikon.jpg) 
Prices of power-generation fuels are surging globally as electricity demand rebounds with industrial growth, tightening supplies of coal and liquefied natural gas.
India is competing against buyers such as China, the world's largest coal consumer, which is under pressure to ramp up imports amid a severe power crunch.
Rising oil, gas, coal and power prices are feeding inflationary pressures worldwide and slowing the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The supply crunch is expected to persist, with the non-power sector facing the heat as imports remain the only option to meet demand but at rising costs,"" ratings agency S&P's unit CRISIL said in a report this week, adding it expected Asian coal prices to continue to increase. 
""Coal inventory at (Indian) thermal plants will improve only gradually by next March.""
Indian power producers locked in long-term agreements with distribution utilities cannot pass on higher input costs unless a clause to pass on such expenses is written into the contract.
Traders and officials at utilities said buying by power plants dependent of imported coal had been muted due to high prices. 
India's average weekly coal imports during August through late September - when global coal prices rallied over 40% to all-time highs - dropped by over 30% from the average for the first seven months of the year, according to data compiled by Kplr.
The import total for the most recent week was under 1.5 million tonnes, the smallest in at least two years. 
(Graphic: India coal imports by supplier - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gdpzyqlqrvw/IndiaCoalImportsbySupplier.png) 
Websites of major coal importing state utilities did not show any new tenders seeking new cargoes this month. 
Coal prices from major exporters have scaled all-time highs recently, with Australia's Newcastle prices rising roughly 50% and Indonesian export prices up 30% in the last three months.
The September Indonesia coal price benchmark was as much as seven times higher than similar quality fuel sold by Coal India to Indian utilities, according to Reuters calculations. 
""Traders who bought coal from Coal India in the spot auctions are making a killing. They are selling at 50-100% premiums,"" said a senior official in charge of sourcing coal at a large Indian utility operator.
State-run Coal India said this week higher global prices of coal and freight rates have pushed utilities dependent on imported coal to curtail power production, resulting in higher dependence on domestic coal-fired plants.
India is the world's second largest importer of coal despite having the fourth largest reserves. Utilities make up about three-fourths of its overall consumption, with Coal India accounting for over 80% of the country's production.
INDUSTRIAL POWER DEMAND SURGE
India's power plants are also grappling with surging demand from industries as economic activity rebounds from the latest wave of COVID-19 pandemic.
Power consumption in industrialised states including Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu grew between 13.9% and 21% in the three months ended September, a Reuters analysis of data from federal grid regulator POSOCO showed.
The three states account for nearly a third of India's annual electricity consumption. Industries and offices account for half the country's annual electricity consumption. During the last two quarters of the fiscal year ending March 2021, the residential and agricultural sectors were key drivers of power consumption after the first wave of coronavirus.

""This year we have seen a tremendous growth in industrial demand,"" said Shahmeena Husain, Managing Director of Gujarat's electricity regulator told Reuters.
While there have not been any large scale power outages in India, deficits have increased nearly four-fold from the negligible levels recorded last year, POSOCO data showed. 
The shortages have so far been mostly restricted to northern states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Kashmir, the data showed.

    ""Domestic consumption increased by about 10% in the last two years because of work from home and air conditioning,"" a senior Tamil Nadu government official told Reuters.
    ""Following opening up of industries after the second wave, industries are king,"" the official said.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's palm oil imports in September more than doubled from a year ago to a record 1.4 million tonnes as buyers increased purchases of refined palm oil ahead of key festivals and to take advantage of newly lowered duties, brokers and dealers said.
Higher purchases by India, the world's biggest buyer of vegetable oils, could support palm oil prices that are trading near a record high hit earlier this week.
The country's total vegetable oil imports in September jumped 72% from a year ago to a record 1.8 million tonnes, including more than 400,000 tonnes of refined palm oil, Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive of Sunvin Group, a vegetable oil broker, said.
""Imports jumped because of government decision to lower import tax and festive season demand,"" said Bajoria.
India lifted restrictions on imports of refined palm oil and slashed base import taxes on palm oil, soyoil and sunflower oil in recent months as New Delhi tries to cool near-record price rises.
Edible oil consumption usually jumps in the December quarter with the start of the wedding season as well as festivals like Dhanteras and Diwali.
Top palm oil producer Indonesia supplied a big chunk of India's palm oil imports in September as it was offering refined palm oil at a discount to number two supplier Malaysia, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm.
Usually soybean oil expands its share of India's edible oil market from October as freshly harvest soybean supplies get processed, the dealer said.
""This year, excessive rainfall in September has delayed soybean harvesting. Besides, demand for local soymeal is weak since imported soymeal is available at lower prices,"" he said.
New Delhi in August allowed imports of 1.2 million tonnes of genetically modified (GM) soymeal for the first time to help the poultry industry after soymeal prices tripled in a year to a record high.
Sunflower oil imports in September surged 154% from a year ago 170,000 tonnes, while soyoil imports fell to 250,000 tonnes from 316,232 tonnes a year ago, dealers said.
The Solvent Extractors' Association of India, a Mumbai-based trade body, is likely to publish import number for September in mid-October.

India could import 1.2 to 1.3 million tonnes of vegetable oil in October and from November imports could moderate to 1 to 1.1 million tonnes, said another Mumbai-based dealer.
Demand from hotels, restaurants have been improving as people are stepping out with a drop in new coronavirus infections, the dealer said.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) -Global manufacturing activity took a big hit from supply chain bottlenecks and escalating costs, exacerbated by pandemic-induced factory shutdowns in Asia and signs of slowing Chinese growth, surveys showed on Friday.
While countries where outbreaks of the Delta coronavirus variant receded saw an improvement in activity, growth shrank in some as chip shortages and supply disruptions impacted those still struggling to shake off the hit from COVID-19.
Euro zone and British manufacturing growth remained strong but activity suffered from logistical issues, product shortages and a labour crunch that are likely to persist and keep inflationary pressures high.
""Though some of the bottlenecks should soon start to ease, many sectors – most notably those requiring semiconductors – are likely to face disruption for much of 2022,"" said Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. 
""This signals activity is likely to remain constrained for some time to come.""
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) sank to 58.6 in September from August's 61.4 and Britain's PMI fell for a fourth month in a row, dropping to 57.1 from 60.3. Anything above 50 indicates growth. [EUR/PMIM][GB/PMIM]
Factories in Germany, Europe's largest economy, had been humming along almost undisturbed during the pandemic lockdowns that have impacted the services sector but shortages of intermediate goods and some raw materials are now holding industry back.
Growth in French manufacturing weakened a tad more than initially forecast, its PMI showed, as problems over supplies of goods weighed on the industry.
Those supply bottlenecks kept pressure on the costs of the raw materials factories need and manufacturers passed some of those increases to customers and the euro zone output prices index approached the record high seen in the summer.
Inflation in the common currency area jumped to a 13-year high of 3.4% last month, preliminary official data showed on Friday, well above the European Central Bank's 2.0% target.

ASIAN STRAIN
China's waning economic momentum dealt a fresh blow to the region's growth prospects, with the official PMI on Thursday showing the country's factory activity unexpectedly shrank in September due to wider curbs on electricity use.
Although the private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI fared better than expected after slumping in August, growing signs of weakness in the world's second-largest economy are clouding the outlook for neighbouring countries.
""While coronavirus curbs on economic activity may be gradually lifted, the slow pace at which this will happen means Southeast Asian economies will stagnate for the rest of this year,"" said Makoto Saito, an economist at NLI Research Institute. 
Manufacturers in Japan, the world's third-largest economy, faced pressure from pandemic restrictions and heightened supply chain disruptions as well as shortages of raw materials and delivery delays and its PMI marked its slowest pace of expansion since February.
Taiwan's factory activity continued to expand but at its slowest pace in over a year while Vietnam's index was unchanged.

""While regional PMIs showed that the disruption from large virus waves in the region is easing somewhat, unmet orders continue to pile up, meaning that the resulting shortages further down supply chains are set to remain for some time to come,"" said Alex Holmes, emerging Asia economist at Capital Economics.
Once seen as a driver of global growth, Asia's emerging economies are lagging advanced economies in recovering from the pandemic's pain as delays in vaccine rollouts and a spike in Delta variant cases hurt consumption and factory production.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell for a fourth month in a row, to 57.1 from 60.3 in August, although the final level was higher than a preliminary September reading of 56.3.
Delays in deliveries showed one of the biggest jumps in the PMI's history amid reports of freight delays, staff shortages, disruptions caused by COVID-19 and Brexit, a lack of delivery drivers and port delays.
New export work shrank for the first time in eight months and growth in jobs was the weakest since January with small manufacturers cutting staff.
Last week, the Bank of England revised down its expectations for economic growth in the third quarter of 2021 because of the supply constraints, which now also include fuel shortages caused by a lack of truck drivers.
The bottlenecks have pushed up prices and inflation for manufacturing inputs was not far off a record high in September.

The BoE said last week it expected consumer price inflation would top 4% at the end of the year, more than double its 2% target, strengthening the case for a first interest rate hike since the pandemic struck.
Despite their current problems, firms taking part in the PMI survey remained optimistic about the year ahead with 62% expecting growth in output.

Factories have struggled with logistical issues, product shortages and a labour crunch brought about in large part by ongoing disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic which forced governments to impose strict restrictions on mobility.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) sank to 58.6 in September from August's 61.4, and just below an initial 58.7 ""flash"" estimate.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Tuesday and is seen as a good guide to economic health, dropped from August's 59.0 to 55.6. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""While euro zone manufacturing expanded at a robust pace in September, growth has weakened markedly as producers report a growing toll from supply chain headwinds,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Supply issues continue to wreak havoc across large swathes of European manufacturing, with delays and shortages being reported at rates not witnessed in almost a quarter of a century and showing no signs of any imminent improvement.""
Those bottlenecks kept pressure on the costs of the raw materials factories need. The input prices index only nudged down from August's 87.0 to 86.9.
However, factories passed some of those increases to customers and the output prices index approached the record high seen in the summer.

Inflation in the euro zone likely rose to 3.3% last month, preliminary official data is expected to show later on Friday, well above the European Central Bank's 2.0% target.

The IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for Italian manufacturing came in at 59.7, down from a multi-year high of 60.9 in August but still far above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
September's index reading, which marked the 15th consecutive month of factory growth, was above the median forecast of 59.4 in a Reuters survey of 20 analysts.
The new orders sub-index declined to 58.9 from 61.4 in August, after hitting a record high of 64.4 in May.

Unlike the larger services sector, factories in Italy have been spared the restrictions on business and movement imposed to try to rein in COVID-19 infections.

IHS Markit's Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of Germany's economy, stood at 58.4, slightly lower than a flash reading of 58.5, and down from 62.6 in August.
Factories in Europe's biggest economy have been humming along during the pandemic almost undisturbed by lockdowns that have impacted the services sector, and activity accelerated early this year on strong demand from the United States and China.
But shortages of intermediate goods like semiconductors and some raw materials have held back the sector, where companies worried that shortages will drag on into next year have started to report ebbing growth expectations.
Growth in new orders dropped to a 15-month low.
""Supply bottlenecks continue to drive up input costs and, in turn, put pressure on manufacturers to raise prices, which is acting as another headwind to growth,"" said Phil Smith, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
""The rate of input price inflation looks like it might have peaked but is still running close to the fastest in the survey's history, leading to near-record numbers of goods producers to raise prices,"" he added.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the French manufacturing sector in September fell to 55.0 points from 57.5 in August.
The index remained above the 50-point line dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction, but the final number for September was a bit weaker than the 55.2 points figure given in an initial, flash forecast.
Problems with global shipping and transport, caused partly by strict COVID-19 checks at Chinese ports and other disruptions to global supply chains during the pandemic, have resulted in many of the world's companies not getting key supplies of goods on time. 
Earlier this month, consulting firm AlixPartners said global automakers could lose $210 billion in revenue this year because of supply chain disruptions, such as shortages of semiconductors.

""September survey data show us that the intense supply-side imbalances are now starting to seriously impede the French manufacturing sector and are even affecting the demand-side of the economy too,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""It's clear that manufacturing growth is easing, with little signs that the situation is going to improve in the immediate future,"" added Hayes.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing in Spain fell to 58.1 for September, from 59.5 in August. However, the reading was well above the 50.0 mark that indicates an expansion in activity and was not far from June's reading of 60.4, which was the highest in more than two decades.
""Growth is clearly being restrained by severe and ongoing supply-side delays, which show little sign of dissipating,"" IHS Markit's economist Paul Smith said.
Supply chain disruptions and mismatches between supply and demand for raw materials contributed to input price increases, which in turn encouraged manufacturers to build up inventories and hence produce even more.
Companies reported demand was still strengthening as some clients were making advance orders to protect against delivery delays.
The Spanish statistics department INE downgraded second quarter economic growth to 1.1% earlier this week from an initial 2.8%, raising concern about the recovery's speed.

Spain's economy had shrunk 0.4% in the first quarter after increasing cases of COVID-19 forced renewed curbs on business activity.
The government expects the economy to grow 6.5% this year after 2020's record 10.8% contraction.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's business mood improved for a fifth straight quarter in September with manufacturers perking up on robust global demand, a central bank survey showed on Friday, boding well for the next administration's bid to pull the economy out of the doldrums.
Steady progress in vaccinations and hopes of a re-opening in economic activity also helped lift non-manufacturers' mood, the survey showed, underscoring the Bank of Japan's view an end to state of emergency curbs will prop up consumption.
But manufacturers expect business conditions to worsen three months ahead as parts shortages and Asian factory shutdowns disrupt production, the survey showed, underscoring the fragile nature of Japan's export-reliant recovery.
""Automakers' sentiment worsened, which is negative. But that's offset by strength in electric machinery and capital expenditure thanks to continued expansion in global IT demand,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
""Supply constraints are affecting broader sectors with parts from Asia in short supply,"" he said. ""Disruptions in domestic production could broaden beyond automakers.""
The headline index gauging big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 18 in July-September, up from plus 14 in the previous quarter and exceeding market forecasts for plus 13, the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely-watched tankan survey showed.
Big non-manufacturers' sentiment index improved to plus 2 from plus 1 in June, beating a median market forecast for a flat reading and posting a fifth straight quarter of improvement.
The survey bodes well for Fumio Kishida, who succeeds Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga next week with a mandate to revitalise the economy and distribute more wealth to households.
With most companies having sent in replies by Sept. 10, the survey did not factor in much of the government's decision to lift all coronavirus state of emergency on Thursday.
Nevertheless, retailers, restaurants and hotels were less gloomy about business conditions three months ahead reflecting hopes over an economic re-opening, the survey showed.
Some big firms in sectors like steel and oil saw conditions improve thanks to progress in passing on higher costs to their clients, a BOJ official told a briefing.
The tankan's indices showed more companies seeing increases in both input and output prices, suggesting that rising raw material costs may gradually prop up consumer inflation ahead.
Large companies expect to increase capital expenditure by 10.1% in the current fiscal year ending March 2022, the survey showed, backing up the BOJ's view robust corporate-sector activity will offset some of the weakness in consumption.
The survey will be among factors the BOJ will scrutinise when it meets for a rate review on Oct. 27-28 and revises its quarterly growth and inflation projections.
""What the BOJ focuses on in projecting the outlook are corporate profits and capital expenditure plans,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.
""Looking at these metrics ... the BOJ will probably maintain its forecast of a moderate recovery,"" she said.
Analysts, however, pointed to some worrying signs. Big automakers' sentiment worsened to minus 7, the lowest level since December 2020, due to the hit from supply disruptions.

The fallout is likely to broaden in coming months with sectors such as steelmakers and small parts makers already complaining of worsening conditions ahead, the survey showed.
Slowing Chinese growth and output disruptions caused by Asian factory shutdowns led to a slowdown in Japan's manufacturing activity in September, and was a point of discussion among BOJ policymakers at a recent meeting.

New-home prices in 100 cities rose 0.14% in September from a month earlier, down from 0.2% growth in August, according to data from China Index Academy, one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms.
In September, some cities intensified their campaigns to drive speculators out of the property market, taking more targeted steps such as caps on speculation on school district properties.
Regulators in the northeastern city of Shenyang and southern city of Haikou, in late September, urged real estate developers and agencies to refrain from hyping homes in school districts.
""We expect the ongoing property curbs are unlikely to be eased in the near term, as Beijing has attached national strategic importance to reining in property bubbles, directly intervening in credit supply for the property sector, leaving it little room to dial back these curbs"", Nomura said in a recent note.
Prices in the biggest tier-one cities such as Shanghai and Beijing rose 0.16%, quickening from August's 0.11% gain.
Monthly new-home prices in tier-two cities including provincial capitals grew 0.17% following August's 0.31% uptick, and rose 0.1% in tier-three and tier-four cities versus a 0.12% gain in August. 
On an annual basis, overall new-home prices rose 3.4% in September, compared with August's 3.51% gain. 
Sentiment in China's property market has been rocked by concerns of default risks among real estate firms as the debt crisis at property giant China Evergrande Group deepened.

September's reading was the sixth-highest registered since the survey began in 1998 and the survey showed a ""very strong rebound"" in the sector was continuing, AIB chief economist Oliver Mangan said. 
But it also showed signs that Ireland was subject to similar trends to the rest of Europe where shortages of raw materials, key inputs and labour were holding back manufacturing activity, Mangan said. 

While sub-indices measuring output, new orders and employment all fell, input and output prices both hit record highs. 
Difficulty hiring workers, order backlogs, supply chain delays and lengthening delivery times all contributed to inflationary pressures, Mangan said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose further last week as California moved more people to another program following the expiration of government-funded aid early this month to maximize their access to assistance.
The labor market recovery remains intact, with the report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing unemployment rolls steadily shrinking in mid-September. California announced on Sept. 17 that about 340,000 people on the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) program, which expired on Sept. 4, had been transferred to the Federal State Extended Duration program that remained in effect until Sept. 11. 
California's Employment Development Department said the transfer, which allowed PEUC claimants to collect one additional week of benefits, would show a large increase in claims filed, even though it reflected an existing claimant moving from one program to another. The PEUC was part of expanded unemployment programs which were funded by the federal government to cushion the blow of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployed Americans. 
Aside from the California distortions, a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, could have caused a modest rise in claims as some companies in the high-contact services industries laid off workers because of reduced demand. Infections are subsiding, leading to a pickup in economic activity.
""The increase in initial claims is less concerning than it may appear,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The rise in new filings in California could be capturing refiles.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 362,000 for the week ended Sept. 25. That was the third straight weekly increase. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 335,000 applications for the latest week. Unadjusted claims, which economists say offer a better read of the labor market, fell 8,326 to 298,255 last week. 
Claims in California increased 17,978 last week, adding to the 17,218 rise in the prior week. There was also a rise in applications in Michigan last week, likely related to the idling of assembly plants by some automakers as they try to manage their supply of semiconductors amid a global shortage. 
Claims in Texas also rose significantly, probably linked to high coronavirus cases in the state. But there were big declines in filings in Virginia, Maryland, Arizona, Ohio and Louisiana. Claims, which have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020, remain above their pre-pandemic levels. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower, leaving the benchmark S&P 500 on course to snap its seven-month winning streak. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
Jobless claims: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/lbvgngxxwpq/joblessclaims.png 
UNEMPLOYMENT ROLLS SHRINKING
The claims report also showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 18,000 to 2.802 million in the week ended Sept. 18, a sign that more people were finding work. 
The so-called continuing claims covered the week during which the government surveyed households for September's unemployment rate. Continuing claims decreased slightly between the August and September survey periods. 
The unemployment rate was at 5.2% in August. The claims data is being watched for signs of how soon a shortage of workers, which is constraining hiring, will start easing after the expiration of the expanded benefits.
Businesses and Republicans blamed those benefits for keeping the unemployed at home. There were a record 10.9 million open jobs at the end of July. More than 6 million people are estimated to have lost their pandemic benefits on Sept. 6. 
The total number of people collecting unemployment checks under all programs tumbled to 5.028 million during the week ended Sept. 11 from 11.250 million in the prior week.
""So far, there has been little evidence that enhanced benefits were significantly holding back workers from re-entering the labor force,"" said Isfar Munir, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""Employment has grown similarly in states that ended the benefits early and those that ended them later."" 
The economy created 235,000 jobs in August, the fewest in seven months. Lack of childcare, fears of contracting the coronavirus and pandemic-related career changes have been blamed for the worker shortage. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Thursday that caretakers and retirees made up most of the shortfall in labor force participation. Powell said he was optimistic that a big chunk of retirees would return to the labor force. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed the economy grew at a slightly faster 6.7% annualized rate in the second quarter, revised up from the 6.6% pace reported in August. Growth was driven by pandemic relief money from the government, which boosted consumer spending. The economy grew at a 6.3% rate in the first quarter. 
GDP: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/akvezqllopr/gdp.png
Growth appears to have slowed in the third quarter because of the Delta variant as well as shortages of raw materials, which have hurt motor vehicle sales and constrained home building and purchases. Gross domestic product estimates for the third quarter are below a 5% rate.

""The economy is set to regain traction after a late summer lull,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
""We expect a slowly improving health situation, solid household finances, a rebuild of inventories and additional fiscal stimulus will support growth momentum in 2022.""

DUBLIN (Reuters) -Ireland on Thursday doubled its forecast for economic growth this year but will not increase its budget package for 2021 as it aims to get the public finances in ""far safer"" shape than previously expected, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said on Thursday.
Finance ministry chief economist John McCarthy said he would not read too much into forecast gross domestic product growth of 15.6% this year due to the ways multinationals can distort Irish GDP. He said he would instead focus on the expected 5.2% growth in modified domestic demand.
GDP jumped 21.6% year-on-year in the second quarter as Ireland emerged from one of Europe's strictest lockdown, while modified domestic demand - which strips out some of the ways multinationals can distort the data - grew by 15% over the same period.
The finance ministry also expects unemployment to be around one percentage point lower for each of the next three years, falling to 7.2% in 2022 and 5.3% in 2024. 
Inflation is expected to peak above 4% in the final quarter of the year before falling back below 2% in the third quarter of 2022, the forecasts showed. 
The government decided in July to narrow its budget deficit more gradually than planned in order to increase capital spending in particular on housing and climate change.
Donohoe said he would not use the better than expected growth to further increase the amount of money available for spending hikes and tax cuts in the Oct. 12 announcement of the budget for 2022.

Public Expenditure Minister Michael McGrath also said government departments are unlikely to spend the record 90.7 billion euros allocated for 2021, raising the prospect of a markedly narrower budget deficit than the 5.1% forecast in July.
Donohoe is due to update the deficit and debt forecasts at or ahead of the budget, taking account of spending and tax figures for September that are due to be published on Monday.

TATSFIELD, England (Reuters) -Truck drivers have a cautionary message for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson: an acute shortage of drivers is ratcheting up their wages and that will have a knock-on effect on prices for food and gifts in the run-up to Christmas. 
An air of chaos has gripped the world's fifth-largest economy in recent days as a deficit of truckers left fuel pumps dry across the land, and a spike in European wholesale natural gas prices tipped energy companies into bankruptcy.
The United Kingdom is short of around 100,000 truckers after tens of thousands returned to the European Union during the Brexit maelstrom and 40,000 truck driver tests were cancelled during the COVID-19 lockdowns.
At Clacket Lane service station beside London's M25 orbital motorway, drivers from Britain, France, Germany, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Russia and Turkey were parked up to rest after journeys from every corner of Europe.
Over the faint whiff of sewage, cigarette smoke and diesel fumes in the truck park, scores of drivers told Reuters in several different tongues that wages would have to rise.
They spoke of a hard and lonely life on the road: filthy showers, high parking fees, nights disturbed by thieves wielding knives, illegal migrants seeking a secret ride, and of the pain of divorce after years spent far from wives and children.
""Wages will have to go up so prices for everything we deliver, everything you buy on the shelves, will have to go up too,"" said Craig Holness, a 51-year-old British trucker with 27 years of experience, who was parked up for a break.
Rising trucker pay may give an insight into a riddle that is bothering investors: whether or not the world is on the cusp of persistent price rises after the splurge by governments and central banks during the COVID crisis.
Sterling has fallen on fears the trucker shortage could crimp economic growth, forecast at 7% this year. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Wednesday he was focused on the inflationary effects from supply shortages including of labour.
Haulier companies and recruitment agencies are battling to fill trucker jobs: One was advertising for a heavy goods vehicle (HGV) Class 1 driver for 75,000 pounds ($102,500) per annum, the highest level the recruiter had ever heard of.
""With HGV drivers, we're now paying them 40% more than we were four months ago,"" Jordan Francis, the commercial director of recruitment agency ProDrive, told Reuters.
He recalled a driver whose pay per hour had increased to 22.50 pounds per hour from 14.00 pounds per hour in March. Sign-on bonuses of 1,000 are being offered too.
'MARRIAGE KILLER'
Holness said the shortage of drivers would not ease any time soon because conditions were so poor that many young people refused to do it. 
While trying to snatch some sleep recently near West Bromwich in central England, thieves sliced an 11-foot hole in his canvas causing hours of delay and stress. 
""Who wants to be a lorry driver - you'd be better tapping away on a keyboard wouldn't you? Kids these days don't want to know,"" said Holness. ""I want to get out."" 
He suggested Johnson, who was educated at Eton, Britain's most exclusive school, and Oxford, its most exclusive university, should spend several days trucking to understand the issues.
""You are just treated like the scum of the earth basically,"" said Phil, a 52-year-old British truck driver from Malvern in central England, who has just had what he termed a significant pay rise. ""Prices will increase.""
He said many truck stops reeked of urine and faeces - and the job gave limited time to see family.
""It's a marriage killer,"" he said. 
The government on Sunday announced a plan to issue temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers. None of the truck drivers interviewed by Reuters thought many would take up the offer.
""It is tough work and youngsters don't want it,"" said Anton Pogodin, a 37-year-old truck driver originally from Omsk, in Siberia, who now drives from Portugal. 
But in Bucharest, some Romanian truckers were tempted by the offer.
'BREXIT CHAOS'
British ministers have repeatedly denied that Brexit has caused the trucker shortage but many EU drivers blamed just that for prompting so many eastern European drivers to head for the exit.
""No one else has these kind of problems that you're finding here,"" said Belgian driver Patrice Rese, 65. ""It's because of Brexit.""
""Best of luck to you Monsieur Johnson,"" he quipped.
Miguel Brunel, a 41-year-old driver from Bethune in northern France, questioned the logic of replacing so many British drivers with those from eastern Europe only to then essentially prompt those drivers to leave.
""If they had maintained a market of English drivers rather than replacing them from drivers from Eastern Europe, they wouldn't be in this position,"" said Brunel in French.

""This is chaos,"" he said.

The move comes as Brazil faces a rising inflation boosted by high energy and food prices, which has been affecting President Jair Bolsonaro's popularity prior to next year's presidential election.
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, said in a securities filing that details of the program are still under evaluation, including which families should receive the benefit and a search for potential partners.
Petrobras CEO Joaquim Silva e Luna said it reinforces the company's ""social role"" amid the outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is seen by the state-run firm as an ""exceptional and emergency situation"".

Luna had said in a press conference earlier this week that the company does not intend to change its fuel pricing policies. Two people close to the company told Reuters, however, that he was in Brasilia during the weekend to discuss with government officials potential measures to cushion the blow of rising prices.

The support will be for about 480,000 companies employing up to 200 Thai workers, which must retain at least 95% of employees, the planning agency said.
It also said the government was aiming to draw 1 million foreign tourists during the final quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of next year, with spending of at least 60 billion baht.

Retail sales in August rose 11.9% from a year earlier to HK$28.6 billion ($3.67 billion), government data showed on Thursday. August's increase compared with a revised 2.8% growth in July.
""The CVS should continue to bode well for local consumption sentiment in the rest of the year,"" a government spokesman said, referring to electronic vouchers given to certain consumers to spend in shops.
In volume terms, retail sales in August grew 10.6% from a year earlier compared with a revised 0.7% surge the previous month.
For the first eight months of 2021, total retail sales increased 8.1% in value terms and rose 6.8% in volume.
Online retail sales in August jumped 16.5% in value year-on-year compared with a revised growth of 28.8% in July.
Sales of jewellery, watches, clocks and valuable gifts, which before the pandemic relied heavily on tourists from the mainland, climbed 28% in August versus a revised 26.3% surge in July, the data showed.
Clothing, footwear and allied products rose 40.1% in August against a revised 30.9% growth in July.
Tourist arrivals in August soared 143% from a year earlier to 10,811 after three straight months of decline. That compared with a 57.9% drop in July.
""Keeping the epidemic under control remains pivotal to a full-fledged recovery of the retail sector and the overall economy,"" the spokesman said, adding it was essential to strive towards more widespread coronavirus vaccinations.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy grew by more than previously thought in the April-June period before what looks like a sharp slowdown more recently as post-lockdown bottlenecks, including a shortage of truck drivers, mount.
Gross domestic product increased by 5.5% in the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics said, stronger than its preliminary estimate of growth of 4.8%. 
The ONS said the data had been adjusted to take account of more complete data from the health sector as well as an update of its sources and methodology for calculating output. 
The revision means Britain is no longer the worst-performing economy among Group of Seven developed countries, when comparing GDP in the summer of 2021 with its level at the end of 2019. It is now tied with Germany and above Italy.
The figures provided a more complete picture of Britain's swift economic bounce-back from its coronavirus lockdown earlier this year, but there are now signs of a loss of momentum due to shortages of supplies and staff as the global economy reopens.
""While the upward revisions to GDP are clearly welcome, Q2 was three months ago, and the recovery appears to have stagnated since,"" Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
""Even so, given that there is now thought to be less spare capacity in the economy that will only encourage the Bank of England to hike rates in the not too distant future.""
On Wednesday, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said he thought the economy would regain its pre-pandemic level of output in early 2022 - a month or two later than the BoE had forecast in August. 
Despite the slowdown, the British central bank has signalled that it is moving towards a first interest rate hike since the pandemic as it expects inflation to head above 4%.
Thursday's data showed households increased their spending by more than 7% in the April-June period and they dipped into their coronavirus lockdown savings to fund it.
The savings ratio, which measures the income households saved as a proportion of their total available disposable income, fell to 11.7% from 18.4% in the first quarter of 2020, the ONS said. 
GDP growth was driven by the services sector, especially in the accommodation and food industry where output rose by 87.6% in quarterly terms as it reopened from lockdown.
Manufacturing output rose by 1.8% in the second quarter, despite a shortage of microchips hurting car production. Food and beverage manufacturing performed strongly.
The ONS said construction output had broadly returned to its pre-pandemic level.

The data also showed that Britain's current account deficit with the rest of the world held steady at 8.6 billion pounds in the second quarter, equivalent to 1.5% of gross domestic product. In the first quarter, the shortfall was 1.6% of GDP.
Excluding volatile trade in precious metals, the deficit widened to 1.8% of GDP from 0.2% in the first quarter, due to a worsening of Britain's trade balance and a fall in earnings on foreign investments.

Investing.com – China’s factory activity contracted in September for the first time since COVID-19 began in 2020, with an electricity crunch inflicting further damage on an economic recovery that is already slowing down.
Data released earlier in the day by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that September’s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was at 49.6, lower than the 50.1 figure in both forecasts prepared by Investing.com and reported in the previous month.
The Caixin manufacturing PMI was at 50, higher than the 49.5 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and August’s 49.2 figure. The improvement was thanks to firmer domestic demand and an increase in new orders, as export sales continued to decline, Caixin Insight Group said in a statement.
The contraction was due to factors including a sluggish performance of energy-intensive industries, NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe said in a statement. A widespread power crunch in China that has already forced at least 20 provinces to restrict electricity use in September, is threatening to slow economic growth and disrupt global supply chains.
The data “offered the first glimpse of the cost from the energy crunch and, for the manufacturing sector, it’s substantial. The manufacturing PMI dropped into contraction. The services sector staged a comeback but is by no means recovering strongly,” according to Bloomberg Economics' Chang Shu and David Qu.
Meanwhile, the “weak PMI sent an alarm to the government. The big question is whether the government monetary and fiscal policies will become more supportive now or if the government will wait till the year-end to change the policies,” Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd. chief economist Zhang Zhiwei told Bloomberg.
The NBS data also showed that the non-manufacturing PMI was at 53.2, higher than the 47.5 reported in August.
In the services sector, spending during the recent Mid-Autumn Festival holiday gave it a small boost. However, tourism revenue and travel remained below pre-COVID-19 levels, signs that consumer confidence remains weak after recent COVID-19 outbreaks led to strict restrictive measures."
471,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 11:31PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory activity unexpectedly shrank in September due to wider curbs on electricity use and elevated input prices, while services returned to expansion as COVID-19 outbreaks receded, offering some relief to the world's second-biggest economy. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) was at 49.6 in September versus 50.1 in August, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Thursday, slipping into contraction for the first time since February 2020. 
Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the index to remain steady at 50.1, unchanged from the previous month. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction. 
China's economy rapidly recovered from a pandemic-induced slump last year, but momentum has weakened in recent months, with its sprawling manufacturing sector hit by rising costs, production bottlenecks and electricity rationing.
Rising COVID-19 cases in tens of cities over the summer also disrupted the manufacturing and the services sectors, though the latter is starting to bounce back as the outbreaks receded.
A sub-index for factory output contracted in September for the first time since February last year, dragged down by a pullback in high-energy consuming industries, such as plants that process metals and oil products. The gauge stood at 49.6 versus 50.1 a month earlier. 
""In September, due to factors such as low volumes of business at high energy-consuming industries, the manufacturing PMI fell below the critical point,"" said Zhao Qinghe, a senior NBS statistician, in an accompanying statement.
""The two indexes of high energy-consuming industries ...are both lower than 45.0, indicating a significant drop in supply and demand.""
GROWTH OUTLOOK
The sudden contraction in factory activity will further weigh on an economy already hit by curbs on its property and tech sectors and facing many growth downgrades by private-sector economists.
Other economies in Asia are also grappling with production issues due to supply chain disruptions, with data on Thursday showing Japan's industrial output falling for a second straight month in August.
""(Chinese) economic growth in Q4 will likely slow further without a change of government policies, and the pace of slowdown may pick up,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, Shenzhen-based chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, after the PMI data was released. 
""The big question is whether the government's monetary and fiscal policies will become more supportive now or if the government will wait till the year-end to change the policies.""
The central bank last eased its requirements on how much cash banks should hold in mid-July, just before a surge in domestic COVID-19 cases. 
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has left its benchmark lending rate for corporate and household loans unchanged for the 17th month in September.
HIGH PRODUCTION COSTS 
A shortage of coal, tougher emissions standards and strong demand from manufacturers and industry pushed coal prices to record highs and triggered widespread curbs on electricity usage in at least 20 provinces and regions.
Higher raw material prices, especially of metals and semiconductors, have also pressured profits of manufacturers. Earnings at China's industrial firms in August slowed for the sixth straight month.
A sub-index for raw material costs rose to 63.5 in September from 61.3 a month earlier, while a gauge of new orders came in at 49.3 compared with 49.6 in August, shrinking for the second straight month. 
A sub-index for employment remained in contraction, at 47.8 versus 47.0 a month earlier. 
A separate private survey also released on Thursday that focuses on small and export-oriented businesses showed that factory activity in September neither expanded nor contracted.
On a more sanguine note, the official non-manufacturing PMI in September was at 53.2, bouncing back from 47.5 in August, data from the NBS showed, as COVID-19 outbreaks receded after rising during the summer months.

Last month, COVID-19-related restrictions drove services sector activity into sharp contraction for the first time since the height of the pandemic last year.
The official September composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, stood at 51.7 versus 48.9 in August.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.0 in September from 49.2 the month before, versus analyst expectations of 49.5 in a Reuters poll. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. 
The Chinese economy recovered rapidly from a pandemic-induced slump last year but has since lost steam, with its sprawling manufacturing sector hit by COVID-19 outbreaks, higher costs, production bottlenecks, and more recently, power rationing. 
China is in the grip of a power crunch due to a shortage of coal, tougher emissions standards, and strong demand from industry, triggering widespread curbs on electricity usage.
The output sub-index showed production fell for a second consecutive month but at a slower pace.
""The resurgence of the epidemic in several regions and shortfalls in raw material supplies slowed production at manufacturing companies,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in comments released alongside the data. 
China has also been dealing with ongoing small-scale coronavirus outbreaks in the southeastern province of Fujian and Heilongjiang province in the country's northeast.
""Surveyed enterprises said the rise in costs was mainly caused by a sharp increase in the prices of energy, industrial metals and electronic raw materials,"" said Wang.
New export orders slipped faster into contraction, the data showed, hitting the lowest level since February, as overseas demand cooled. Factories continued to lay off workers and at a quicker pace. 
""The demand for consumer goods was weak, reflecting consumers' lack of purchasing power,"" said Wang, adding that demand for intermediate goods was higher. 

A sub-index for new orders returned to expansion. Input prices rose at the fastest pace since May. 
Higher raw material prices, especially of metals and semiconductors, have also pressured profits. Earnings at industrial firms slowed for a sixth month in August.

The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index declined to 49.6 from 50.1 in August, the National Bureau of Statistics said Thursday, below the 50 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Readings below the 50-mark signal a contraction in output.
The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in construction and services sectors, improved to 53.2, well above the consensus forecast of 49.8.
China is facing a widespread power crunch that threatens to slow economic growth and disrupt global supply chains just ahead of the year-end Christmas shopping season. At least 20 provinces have restricted electricity use in September, curbing factory production on everything from aluminum and steel to toys and clothing. 
The electricity shock adds to a slew of headwinds already hitting the economy: the financial system is under stress because of China Evergrande Group’s debt crisis; high commodity prices have squeezed industrial profits; the government has cracked down on industries from property to the internet; and consumer spending remains weak due to virus outbreaks.

Twenty-eight percent of respondents in the poll by Kantar Public said they thought the economy would be in a worse state in 12 months' time, up from 20% in August. Those who thought it would be doing better fell by six points to 24%.
More than half were worried about not being able to keep their home warm enough this winter while three in 10 said they were finding it harder to meet their household budgets than a year ago, an increase of six points from August.
Wholesale natural gas prices have doubled over the past month, leading to the collapse of several smaller British energy suppliers. Regulated household energy prices are set to rise steeply next month, and probably again in April. 
Last week, the Bank of England raised its forecast for inflation which it now expects to peak at above 4% and it lowered its estimate for economic growth in the third quarter, in large part due to post-lockdown bottlenecks in supply chains.
Kantar Public said it interviewed 1,089 people between Sept. 23 and Sept. 27. 
A separate report showed slower growth among businesses in the three months to September although activity was still above its long-run average.

The Confederation of British Industry's growth balance - based on surveys of manufacturers, retailers and other services firms - dropped to +27 from +34 in the three months to August, with the biggest fall in consumer services and distribution.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes rebounded to a seven-month high in August, but higher prices as supply remains tight are slowing the housing market momentum.
Other data on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a house fell last week as mortgage rates increased after the Federal Reserve signaled it would likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November. There are indications that supply could improve in the fall. 
""Supply constraints that are boosting prices are impacting affordability and have been a headwind for buyers,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""Gradually easing supply constraints should be a positive, although affordability concerns could temper sales in the very near term.""
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, jumped 8.1% last month to 119.5. That was the highest reading since January and followed two straight monthly declines.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts, which become sales after a month or two, increasing 1.4%. Compared with a year ago, pending home sales fell 8.3% in August. 
The housing market boomed early in the COVID-19 pandemic amid an exodus from cities as people worked from home and took classes online. But the pandemic tailwind is fading as vaccines allow workers to return to offices. 
Expensive homes are also sidelining some first-time buyers from the market. The NAR reported last week that the share of first-time buyers was the smallest in more than 2-1/2 years in August. Existing home sales dropped last month.
Data on Tuesday showed consumer sentiment towards buying a home weakening for a third straight month in September and house prices posting record gains in July from a year-ago.
Lumber prices have plummeted from record highs scaled in May, which economists and realtors hope will encourage builders to ramp-up construction of single-family homes. The resumption of foreclosures after a pandemic moratorium is also expected to ease the inventory crunch. 
But house prices are likely to remain elevated, which together with rising mortgage rates could further erode affordability. In a separate report on Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for loans to buy a home fell 1.2% last week from the prior week.
Loan purchase applications were down 12% from a year ago. According to the MBA, mortgage rates across all loan types increased since last Wednesday's announcement by the Fed, with the benchmark 30-year fixed rate reaching its highest level since early July. 
The U.S. central bank's massive monthly bond buying program to aid the economy's recovery from the pandemic has helped to keep mortgage rates low. With U.S. Treasury yields rising in recent days, mortgage rates could creep higher, which could draw some buyers into the market in anticipation of further rises.

""We anticipate home sales will trend sideways over the remainder of 2021,"" said Mahir Rasheed, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
The surge in pending home sales last month was led by the South and Midwest regions, where the NAR said house price increases have been generally moderate relative to the rest of the country. Contracts soared 10.4% in the Midwest and vaulted 8.6% in the densely populated South. They rose 4.6% in the Northeast and advanced 7.2% in the West.

The European Commission's economic sentiment indicator rose to 117.8 in September, from 117.6 in August, after hitting an all-time high of 119.0 in July. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected sentiment to ease in September to 116.9, mainly because of an expected weakening in industry and services.
But Commission data showed sentiment in industry improved to 14.1 from 13.8 in August, though it did decline in services to 15.1 from 16.8.
Consumers became more optimistic as well, with a reading of -4.0, up from -5.3 in August, and in the construction sector the indicator rose to 7.5 from 5.5, helping offset the decline in the retail sector to 1.3 from 4.6.

The economic rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic and rapidly rising energy prices also drove higher inflation expectations among consumers and manufacturers. 
Selling price expectations among manufacturers rose to 38.2 points, setting a new record high since the survey began in 2000, while consumer inflation expectations rose to 33.1 from 31.1 in August, approaching the 38.7 record from August 2001.

LONDON (Reuters) - British mortgage lending rose last month, recovering from a rare fall in July which was linked to the scaling back of a tax break for homebuyers, but consumers remained cautious about their borrowing, Bank of England data showed on Wednesday.
Net mortgage lending increased by 5.293 billion pounds ($7.24 billion) in August, bouncing back from July's net repayment of 1.758 billion pounds. New mortgage approvals fell slightly to 74,453.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a net rise of 3.7 billion pounds in mortgage borrowing in August and to 73,000 mortgage approvals during the month.
Britain's housing market has boomed since the summer of 2020, helped by a pandemic surge in demand for bigger properties as more people work from home and by the tax incentive offered by finance minister Rishi Sunak.
That incentive was halved in scale on July 1 for home-buyers in England and Northern Ireland and is due to expire completely at the end of this month. Similar tax breaks in Scotland and Wales have already ended.
Wednesday's data showed consumer borrowing also rose in August, increasing by a net 351 million pounds after a rise of just 32 million pounds in July. The economists polled by Reuters had expected a smaller rise of 300 million pounds.
Nonetheless, consumer credit was 2.4% lower than in August 2020, underscoring how many households remained cautious about their spending over the summer when COVID-19 cases picked up again and many people were required to isolate at home.

Economists say further momentum is likely to be lost in the coming months due to rising inflation and supply chain problems linked to the reopening of the economy, chief among them a lack of truck drivers which is hampering fuel supplies.
""Overall, we're becoming more worried that economy may soon take a step back,"" Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics said. ""That would be food for thought for the Bank of England which appears intent on raising interest rates in the coming months.""

Import prices jumped 16.5% in August from a year earlier, the Federal Statistics Office said on Wednesday, which was above economists' forecasts for a 16.1% increase and up from 15.0% in July.
The August increase was the steepest rise since September 1981, when the second oil crisis pushed prices up by 17.4%.
The price of energy imports was up 93.6% in August compared with a year earlier, mainly due to a strong rise in the price of natural gas, the Statistics Office said.
The price of many raw materials rose steeply as well. Iron ore cost 96.8% more in August, and the price of sawn and planed wood was up 61.6%, and basic iron, steel and ferro-alloys were up by 57.7%.
At the same time, supply chain bottlenecks affecting German companies worsened further, a survey published by the Ifo institute on Wednesday showed.
Some 77.4% of German industrial firms reported difficulties procuring intermediates and raw materials this month. Among car companies, that figure was at 97%, Ifo said.

""There are many orders, but companies cannot produce them right now,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said. As a result, more companies are now planning to increase prices, Ifo said.
Economists expect German flash inflation figures due on Thursday to show the rise in consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries (HICP), accelerated further to 4.0% in September, from 3.4% in August, according to Refinitiv data.

The services sector contracted 9.28% from a year earlier in the period, while the industrial and construction sector fell 5.02%, the General Statistics Office (GSO) said in a statement. The agriculture sector expanded 1.04%. 
""The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected all aspects of the economy with many key production cities and provinces having to impose strict lockdowns,"" the GSO said in a statement.
The GSO traditionally releases data before the end of the reporting period and its data is often subject to revision. Growth in the second quarter was revised down to 6.57% from 6.61%. 
After successfully containing the virus for most of last year, Vietnam has been grappling with a rise in infections since April, with total cases at 770,000 and 18,936 deaths, mostly in its business hub Ho Chi Minh City and neighbouring industrial provinces. 
The outbreak has forced authorities to impose strict lockdowns in Vietnam's largest cities and provinces, and prompted companies to suspend production. 
The government has in the past week taken steps to gradually ease lockdowns, following pressure from business associations and warnings by investors that the restrictions will prompt a shift away from the country.
The government is targeting a 6.5% GDP increase this year, but a minister earlier this month said growth could be 3.5%-4.0%.
Analysts said monthly activity data indicated the worst may be over. 
""We still expect a sizeable pick-up in the fourth quarter with production quickly normalising due to higher vaccination rates among manufacturing employees and a broader easing in restrictions,"" Oxford Economics said in a note.
However, it said logistical and supply chain disruptions were a risk to the outlook and that it would be revising down its 2021 GDP growth forecast of 5.4%.
Around 90,000 businesses suspended operations or went bankrupt in the January-September period, the GSO said. Among them, 32,400 were dissolved, up 17.4% from a year earlier.

It said the unemployment rate rose to 3.43% in the third quarter from 2.40% in the second quarter. 
According to the GSO, exports in September likely fell 0.6% from a year earlier to $27 billion and the industrial production index dropped 5.5%.

The Household Finance Index published by Scottish Widows, an insurance and pensions firm, fell to 44.0 in the July-September period from 44.7 in the second quarter of the year.
The last time the index decreased from one quarter to the next was in the three months to June 2020 when Britain was in the grip of its first coronavirus lockdown.
Income from employment rose for the first time since early last year. But households had less cash available for discretionary spending as prices for essential goods increased, Scottish Widows said.
Britain's main inflation measure jumped to 3.2% in August and the Bank of England expects it to rise above 4% as the post-lockdown reopening of the economy at home and around the world leads to bottlenecks and supply shortages.
Households were also more downbeat about their financial outlook over the next 12 months. 
A survey published last week showed growing worries over energy bills, food costs and tax hikes that caused a drop in British consumer confidence.

A separate report from a recruiters group showed employers were a bit less confident about hiring in the three months to August but their plans for taking on new staff remained high by historical standards.
The Recruitment & Employment Confederation survey was conducted before the recent escalation of supply chain problems which led the BoE last week to lower its estimate for economic growth in the third quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell to a seven-month low in September as a relentless rise in COVID-19 cases deepened concerns about the economy's near-term prospects, fitting in with expectations for a slowdown in growth in the third quarter.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumers less interested in buying a home and big-ticket items such as motor vehicles and major household appliances over the next six months. Consumers were also not as upbeat in their views of the labor market as in the prior month. 
Economic activity has cooled in recent months as the boost from pandemic relief money faded and infections flared up, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus. Labor and raw material shortages have also chipped away at growth.
""But given that wave seems to be cresting, there's hope confidence just hit its nadir,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""Assuming predictions of Delta dropping hold true, this setback may be a three-month trough during the recovery rally.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 109.3 this month from 115.2 in August. The third straight monthly decline pushed the index to the lowest level since February. 
The measure, which places more emphasis on the labor market, has dropped 19.6 points from a peak of 128.9 in June. It was in contrast with the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, which showed sentiment stabilizing early this month. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the consumer confidence index nudging up to 114.5.
""These back-to-back declines suggest consumers have grown more cautious and are likely to curtail spending going forward,"" said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board in Washington.
Politicians in Washington bickering over extending the federal government's borrowing capabilities are also casting a cloud. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Tuesday that the government could run out of cash by Oct. 18 unless the U.S. Congress raised the debt limit.
Yellen warned that a debt default would be a ""disastrous"" event that would trigger a ""financial crisis and calamity.""
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, fell to a reading of 42.5 this month from 44.4 in August, the highest since July 2000.
This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's closely watched employment report. September's employment report is due to be released on Oct. 8, but could be delayed if Congress fails to reach a deal by Friday to keep the government funded.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
HOUSE PRICES SURGE
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months slipped to 6.5% from 6.7% last month. 
Buying intentions for motor vehicles fell to a nine month low. Fewer consumers planned to purchase household appliances like washing machines and clothes dryers over the next six months, supporting expectations for a sharp slowdown in consumer spending this quarter, which will ultimately restrain economic growth. Gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter are mostly below a 5% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.6% pace in the second quarter.
Expectations for slower GDP growth were reinforced by a separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showing the goods trade deficit rose 0.9% to $87.6 billion in August as businesses imported more products to replenish inventories. Trade has subtracted from GDP growth for four straight quarters.
Imports of goods climbed 0.8% to $236.6 billion, lifted by consumer goods and industrial supplies. But imports of food, capital goods and motor vehicles fell. Motor vehicle imports were likely weighed down by a global shortage of semiconductors, which is impacting production.
Rising imports offset a 0.7% gain in goods exports to $149.0 billion, supported by industrial supplies and consumer goods. But the nation reported a decline in exports of capital goods, motor vehicles and food products. Exports are increasing as global economies continue to recover from the pandemic. 
Some of the increase in imports ended up in warehouses at wholesalers and retailers. Wholesale inventories accelerated 1.2% last month. Stocks at retailers edged up 0.1%. Retail inventories were held back by a 1.5% tumble in stocks of motor vehicles.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.6% after advancing 0.5% in the prior month. Business inventories were drawn down in the first half of the year. Last month's increase should soften the hit to GDP growth from the widening goods trade deficit.
""The real change in inventories may be slightly positive in the third quarter, with a drop in retail auto inventories being offset by inventory gains in other parts of the economy,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
News on the housing market was discouraging, with the Conference Board survey showing consumers less inclined to buy a home for a third straight month amid higher house prices due to tight supply. 
A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index surged a record 19.7% in July from a year ago after accelerating 18.7% in June.
Sustained house price inflation was corroborated by a fourth report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showing house prices soared a record 19.2% in the 12 months through July after surging 18.9% in June.

""We expect some moderation in home price inflation in the second half of this year but still look for annual price
growth to be in double digits,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

New vehicle retail sales in the United States are seen dropping to 888,900 units in September, from 1,182,788 a year ago.
""September results show that there are simply not enough vehicles available to meet consumer demand,"" J.D. Power said in a statement.
While demand remains sky high for personal transportation, with consumers set to spend billions in September, automakers are crimped by semiconductor shortages and supply chain disruptions.
The gap between demand and supply is leading to record vehicle prices, with average transaction price in September expected to reach an all-time high of $42,802, J.D. Power said.
Used vehicle prices are also starting to heat up as the fall season gets underway after cooling in late-June and July, J.D. Power added.
LMC Automotive warned that the recovery in the auto industry may be pushed until 2022, if not 2023, due to the worsening disruptions.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China faces mounting pressure to ramp up coal imports and ensure supplies to keep lights on, factories open and water flowing as a severe power crunch roils the northeastern industrial heartland.
With electricity shortages sparked by coal shortages crippling large sections of industry https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-power-crunch-begins-weigh-economic-outlook-2021-09-27, the governor of Jilin province, one of the hardest hit in the world's no.2 economy, called for a surge in coal imports, while a power company association said supply was being expanded ""at any cost"".
News organisations and social media carried reports and posts saying the lack of power in the northeast had shut down traffic lights, residential elevators and 3G mobile phone coverage as well as triggering factory shutdowns.
A utility in Jilin even warned power shortages could disrupt water supplies at any time, before apologising for causing alarm.
For the second straight day, the main state grid operator sought to reassure customers, saying it would work to guarantee coal supply and strictly control power use by high-energy consuming and polluting sectors, and ensure power supply to residents during the October holidays and winter heating season.
Cities such as Shenyang and Dalian - home to more than 13 million people - have been hit, with disruption at factories owned by suppliers to global companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Jilin is one of more than 10 provinces forced to ration power https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-behind-chinas-power-crunch-2021-09-27 as generators feel the heat of soaring coal prices that they can't pass on to consumers.
Speaking to power firms on Monday, Han Jun, the governor of Jilin province, home to nearly 25 million people, said ""multiple channels"" needed to be set up to guarantee coal supplies, and China should source more from Russia, Mongolia and Indonesia.
Han said the province would also urgently send teams to secure supply contracts in the neighbouring region of Inner Mongolia, according to Jilin's official WeChat social media account.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimated that as much as 44% of China's industrial activity has been hit by power shortages, potentially causing a one-percentage-point decline in annualised GDP growth in the third quarter, and a two-percentage-point drop from October to December. 
It said in a Tuesday note that it was cutting its 2021 GDP growth forecast for China to 7.8%, from the previous 8.2%. 
'AT ANY COST'
The power crunch has taken hold https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-behind-chinas-power-crunch-2021-09-27 as a shortage of coal supplies, toughening greenhouse gas emissions standards and strong demand from industry have pushed coal prices to peaks.
China's thermal coal futures hit a record high at 1,330 yuan ($205.68) per tonne on Tuesday.
Rationing has been implemented during peak hours in many parts of northeastern China since last week, triggering state media reports of power supply disruptions in many cities and stoking concern on social media.
As some shops in the northeast operated by candlelight and malls shut early, posts on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) expressed concern about water after a utility in Jilin warned users that power shortages could hit supplies at any time.
Jilin governor Han urged companies to fulfil their ""social responsibilities"" and ""overcome the difficulties"" caused by coal price rises.
The China Electricity Council, which represents power suppliers, said on Monday that coal-fired power companies were now ""expanding their procurement channels at any cost"" in order to guarantee winter heat and electricity supplies.
It said China needed to increase production and supply of coal while guaranteeing safety and environmental protection. More medium- and long-term contracts needed to be signed to raise power plant inventories ahead of winter.
Coal traders said finding fresh import sources may be easier said than done.
""Russia has to first meet demand from Europe, Japan and South Korea,"" said one northeast China based trader. ""Indonesia's export shipments have been curbed by rainy weather the last couple of months and Mongolia's exports, mostly by trucks, are small."" 
David Fishman, China energy policy researcher and manager at the Lantau Group consultancy, said flaws in China's pricing system were ultimately to blame.
""In the short term, the only relief policies that make sense are digging more coal out of the ground, which is bound to be an unpopular idea, or make end-users pay more for their power,"" Fishman said.
Policymakers had previously warned that China needed to build more coal plants in order to offset potential power shortages over the 2021-2025 period, but utilisation rates at existing plants remain low.

Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst with the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said northeast China currently had 100 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity, which would be more than enough to meet demand if plants had the incentive to buy more coal.
""Not a single grid region has reported peak loads that would be even close to exhausting available generating capacity,"" he said.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI)is expected to stay at 50.1 in September, the same as the August reading, according to the median forecast of 34 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates expansion from the previous month.
China's economy rapidly recovered from a pandemic-induced slump last year, but momentum has weakened in recent months, with the vast manufacturing sector facing heightened costs and production bottlenecks, and more recently, electricity rationing.
China is in the grip of a power crunch as a shortage of coal supplies, toughening emissions standards and strong demand from manufacturers and industry have pushed coal prices to record highs and triggered widespread curbs on usage.
""Unless the power issues are resolved and production restrictions are lifted, efforts by Beijing to ease policy will have a more muted impact on economic output. Thus, power shortages raise the possibility that any economic rebound will be delayed,"" said analysts at BCA Research on Tuesday.
China is also dealing with ongoing small-scale coronavirus outbreaks in the southeast province of Fujian and the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.
Higher raw material prices, especially of metals andsemiconductors, have also pressured profits. Earnings at China's industrial firms in August slowed for the sixth straight month.

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big andstate-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector,will both be released on Thursday.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will also be published on the same day. Analysts expect the headline reading will rise to 49.5 from 49.2 the month before, remaining in contraction.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed for a sixth month as plants fought off high commodity prices, COVID-19 outbreaks and part shortages, with an unfolding power crisis a growing threat to output and bottom-lines. 
Profits rose 10.1% on year in August to 680.3 billion yuan ($105 billion) compared with a 16.4% gain in July, data from China's statistics bureau showed on Tuesday. 
The world's second-biggest economy rapidly recovered from a pandemic-induced slump last year, but momentum has weakened in recent months, with its vast manufacturing sector facing heightened costs and production bottlenecks, and more recently, electricity rationing.
Factory output rose in August at its slackest pace since July 2020, weighed by domestic COVID-19 outbreaks, high raw material prices, and a persistent shortage of parts such as semiconductors. 
A sustained crackdown this year on real estate speculation and new borrowing by developers for projects has also sapped demand for construction-related goods and services. 
""We expect industrial profit growth to fall further in coming months amid a notable growth slowdown in H2 due to the recurring COVID-19 waves and Beijing's zero-COVID strategy, likely slowing exports, and Beijing's enforcement of property sector tightening and green measures,"" Nomura wrote in a note. 
High commodity prices in recent months have hurt the profitability of many medium-sized and downstream factories.
To cool prices, China will auction more industrial metals from its state stockpiles next month in a rare release of inventories. Prior to this year, Beijing had not sold off state metal reserves for more than a decade.
Earlier this month, China also released crude oil from its strategic reserves for the first time.
POWER CRISIS
New headwinds are also building as China's efforts to meet carbon emissions goals lead to wider curbs on electricity use, particularly on energy-intensive plants and businesses.
Local governments in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Yunnan and Guangdong provinces have told factories to limit power usage or curb output. In the past week, electricity rationing has severely hit China's northeast.
""We estimate two months of electricity rationing from mid-September in selected provinces will cut 0.1 percentage point from 2021 GDP growth and 0.3 percentage point from 2022 GDP growth,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) wrote in a research note. 
""The combined share of the industrial sector in affected provinces with power rationing is about 14% of Chinese GDP.""
Tight coal supplies and higher prices of the fuel have also eroded the bottom-lines of power companies.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales dived for a third straight month in August as half the population were trapped in coronavirus lockdowns, though reopening is in sight as vaccinations race toward world-beating levels.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday showed retail sales fell 1.7% in August to A$29.3 billion ($21.27 billion). That followed a 2.7% drop in July, but did beat market forecasts of a 2.5% slide.
The A$360 billion retail sector accounts for around 18% of gross domestic product and further weakness is expected this month with Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra all locked down. 
While the entire economy is certain to shrink sharply this quarter, relief is in sight with New South Wales just a couple of weeks from easing restrictions as people flock to get jabbed.
After an agonisingly slow start, almost 86% of the adult population in NSW have now had a first shot and 60% are double dosed. By the end of October, the state is expected to pass world leader Portugal which has 84% fully vaccinated.
For Australia as a whole, 77% have had their first dose and the fully vaccinated share will soon surpass the United States.
""At reopening, spending will be driven by pent‑up demand after months of lockdown and accumulated savings,"" said CBA economist Stephen Wu.
""But we expect bumps along the way as some consumers will be initially wary of catching the virus or from coming into contact with the virus and being forced into isolation.""
Yet the pandemic has also massively accelerated the adoption of online sales both by consumers and retailers. Online sales of food have doubled on pre-pandemic levels and even fine dining restaurants have gotten into the game, selling take-away courses and assemble-at-home gourmet meal kits.
It has been a life saver for hard-pressed department stores with annual sales booming by more than 50%.
Analysts at NAB estimate Australians spent almost A$51 billion on online retail in the year to August, an annual increase of around 30% and twice the levels seen pre-pandemic. 

The bonanza, however, is stretching supply chains and pushing up costs. Australia Post recently boasted its busiest day ever and warned customers to shop early for Christmas.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders and shipments of key U.S.-made capital goods increased solidly in August amid strong demand for computers and electronic products, keeping business spending on equipment on track for another quarter of robust growth.
The sustained strength in business investment is expected to limit the hit on economic growth from an anticipated slowdown in consumer spending in the third quarter as the boost from fiscal stimulus fades and COVID-19 infections flare up. Demand for goods is being driven by businesses desperate to replenish inventories, but strained supply chains remain a challenge.
""The outlook for business equipment investment remains bright, with the latest business surveys suggesting growth will be sustained close to the pace seen in recent quarters,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""The resilience of investment is one reason why we expect overall GDP growth will slow marginally in the third quarter, despite a bigger slump in consumption growth.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.5% last month, the Commerce Department said on Monday. 
Data for July was revised higher to show these so-called core capital goods orders gaining 0.3% instead of the previously reported 0.1%. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders increasing 0.4%. 
Orders shot up 16.4% on a year-on-year basis and are 18% above their pre-pandemic level. That is boosting manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, though an acute shortage labor as well as raw materials such as semiconductors are making it harder for factories to fulfill orders.
Last month, orders for computers and electronic products rose 1.4%. There were also increases in orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components, as well as fabricated metal products. But orders for machinery fell as did those for primary metals. 
Shipments of core capital goods advanced 0.7% last month after increasing 0.9% in July. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. Business spending on equipment has logged four straight quarters of double-digit growth.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
LEAN INVENTORIES 
There were increases in shipments of machinery as well as computers and electronic products. But shipments of electrical equipment, appliances and components fell. 
Supply constraints, underscored by a building up of unfilled orders, and a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus prompted economists early this month to slash their estimates for third-quarter GDP to as low as 3.5% annualized rate from as high as a 9% pace. The economy grew at a 6.6% pace in the second quarter.
Unfilled core capital goods orders rose 1.0% in August after a similar gain in July. This together with extremely lean inventories after they were depleted in the first half of the year should keep manufacturing well supported.
""The fact that unfilled orders are outpacing actual orders and shipments suggests that the anecdotes of companies turning away business for lack of supplies and needed help on the labor front are endemic to the broader economy,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""Even once bottlenecks ease, the manufacturing sector will still have plenty of work to chip away at."" 
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, accelerated 1.8% after climbing 0.5% in July. They were boosted by a 5.5% rebound in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 0.4% fall in July.
Orders for civilian aircraft soared 77.9%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received 53 aircraft orders last month compared to 31 in July. 
But orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 3.1% after rising 5.3% in July. General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford this month announced further production cuts as they adjust their schedules to manage their chip supply. 
Unfilled orders of durable goods increased 1.0% last month after rising 0.5% in July. Durable goods inventories climbed 0.8%, matching July's gain.

""Inventory levels of final goods have been run down, but the durables report shows inventories of manufactured goods steadily increasing,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. 
""In some sectors this is because supply-chain issues are emerging after some degree of manufacturing has taken place, meaning partially completed goods, most notably autos, are reflected in the report.""

493,"<span>Sep 27, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Orders placed with U.S. manufacturers for business equipment strengthened in August, extending to six months a solid run of robust capital investment that’s helping fuel economic growth.
The value of core capital goods orders, which exclude aircraft and military hardware and is seen as a barometer of business equipment investment, increased 0.5% after an upwardly revised 0.3% a month earlier, Commerce Department figures showed Monday.
Bookings for all durable goods -- or items meant to last at least three years -- rose 1.8% from the prior month, reflecting a pickup in orders for commercial aircraft.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.4% increase in core capital goods orders and a 0.7% gain in total durables. 
Business outlays for capital goods such as electronics, construction machinery and power generating equipment have been a key source of strength for the economy. Resilient consumer spending against a backdrop of lean inventories has also propelled demand for durables, even as capacity constraints frustrate factory production efforts.
Core capital goods shipments, a figure that will be used to calculate investment in the government’s third-quarter gross domestic product report, rose 0.7% after a 0.9% gain. 
Bookings for commercial aircraft increased nearly 78%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. earlier reported 53 orders in August, up from 31 a month earlier. The government’s data aren’t always directly comparable on a month-to-month basis.
Outside of the volatile commercial aircraft category, bookings were mixed. While orders rose for communications equipment, electrical hardware and fabricated metals, they declined for motor vehicles, computers and machinery.
Unfilled orders for manufactured durable goods and inventories both rose, illustrating lingering bottlenecks and long lead times faced by manufacturers.
These supply chain disruptions help explain softness in recent manufacturing surveys. A recent survey of purchasing managers by IHS Markit showed an index of manufacturing slipped to a five-month low in September. A measure of order backlogs, however, climbed to the highest in data back to 2007.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Widening power shortages in China have halted production at numerous factories including many supplying Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), while some shops in the northeast operated by candlelight and malls shut early as the economic toll of the squeeze mounted.
China is in the grip of a power crunch as a shortage of coal supplies, toughening emissions standards and strong demand from manufacturers and industry have pushed coal prices to record highs and triggered widespread curbs on usage.
Rationing has been implemented during peak hours in many parts of northeastern China since last week, and residents of cities including Changchun said cuts were occurring sooner and lasting for longer, state media reported. 
On Monday, State Grid Corp pledged to ensure basic power supply and avoid electricity cuts.
The power crunch has hurt production in industries across several regions of China and is dragging on the country's economic growth outlook, analysts said. 
The impact on homes and non-industrial users comes as night-time temperatures slip to near-freezing in China's northernmost cities. The National Energy Administration (NEA) has told coal and natural gas firms to ensure sufficient energy supplies to keep homes warm during winter. 
Liaoning province said power generation had declined significantly since July, and the supply gap widened to a ""severe level"" last week. It expanded power cuts from industrial firms to residential areas last week. 
The city of Huludao told residents not to use high energy-consuming electronics like water heaters and microwave ovens during peak periods, and a resident of Harbin city in Heilongjiang province told Reuters that many shopping malls were closing earlier than usual at 4 p.m. (0800 GMT). 
Given the current power situation ""the orderly use of electricity in Heilongjiang will continue for a period of time,"" CCTV quoted the provincial economic planner as saying.
The power squeeze is unnerving Chinese stock markets at a time when the world's second-largest economy is already showing signs of slowing.
China's economy is grappling with curbs on the property and tech sectors and concerns around the future of cash-strapped real estate giant China Evergrande.
PRODUCTION FALLOUT 
Tight coal supplies, due in part to a pickup in industrial activity as the economy recovered from the pandemic, and toughening emission standards have driven the power shortages across China.
China has vowed to cut energy intensity - the amount of energy consumed per unit of economic growth - by around 3% in 2021 to meet its climate goals. Provincial authorities have also stepped up the enforcement of emissions curbs in recent months after only 10 of 30 mainland regions managed to achieve their energy goals in the first half of the year.
China's focus on energy intensity and decarbonization is unlikely to abate, analysts said, ahead of COP26 climate talks - as the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference is known - which will be held in November in Glasgow and where world leaders will lay out their climate agendas.
The power pinch has been affecting manufacturers in key industrial hubs on the eastern and southern coasts for weeks. Several key suppliers of Apple and Tesla halted production at some plants.
At least 15 Chinese companies have said in exchange filings that production had been disrupted by power curbs, while more than 30 Taiwan-listed firms with China operations had stopped work to comply with the power limits.
The steel, aluminium and cement industries have also been hard hit by the output curbs, with about 7% of aluminium production capacity suspended and 29% of national cement production affected,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts wrote in a Monday note. Paper and glass could be the next industries to face supply disruptions, they said.
Producers of chemicals, dyes, furniture and soymeal have also been affected.
GDP CUTS
The fallout of the power shortage has prompted some analysts to downgrade their 2021 growth outlook.
Nomura cut its third and fourth-quarter China GDP growth forecasts to 4.7% and 3.0%, respectively, from 5.1% and 4.4% previously, and its full-year forecast to 7.7% from 8.2%.
""The power-supply shock in the world's second-biggest economy and biggest manufacturer will ripple through and impact global markets,"" analysts at Nomura said in a Sept. 24 note, warning that global supplies of textiles, toys and machine parts could be affected.
Morgan Stanley analysts said production cuts, if prolonged, could knock 1 percentage point off China's GDP growth in the fourth quarter. 

Last week, major coal producers in China met to try and resolve shortages and curb price increases. 
China, the world's biggest energy consumer and source of climate-warming greenhouse gas, has said it aims to bring carbon emissions to a peak by 2030 and to net zero by 2060.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob on Monday tabled a new five-year economic plan, boosting infrastructure spending and committing to a carbon tax under climate change goals as the country looks to chart its way out of a pandemic-induced slump. 
Launching the 12th Malaysia Plan in parliament, Ismail Sabri said the country's financial position was expected to improve in 2023, with the economy targeted to grow 4.5%-5.5% per annum in the next five years. 
Malaysia posted average annual growth of 2.7% between 2016-2020, dragged down by a 5.6% contraction last year due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the premier said. 
Gross national income per capita rose to 42,500 ringgit ($10,150) in 2020, about 20% lower than the level required to become a high-income country. Malaysia now expects to reach that target by 2025, Ismail Sabri said. 
""The 12th Malaysia Plan is a comprehensive development plan that will introduce a number of reforms to ensure sustainable economic growth and more equal distribution of opportunities and results,"" Ismail Sabri said.
Malaysia's export-driven economy has taken a hit from the pandemic. The central bank slashed its full-year growth forecast to 3.0%-4.0% from 6-7.5% last month - the second cut this year. 
The government will spend 400 billion ringgit ($95.53 billion) on existing and new development projects between 2021 and 2025, compared with 260 billion ringgit in the 11th Malaysia plan, Ismail Sabri said.
These include new highways and rail networks linking rural areas with urban and industrial hubs, more affordable housing, as well as improvements in health, education, and broadband connectivity. 
Malaysia also aims to become a carbon neutral country by 2050, Ismail Sabri said, adding that economic instruments such as carbon pricing and a carbon tax will be introduced. 
The government also pledged to stop building coal-fired power stations, as it continues its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity of GDP by 45% in 2030, the premier said.

Other promises included plans to reduce the country's dependence on foreign labour, provide support to small and medium-sized businesses, and turn Malaysia into a regional investment hub.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Early in the pandemic, there were encouraging and surprising signs about the decline of credit card debt.
Now, that trendline seems to be changing.
Many Americans stayed at home at the start of COVID-19 and did not spend like they usually do. They also received several rounds of emergency cash assistance, helping to chop away at those credit-card bills, at least temporarily.
Spending is ticking back up – and the results are starting to show up on our monthly statements.
In fact, 42% of those with credit card debt, or 59 million Americans, say they have added to their balances since the beginning of the pandemic, according to a new study by personal finance site Bankrate.com.
""Things are better for some, but they are not better for everybody,"" explains Ted Rossman, Bankrate’s senior industry analyst. 
The end of stimulus checks, expanded unemployment benefits and the eviction moratorium does not bode well for debt management, Rossman added.
This trend reversal is reflected in the most recent numbers of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Its Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit found that credit-card bills rose by $17 billion in 2021’s second quarter, to $790 billion nationally. That was the first uptick after four straight quarters of declines.
Also headed north were auto loans, by $33 billion in the quarter, and mortgage debt, by $282 billion. All told it makes for total household debt of $14.96 trillion, a quarterly rise of 2.1%.
DIFFERENT DEBT, DIFFERENT STRATEGIES
Of course, not all debt is the same, nor should it automatically be considered a bad thing. The rise in mortgage debt can be attributed to many people buying homes in a hot real estate market – and with interest rates near historic lows, that is not necessarily a concern for household balance sheets.
Credit card debt is especially pernicious, though. It can be very challenging to escape as balances rise to a certain level, combined with sky-high interest on revolving debt – average rates are currently north of 16%, according to Bankrate. Add in late fees or missed payments, and the cycle is hard to break.
Those concerns are highlighted in a recent survey by real estate firm Clever. Almost one in five of those with credit card debt, 18%, report having bills over $20,000. Meanwhile 40% of those who carry a monthly balance haven’t been debt-free from credit cards since before 2018, and 15% have been struggling with it for more than 15 years.
""We also found that 57% of people had missed a credit-card payment, and the majority of those were in the past year,"" says Francesca Ortegren, lead researcher for Clever. ""It could cause a snowball effect over time, and make it much harder to climb out.""
Chronic debt can make people feel pretty bleak. A third of those with credit card debt think it will take at least a couple of years to pay it off, and 20% say three years or more, according to Clever. Most depressing of all, 3% think it will never be possible.
CHARTING A WAY OUT
To be sure, there are glimmers of good news in the debt data. Even though credit card bills are once again headed back up, the early-pandemic declines means that total amounts are still $140 billion below the end of 2019's levels, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. And student loan debt actually dropped in the second quarter of 2021, by $14 billion.
Meanwhile personal savings rates are still elevated, compared to historic norms. And debt delinquencies and defaults are relatively modest, notes Bankrate’s Rossman -- which is somewhat surprising, given the length and breadth of our ongoing pandemic crisis.
What Rossman worries about: That our early-pandemic frugality will fall by the wayside, and the urge to get out and spend after being cooped up for so long will throw whatever progress we have made into reverse.

Instead, Americans should be proactive. He suggests: Take advantage of the growing number of 0% card balance-transfer offers, partner with nonprofit credit counselors like Money Management International or GreenPath, or pay off high-rate cards with a lower-rate personal loan.
""It would be nice if we could keep lower balances as a part of our future,"" Rossman says. ""You don’t want to throw that all away and run those balances right back up – because this is very expensive debt.""

BRIGHTON, England (Reuters) -BP said nearly a third of its British petrol stations had run out of the two main grades of fuel on Sunday as panic buying forced the government to suspend competition laws and allow firms to work together to ease shortages.
Lines of vehicles formed at petrol stations for a third day running as motorists waited, some for hours, to fill up with fuel after oil firms reported a lack of drivers was causing transport problems from refineries to forecourts.
Some operators have had to ration supplies and others to close gas stations.
""With the intense demand seen over the past two days, we estimate that around 30% of sites in this network do not currently have either of the main grades of fuel,"" BP (NYSE:BP), which operates 1,200 sites in Britain, said in statement.
""We are working to resupply as rapidly as possible.""
The fuel panic comes as Britain faces several crises: an international gas price surge that is forcing energy firms out of business, a related shortage of carbon dioxide that threatens to derail meat production, and a shortage of truck drivers that is playing havoc with retailers and leaving some shelves bare.
Anglo-Dutch oil group Shell (LON:RDSa) said that it had also seen increased demand for fuel.
In response business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said he was suspending competition laws to allow firms to share information and coordinate their response.
""This step will allow government to work constructively with fuel producers, suppliers, hauliers and retailers to ensure that disruption is minimised as far as possible,"" the business department said in a statement. 
Transport minister Grant Shapps had earlier appealed for calm, saying the shortages were purely caused by panic buying, and that the situation would eventually resolve itself because fuel could not be stockpiled.
""There's plenty of fuel, there's no shortage of the fuel within the country,"" Shapps told Sky News.
""So the most important thing is actually that people carry on as they normally would and fill up their cars when they normally would, then you won't have queues and you won't have shortages at the pump either.""
After meeting Kwarteng, industry figures including representatives from Shell and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) said in a joint statement issued by the business department that they had been reassured, and stressed there was no national fuel shortage.
'MANUFACTURED SITUATION'
Earlier, Shapps said the shortage of truck drivers was down to COVID-19 disrupting the qualification process, preventing new labour from entering the market.
Others pinned the blame on Brexit and poor working conditions forcing out foreign drivers.
The government on Sunday announced a plan to issue temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers.
But business leaders have warned the government's plan is a short-term fix and will not solve an acute labour shortage that risks major disruption beyond fuel deliveries, including for retailers in the run-up to Christmas.
Shapps called the panic over fuel a ""manufactured situation"" and blamed it on a hauliers' association.
""They're desperate to have more European drivers undercutting British salaries,"" he said.

An Opinium poll published in the Observer newspaper on Sunday said that 67% of voters believe the government has handled the crisis badly. A majority of 68% said that Brexit was partly to blame.
Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, speaking at his party's annual conference in southern England, said ministers had failed to plan for labour shortages following the 2016 Brexit vote and called for a bigger temporary visa scheme.

The country, which until late April had maintained one of the world's best containment records, is seeking to co-exist with the virus instead of trying to maintain a COVID-zero policy. 
The current outbreak and related restrictions on movement have impacted its manufacturing-led economy, forcing the closure of some factories.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes increased for a second straight month in August, but demand for housing has probably peaked after a COVID-19 pandemic-fueled buying frenzy.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed the supply of new homes on the market last month was the largest in nearly 13 years, with prices unchanged on a monthly basis. It followed on the heels of news on Wednesday that sales of previously owned homes fell in August. 
""These data suggest that the surge in new home sales during the pandemic has ebbed and inventories of unsold homes have risen to a more normal level in relation to sales,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""This report and the existing home sales data for August suggest that a considerable portion of the flow adjustment of sales to higher demand may have taken place.""
New home sales rose 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 740,000 units last month. July's sales pace was revised up to 729,000 units from the previously reported 708,000 units. 
Sales increased 6.0% in the populous South and gained 1.4% in the West. They soared 26.1% in the Northeast, but tumbled 31.1% in the Midwest. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11.2% of U.S. home sales, increasing to a rate of 714,000 units.
Sales decreased 24.3% on a year-on-year basis in August. They have struggled to post significant gains since surging to a rate of 993,000 units in January, which was the highest since the end of 2006. Builders have been constrained by higher prices for inputs, as well as shortages of land and labor. 
About 78% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.
""This report continues to highlight the ongoing difficulties that homebuilders are facing as they attempt to work through their current construction backlog, due to a shortage of labor and elevated material costs and outright shortages,"" said Mark Palim, deputy chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower as worries persisted about the spillover from debt-laden China Evergrande. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
(GRAPHIC: New home sales - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dwpkrdqzwvm/nhs.png) 
DEMAND LIKELY PEAKED 
The coronavirus pandemic sparked an exodus from cities as Americans worked from home and took classes online. That boosted demand for bigger homes in the suburbs and other low-density areas, which far outpaced supply, causing bidding wars. 
But demand has likely peaked. The National Association of Realtors reported on Wednesday that sales of previously owned homes fell in August, with house prices continuing to moderate sharply after posting record increases in May. 
Some sellers are reducing their asking prices and consumer sentiment towards buying a home has shifted. 
Demand for housing could cool after the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it would likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November and signaled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected.
Still, the fundamentals for the housing market remain strong. A tightening labor market is lifting wages. The new housing market remains underpinned by an acute shortage of previously owned home. 
The median new house price shot up 20.1% in August to $390,000 from a year ago. Prices were unchanged on a monthly basis. Last month, new home sales remained concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. 
Sales in the under-$200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for just 3% of transactions.
There were 378,000 new homes on the market in August. That was the most since October 2008, and up from 366,000 in July. Houses under construction made up 62.7% of the inventory, with homes yet to be built accounting for a record 27.8%.

""The need to work through these backlogs should support new home construction in the months ahead even if the pace of sales moves sideways,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
At August's sales pace it would take 6.1 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 6.0 months in July.

BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -German business morale fell for the third month running in September, hit by a ""bottleneck recession"" for manufacturers in Europe's largest economy that shows no sign of easing, a survey showed on Friday.
The Ifo institute said its business climate index fell to 98.8 from an upwardly revised 99.6 in August. A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a September reading of 98.9.
""Problems in the procurement of raw materials and intermediate products are putting the brakes on the German economy,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement.
""Manufacturing is experiencing a bottleneck recession.""
A separate survey on Thursday also showed Germany's economic recovery from the pandemic lost momentum https://reut.rs/3hXp2yy in September as activity in both the manufacturing and services sectors slowed amid supply bottlenecks and waning catch-up effects.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said almost 80% of manufacturers surveyed had complained of intermediate goods shortages, up from 70% last month.
""The supply crisis will remain until at least the end of the year,"" he added. ""The peak lies ahead.""
Adding to the uncertainty facing Germany's economic outlook, the country votes in a national election on Sunday, after which Chancellor Angela Merkel plans to stand down. With the vote fractured, there are multiple potential coalition outcomes https://reut.rs/2ZeqYw3. 
On Wednesday, Ifo said it had cut its growth forecast https://reut.rs/3nU3Ux5 for the German economy for this year as supply chain disruptions and a scarcity of chips and other intermediate goods were slowing down the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The institute now sees Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) growing 2.5% this year, down 0.8 percentage points from its previous forecast, and 5.1% next year, up 0.8 points.
The weaker-than-expected rebound in 2021 follows a 4.6% plunge of overall economic output in 2020 caused by coronavirus restrictions on public life and business activities to contain the spread of the highly infectious disease.
Jens-Oliver Niklasch, economist at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, said: ""We are likely to face a difficult fourth quarter, in which the supply chain issue could even replace Corona as the main risk. And Corona is by no means over.""

The government, which so far has been forecasting growth of 3.5% for this year and 3.6% for next, will update its estimates in October.
A survey by the VDMA engineering industry association published last week showed most German mechanical engineering firms were facing noticeable or serious supply chain problems, with production growth expected to be affected next year.

Taiwan's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, jumped 17.6% from a year earlier to $53.5 billion in August, data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed on Friday. 
While that was the 18th month of expansion, the pace was slower than the median forecast of a rise of 20.7% in a Reuters poll. 
Huang Yu-ling, head of the ministry's statistics department, told reporters that orders for new smartphones were weaker than expected, and fewer people working from home as pandemic lockdown rules eased also affected orders, meaning they needed to buy fewer tablets and laptops.
Taiwanese companies such as Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and other global tech firms.
Apple unveiled the iPhone 13 and a new iPad mini last week, expanding 5G connectivity and showing off faster chips and sharper cameras without raising the phone's price. 
Looking ahead, the ministry warned COVID-19 cases could pick up globally ahead of winter adding uncertainty to the economic outlook.
However, more consumer electronic products coming to market and ""flourishing"" demand for electric vehicles will help support Taiwan's export order momentum, it added. 
In July, export orders leapt 21.4% from a year earlier to $55.3 billion.
The second half of the year is typically stronger due to high demand for electronics during the year-end holiday shopping season in Europe and the United States.
The ministry said it expects export orders in September to rise between 15.9% and 18.9% from a year earlier. 

Orders from the United States rose 19.2% in August from a year earlier, a faster rate of expansion compared with the 16.5% logged in July, while orders from China were up 15.9%, versus a gain of 20.1% the previous month.

ROME (Reuters) - Prime Minister Mario Draghi set an ambitious reform timeline to relaunch Italy's chronically sluggish economy after the COVID-19 pandemic, but political disputes and cloying bureaucracy are starting to get in his way. 
The government has been trying for weeks to overcome divisions in the multi-party ruling coalition over a tax reform and a market competition law which Draghi had promised by the end of July as part of Rome's Recovery Plan.
Presented to the European Union in April, the Plan sets out infrastructure investments and reforms to raise Italy's growth potential and obtain more than 200 billion euros ($234.52 billion) of EU funds over the next six years.
""The delays in the reforms put at risk the next tranches of EU money, and above all they push back what is most important, that the Recovery Plan is put into action fast and effectively,"" Carlo Bonomi, head of employers lobby Confindustria told its annual assembly on Thursday. 
Draghi made a solid start, meeting initial requirements needed to unlock a first tranche of 25 billion euros, which was paid by the EU in August.
He also hammered out a coalition deal to pass a fiercely contested reform of the criminal justice system, while new rules to speed up civil cases are close to approval in parliament.
However, of the 51 goals set in the Recovery Plan for 2021, 38 are left for the fourth quarter, and the government seems to be faltering just when it needs to accelerate.
Special commissioners responsible for overseeing infrastructure projects in the plan recently wrote to the government complaining that red tape is hindering their work, one of the commissioners told Reuters, asking not to be named.
Another commissioner, Pasqualino Monti, who is in charge of ports in western Sicily, warned that if the state bureaucracy continues to act as a brake on projects ""we will hit an obstacle as insurmountable as the Great Wall of China"".
In a statement after Thursday's cabinet meeting, the government urged ministers to present a road map for all the interventions needed and said it is considering new measures to speed up the projects.
Meetings will be called of all the administrations involved to monitor the progress of the national recovery plan and highlight any hurdles.
Draghi is running up against the same difficulties that have hobbled Italy for decades: political fragmentation, bureaucracy and almost constant electioneering.
Big cities including Rome and Milan will elect new mayors on Oct. 3-4, and the parties in Draghi's national unity government are unwilling to take any steps that could upset their voters.
""The problems Draghi is having now were inevitable,"" said Eugenio Pizzimenti, a politics professor at Pisa University.
""We have been living under a collective illusion that a group of technocrats could fix everything, but these are political decisions, not technical ones, and conflicting interests are at stake.""
NATIONAL SAVIOURS
There are parallels between Draghi and Mario Monti, another non-partisan technocrat who led a similarly broad coalition for just over a year from 2011, when he took office at the height of a debt crisis.
Monti, like Draghi, was initially hailed as a national saviour, but after he passed swingeing budget cuts and a tough pension reform the parties turned against him, his government lost momentum and his personal popularity slumped.
Draghi, whose term ends in 2023, has one big advantage: whereas Monti had to make cuts, he has billions of euros of extra spending to allocate - provided the investment and reform momentum is maintained.
The aim of the delayed tax reform is to simplify the system, reduce income tax and curb evasion, while the competition law is needed to ensure a level playing field for infrastructure investments in ports, telecoms and the national power grid.
Both are being held up by political bickering.
The government, which has said the tax reform will not weigh on public finances, wants to update the taxable value of Italian real estate, which is usually far below real market values.
This is opposed by the right-wing League and Silvio Berlusconi's conservative Forza Italia, key coalition parties.
Both present themselves as staunch defenders of home-owners and say the government's plan is unacceptable because it will result in higher housing levies.
""We defend the right to property. This is not the time to raise taxes,"" said Antonio Tajani, Forza Italia's deputy leader.
Similar tensions are blocking the competition law, with both parties rejecting plans to liberalise the lucrative concessions to run tourist services on Italy's beaches.
These concessions are traditionally family-owned and passed down from one generation to another, despite repeated calls by the European Commission for them to be offered at open tenders.
Politics professor Pizzimenti said the huge differences in Draghi's coalition meant such disputes were only likely to get worse, resulting in more delays and weak reforms.

""I think sooner or later Brussels will tell us we haven't done what we promised,"" he said.

506,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 08:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s consumer prices stopped falling in August for the first time in 13 months, ending the country’s longest deflationary stretch since 2011.
Prices, excluding those for fresh food, were unchanged from a year earlier, the ministry of internal affairs reported Friday in a result that matched the estimate from analysts. Rising costs for hotels, processed food and energy cushioned the impact of mobile phone rates that have fallen sharply under pressure from outgoing Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. 
 
Despite August’s slightly improved reading, Japan’s weak inflation pulse has trapped the Bank of Japan in a holding-pattern while the Federal Reserve and other central banks move toward reining in pandemic stimulus. The BOJ on Wednesday kept its key stimulus tools in place and is likely stuck for the foreseeable future.
“At least we can say prices aren’t falling, so the BOJ can continue to keep a close eye on it, without taking additional easing steps,” said economist Taro Saito at NLI Research Institute. 
While producer prices have jumped recently, climbing 5.5% in August, most Japanese firms aren’t choosing to pass those costs on to customers. Notable exceptions include Yamazaki Baking and dairy company Megmilk Snow Brand, which recently hiked prices due to higher costs of raw materials from oil to sugar.
BOJ Flags Pressure on Economy Ahead of Japan Leadership Vote
Global supply-chain snags and surging commodities prompted the Paris-based OECD this week to raise its forecast for consumer price inflation this year and next in every Group of Seven country, except Japan.
August’s inflation report continued to show the numbers being swayed by government initiatives that analysts say have made it hard to grasp underyling price trends.
The cost of hotel accommodation rose nearly 50% compared with the level last summer, when the government’s “Go-To Travel” discounts to help the ailing tourism industry had just gone into effect. 
BOJ Flags Pressure on Economy Ahead of Japan Leadership Vote
Moving in the opposite direction, the cost of mobile phone service fell by almost the same amount, shaving 1.2 percentage points from the overall price index. Getting phone companies to slash rates was a top priority of the Suga administration. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“We expect the core CPI to rise 0.2% in September, supported by higher energy prices. Beyond that, pent-up demand and a lower base for energy prices last year will support inflation toward the end of the year, assuming virus infections are brought under control by September.”
--Yuki Masujima, economist

With more expensive energy and the continuing hotel-effect, some small price gains should start to take hold in Japan, especially as higher vaccination rates begin to allow for restrictions on businesses to be lifted and shoppers get out more. The latest state of emergency is set to last through the month. 
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is preparing next week to pick a replacement for Suga, with the new leader widely expected to put together a stimulus package to help the economy get back on a firmer recovery track.

(Reuters) -U.S. household wealth jumped to a new high of $141.7 trillion at the end of June, a report from the Federal Reserve showed on Thursday, boosted by stock market gains and a pandemic-induced real-estate boom. 
Soaring equity markets fueled the increase in overall wealth, adding $3.5 trillion to household assets in the second quarter - a period in which the S&P 500 saw a total return of just over 8.5% after factoring in reinvested dividends. 
Rising real estate values added around $1.2 trillion, according to the U.S. central bank's latest quarterly report https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1 on household, business and government financial accounts.
Overall U.S. household wealth rose by $5.9 trillion from the first quarter.
The amount held in household savings deposits fell to $10.6 trillion in the second quarter from $10.8 trillion in the first quarter. Balances in checking accounts rose to $3.6 trillion from $3.3 trillion in the first quarter, the report showed. 
The latest snapshot of U.S. household wealth and how it has grown over the coronavirus pandemic shows just how unique the downturn has proven to be. With the help of unparalleled monetary and fiscal policy responses that fortified personal balance sheets and sent asset prices soaring, household wealth has rocketed by $31 trillion - 28% - since the first quarter of 2020, an unprecedented increase. 
Much of the support offered to households, including enhanced unemployment benefits or mortgage forbearance, has either ended or will be expiring in the coming months, just as a resurgence in COVID-19 infections is hurting some vulnerable sectors and slowing job growth.
The report showed that household debt grew at an annualized rate of 7.9% in the second quarter, compared to 6.7% in the first quarter. 

Non-financial business borrowing rose at a slower annualized rate of 1.4%, compared to 4.3% in the first quarter. 
And government borrowing increased at an annualized rate of 9.6%, up from 9.0% the previous quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, boosted by surges in California and Virginia, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a steadily recovering labor market. 
The second straight weekly increase in jobless claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday puzzled economists. Some pointed a finger at the wildfires in California, while others blamed Hurricane Ida, which devastated U.S. offshore energy production in late August. There was little conviction that ongoing COVID-19 infections, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, were a factor.
""Some, but not all, of this recent pickup looks related to Hurricane Ida, as filings in Louisiana have been above their pre-storm trend in recent weeks,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But even including any storm-related claims, the recent move up in filings has not looked particularly severe so far, and we don't think the labor market recovery has been derailed at this point."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 351,000 for the week ended Sept. 18. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 320,000 applications for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims in California jumped 24,221 while Virginia reported a rise of 12,879. There were also notable increases in Oregon, Ohio and Kentucky. Claims in Louisiana fell and have been above their pre-hurricane trend in recent weeks.
""Perhaps fires in California and the lingering impact of Ida in Virginia contributed to those increases, but we don't know for certain,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We expect claims to return to their downward path in the weeks ahead, but the data will be more uneven as claims get closer to pre-pandemic levels.""
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 750 to 335,750 last week. That was the lowest level since mid-March 2020 when mandatory closures of nonessential businesses were enforced when the nation was slammed by the first wave of coronavirus cases. 
Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020, but still remain above the 200,000-250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with healthy labor market conditions. 
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday struck an upbeat note on the economy, paving the way to reduce its monthly bond purchases ""soon"" and signaling interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected.
A survey on Thursday from data firm IHS Markit showed business activity grew at its slowest pace in a year in September as companies struggled with ongoing shortages of raw materials and labor.
But the slowdown is likely temporary. A third report from the Conference Board showed its leading economic index, a gauge of future U.S. economic activity, increased 0.9% in August after rising 0.8% in July. The Conference Board said ""the trend in the LEI is consistent with robust economic growth in the reminder of the year."" 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
WORKER SHORTAGES 
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for the nonfarm payrolls portion of September's employment report. Claims were little changed between the August and September payrolls survey periods.
Job growth slowed in August, with payrolls posting their smallest gain in seven months as hiring stalled in the high-contact leisure and hospitality sector. 
The claims report also showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid increased 131,000 to 2.845 million in the week ended Sept. 11. Data next week on the so-called continuing claims will offer more clues on how hiring fared in September. 
Pandemic-related factors are causing worker shortages, which are constraining hiring. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday that he anticipated ""more rapid gains in employment"" as these factors, which include lack of affordable childcare and fears contracting the virus, diminish.
There were a record 10.9 million job openings at the end of July. The Fed projected the unemployment rate to be at 4.8% this year. That was up from the 4.5% rate the U.S. central bank projected in June. The jobless rate was 5.2% in August.
There is cautious optimism that the labor crunch will ease following the expiration of government-funded unemployment benefits early this month, which had been blamed by businesses and Republicans for encouraging the unemployed to stay at home. 
At least 11.250 million people were receiving benefits under all programs during the week ended Sept. 4. According to Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at the Century Foundation, more than 8 million people have lost all their pandemic benefits.

It is, however, unlikely that this would boost the labor pool. An early termination of expanded benefits by about 25 states led by Republican governors over the summer did not led to a surge in hiring in those areas and the Delta variant could cause reluctance among some people to return to work.
""For the labor market, recovery is ongoing, but supply shortages remain a headwind,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business activity expanded at its slowest pace in a year in September amid relentless supply constraints and peaking demand, in line with expectations for a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter. 
Data firm IHS Markit said on Thursday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to 54.5 this month. That was the lowest reading since September 2020 and followed 55.4 in August. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector.
Businesses are struggling with perennial shortages of raw materials and labor as the economy normalizes following unprecedented disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
There had been optimism that the supply chains would adjust soon, but the Delta variant of the coronavirus has worsened the scarcity of some raw materials, produced primarily in Southeast Asia. Congestion at ports in China is also contributing to keeping the supply chains tight.
Economists are anticipating a significant slowdown in gross domestic product this quarter also as the boost from pandemic relief money from the government fades. Growth estimates for the third quarter are as low as a 2.6% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.6% pace in the April-June quarter.
With bottlenecks in the supply chains persisting, businesses continued to pay higher prices for inputs, a sign that inflation could remain hot for a while even though the monthly pace of consumer price increases has been slowing in recent months. 
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its projection for its key inflation measure to 3.7% this year from 3.0% in June. The U.S. central bank has a flexible 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that ""hiring difficulties and other constraints could again prove to be greater and longer lasting than anticipated, posing upside risks to inflation."" 
The IHS Markit survey's flash services sector PMI fell to a 14-month low reading of 54.4 in September from 55.1 in August, Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 55 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
The moderation in growth reflected less robust demand conditions and ongoing COVID-19 worries. According to the survey, sales were also hampered by a faster pace of decline in new export orders.

Manufacturing is also losing steam. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI fell to 60.5 this month from a reading of 61.1 in August. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, would edged up to 61.5.
Manufacturers reported longer lead times as trucking issues and capacity shortages led to what the survey said was one of the greatest deteriorations in vendor performance on record.

Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs rose to 351,000 in the week ended Sept. 18, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a decrease to 320,000 new applications.
Continuing claims for state benefits increased to 2.8 million in the week ended Sept. 11.
The rise in claims reflects the volatility in weekly data as the figure has broadly declined throughout the economic recovery.
Looking ahead, economic growth is expected to slow in the third quarter amid a pullback in stimulus spending. The end of federal pandemic benefits has not yet led to an increase in job applications, according to employers across industries.

MADRID (Reuters) - The pace of Spain's economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis in the second quarter was less than half the initial estimate, official data showed on Thursday, jeopardising upbeat full-year forecasts of a return to pre-pandemic output levels. 
In an unprecedentedly sharp revision, the National Statistics Institute (INE) said the economy grew just 1.1% in the April-June period from the previous quarter, down from a flash estimate of 2.8% released in late July. It also revised the scale of the first-quarter contraction to 0.6% from 0.4%.
Until this revision, the Spanish economy had been recording one of the fastest rebounds among developed countries, after a historic 10.8% slump in 2020.
Just two days ago, the OECD ranked Spain as the fourth-fastest growing economy in the world this year and the Bank of Spain revised higher its full-year growth forecast for 2021 to 6.3%, describing the July estimate for second-quarter expansion as ""a positive and big surprise"".
Economy Minister Nadia Calvino earlier this week announced an expected return to pre-pandemic GDP levels by the end of 2021..
With today's data, such calculations will probably change. 
The INE said its downward revision was prompted by final data on sales, from both large and small companies in the service and manufacturing industries, as well as private consumption. 
'STATISTICAL CHALLENGE'
It now believes the segments most exposed to consumption, such as retail, restaurants and transport, had shrunk 0.4%, while it had previously estimated 5.5% growth. 
""It is a period of large and rapid changes... It poses an unprecedented statistical challenge,"" the INE added.
The INE also revised year-on-year growth for the second quarter to 17.8% from 19.8%. In the same quarter of 2020, Spain was under a strict lockdown. 
""The downward revision of GDP growth... will significantly delay the recovery of the Spanish economy after the COVID-19 crisis and implies a downward bias in our growth scenario for 2021"", said Rafael Domenech, chief economist at BBVA (MC:BBVA).

The Bank of Spain, asked if it would now review its outlook, said it would take the new data into account for future forecasts, adding the INE's July estimate had surprised on the upside.
Skyrocketing electricity prices are also pressuring Spanish household and business spending, the Funcas think-tank said, posing further challenges to Spain's growth.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy lost more momentum this month as businesses grappled again with rising costs, a survey showed, highlighting the difficult backdrop for Bank of England officials ahead of Thursday's interest rate decision.
The preliminary ""flash"" IHS Markit/CIPS flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped for a fourth consecutive month in September to its lowest reading since February, slipping to 54.1 from 54.8 in August.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 54.5. The survey, a gauge of health for Britain's businesses, showed a slowdown in both the services and the manufacturing sectors.
The readings, which will have been seen by BoE officials in advance of the central bank's 1100 GMT policy announcement, add to signs of fading momentum in the economy just as inflation surges, fuelled by global supply chain problems and rising energy prices.
PMI data company IHS Markit said the figures suggested Britain may be on course for a bout of stagflation - a mixture of poor growth and high inflation associated with the economic malaise of the 1970s.
""While the UK PMIs maybe aren't the best place to look for guidance on where GDP is right now, they nevertheless emphasise that the recovery is stalling as we head into winter,"" ING economist James Smith said.
IHS Markit said there were clear signs that shortages of materials and labour were holding back growth. The composite PMI for Britain lagged behind those for France and Germany.
The PMI for the services sector fell to 54.6 in September from 55.0 in August, its lowest level since February when Britain was still in lockdown.
Business expectations among services companies fell to a nine-month low and they raised prices on the broadest basis since records started in the mid-1990s.
""Brexit was often cited as having exacerbated global pandemic-related supply and labour market constraints, as well as often being blamed on lost export sales,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.

While the BoE has said it expects the current rise in inflation to be transitory, the increase has put rate-setters under more pressure to explain how they plan to unwind the stimulus launched last year to help the economy through the COVID-19 pandemic.
The PMI for the manufacturing sector fell to 56.3 in September from 60.3 in August, also marking its lowest level since February.

(Reuters) - Euro zone business growth was much weaker than expected this month as curbs to limit the Delta variant of coronavirus hit demand and already worsened supply-chain constraints pushed input cost rises to an over two-decade high, a survey showed. 
Despite daily infection rates slowing significantly over the past month, most remaining restrictions are unlikely to be lifted anytime soon in major economies, including Germany and France, on concerns over how the pandemic might develop in the months ahead.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, a good gauge of overall economic health, fell to a five-month low of 56.1 in September from 59.0 in August.
Although it stayed above the 50 level separating growth from contraction for the seventh consecutive month, it was well below a Reuters poll estimate of 58.5.
""September's PMIs suggest that the pace of recovery slowed further at the end of Q3, in part as the euro zone economy approaches its pre-virus size but also as supply shortages continue to bite,"" said Jessica Hinds, Europe economist at Capital Economics.
""Price pressures remain intense and sky-high energy prices suggest that these are unlikely to ease any time soon.""
Those supply distortions - one of the primary drivers of prices throughout the globe over past months - are far from resolved and the trend of higher inflation is here to stay. A sub-index tracking input costs throughout the bloc hit its highest in 21 years. 
European Central Bank policymakers recently acknowledged the risk price growth may exceed their relatively benign projections, but will trim emergency bond purchases over the coming quarter.
The Ifo institute on Wednesday cut its 2021 growth forecast for Germany to 2.5%, pointing to supply chain disruptions.
The purchasing managers' surveys told the same story with Germany and France - the bloc's two biggest economies - suffering slowdowns as the bottlenecks put a brake on activity. Both manufacturing and services sectors grew at a weaker than expected pace. 
In Britain, outside the currency union, the economy also lost more momentum as businesses grappled again with rising costs. [GB/PMIS] 
DEMAND WANES 
Optimism about future output fell to an eight-month low. That contrasts with improving consumer sentiment, according to the latest European Commission data.
""Supply constraints are increasingly weighing on confidence. The weaker confidence was across the board,"" said Peter Vanden Houte, chief economist at ING. 
New services business in the bloc expanded at its slowest pace in five months, according to the PMI survey.

Weakening demand led factories to hire at the slowest pace in six months. Meanwhile, their backlogs of work expanded at a robust pace again, signaling worsening supply constraints.
""Overall, today's data confirm our expectation that, contrary to the ECB's forecast, economic growth in the euro area will weaken significantly in the final quarter,"" said Christoph Weil, senior economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).

In a note, S&P Global said it had also revised up its inflation forecast for this year to 2.2% from 1.8%.

As a result, the flash composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, dropped to a seven-month low of 55.3 from 60.0 in August.

""However, despite the slowdown in September, the pace of economic growth in the third quarter still looks to have surpassed the 1.6% expansion seen in the three months to June,"" Smith added.

While companies remained upbeat about their business outlook on hopes that the pandemic could be overcome soon, growth expectations were still held back by supply chain concerns and risks posed to demand from rising prices, Smith said.

The preliminary PMI figure for the manufacturing sector fell to 55.2 points in September from 57.5 in August, and below a forecast for 57.0 points.
IHS Markit said the preliminary September numbers for the composite and manufacturing PMIs marked a five- and eight-month low, respectively.

""Flash PMI data for September provides clear evidence that economic growth in France is cooling,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.

Beijing's wide-ranging crackdown on companies has also unnerved U.S. firms, an American industry lobby executive said. 
The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, which conducted the survey with consultancy PwC China, attributed the renewed optimism to rising revenues as well as ebbing concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic in China, which has largely gotten control over its spread with a zero-tolerance policy. 
U.S.-China relations reached a nadir in 2019 during the Trump administration, which launched a bruising trade war with China and also floated sanctions toward some of China's highest-profile tech companies.
The Biden administration, however, has shown more reservation towards taking direct action against Beijing, though relations remain tense.
“Business in China recovered quickly from last year’s lockdown,"" said Ker Gibbs, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai which published the survey that was conducted between mid-June and mid-July.
""However, we are still feeling the pandemic’s effects, with members continuing to be negatively impacted by China’s travel restrictions. Overall business performance is good but there are signs of nervousness."" 
Of the 338 respondent companies, 78% described themselves as ""optimistic or slightly optimistic"" about their five-year business outlook in 2021, nearly 20 percentage points more from 2020 and a return toward 2018 levels, the survey said. 
By contrast, in 2021, 10% of respondent companies described themselves as ""pessimistic"" about their five-year outlook, compared to 18% and 21% of respondents in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
But firms expressed reservations toward some Chinese policy in the aftermath of COVID-19, especially with respect to hiring labour, the survey said. 
About two-thirds of respondents said they plan to increase their China headcount this year, a 31.4 percentage point increase from 2020, but 62.3% of respondents described workforce availability as posing some hindrance or a serious hindrance to operations. 
China's borders remained closed to most visitors without proper work and residence permits, and all entrants must complete at least two-week quarantine upon arrival. 
Companies also reported a slight dip in policy transparency. In 2021, 46.7% of respondents called the regulatory environment transparent, down from 51.4% the year prior.

Those figures come during a year of ongoing regulatory tightening from Chinese authorities targeting a range of industries, as well as the implementation of new laws governing data privacy and data security.
“Further hindering our members, many regulatory changes were enacted after our survey closed. While well-intentioned, they were announced with little or no warning, which has unsettled companies,"" Gibbs added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell in August as supply remained tight, but there are signs the surge in house prices and the COVID-19 pandemic-fueled demand have probably run their course. 
Still, prices remain high enough to keep some potential buyers from a hot housing market. The report from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday showed the smallest share of first-time homebuyers in more than 2-1/2 years and houses continuing to be snapped up typically after only 17 days on the market.
""The recent moderation in existing home sales reflects some easing of the buying frenzy that carried over into early 2021,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte North Carolina. ""The frantic race for space sent prices soaring. We continue to expect the housing market to move back into balance over the next couple of years.""
Existing home sales dropped 2.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.88 million units last month. Sales fell in all four regions, with the densely populated South posting a 3.0% decline. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would decline to a rate of 5.89 million units in August.
Single-family sales fell 1.9%, while condo/co-op sales dropping 2.8%. The decrease in sales coincided with a recent change in consumer attitudes towards buying a home.
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, fell 1.5% on a year-on-year basis. The annual comparison was distorted by the pandemic-driven surge in sales in August 2020. Sales are up 16% so far this year compared to the same period in 2020 and remain well above their pre-pandemic level.
The housing market boomed early in the coronavirus pandemic amid an exodus from cities as people worked from home and took classes online, which fueled demand for bigger homes in the suburbs and other low-density areas. 
The surge, which was skewed towards the single-family housing market segment, far outpaced supply. Expensive building materials as well as land and labor shortages have made it harder for builders to boost production. At the same time, some homeowners are reluctant to sell because of concerns they might not find something affordable, keeping inventory tight. 
Government data on Tuesday showed single-family homebuilding fell for a second straight month in August.
Though the pandemic tailwind is fading, demand for housing remains strong thanks to near record low mortgage rates and rising wages from a tightening labor market. A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a modest rise in applications for loans to purchase a home last week. 
Mortgage rates could rise after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday cleared the way to reduce its monthly bond purchases ""soon"" and signaled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, recouping some of the recent losses as concerns over a default by Chinese property developer Evergrande eased. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries rose.

TIGHT SUPPLY
The median existing house price increased 14.9% from a year ago to $356,700 in August. That is a deceleration from a 23.6% jump in May. The slowdown in house price inflation adds to anecdotal evidence that some sellers are reducing their asking prices. Realtors are also noting that bidding wars are subsiding.
""We expect home price growth to slow further over the balance of this year and through 2022 as the housing inventory shortage eases and demand moderates,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
Sales remained concentrated in the upper price end of the market, with transactions of homes in the below-$250,000 price range continuing to experience double-digit declines.
Residential investment contracted in the second quarter after three straight quarters of double-digit growth. 
August's sales decline implies lower broker commissions. This together with the drop in housing starts suggests a further decrease in residential investment this quarter. 
There were 1.29 million previously owned homes on the market last month, down 13.4% from a year ago. At August's sales pace, it would take 2.6 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.0 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 
In August, properties typically remained on the market for 17 days, unchanged from July, but down from 22 days a year ago. Eighty-seven percent of the homes sold last month were on the market for less than a month.

First-time buyers accounted for 29% of sales, the lowest since January 2019 and down from 30% in July and 33% a year ago. All-cash sales accounted for 22% of transactions, down from 23% in July and up from 18% a year ago.
""There is a suggestion here in the moderation of price gains and sales, and a declining share of first-time buyers, that a considerable portion of the stock adjustment of demand for homes to low rates and pandemic-driven population moves has taken place,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.

Around 50,200 homes were sold in July, 53% more than in the same month in 2020, according to the figures from the National Statistics Institute.
The July sale figures were 4% above pre-pandemic levels and approached the frenzied pace recorded during Spain's ill-fated real estate boom in 2008, when the month of April alone saw some 55,000 houses sold.
""If you compare with the same month in 2019, the evolution is positive ... which confirms that we've not only surpassed pre-pandemic numbers but also re-entered the big upwards trend in house sales initiated in 2018,"" Maria Matos, a spokesperson for online property portal Fotocasa, said in a statement.

The sale of newly built homes rose 40% compared with July 2020, buoyed by enthusiasm for pools, terraces, gardens and other outdoor areas as remote working let more people move out to bigger properties in the suburbs, where most new developments are, Matos added.
In a bleaker sign of coronavirus impact, the rate of homes passed on through inheritance procedures continued to grow. The latest figures were up 20% year-on-year, representing one in five of all houses on sale, mirroring the surge in mortality amid the pandemic.

The median forecast from a poll of 18 economists expects export orders to jump 20.7% from the year-ago period. Forecasts for growth ranged from 18% to 24.5%.
Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asia's exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.
The island nation's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 21.4% in July to $55.3 billion year-on-year.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British public's expectations for inflation over the coming year have shot up by a record amount this month, raising the risk that the Bank of England will send a hawkish message soon, Citi said on Tuesday.
The Citi/YouGov monthly inflation expectations survey showed that public inflation expectations for the next 12 months jumped to 4.1% in September from 3.1% in August, the biggest monthly increase since the survey began more than 15 years ago.
Longer-term inflation expectations for the next five to 10 years rose to 3.8% in September from 3.5% in August.
""Today's data, especially the movement in long-term expectations, suggest growing risks inflation expectations could become de-anchored to the upside. The sharp increase risks a hawkish response from the (Monetary Policy Committee) this week,"" Citi said.
The BoE's Monetary Policy Committee is meeting ahead of its September policy statement on Thursday. Citi's survey contrasts with a much smaller increase in inflation expectations in a poll for August which the BoE published last week. 
Financial markets expect the BoE to start to raise interest rates early next year, possibly as soon as February, though most economists think a move will only come towards the end of 2022.
The BoE looks closely at inflation expectations for signs the public expect above-average inflation over the medium term, which could lead to greater pressure for pay rises and prompt businesses to raise prices in expectation of higher costs.

Inflation expectations tend to be pushed up by short-term rises in the current rate of inflation. Last month, consumer price inflation jumped to 3.2% from July's 2.0%, and in recent days energy companies have warned of big rises in electricity and heating bills.
The Citi/YouGov survey was based on a poll of 2,005 adults on Sept. 20 and Sept. 21.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding fell for a second straight month in August as builders continued to struggle with shortages of materials and labor, suggesting the housing market could remain a drag on economic growth in the third quarter. 
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed the number of houses authorized for construction but not yet started raced to a record high last month, a sign of reluctance by builders to take on new projects. 
Builders' inability to ramp up the production of single-family homes amid a massive housing shortage is driving up prices and keeping some first-time buyers from the market.
""While lumber prices have plummeted in the spot market, those lower prices have not yet made their way to home builders,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Moreover, other essential building materials remain in short supply, including windows, cabinets, electric breaker boxes and wedge anchors."" 
Single-family starts, which account for the largest share of the housing market, dropped 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.076 million units last month. The decline was, however, offset by a surge in starts for the volatile multi-family segment. 
As a result, overall housing starts advanced 3.9% to a rate of 1.615 million units in August. Data for July was revised up to a rate of 1.554 million units from the previously reported 1.534 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would rebound to a rate of 1.555 million units. Housing starts jumped 17.4% compared to August 2020.
Single-family starts dropped in the West and Midwest. They rose in the Northeast and the densely populated South.
Building costs remain an issue even though lumber futures have tumbled from a record high of $1,711 per thousand board feet in May to about $604 in Tuesday morning trade. 
Single-family homebuilding has struggled to gain traction since surging to a rate of 1.255 million units in March, which was the highest level since November 2006. 
Starts for buildings with five units or more soared 21.6% to a rate of 530,000 units last month, the highest level since January 2020. The multi-family housing segment is being boosted by demand for rentals as COVID-19 vaccinations allow companies to recall workers to offices in city centers. 
Early in the coronavirus pandemic, there was an exodus from cities as people worked from home and took classes online, fueling demand for bigger homes in the suburbs and other low-density areas. While the pandemic tailwind is fading, demand for housing remains strong thanks to near record low mortgage rates and rising wages from a tightening labor market.
Though the Federal Reserve is expected at the end of a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday to clear the way to trimming its monthly bond purchases later this year, that will likely have a limited impact on mortgage rates. The U.S. central is expected to keep its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero for a while. 
A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Monday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders edged up from a 13-month low in September, but it noted that ""delivery times remain extended and the chronic construction labor shortage is expected to persist.""
Stocks on Wall Street rose as investors weighed the risk of contagion from debt-saddled Chinese developer Evergrande. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
(Graphic: Housing starts, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/mypmnobydvr/hsbp.png) 
STRONG RENTAL DEMAND
Residential investment contracted in the second quarter after three straight quarters of double-digit growth. A further decline this quarter is likely.
""The softness in single-family starts suggests somewhat lower residential investment,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Washington. 
Permits for future homebuilding rose 6.0% to a rate of 1.728 million units in August. Single-family permits gained 0.6% to a rate of 1.054 million units. Permits for buildings with five units or more jumped 19.7% to a rate of 632,000 units, the highest level since January 1990.
""We conjecture that this strength in multi-family may be a response to the strong increase in asking rents and the low vacancy rates in rental units,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
The backlog of homes yet to be started increased 3.7% to 251,000 units, a record high. Single-family homes yet to be started were near a 15-year high.
Housing completions fell 4.5% to a rate of 1.330 million units last month. Single-family home completions rose 2.8% to a rate of 971,000 units. The pandemic has lengthened the time from when a permit is issued for single-family home construction to completion, which economists blame on supply constraints.
The inventory of previously owned homes is near record lows, leading to record double-digit annual growth in home prices.
Realtors estimate that single-family housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap.

The stock of housing under construction increased 1.7% to a rate of 1.404 million units last month.
""Supply issues will constrain production for some time yet and we expect single-family starts will see only a gradual rise from here, reaching 1.16 million annualized by end-2021,"" said Matthew Pointon, a senior property economist at Capital Economics in New York.

524,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 09:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. current account deficit increased to a 14-year high in the second quarter as businesses boosted imports to replenish depleted inventories amid robust consumer spending.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, rose 0.5% to $190.3 billion last quarter. That was the largest shortfall since the second quarter of 2007.
Data for the first quarter was revised to show a $189.4 billion gap, instead of $195.7 billion as previously reported. 
The current account gap represented 3.3% of gross domestic product last quarter. That was down from 3.4% in the January-March quarter. Still, the deficit remains below a peak of 6.3% of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 as the United States is now a net exporter of crude oil and fuel.
The wider deficit is likely not an issue for the United States because of the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. The current account gap could remain big as the nation leads the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The economy grew at a 6.6% annualized rate in the second quarter, powered by another quarter of double-digit growth in consumer spending. Domestic demand, which has been buoyed by fiscal stimulus and vaccinations against the coronavirus, is being partially satiated with imports. 
Inventories were depleted in the first half of the year.
Imports of goods increased $29.0 billion to $706.3 billion, primarily reflecting an increase in industrial supplies and materials, mostly petroleum products as well as metals and nonmetallic products.
Exports of goods rose $28.3 billion to $436.6 billion, lifted by industrial supplies and materials such as petroleum products. There were also gains in exports of capital goods, mainly civilian aircraft and semiconductors.
Imports of services increased $9.1 billion to $127.8 billion, mostly reflecting increases in sea freight and air passenger transport as well as other personal travel. 
Exports of services increased $7.6 billion to $189.1 billion. They were driven by personal travel.

Primary income receipts advanced $7.7 billion to $270.6 billion. Payments of primary income rose $8.8 billion to $221.5 billion. The increases in both receipts and payments mainly reflected advances in direct investment income.
Secondary income receipts dropped $0.9 billion to $41.6 billion, pulled down by declines in general government transfers, mostly public sector fines and penalties. Payments of secondary income fell $3.5 billion to $72.6 billion as general government transfers decreased.

Residential starts rose 3.9% last month to a 1.62 million annualized rate after an upwardly revised July print, according to government data released Tuesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 1.55 million pace. 
Building permits, meanwhile, increased 6% in August, the biggest gain since January, reflecting a sizable jump in multi-family units. Permit applications for single-family homes also edged higher.
The data suggest that builders are making some construction headway despite limited availability of land, labor and materials, which has slowed residential starts from a 15-year high in March. Despite the bottlenecks, housing starts remain mostly above pre-pandemic levels, which is expected keep construction activity elevated for some time.
A measure of homebuilder sentiment out Monday rose in September for the first time in five months amid lower lumber prices and strong housing demand.
The number of single-family houses under construction but not yet completed, a measure of backlogs, rose to 702,000, the most since 2007, further underscoring builders’ struggle to keep up with demand.

The Confederation of British Industry's monthly manufacturing order book balance rose to +22 in September from +18 in August, its highest level since records started in 1977.
Still, the picture was weaker for export orders - which grew at their fastest since March 2019 - and the survey's gauge of output growth fell to its lowest level since April.
""Today's survey highlights how amidst a variety of supply challenges, companies are beginning to struggle to meet high demand,"" CBI deputy chief economist Anna Leach said.
""Despite close to half of manufacturers surveyed reporting order books above normal, output growth has slowed sharply, albeit remaining relatively robust.""
The survey's gauge of price expectations cooled to a four-month low, but Leach warned manufacturers still faced rocketing energy prices.

As economies reopen after COVID-19 lockdowns, wholesale natural gas prices in Europe have soared this year, pushed up by high demand for liquefied natural gas in Asia, nuclear maintenance and lower-than-usual supplies from Russia.
The record prices have strained the British energy sector, destroying the business model of smaller energy traders and sending shockwaves through the chemical and fertiliser markets, leading to a shortage of carbon dioxide used in food processing.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese land prices fell for the second straight year as the country's closed borders and state of emergency curbs to combat the coronavirus pandemic hit demand for new restaurants and hotels, an annual government survey showed.
In a sign the pandemic is reshaping the economy, however, land prices for industrial areas rose for the fourth straight year on booming demand for warehouses to stock up on electronic appliances and other goods catering to stay-at-home demand.
Overall property prices in the world's third-largest economy fell 0.4% in the year to July after last year's 0.6% decline, which was the first fall in three years, a land ministry survey showed on Tuesday.
Residential land prices, which have been falling for nearly three decades due to Japan's shrinking population, slid 0.5% after a 0.7% decline in the previous year, the survey showed.
The decline stands in contrast to a troubling surge in property prices in many other industrialised nations such as Australia, where home prices rose a record 6.7% in April-June despite low economic growth.
Commercial property prices in Japan fell 0.5%, bigger than a 0.3% drop a year earlier, as the pandemic forced the country to close its borders to foreign tourists and impose curbs on economic activity.
In Osaka, Japan's second-biggest metropolitan area and among its most popular tourist destinations, they fell 0.6% to mark the first decline in nine years, the survey showed.
""We're continuing to see prices fall as profitability plummets, demand shrinks and the outlook darkens due to the pandemic,"" a land ministry official told a briefing.
By contrast, industrial land, which is mostly used by plants and logistic facilities, saw prices rise 0.8% nationwide from a year earlier reflecting robust demand for goods.
Both Rakuten and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), two of the biggest online commerce operators in Japan, announced plans to open several distribution centres earlier this year given a continued boom for delivery services during the pandemic.

Japan's land prices had risen before the pandemic thanks in part to a wall of money pumped out by the central bank as part of former premier Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies, and a hotel construction boom to cater to an influx of foreign tourists.
The ministry surveyed 21,430 locations nationwide.

528,"<span>Sep 20, 2021 10:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Confidence among U.S. single-family homebuilders edged up in September, reversing a three-month decline as elevated costs for some building materials including softwood lumber eased, a survey showed on Monday.
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose one point to 76 last month. A reading above 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as good than poor.
Builder sentiment hit an all-time high of 90 last November as the COVID-19 pandemic fueled a housing market boom, with more people forced to work from home. The outlook for builders has since cooled, with many citing chronic labor shortages and spiraling construction costs as supply chain disruptions at saw mills and ports saw rocketing prices for lumber and some other raw materials. Tariffs on steel imports have also added to building costs.
""The September data show stability as some building material cost challenges ease, particularly for softwood lumber,"" NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke said in a statement. ""However, delivery times remain extended and the chronic construction labor shortage is expected to persist as the overall labor market recovers.""
Lumber is down more than 60% from its May peak but overall aggregate residential construction material costs increased 13% on an annual basis in the first eight months of this year, according to the NAHB. When combined with the recent surge in home price growth, builders see housing affordability as an issue in the months ahead. 

The survey's measure of current sales conditions also increased one point to 82 and its gauge of sales expectations over the next six months remained unchanged at 81. The component measuring traffic of prospective buyers rose 2 points to 61.
""The single-family building market has moved off the unsustainably hot pace of construction of last fall and has reached a still hot but more stable level of activity,"" said Robert Dietz, the NAHB's chief economist.

LONDON (Reuters) - Asking prices for houses in Britain resumed their upward trend this month as buyer demand far outstripped the supply of houses coming to the market, a survey showed on Monday.
Real estate website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said asking prices rose by 0.3% in its September survey to reach a new record high of 338,462 pounds ($466,671), reversing a 0.3% drop in early August.
Overall the survey added to signs that the housing market has retained some of its upward momentum even after the gradual withdrawal of temporary tax breaks on property purchases.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak cut stamp duty, a tax on house purchases, in July 2020. But in July it started to return to its pre-pandemic level and the tax break fully expires this month.
The tax cut aimed to reverse a slump in property sales at the start of the pandemic, and helped fuel a surge in property prices and some new construction. Many households were already seeking more spacious housing suited to working from home, a factor which has led to big price rises in other countries too.
""The high ratio of buyer demand to properties for sale means that the property market remains stock-starved despite the summer lull lessening overall activity,"" said Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data.
The company said the number of prospective buyers per property had more than doubled compared with pre-pandemic levels - chiming with a similar report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

The August survey covered property first advertised on Rightmove between Aug. 8 and Sept. 11.

LONDON (Reuters) - More British employers are planning pay rises than at any time since the global financial crisis as they struggle to recruit staff following the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit, data from the Confederation of British Industry showed on Monday.
The CBI said 44% of businesses intended to raise pay in line with inflation and 24% planned above-inflation pay rises, the highest combined percentage since it started surveying businesses about this in 2009.
""Pay intentions are rising across the board as firms reopen and the economy recovers,"" Matthew Percival, the CBI's director of skills and inclusion said.
However he warned that businesses were likely to pass on higher wage bills to their customers unless productivity improved, especially as many also needed to repay loans taken out last year during the pandemic.
The prospect of higher prices is likely to concern the Bank of England as its policymakers meet this week. The BoE expects a short-term rise in inflation due to higher oil prices and supply-chain bottlenecks, but so far has said it does not expect lasting inflationary pressure from the job market.
Just over three quarters of the 422 firms polled by the CBI and recruiters Pertemps Network in late August said labour shortages were hurting competitiveness, the highest proportion in over five years.
The CBI renewed its call for the government to ease post-Brexit visa restrictions on European Union workers with in-demand skills.
Separately, manufacturing trade body Make UK said its members were seeing the fastest output growth in more than 30 years and expected output to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022, sooner than previously forecast.

""Growth prospects continue to accelerate for manufacturers as economies at home and abroad continue to open up. However, supply chain shortages and the rapidly escalating increase in shipping costs are threatening to put roadblocks on the road to faster growth,"" Make UK chief executive Stephen Phipson said.
Make UK also criticised a recent government decision to raise employers' social security contributions.

Assessments of current conditions slipped further, to 77.1 from 78.5 in August, while the survey's forward-looking expectations index ticked up to 67.1 from 65.1, which had been the lowest since 2013.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Foreign holdings of Treasuries rose for a fourth straight month in July, hitting a record high, data from the Treasury Department showed on Thursday.
Major foreign holders of Treasuries held $7.54 trillion, the highest on record, according to Refinitiv Datastream. In June, foreign holdings of Treasuries stood at $7.50 trillion.
""One of the big drivers is just low interest rates across the world. That's certainly driving a lot more investors to U.S. Treasuries despite their low rates,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rates strategist, at TD Securities in New York.
Although U.S. Treasury yields are low, they are higher than government bond yields in many other major countries, boosting their attractiveness to foreign investors.
""Looking back, we saw a fairly significant decline in interest rates in July and the data suggest it was driven at least partly by the buying from foreign investors,"" Goldberg said.
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields started July with a yield of 1.4680%, falling about 24 basis points to 1.2256% by the end of that month.
Overall, net foreign acquisitions of U.S. long-term and short-term securities, including banking flows, showed a net inflow of $126 billion in July, from a revised net inflow of $32 billion in June.

LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses have reported a sharp rise in recruitment difficulties within the space of just a few weeks - partly as a result of a continued lack of European Union workers, official figures showed on Thursday.
Some 41% of companies with 10 or more staff reported greater than usual recruitment challenges in the two weeks to Sept. 5, up from 32% in early August, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/hospitalitybusinessesaremostlikelytobestrugglingtofillvacancies/2021-09-16.
Around a quarter of businesses with recruitment difficulties named a reduced number of EU applicants as a factor, rising to almost half in the transport and storage sector, where a lack of truck drivers https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot/britains-trucker-shortage-jams-post-pandemic-recovery-2021-09-03 has led to widespread delivery bottlenecks.
Labour shortages were most widespread in hospitality, followed by water utilities, healthcare and construction.
Britain introduced new immigration rules on Jan. 1 which require most EU workers not already living in Britain to get work visas, something that can be time-consuming and costly.
The number of EU nationals employed in Britain in the three months to the end of June was 8.7% lower than before the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with a 2.4% fall in the size of the total workforce, the ONS said.
ONS data earlier this week showed Britain had more than an average of just over 1 million job vacancies in the three months to the end of August, a record high.
Recruitment difficulties had also become a theme in company earnings reports in the past quarter, said Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at brokers  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
""In some cases, this means businesses are struggling to operate effectively, which in turn is putting the brakes on GDP,"" she said.
Employers have called on the government to temporarily ease visa rules to allow them more time to train British staff, but the government has rejected this so far and said part of the solution is for businesses to improve pay and conditions. 

The Bank of England expects higher oil prices and post-pandemic bottlenecks, including labour shortages, to push inflation up to 4% by the end of the year, although it thinks this will fade and sees potential slack in the job market.
Britain's COVID furlough programme ends on Sept. 30. Businesses said that in the two weeks to Sept. 5, 6% of their staff were receiving furlough payments for some or all of their hours, equivalent to about 1.6 million employees.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly increased in August, likely boosted by back-to-school shopping and child tax credit payments from the government, which could temper expectations for a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter.
The surprise rebound in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday defied slumping consumer confidence. Sales were driven by a surge in online purchases, which offset a continued decline at auto dealerships. But sales in July were much weaker than initially estimated. 
Economists have been downgrading their gross domestic product estimates for the current quarter, citing plunging motor vehicle sales, which are the result of an acute inventory shortage, and a flare-up of COVID-19 infections fueled by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
""U.S. consumption is not slowing as quickly as it appeared a month ago despite the fading stimulus, and the Delta variant did not much affect the industries feeding into retail sales,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""The economy continued to hum in August."" 
Retail sales rose 0.7% last month. Data for July was revised down to show retail sales declining 1.8% instead of 1.1% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would drop 0.8%. Sales increased 15.1% from a year ago and are 17.7% above their pre-pandemic level. 
They are holding up even as spending is shifting back from goods to services like travel and entertainment. Retail sales are mostly goods, with services such as healthcare, education, travel and hotel accommodation making up the remaining portion of consumer spending.
Online retail sales rebounded 5.3% after tumbling 4.6% in July. Most school districts started their 2021-2022 academic year in August, with in-person learning resuming after last year's shift to online classes because of the pandemic. 
Qualifying households in mid-July started receiving money under the expanded child tax credit program, which will run through December. Sales at clothing stores edged up 0.1% last month. There were strong gains in receipts at building material and furniture stores.
But sales at auto dealerships tumbled 3.6% after declining 4.6% in July. An ongoing global shortage of microchips is forcing has automakers to cut production. 
The semiconductor crunch, which has been worsened by the latest COVID-19 wave, is also causing shortages of some electronic goods. 
There is also congestion at ports in China. Sales at electronics and appliance stores fell 3.1%. There was also a decrease in receipts at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. 
With coronavirus infections surging, the flow of traffic to restaurants and bars ebbed, keeping sales flat. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rebounded 2.5% last month after a downwardly revised 1.9% decrease in July.
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely to the consumer spending component of GDP. They were previously estimated to have dropped 1.0% in July.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
GROWTH ESTIMATES
The National Retail Federation said the rise in sales despite the headwinds reflected the continued strength of the American consumer and the resilience of the nation's retailers.
""We maintain our confidence in the historic strength of consumers and fully expect a record year for retail sales and a strong holiday season for retailers,"" NRF President Matthew Shay said. 
Americans are sitting on at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. Wages are rising as companies scramble to fill a record 10.9 million job openings.
A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state jobless benefits rose 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 332,000 for the week ended Sept. 11.
Claims were likely boosted by Hurricane Ida, which devastated U.S. offshore energy production and knocked out power in Louisiana. Ida also drenched Mississippi and caused historic flooding in New York and New Jersey.
The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid fell 187,000 to 2.665 million in the week ended Sept. 4, the lowest level since mid-March 2020. The expiration of federal government-funded benefits early this month is expected to boost the labor pool.
""There is no evidence here that the surge in COVID cases related to the Delta variant is forcing a retrenchment in the economy,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
A third report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed its business activity index jumped to a reading of 30.7 in September from 19.4 in August. A reading above zero indicates growth in manufacturing in the region, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
Manufacturers reported a moderation in input prices, which fits in with recent data suggesting that inflation had probably peaked. They also increased hours for workers as they struggled to find labor. Though expectations moderated, manufacturers were upbeat about business conditions over the next six months.
Tanking motor vehicle sales and struggles by businesses to replenish stocks have prompted economists to slash their GDP growth estimates for the third quarter. A fourth report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed inventory accumulation slowed in July.
On Wednesday, economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) again trimmed their third-quarter GDP growth forecast to a 5.0% annualized rate from a 7.0% pace. The Federal Reserve's ""Beige Book"" report last week showed ""economic growth downshifted slightly to a moderate pace in early July through August.""

But after the release of the retail sales report on Thursday, economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised their third-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 5.0% rate from a 3.3% pace. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised its forecast to a 4.5% pace from a 3.5% rate, having lowered it to a 5.25% pace early this month.
The economy grew at a 6.6% rate in the second quarter.

Business inventories rose 0.5% after increasing 0.9% in June, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. July's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
Inventories rose 7.2% on a year-on-year basis in July.
Retail inventories gained 0.4% in July as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.5% rise in June. Motor vehicle inventories climbed 0.2% instead of 0.3% as estimated last month. 
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.5% as estimated last month.
Business inventories were depleted in the first half of the year, but shortages amid persistent supply bottlenecks because of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent ports congestion in China are frustrating efforts to replenish stocks. 
Still, inventory rebuilding is expected to underpin economic growth in the second half of the year.

Wholesale inventories increased 0.6% in July. Stocks at manufacturers advanced 0.5%.

The value of overall retail purchases climbed 0.7% last month following a downwardly revised 1.8% decrease in July, Commerce Department figures showed Thursday. Excluding autos, sales advanced 1.8% in August, the largest gain in five months.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.7% decline in overall retail sales, with forecasts ranging from a 3.3% drop to a 1.1% gain. 
U.S. stock-index futures pared losses and bonds slipped after the report.
The surprising improvement in sales, underpinned in part by back-to-school shopping and payments for millions of families with children, suggests resilient demand for goods. The report showed firmer receipts at non-store retailers, general merchandise stores, furniture outlets and grocery stores.
The delta variant is curbing demand for services such as travel and leisure. The retail sales data showed receipts at restaurants and bars, the only services-spending category in the report, stagnated in August. Grocery store receipts climbed 2.1%.
Still, a surge in Covid-19 infections, rising prices and persistent supply chain challenges prompted a wave of downgrades to third-quarter economic growth forecasts in recent weeks. 
Earlier this month, economists at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). downgraded their third-quarter consumption forecast to a 0.5% annualized decline because of delta’s impact on services spending.
Separate data on Thursday from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed an index of services business activity in the region slumped 13 points in September to 14.4, indicating softer growth. Another gauge showed a deterioration in the business climate.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports extended double-digit gains in August, led by strong shipments of chip manufacturing equipment, although the pace of growth weakened as COVID-19 hit key Asian supply chains and slowed factory production.
The trade growth is unlikely to dispel worries about the outlook for Japan's economy, which has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels after taking an enormous hit from a collapse in global trade in the first quarter of 2020.
Exports rose 26.2% in August compared with the same month a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said on Thursday, marking the sixth straight month of double-digit growth as strong demand for chip-making equipment offset slowing U.S and European Union-bound shipments of cars.
However, the growth was slower than the 34.0% expected by economists in a Reuters poll and the 37.0% advance in the previous month.
""Exports have been driving the economy. The recovery scenario for Japan's economy may become shaky if they won't grow,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank.
Policymakers are under pressure to keep the fragile recovery intact, which has been thrown into doubt due to a resurgence of the pandemic in other parts of Asia, leading manufacturing hubs such as Vietnam and Malaysia to roll out lockdown measures.
""The semiconductor issue had quite a big impact, which weighed on car exports a lot,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""I think it's likely to impact exports at least until the year-end as bottlenecks in parts supply in Southeast Asia continue.""
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp cut https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-cuts-annual-auto-production-target-shortage-chips-parts-2021-09-10 its annual production target by 300,000 vehicles last week as rising COVID-19 infections slowed output at parts factories in Vietnam and Malaysia.
While vaccination rates are improving and daily COVID-19 infections appear to have peaked, analysts expect Japan to see annualised 1.2% growth https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-q3-growth-forecast-more-than-halved-covid-19-impact-2021-09-14 in the current quarter, much slower than projected last month, a Reuters poll on Tuesday showed.
By destination, shipments to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 12.6% year-on-year in August, led by chemicals and semiconductor parts, the data showed.
Exports to the United States, the world's top economy, soared 22.8%, as strong demand for power-generating machines offset a decline in car shipments.
Shipments to Asia as a whole gained 26.1%, their slowest pace in five months, while those to the European Union advanced 29.9% in August.
Imports jumped 44.7% in August compared with the same month a year earlier, versus the median estimate for a 40.0% increase, due to stronger demand for fuel and medical goods.
That brought a trade deficit of 635.4 billion yen ($5.81 billion), the largest shortfall since December 2012 and bigger than the median estimate for a 47.7 billion yen deficit.

The trade data follows the Reuters Tankan poll on Wednesday, which found confidence among Japanese manufacturers fell to a five-month low in September as the latest wave of COVID-19 forced factory halts around Asia.

For the European Union as a whole, the non-seasonally adjusted data showed a decline in the trade surplus in both July and in the Jan-July period from a year earlier. The bloc is a major importer of oil and other raw materials and a major exporter of chemicals, machinery and vehicles.
The European Union's trade deficit with China increased, while its surplus with the United States and Britain expanded in the first seven months of 2021.
To Britain, which has left the bloc, exports rose by 6.2% and imports fell by 17.1%, although Eurostat has calculated trade with Britain differently since the start of the year.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian employment dived in August as coronavirus lockdowns in Sydney and Melbourne forced businesses to lay off workers and slash hours, while the jobless rate was nudged lower by a sharp fall in the number of people looking for work.
Thursday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed employment fell by 146,000 in August, compared to median forecasts of a drop of 90,000. 
The unemployment rate dipped to 4.5%, having already fallen to 4.6% in July when lockdowns also distorted the data.
The ABS cautioned that the dip in the jobless rate was due to people dropping out of the labour force given how difficult it was to look for work while in lockdown. Only people actively looking for work are counted as unemployed.
""The fall in the unemployment rate reflects a large fall in participation during the recent lockdowns, rather than a strengthening in labour market conditions,"" said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labour statistics at the ABS.
""Hours worked data continues to provide the best indicator of the extent of labour market impacts and recovery from lockdowns,"" he added.
Hours worked in August slid 3.7% nationally, and by 6.5% in New South Wales where Sydney was closed for the entire month.
Likewise, the participation rate fell a steep 0.8 percentage points to 65.2%, while underemployment jumped a full point to 9.3% as workers' hours were restricted.
""The September print for labour force will see a further significant step down, as this will include the full impact of Victoria’s lockdown,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief Australia economist for BIS Oxford Economics.
""The degree of dislocation in economic activity means that GDP is likely to fall by around 4% in the September quarter.""

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cautioned that the unemployment rate will likely rise well above 5% once the full impact is felt, though it is also optimistic the economy will recover quickly once lockdowns ease.
A sharp increase in vaccinations has allowed the New South Wales government to flag a loosening of restrictions by mid-October, with Victoria likely to follow.

546,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 10:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s economy shed more jobs than expected in August as an outbreak of the delta variant of coronavirus forced a prolonged lockdown in the nation’s two largest cities and prompted firms to cut workers. 
Employment dropped by 146,300 last month, compared with economists’ forecast of an 80,000 decline, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed Thursday. The jobless rate edged down to 4.5% as the participation rate slumped to 65.2% from 66%.
“Throughout the pandemic we have seen large falls in participation during lockdowns — a pattern repeated over the past few months,” Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS, said in a statement. “Beyond people losing their jobs, we have seen unemployed people drop out of the labor force, given how difficult it is to actively look for work and be available for work during lockdowns.”
The Australian dollar edged down after the release and traded at 73.36 U.S. cents at 11:55 a.m. in Sydney.
Sydney and Melbourne and large swathes of the east coast are under a lockdown that’s impacting about half the nation’s population. As delta overwhelmed their defenses, the leaders of New South Wales and Victoria are stepping up vaccinations to try to live with the virus, while the federal government has boosted aid to households and businesses.
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said this week that he expected the main hit to the labor market to be in hours worked, though he added it wouldn’t be surprising to see the jobless rate climb to the “high fives” for a short period.
Among other details in today’s report:
The RBA this month pressed ahead with a tapering of its weekly bond purchases to A$4 billion ($2.9 billion) from A$5 billion, though it put back a planned review of the program by three months to mid-February. The extension, it said, reflected the delay in the recovery caused by the virus outbreak.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's economy grew at a much faster pace than expected in the second quarter, officials said on Thursday, reinforcing views that the central bank will start raising interest rates despite a recent outbreak of the coronavirus.
Gross domestic product (GDP) surged 2.8% in the three months through June, Statistics New Zealand said, well ahead of a Reuters poll forecast of a 1.3% increase and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) estimate of 0.7%.
The growth surge follows a drop in unemployment in the second quarter to an 18-month low of 4.0% and a rise in annual inflation to 3.3%, above the central bank's 1-3% target range.
The New Zealand dollar jumped 0.3% after the data was released, settling at $0.7320. 
""We expect the RBNZ to 'look through' near-term volatility and reduce monetary stimulus, with a series of 25 basis point (rate) hikes starting from next month,"" said Mark Smith, Senior Economist at ASB Bank.
The central bank delayed raising rates last month after the country was put into a snap COVID-19 lockdown over an outbreak of the Delta variant of COVID-19 in Auckland, but said a hike was still on the cards.
The market has already priced in a 100% chance of a 25 basis point hike at the next central bank meeting on Oct 6.
Annual GDP jumped 17.4% from a very weak base as the country was in a complete COVID-19 lockdown in the second quarter last year. A Reuters poll had expected a 16.3% rise.
Second-quarter growth was driven by the tourism sector, after the country opened a trans-Tasman travel bubble with Australia.
New Zealand has rebounded strongly from a recession last year, largely due to its success in eliminating the coronavirus within its borders and reopening its domestic economy well before other advanced nations.
The country had been virus-free for months until an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta strain in August. The biggest city Auckland remains in lockdown, but the rest of the country has opened up again. The travel bubble with Australia, however, has been suspended.
Economists expect growth to contract in the third quarter due to the Delta-driven lockdown, but forecast a rapid recovery as vaccinations increase and the outbreak is contained.

""Given that the economy was running hot going into the lockdown in August, the prospect of another V-shaped rebound becomes more likely,"" said Michael Gordon, Acting Chief Economist at Westpac Bank.
The country recorded 13 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, taking the total number of cases in the latest outbreak to 979.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Production at U.S. factories slowed more than expected in August amid disruptions from Hurricane Ida and lingering shortages of raw materials and labor as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on.
An improvement is likely with other data on Wednesday showing a sharp acceleration in a measure of factory activity in New York state this month against the backdrop of strong order growth and shipments of goods. Demand is being fueled by businesses desperate to replenish stocks after inventories were drawn down sharply in the first half of the year.
""Growth in manufacturing going forward is likely to be supported by low inventories,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""But supply issues and shortages remain a constraint for now that are preventing a stronger rebound.""
Manufacturing output increased 0.2% last month, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. Data for July was revised to show production surging 1.6% instead of 1.4% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing production would gain 0.4%. 
The Fed estimated that Hurricane Ida, which devastated U.S. offshore energy production and knocked off power in Louisiana at the end of August, subtracted 0.2 percentage point from manufacturing output. The hurricane led to plant closures for petrochemicals, plastic resins and petroleum refining 
Factory production is 1.0% above its pre-pandemic level. 
Output at auto plants edged up 0.1%. The raw materials crunch, most evident in the automobile sector, has been worsened by the latest wave of infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, primarily in Southeast Asia, as well as by congestion at ports in China. 
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said it would cut production at its plants in Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee this month because of an ongoing microchip shortage. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co is also reducing truck production.
Excluding autos, manufacturing output rose 0.2% in August.

IMPORT PRICES FALL
In a separate report on Wednesday, the New York Fed said its ""Empire State"" index on current business conditions surged to a reading of 34.3 this month from 18.3 in August. A reading above zero suggests an expansion in regional business activity.
But supply side challenges remained, with the delivery times measure hitting a record high. Firms in the region were very optimistic that business conditions would improve over the next six months, with capital and technology spending plans increasing markedly. 
""Upbeat goods demand, rising business investment, and rebounding demand from abroad are slated to keep activity growing at a healthy clip into 2022,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
""However steadfast supply chain and hiring challenges will concurrently limit the expansion, and these headwinds won’t diminish significantly until the COVID crisis is effectively contained at home and abroad."" 
Graphic: Empire State: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/klpykgzgapg/empirestate.png 
August's gain in manufacturing output and a 3.3% rebound in utilities raised industrial production by 0.4%. Industrial output increased 0.8% in July. Mining production fell 0.6%, reflecting hurricane-induced disruptions to oil and gas extraction in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, edged up 0.1 percentage point to 76.7% in August. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector rose 0.2 percentage point to 76.4%. It is 3.2 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.
Officials at the U.S. central bank tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.
Inflation appears to have peaked. A third report from the Labor Department showed import prices dropped 0.3% last month after increasing 0.4% in July. The first decrease since October 2020 lowered the year-on-year increase to 9.0% from 10.3% in July. 
The report followed on the heels of news on Tuesday that consumer prices recorded their smallest gain in seven months in August. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has steadfastly maintained that high inflation is transitory.

The run-up in prices centered on used cars and trucks, as well as services in industries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, is slowing. But strained supply chains will likely keep inflation elevated for a while. 
Imported fuel prices tumbled 2.3% last month after increasing 3.0% in July. Petroleum prices dropped 2.4%, while the cost of imported food rose 0.6%. 

Excluding fuel and food, import prices fell 0.2%. These so-called core import prices gained 0.1% in July. There were small gains in the prices of imported capital goods and consumer goods, excluding automobiles. 
""Inflation took a little breather in August, but the race or marathon isn't over yet,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.

549,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 09:33AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Production at U.S. factories slowed more than expected in August amid disruptions from Hurricane Ida and lingering shortages of raw materials and labor as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on.
Manufacturing output increased 0.2% last month, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. Data for July was revised to show production surging 1.6% instead of 1.4% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing production would gain 0.4%. 
The raw materials crunch has been worsened by the latest wave of infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, primarily in Southeast Asia, as well as by congestion at ports in China. 

General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said it would cut production at its plants in Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee this month because of an ongoing microchip shortage. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co is also reducing truck production.
Some of the slowdown in manufacturing reflects the rotation in spending back to services from goods because of COVID-19 vaccinations. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, remains underpinned by businesses desperate to replenish stocks after inventories were drawn down sharply in the first half of the year.

550,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Inflation in Canada accelerated to the fastest pace since 2003, a political headache for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau only five days before an election.
The consumer price index rose 4.1% in August from a year earlier, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday in Ottawa, marking the fifth straight month of inflation readings above the Bank of Canada’s 3% cap. That’s the highest since March 2003, when it touched 4.2%. Economists were predicting a yearly gain of 3.9%.
While policy makers are likely to view price pressures as transitory, the report comes at an inopportune time for Trudeau in the final days of a tight election battle. Affordability is a key campaign issue and the main opposition Conservatives have  been accusing the incumbent Liberal government of stoking inflation with debt-financed spending plans.
Still, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem, whose latest forecasts show inflation creeping up to 3.9% in the third quarter, has warned against overreacting to the  “temporary” spike that is being driven by global supply chain disruptions and pent-up demand for services as the economy reopens. There’s also a weak comparison to last year when price pressures were subdued during the pandemic.
The increase last month was driven by a sharp increase in the cost of airplane tickets and other traveling-related expenses. From a year ago, gasoline prices and housing costs remain key drivers. Gasoline prices rose 32.5% from year ago.
On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% versus economist estimates for a 0.1% gain. 
The average of core measures of inflation, often seen as a better gauge of underlying price pressures, rose to an annual 2.57% pace in August, the highest since 2009.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory and retail sectors faltered in August with output and sales growth hitting one-year lows as fresh coronavirus outbreaks and supply disruptions threatened the country's impressive economic recovery.
Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.
Consumer spending also took a big hit from rising local COVID-19 cases and floods with sales rising only 2.5% in August from a year ago, much lower than the forecast 7.0% rise and the slowest clip since August last year.
""Economic growth slowed in August as consumption was hit by the lingering impact of earlier COVID outbreaks and investment remained weak,"" said Louis Kuijs, Head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics. ""Meanwhile, a new outbreak which started a few days ago in Fujian is posing downside risk to our forecast of a pick-up in growth in Q4 after a weak Q3.""
The world's second-largest economy has made a remarkably strong revival from last year's coronavirus-led slump, but momentum has slowed over the past few months due to supply chain bottlenecks, semiconductor shortages, curbs on high-polluting industries and a crackdown on property investment.
Looking ahead, analysts at Nomura expect the weakness to broadly extend into September given the new wave of Delta cases in Fujian province and worsening conditions in the property market as authorities get tough on the sector.
In the industrial sector, production curbs hit output of aluminium and steel, while a drastic cut in fuel export quotas hurt China's crude oil throughput.[L1N2QH048]
Social restrictions due to the COVID-19 Delta variant in several provinces have hit the catering, transportation, accommodation and entertainment industries.
China's services activity slumped into contraction in August, a private-sector survey showed, as restrictions to curb COVID-19 once again closed shopping malls and many businesses in parts of the country.
KFC operator Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) Inc said on Tuesday its adjusted operating profit would take a 50% to 60% hit in the third quarter as the spread of the Delta variant in China closed restaurant and ""sharply reduced sales"".
""As growth is approaching the lower end of the officially-estimated potential growth range of 5.0-5.7%, Beijing may step up targeted easing to generate a moderate pick-up in growth in our view,"" said Jingyang Chen, Greater China economist at HSBC. 
""We expect the government to further speed up special bond issuance and the central bank to roll out more targeted easing measures, including targeted RRR cuts, to support SMEs.""
Analysts also expect China to quicken spending on infrastructure projects later this year. 
FOCUS SHIFTS TO PROPERTY
The weak data comes amid growing worries problems in China's property sector could have a wider impact on the broader economy.
Particular focus is on Evergrande Group, one of China's top property developers, which has struggled to pay lenders and suppliers as its housing sales plunge.
Separate data on Wednesday showed China's property investment rose 0.3% in August, the slowest pace in 18 months, while growth in new home prices eased an eight-month low.
Authorities in China have stepped up efforts to rein in a red-hot property market, which rebounded sharply from last year's COVID-19 shock.

For now, analysts expect policymakers to prioritise stability and maintain their property curbs and restrictions on carbon emissions, even if it means a deeper hit to the economy.
""We think Beijing is willing to shoulder some short-term pain in order to seek long-term gains,"" Nomura said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) -Indonesia's exports hit a record high of $21.42 billion in August, boosted by surging commodity shipments, helping Southeast Asia's biggest economy post its largest ever monthly trade surplus, official data showed.
Robust exports helped Indonesia pull out of recession in the second quarter, but analysts say its recovery may be slowed by COVID-19 infections and supply chain disruptions.
The resource-rich country's August shipments rose 64.1% from a year earlier, according to data released by the statistics bureau on Wednesday, handily beating analysts' forecast in a Reuters poll for a 36.90% rise. 
Sales of palm oil, coal and natural gas, its top commodities, surged more than 100%. Shipments of copper, tin and steel also jumped.
The August export value surpassed Indonesia's last record high of $18.65 billion in August 2011, during the previous global commodity boom.
Commodity prices have been rising as more economies reopen from last year's COVID-19 lockdowns. 
Coal and palm oil prices have reached record highs as demand outstripped supply, while tin prices also surged due to a supply crunch.
Riding on the trend, Indonesia has posted a trade surplus every month since May 2020.
August's surplus was $4.74 billion, compared with a $2.36 billion surplus expected in the poll. July's surplus was $2.59 billion.
The G20 economy also booked a 55.26% annual rise in imports in August to $16.68 billion, beating the poll's 45.10% growth prediction. 
Indonesia's COVID-19 restrictions were eased last month after infection numbers gradually fell.
Wisnu Wardana, an economist with Jakarta-based Bank Danamon, said it may not take long before Indonesia's trade numbers normalise and commodity prices fall, adding that authorities should use this as an opportunity to build local industries.
""Judging from the global financial crisis, when the global real sector recovers and we come closer to quantitative tightening, commodity (prices) will adjust,"" he said, referring to some central banks' plans to scale back emergency stimulus.

Maybank Indonesia economist Myrdal Gunarto said resource prices will remain high as long as demand from China remains strong. But he said as Indonesia eases anti-virus mobility curbs further, domestic demand for imports also will rise, narrowing the trade surplus.
The large trade surplus could add to onshore supply of U.S. dollars, helping Bank Indonesia maintain monetary policy accommodative without hurting the rupiah. The central bank is scheduled to review monetary policy next week.

Investing.com – China's factory and retail sectors hit a bump on the road to economic recovery in August thanks to COVID-19 outbreaks and supply disruptions.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released earlier in the day said industrial production grew 5.3% year-on-year, its weakest pace since July 2020. The growth was also lower than both the 5.8% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and July’s 6.4% growth.
Chinese industrial production year to date rose 13.1% year-on-year, down from July’s 14.4% growth.
Meanwhile, retail sales grew 2.5% year-on-year, a sharp drop from both the 7% growth in Investing.com forecasts and July’s 8.5% growth.
""Recent economic data reflected the overall demand is still weak in the economy, vulnerable to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks, but some sectors have been overheated, judging from the persistently high commodity prices,"" Hwabao Trust economist Nie Wen told Reuters.
""Policymakers will face a dilemma in terms of how to respond to a situation like this.""
Supply chain bottlenecks, semiconductor shortages, curbs on high-polluting industries and the crackdown on the property sector also contributed to declining growth.
Although the world's second-largest economy has largely recovered from 2020’s COVID-19-induced slump, fresh outbreaks have put a dent in the pace and raised expectations of further government support.
""We had been expecting services activity to rebound strongly in September as the COVID-19 situation was back under control,"" Capital Economics Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard told Reuters. However, the latest outbreak in Fujian province could derail the recovery further, he added.
NBS data also said fixed-asset investment grew 8.9% year-on-year, down from the 9% growth in Investing.com forecasts and July’s 10.3% growth."

559,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 10:18PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy weakened further in August after the government imposed stringent measures to contain a widespread Covid-19 outbreak, curbing consumer spending and travel during the peak summer holiday break. 
Retail sales growth slowed sharply to 2.5% from a year ago, lower than the 7% estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Industrial output rose 5.3%, versus the median estimate of 5.8%. Fixed-asset investment in the first eight months of the year was largely in line with projections, rising 8.9%. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.1%.
Even before the delta variant outbreak from late July, consumers had been cautious to spend, failing to make a comeback to pre-pandemic levels. More recently, regulatory crackdowns in property and education services have weighed on consumer sentiment. 
The virus control measures caused a slump in retail sales and spending on services last month as many people stopped going out to restaurants and shops and canceled holidays. The services sector contracted in August for the first time since early 2020, recent purchasing managers’ surveys showed.
While China quickly brought the late-July outbreak under control, a new virus cluster has developed in southern China this month, suggesting consumers will remain cautious for longer.

Manufacturers have had to deal with rising costs, disruptions caused by recent floods in some parts of the country, and the continued shortage of computer chips, which has been especially damaging for the car industry. 
At the same time, global demand has remained strong, despite port congestion problems and high shipping costs. China posted record monthly export figures in August as U.S. and European buyers increased their orders before the Christmas shopping season. 
With economic risks building, policy makers are ramping up support for smaller businesses, and pledging better use of local government bonds. Several economists expect the People’s Bank of China to cut the reserve requirement ratio for banks again in coming months following a surprise reduction in July.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment released on Wednesday rose 2.0% in September, recouping some of August's 4.4% drop.
Sentiment rebounded by 5.3% in New South Wales after the state government flagged a loosening of restrictions as early as mid-October, at least for those fully vaccinated.
The national index was up 13.2% on September last year with the mood never getting as bleak as during the first round of the pandemic. The index reading of 106.2 showed optimists outnumbered pessimists by some margin.
""The resilience of consumer sentiment in a period when Australia's two major cities have been locked down and the economy has been contracting is truly remarkable,"" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans.
""The improving vaccine situation appears to be a key factor behind these results.""
Evans noted confidence amongst the 57% of respondents that have had at least one dose was running at 103.7, while confidence amongst the 27% that were unvaccinated but willing to get the jab was up at 121.6.
That left 16% of respondents who were either unwilling to be 
vaccinated or undecided.
The optimism showed in the survey's measures of the outlook for the economy over the next 12 months which rose 4.6%, while that for the next five years gained 4.8%.
The measure of family finances compared with a year ago added 1.7% and that for finances over the next 12 months 2.1%.

The only decline was a 2.7% fall in the measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household, though that could be partly because so many shops are shut right now.
The time to buy a dwelling measure rebounded by 8.8%, recovering all of August's drop. Expectations for house prices rose by another 1.4% to an eight-year peak, with NSW particularly strong.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's Consumer Price Index rose 2.5% in August, the country's official statistics agency said on Tuesday, the smallest rise in over a year as the government tries to tamp down inflation that has damaged its popularity.
The South American country is grappling with stubborn inflation that clocked in at an annual rate of 51.4% in the month, even as prices cooled on a month-to-month basis amid price control measures and caps on exports of beef.
The monthly increase compared favorably with the projections of 18 analysts polled by Reuters who had forecast an average rise of 2.8%, ranging from a minimum estimate of 2.5% to a maximum of 3.2%.
Consumer prices rose 32.3% in the first eight months of the year.
Argentine Economy Minister Martín Guzmán had said the monthly inflation rate would be lower than July's 3% and that he expected it to keep falling in coming months. 
However, Isaías Marini, an economist at consultancy Econviews, said: ""Unlike what the government is saying, we expect inflation to overheat as we approach the end of the year to end at 49%.""
High inflation projections for the year are straining local savings and salary levels and are a headache for the government ahead of congressional elections in November.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Underlying U.S. consumer prices increased at their slowest pace in six months in August as used motor vehicle prices tumbled, suggesting that inflation had probably peaked, though it could remain high for a while amid persistent supply constraints.
The broad slowdown in price pressures reported by the Labor Department on Tuesday aligns with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's long-held belief that high inflation is transitory. Still, economists cautioned it was too early to celebrate and expected the U.S. central bank to lay out plans in November to start scaling back its massive monthly bond-buying program.
""Inflation remains troublingly strong, even if it is not exploding like it did earlier in the year,"" said James McCann, deputy chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Boston. ""If we continue to see further step-downs in inflation over the next six months, that should ease the pressure on the Fed to quickly follow tapering with interest rate rises.""
The consumer price index excluding the volatile food and energy components edged up 0.1% last month. That was the smallest gain since February and followed a 0.3% rise in July.
The so-called core CPI was held back by a 1.5% decline in prices for used cars and trucks, which ended five straight monthly increases. Robust rises in prices of used cars and trucks, as well as services in industries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, were the key drivers behind a heating up of inflation at the start of the year.
Airline fares plunged 9.1% in August, likely as a resurgence in infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, sapped demand for air travel. There were also decreases in motor vehicle rentals and insurance.
In the 12 months through August, the core CPI increased 4.0% after advancing 4.3% in the 12 months through July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI would gain 0.3% for the month and increase 4.2% year-on-year. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS REMAIN
In addition to the price surge for used cars and trucks appearing to have run its course, hotel and motel accommodation prices are now above the pre-pandemic level, suggesting moderate gains ahead. Prices for hotels and motels accommodation fell 3.3% after shooting up 6.8% in July. Some of the price plunge was probably because of the soaring coronavirus infections.
But bottlenecks in the supply chain remain and the labor market is tightening, pushing up wages. There were a record 10.9 million job openings as of the end of July, forcing companies to boost wages as they compete for workers. 
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Tuesday hiked its average starting wage to $18 per hour. 
A shortage of homes is driving record house price gains and rents are going up as COVID-19 vaccinations allow companies to recall workers to offices, pulling Americans back to cities following a pandemic-fueled exodus to lower-density areas. These factors could contribute to keeping annual inflation higher.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would receive from renting a home, increased 0.3% in August, rising by the same margin for the fourth straight month.
""The biggest upside risk to inflation in the next six months is from the potential pass-through of higher house prices to the CPI shelter component,"" said Bill Adams, a senior economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Prices for furniture and bedding rebounded 2.3%, while appliances accelerated 1.5%, underscoring the supply chain constraints. New motor vehicle prices rose 1.2%, marking the fourth straight month of gains above 1%. A global semiconductor shortage, worsened by the spread of the Delta variant in East Asia has forced auto manufacturers to cut production.
Consumers also paid more for apparel. The cost of healthcare rose at a tame 0.2% as a strong gain in prices for hospital services was offset by a decline in prescription medication. The cost of doctor visits was unchanged.
The government reported last week that producer prices increased solidly in August, with the PPI posting its largest annual gain in nearly 11 years.
Some economists expect officials at the Fed will upgrade their inflation estimates when the U.S. central bank publishes its summary of economic projections at end of the Sept. 21-22 policy meeting. The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 3.6% in the 12 months through July, matching the gain in June. August's data will published later this month.
The overall CPI rose 0.3% in August, the smallest increase since January, after gaining 0.5% in July. The food index increased 0.4%, slowing down after two straight months of hefty gains, as the cost of dairy products declined. 
Prices for food away from home also moderated. Gasoline prices rose 2.8% after increasing 2.4% in July.
In the 12 months through August, the CPI increased 5.3% after soaring 5.4% on a year-on-year basis in July.

""Even with a slowdown in monthly CPI gains, big year-over-year increases will persist until well into 2022,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
""The slowdown in sectors sensitive to the reopening is another piece of evidence for the transitory story of inflation, but steady increases elsewhere show that inflation should stick around even after those sectors adjust.""

Sudan is in the midst of a deep economic crisis and the government is pushing for increased exports, particularly from agriculture, to pull the country out, along with foreign aid and investment. 
The largest export was gold, of which Sudan exported 16.7 tonnes, worth about $1 billion, the central bank data showed, almost all of it to the United Arab Emirates. 
Most of the gold produced in Sudan is smuggled, a practice the government has said it is tackling, and the data showed an increase in exports of about 250%.
Other major exports were peanuts, sesame and livestock.
Sudan has run a wide trade deficit ranging between $4 billion to more than $6 billion since the secession of oil-producing South Sudan in 2011.
The lack of foreign reserves has lead to shortages of crucial medicines and lines for fuel and bread, as well as power outages in recent years.

    ""It’s a fairly positive report in the sense that the Fed's wish that inflation is transitory is coming true. If you look at a lot of the areas that were leading the surge in inflation, now they are all starting to come back down to earth. If you look at some of the components - used cars and trucks (prices), car and truck rentals, airline fares, lodging were all down.""
    ""It continues to give the Fed maximum flexibility. Our base case expectation is that they are going to discuss (tapering) at the meeting next week but they won't have an official announcement till the November meeting.""
GENNADIY GOLDBERG, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“There was a little bit of softening in some of the covid impacted components, as expected. Airfares were down quite precipitously…hotel rates were down as well… so quite a bit of moderation here. The big question of course is in some of the core components, including OER, that’s the big one. Certainly, you had some cooling in used vehicle prices as well, so a lot of what’s been driving CPI higher in recent months, vehicles, a rebound in airfares and hotels, all of them moderated.”
“The big question is some of these core components like shelter. You had fairly tame OER, so that’s actually cooled a little bit on the last few months, but rent has gone up. So rents are reflective potentially of people moving back to the cities, trying to get apartments or housing once again, that could be driving up costs as well. But on net, if you look at shelter prices, they have been going up pretty dramatically, driven by strong OER and strong hotel price increases and now that’s cooled quite significantly as well. So, a bit of a mixed bag I would say, but overall its suggesting moderation in prices, which certainly is going to weigh on yields.”
“It’s unclear whether one inflation number will really move the needle for the Fed. I think, from a broader perspective, the prices part of their requirements for tapering have been met, in terms of inflation. I think the threshold has already been met for tapering, so I don’t think it necessarily changes the outlook very much. The big question I think for the Fed is going to be whether this further moderation pushes inflation lower in the next few months, and whether inflation significantly cools. And that could be interesting for the rate hike component of all of this, which they have been very careful to divorce from tapering. I don‘t think this materially changes the picture for the Fed in terms of tapering, they are focused really on the unemployment side of the picture and most of them would agree that even with this number the prices part, the substantial further progress on inflation, has already been met.” 
ROBERT PAVLIK, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, DAKOTA WEALTH, FAIRFIELD, CONNECTICUT
    “Better than expected (data) and that's fuelling the rise in the Dow futures. The CPI was only up three tenths of percent versus four tenths estimate and below the last month, that's giving a little bit of encouragement for the overall market.”
“And so while market participants are cautious on inflation, at least this was a good sign and when you partnered up with a PPI, it's moving in the right direction.”
“It doesn't force the Fed's hand, so there's a possibility that the Fed could drag its feet and when they do announce tapering, it may be smaller than what the Street may be looking for that time.”
“Right now I'm not thinking that they do any tapering in September, but I'm not sure where their heads are all at. If it's up to Powell, he'll wait till November. But other Fed members seem to be on different pages. “
THOMAS HAYES, MANAGING MEMBER, GREAT HILL CAPITAL LLC, NEW YORK.  
    ""We didn't get a really high number on CPI. The fact that they came in just below expectations gives the Fed the chance to punt any taper implementation announcement from September to November."" 
    ""The inflation numbers confirmed that the Fed can push it off a little bit more cause there were worries if inflation numbers came in really hot then the Fed's hand might be forced to move sooner rather than later, in spite of recent employment numbers being weak.""
KATHY BOSTJANCIC, CHIEF US FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, OXFORD ECONOMICS, NEW YORK
    ""Overall, we're getting further moderation in the monthly advance in consumer prices, especially at the core level. The core level was little bit softer than we thought, so that's good news. But the year-on-year rate is only easing slightly. Ongoing supply chain bottlenecks amid strong demand are going to keep the pace of inflation elevated and sticky in the coming months.""
    ""If these inflation readings continue to moderate, then it will be transitory. It's just that transitory could be longer than maybe previously expected.""

ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
    ""The CPI has been running less hot than PPI and that's been true for the last five months. When you look at the month over month number, which is the most important number, there is sequential improvement, which is a very good sign. We're clearly seeing inflation heading in the right direction. These numbers are still elevated for historic norms but the sequential trend is still improving and that's a good sign.""

565,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid by U.S. consumers rose in August by less than forecast, suggesting that some of the upward pressure on inflation is beginning to wane.
The consumer price index increased 0.3% from July, according to Labor Department data released Tuesday. Compared with a year ago, the CPI rose 5.3%. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, so-called core inflation climbed 0.1% from the prior month and 4% from August 2020.
Follow the reaction in real-time here on Bloomberg’s TOPLive blog
Economists in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.4% increase in the overall CPI from the prior month and a 5.3% gain from a year earlier, based on the median estimates.
Faced with mounting cost pressures as a result of materials shortages, transportation bottlenecks and hiring difficulties, businesses have been boosting prices for consumer goods and services. While price spikes associated with the economy’s reopening are beginning to abate, tenuous supply chains could linger well into 2022 and keep inflation elevated.
A Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey showed Monday that consumers expect inflation at 4% over the next three years, the highest in data back to mid-2013.
The CPI data precede next week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where Fed officials will debate how and when to begin tapering asset purchases. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that the central bank could begin reducing its monthly bond purchases this year, but didn’t give a specific time line.  
Parts shortages that have driven up input costs are restraining production. In the last week,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. and 3M Co. both downgraded their outlooks for car output due to semiconductor shortages, while Nestle said it is introducing even bigger price hikes as commodity and transportation costs surge. 
Meantime, Hurricane Ida halted operations at refineries and petrochemical plants in the south, adding to pandemic-related supply chain bottlenecks and likely price pressures as well.

The bank said the rise in gross domestic product was due to economic recovery in the European Union, the Balkan country's main trade partner.
""All monthly data, especially retail trade, industrial output and export indicate that a historically high increase of local economy in the second quarter has been recorded,"" the bank said in a statement, adding that it might revise up its earlier projection of a 3.4% rise of GDP for 2021.
The bank forecast inflation in 2021 at 1.2%, up from an earlier forecast 0.6%. It explained that the rise was primarily due to a low baseline effect in 2020 when oil prices were at a record low, and the rise in prices of raw materials, transportation and demand.

Norges Bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at a monetary policy meeting next week, from a record low 0%, and has said https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/breaking-ranks-norway-signals-4-rate-hikes-by-mid-2022-2021-06-17 it may hike three times more by mid-2022 if the economy develops as expected.
""Contacts report higher output growth in all sectors over the past three months. The rise has been most pronounced in manufacturing and household services,"" Norges Bank said in a statement accompanying the quarterly sentiment index.
""Close to half of the contacts are facing capacity constraints.""
The Norwegian economy has accelerated thanks to a gradual lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, and policy-makers and analysts expect above-trend growth for several more years.
Norway's crown currency traded largely unchanged on the news at 10.17 against the euro at 0828 GMT.
The sentiment index, most of which was collected from Aug. 2-20, showed employment had risen during the preceding three months and will likely continue to do so.
""At the same time, more contacts than for some time report difficulties in recruiting qualified labour. The supply of raw materials is also cited as a key capacity constraint,"" Norges Bank said.
""Higher raw materials prices are driving an accelerating rise in prices in all sectors,"" it added.
The survey's estimate for annual wage growth in 2021 was revised up to 2.9% up from 2.7% seen in May.
The data provided backing for the central bank's plan to hike rates, Handelsbanken said.

LONDON (Reuters) -British employers added a record 241,000 staff last month, lifting the total number of employees on company payrolls to just above the level before Britain first went into a COVID-19 lockdown last year, official data showed on Tuesday.
The robust jobs data https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/september2021 comes as Britain's government prepares to end its furlough programme on Sept. 30, which helped around a third of employees at its peak, and last month was still supporting around 700,000 workers full time.
Tuesday's figures mark an upturn from July's weak economic data, when Britain's recovery slowed to a crawl as hundreds of thousands of workers had to stay home after being notified of contact with people who had tested positive for COVID-19.
British government bond yields rose after the data - with the two-year benchmark touching its highest since the start of the pandemic - as the figures revived questions about when the Bank of England might start to raise interest rates.
Businesses reported more than 1 million vacancies in the three months to August - an all-time high, and the unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.6% in the three months to July, the Office for National Statistics said, in line with economists' expectations in a Reuters poll.
""The latest data brought more signs that labour market slack is declining fast and that labour shortages are contributing to faster underlying pay growth,"" said Ruth Gregory, economist at Capital Economics.
During the three months to July, the number of people in employment, which includes the self-employed as well as employees, rose by 183,000 to 32.4 million, broadly in line with forecasts.
""Today's statistics show that our plan for jobs is working,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said. 
The number of people in work on this broader measure was still well below the record 33.1 million just before the pandemic. Fewer people are self-employed and more report being unemployed or ""inactive"" - a category which includes many students, home-makers and those no longer looking for work.
RECORD VACANCIES
Businesses reported 1.034 million vacancies in the three months to August, the highest since these records began in 2001.
Vacancies were especially high in sectors such as accommodation and food services, which laid off many workers last year but have seen a boom in demand as COVID-19 restrictions eased in recent months.
A lack of some key workers such as truck drivers and food processing workers has caused temporary gaps in some supermarket shelves and on restaurant menus.
""Ongoing supply and labour shortages are impeding further growth,"" said Matthew Percival, director of people and skills at the Confederation of British Industry.
The CBI and other business groups have been calling on the government to temporarily relax new post-Brexit immigration rules while they train new workers.
Businesses have reported pay pressure rising sharply. Tuesday's official data showed average weekly earnings in the three months to July were 8.3% higher than the year before, just below the all-time high of 8.8% for the three months to July.
The ONS said these hefty increases should not be taken at face value as low-paid jobs were more likely to have been cut over the past year, and fewer people were now on reduced furlough pay.
Pay excluding bonuses rose by 6.8% year on year in the three months to July, and the ONS said the true underlying rate was probably somewhere between 3.6% and 5.1% -- still high by pre-pandemic standards.
Britain's job market offers a challenge for the BoE as it tries to judge how persistent inflation pressures and supply-chain bottlenecks are likely to be.
Last month, half BoE's policymakers judged that some basic conditions for a rate rise had already been met, but others stressed there was still significant slack in the job market.
Gregory from Capital Economics said she expected labour shortages would be temporary.

""The danger is that they persist for longer than we expect, causing inflation to stay high and the Bank of England to pull the interest rate trigger next year,"" she added.
Financial markets price in a first rate rise to 0.25% from 0.1% by May, while economists polled by Reuters on average see one by late 2022.

India has attracted foreign direct investment at record levels even during the COVID-19 pandemic with total FDI inflows amounting to $81.72 billion in 2020/21, 10% higher than the previous financial year.
The survey conducted at the peak of the second wave of the pandemic showed 44% of the respondents across the United States, UK, Japan, and Singapore said they were planning additional or first-time investments in India. 
Amongst new investors, nearly two-thirds are planning investments in India within the next two years, it showed.
Utilities, particularly energy infrastructure, got 57% votes in terms of sectors that will see new investments while financial services at 49% and healthcare at 48% were other highly ranked sectors.
Deloitte said FDI is widely regarded as a foundation for accelerating a country's economic growth.
""While foreign investment inflows into India have been consistently rising over the past five years, they have not contributed proportionately to the country's capital formation and GDP,"" the report said.
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019 had said his country aimed to be a $5 trillion economy by 2024. India's GDP is currently less than $3 trillion.
Several economists have said the pandemic has put at risk the country's $5 trillion economy goal by 2024 and that it will take at least an additional two years to achieve that target. 
Deloitte in an analysis accompanying the report said India will need $8 trillion of gross capital formation or new greenfield assets to become a $5 trillion economy by 2026/27.
""Based on past trends, India will need at least $400 billion, cumulatively, over six years, in FDI,"" it added.
While India is perceived as both politically and economically stable, it scored lower on institutional stability i.e., regulatory clarity and efficient judicial redress and mechanisms, the survey showed.

Inadequate infrastructure was another negative factor cited by existing and potential investors.
""After the challenges of the past 18 months, the Deloitte survey is a positive validation of the underlying strengths of the Indian economy, in particular its appeal for foreign investors,"" said Punit Renjen, Deloitte Global CEO.

It said that for much of 2021 shoppers were shielded from price increases, with more products being sold on promotion compared to 2020.
However, in the past month only 27.5% of spending was done on deals.
""Other than the early days of lockdown last year, that is the lowest level recorded in the 15 years which we have tracked this data, with retailers aiming to offer everyday low prices instead,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.
It said fastest-rising prices are in markets such as savoury snacks, cat food and ambient cakes and pastries, while falling in fresh bacon, vegetables and ambient cooking sauces.
Last week Morrisons, Britain's fourth-largest supermarket group, warned industry-wide price rises were coming. 
It said inflation would be driven by recent sustained commodity price increases and freight costs, and the current shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers.
Kantar said total year-on-year grocery sales fell by 1.9% in the 12 weeks to Sept. 5. But sales remain higher than they were before the pandemic, up by 8.7% compared with this period in 2019.
Sales at market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) were up 0.2% over the 12-week period year-on-year.

It was the only grocer among Britain's big four players - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - to see a sales increase, pushing its market share up 0.5 percentage point to 27.3%.
Kantar said the market share of online grocery sales fell to 12.2% in the four weeks to Sept. 5 from 13% four weeks ago – the lowest level since May 2020 as consumers continue to move their spending back in-store.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A measure of Australian business conditions showed a welcome improvement in August as sales and profits weather coronavirus lockdowns in parts of the country, offering hope of a speedy recovery once restrictions ease.
Tuesday's survey from National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) showed its index of business conditions rose 4 points to +14 in August, recovering part of July's sharp 14-point drop.
The survey's measure of confidence edged up 2 points to -5, after diving in July as lockdowns spread from Sydney to Melbourne and Canberra.
Importantly, the conditions index remained well above the long-run average and businesses were faring much better than during the first round of lockdowns last year.
""The resilience of the survey during the current episode likely reflects the healthy momentum in the economy before the lockdowns, ongoing fiscal and monetary support as well as greater certainty that the lockdowns will end as vaccines roll out,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster.
""While we expect a large hit to activity in Q3, the survey supports our view that once restrictions are eased, activity will rebound.""
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) also argued last week that the economy could recover quickly once the lockdowns were over and forecast strong growth for next year.
An easing in rules is expected to begin around mid-October when more of the population is vaccinated, though different states have different views about when to open fully.
A separate survey of consumers from ANZ out on Tuesday showed New South Wales' plan to re-open announced last week had an immediate impact, with confidence jumping 10.6% in the state.
That helped lift sentiment nationally by 3.1% as consumers' mood improved on their own financial health and the economy in general.
The NAB survey showed consumers were still shopping as its measure of sales rebounded to +19 in August, from +12 in July, while profitability firmed to +15 from +5.
The employment index fell 2 points to +9, though that was also above the long-run average.

Forward orders picked up sharply to +6, but capacity utilisation dipped back to 80.0% pointing to a lot of slack in the system.
The NAB survey was conducted from Aug. 17-30.

575,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 05:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy likely slowed further in August, with data on consumption, industrial output and investment due Wednesday to reveal the extent of the damage caused by an outbreak of the delta variant. 
The extent of the slowdown will be closely watched for sign that it’s serious enough to prompt authorities to change their current stance of slowly withdrawing liquidity from markets and keeping stimulus limited. The ongoing regulatory crackdown on sectors like education, the internet and property may have exacerbated the recent economic weakness. 
The Wednesday data will likely show China’s recovery remains uneven. Strong global demand led to record exports in August but domestic consumers turned cautious as lockdowns and fear kept many at home, meaning the industrial sector is expected to have fared better than retail sales.
To better gauge China’s economic performance, here’s a guide to what to watch for in the data:
Consumption 
Consumption took the hardest hit in August as the Covid-19 delta variant spread across China, forcing the closure of tourist spots and some cities during the summer holidays. However even before those outbreaks, China’s consumption rebound was not solid. 
Indicators of the services industry painted a bleak picture for August, with both official and private gauges pointing to the first contraction since early 2020. 
Although China now has the outbreak under control and has relaxed most restrictions, the impact on consumer spending will likely linger and the incomes of service providers will take a long time to recover. 
Property 
Government measures to curb soaring house prices and also the worsening situation at China’s largest property developer likely cooled property investment further. Authorities haven’t stepped in to open the credit taps to support real-estate demand and construction, and there’s no indication yet that will change, with the government aiming to make housing more affordable as part of efforts to reduce inequality.
Home sales sales in the four first-tier cities declined 16% in August from a year ago, according to Bloomberg calculations based on weekly data. What happened with property investment nationwide will be key for the economy, as 28% of gross domestic product is related to the property sector, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) economists. 
Infrastructure
China used to rely on debt-fueled construction to boost growth, but infrastructure investment has disappointed this year, even as the slowdown has sparked hopes for more government action. In July, spending on roads and other infrastructure shrank the most since the pandemic last February, dragged down by the slow pace of borrowing by local governments. 
The finance ministry in late August urged local government to speed up the issuance of special bonds and make good use of the proceeds. While sales of government debt in August were the highest they’ve been all year, it will take time before the effect of any increase in bonds sales shows up in the investment data. Investment is expected to pick up in the coming months but a lack of good projects and local governments’ pressure to cut debt could make the outlook for spending less optimistic. 
Youth Unemployment
Although China’s overall jobless rate has stabilized at pre-pandemic levels, the youth unemployment rate has hovered at an elevated level this year. Authorities have repeatedly emphasized the urgency of this issue and pledged targeted measures to help graduates find jobs or start their own businesses. With the graduation season coming to an end, seeing how many of the 9.1 million fresh graduates have been absorbed by the labor market will be key.
Policy Stance
Policy makers have so far refrained from large-scale stimulus this year, instead resorting to some low-profile tools to increase credit supply to parts of the economy, especially small businesses. With the latest wave of Covid, surging production costs, and a likely slowdown in exports, some economists are calling for more action to support growth. 
Any change in the statistics bureau’s assessment of the current economic operations and policy outlook is worth looking at. In previous reports, it had consistently stated that the momentum of the steady recovery was sustained, despite a number of downside risks. 
The People’s Bank of China is also likely to announce the rate for 1-year loans to banks Wednesday morning, when 600 billion yuan ($93 billion) of lending matures, but there is no expectation the bank will cut the rate if it does make any loans.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Monday posted a $171 billion budget deficit for August, 15% lower than the $200 billion gap a year ago, as recovery-driven tax receipts grew faster than outlays for COVID-19 pandemic relief programs, the Treasury Department said.
The August deficit was $2 billion less than the average forecast by analysts in a Reuters survey. A U.S. Treasury official said the August budget results would not alter the department's estimates for when Treasury's extraordinary financing measures to avoid breaching the $28.4 trillion debt limit would be exhausted.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last week urged Congress to increase or suspend the debt limit, saying that ""cash and extraordinary measures will be exhausted during the month of October,"" leaving the government unable to fully pay its obligations.
Receipts in August rose 20% from the year-earlier period to $268 billion while outlays in the month were up 4% to $439 billion. Some $59 billion in August benefits were paid in July because the month started on a non-business day.

For the first 11 months of the 2021 fiscal year, the deficit totaled $2.711 trillion, down 10% from the $3.007 trillion for the same period last year, as revenues improved.

LONDON (Reuters) - A key market gauge of euro zone inflation expectations rose to its highest level since mid-2015 on Monday, a further sign that investor perceptions over the direction of future inflation are shifting.
Euro zone bond yields were broadly steady, although relief over a slowdown in the pace of European Central Bank purchases appeared to be in the past.
And evidence that expectations for higher inflation, boosted by Germany's election race and signs of supply bottlenecks in recent weeks, moved into the spotlight.
The five-year, five-year breakeven inflation forward, a long-term market inflation gauge tracked by the ECB, rose to 1.8207%, its highest level since mid-2015 and a step closer to the ECB's new 2% inflation target.
It has risen almost 15 bps since the start of September and by 1502 GMT it was at 1.7856%.
""The rise in breakevens and inflation is a reflection of much greater inflation risk than in recent years,"" said Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING. 
""I don’t think the median long-term inflation expectation has shifted materially higher but the range of possible outcomes is much wider than it was a couple of years ago, and skewed towards high prints,"" he added, citing factors such as supply chain disruptions for the increase in inflation protection. 
Graphic: Euro zone inflation expectations at highest since 2015: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwvkrdrzqpm/inflation1310.png 
The ECB's Isabel Schnabel said on Monday that inflation will ""in all likelihood"" ease next year after the current spike but she listed risks to that scenario from supply bottlenecks to higher wages.
Breakeven inflation in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, has also shot up, a sign for some analysts that investors expect policies under the next German government could stoke inflation.
Germany's 10-year breakeven inflation rate is at around 1.59% -- its highest since late 2018.
Olaf Scholz, the Social Democrat candidate to become Germany's next chancellor, beat his conservative rival in a primetime TV debate on Sunday, a snap poll showed, further boosting his chances of succeeding Angela Merkel after the Sept. 26 election.
Most experts think a three-way coalition is the most likely outcome -- a scenario that could take several months to negotiate.
""There is uncertainty about the coalition outcome and that is effecting the term premium in German bonds, especially the inflation expectation component,"" said Rabobank senior rates strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor. ""There is a concern that the next government could have policies that are inflationary.""
Germany's 10-year Bund yield was steady at around -0.33% -- near eight-week highs hit ahead of last Thursday's ECB meeting.
Bond markets were expected to face fresh headwinds in the form of new supply and U.S. economic data. 

Bond issuance steps up this week, with ING estimating that supply could reach 30 billion euros from Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, France and Spain. 
The European Union on Monday mandated banks to sell a new 7-year bond, which will likely on Tuesday, according to a lead manager memo seen by Reuters. And Greece said it may issue a green bond in the second half of 2022.

(Reuters) -U.S. consumers' expectations for how much inflation will change over the next year and the coming three years rose last month to the highest levels since 2013, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
Year-ahead inflation expectations increased for the 10th straight month to a median of 5.2% in August, according to the monthly survey of consumer expectations. Inflation expectations over the next three years increased to a median of 4.0%. Both metrics are at the highest they've ever been for the survey, which was launched in 2013. 
U.S. central bank officials are keeping a close watch on inflation expectations as they try to evaluate whether the pricing pressures triggered by the coronavirus pandemic will pass or have more lasting effects on the economy. 
Some policymakers say ending the massive asset purchases the Fed launched last year to support markets and the economy sooner rather than later will give officials more options for responding down the road if inflation lasts longer than anticipated. 
Several policymakers said they expect the Fed to begin winding those asset purchases down later this year despite a weakening in jobs growth in August. 
The New York Fed survey showed that consumers are raising their expectations for how much more they may have to spend on housing, food and other essentials over the next year. 
Expectations for how much home prices will increase over the next year dropped again in August for the third straight month, but were still elevated at a median of 5.9%, the survey found.

Food prices are expected to grow by 7.9% over the next year, up from 7.1% in July. Rent is expected to increase by 10% over the next 12 months and the price of medical care is expected to rise by 9.7% over the next year - both up 0.2 percentage point from July. 
The report is based on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turkish industrial output rose 8.7% annually in July, much less than forecast after a recent strong rebound, while the current account deficit was wider than expected, data showed on Monday, fuelling speculation about the timing of possible rate cuts.
The disappointing data came after a strong run in which recoveries in consumption, exports and tourism set the economy on a path to near 10% overall growth this year, leaving last year's initial coronavirus fallout behind. 
Month-on-month, industrial output shrank 4.2% in July on a calendar and seasonally adjusted basis, the Turkish Statistical Institute said. 
In a Reuters poll, production was forecast to rise 15.1% annually in July after surging 23.9% in June.
The data, along with figures showing monthly retail sales growth slowing to 0.7% in July from 15% in June, suggested the economy made a soft start to the third quarter, said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
""The weak hard activity indicators coming alongside comments from the central bank that it is currently putting more emphasis on core inflation... mean that it is more likely than not that an easing cycle begins before the year is out,"" he said.
Last week the central bank governor said the current 19% policy rate was tight enough to bring inflation down in the fourth quarter, suggesting monetary easing is on the way. He also stressed the importance of core inflation, which fell below 17% annually in August. 
Separate data showed a current account deficit of $683 million in July, compared with a poll forecast of $570 million.
The July balance had been expected to show a relatively small deficit, due largely to a partial recovery in tourism revenues. The deficit narrowed from $1.122 billion in June.
The lira was 0.4% stronger at 8.4520 against the dollar after the data. But it has shed 2.5% in the last four trading days and some analysts expect more volatility heading into a monetary policy meeting on Sept. 23.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) on Monday said the lira would likely weaken to 8.85 by year end, adding the central bank increasingly risks making the mistake of cutting interest rates too early given political pressure for stimulus. 

Many Turkish factories halted work in March last year, soon after the first COVID-19 infection was recorded. Output dropped 31.4% in April and 19.9% in May before a recovery began in June.
Throughout the pandemic Turkey imposed temporary curfews and business closures, including a tough but brief lockdown in April and May of this year. The measures were lifted in June.

For the full year, the median estimate of 11 economists was a $20 billion deficit, with responses ranging from $18 billion to $25 billion.
Turkey's import-reliant economy, worth $717 billion in 2020, has been prone to big trade deficits and a boom-bust growth cycle that was exacerbated by the pandemic.
The current account recorded a deficit of $36.72 billion in 2020 due mostly to a sharp rise in the trade deficit and plunging tourism revenues due to coronavirus fallout.
The median estimate in the Reuters poll showed a deficit of $570 million in July, with estimates ranging between a deficit of $1 billion and a surplus of $39 million.
A major component of the current account, the trade deficit widened 51.3% year-on-year to $4.28 billion in July, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute.
An uptick in tourism revenue from last year, as well as exports are expected to narrow the deficit in 2021 as a whole compared to last year.
Last month, the central bank revised four data points, including trade credits and short-term external debt stock, which is also expected to impact the deficit for the full year.
For 2021 as a whole, the $20-billion forecast was lower than a government estimate of $21 billion released on Sunday as part of its medium-term projections, which also predicted it would drop to $18.6 billion next year.
Central Bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu said in July that Turkey would record a current account surplus for the rest of the year.

Turkey's 12-month current account ended 2019 in surplus for the first time since 2001, though the monthly reading dipped back towards the end of the year as the economy recovered from a recession brought on by a 2018 currency crisis.
The central bank is scheduled to announce July current account data at 0700 GMT on Sept. 13.

The Russian capital uses cheaper migrant labour, typically workers from the former Soviet Union countries of central Asia, for construction projects across the city of more than 12 million people.
""We hope that in the near future, restrictions on their entry into the country will be eased,"" Yefimov said. ""The shortage of labour resources is leading to employers, first and foremost real estate developers, buying employees from each other, due to which the cost of their services grows.""
Russia imposed wide-ranging travel restrictions at the start of the pandemic in March 2020, many of which remain in force, making cross-border travel a challenge for certain countries' citizens.
House prices in Moscow were stagnant for a few years, Yefimov said, but against the backdrop of the pandemic, the cost of housing has increased, catching up with inflation.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's wholesale inflation hovered near a 13-year high in August as raw material imports continued to rise on solid global demand, data showed on Monday, putting pressure on companies to pass on higher costs to households.
Many analysts, however, expect companies to keep any price hike moderate as state of emergency curbs to combat the coronavirus pandemic weigh on domestic demand.
""It's difficult to pass over the (wholesale) price increase to consumer goods given the weak consumption,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research.
""The BOJ might be forced to continue its massive easing even when central banks around the world seek normalisation.""
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, rose 5.5% in August from a year earlier, slightly below a median market forecast for a 5.6% gain, Bank of Japan data showed.
It was the sixth straight month of increase and a tad below the 5.6% surge in July, which was the fastest pace of increase since September 2008.
The index, at 105.8, marked the highest level since 1982, when Japan's economy was booming from an asset-inflated bubble.
While gains in fuel costs moderated, prices rose for chemical, steel and wood products as global demand for such goods remained strong, Shigeru Shimizu, head of the BOJ's price statistics division, told a briefing.
""As the global economy continues to recover thanks to progress in vaccinations, domestic wholesale inflation will remain under upward pressure, though there's uncertainty over the outlook due to a resurgence in infections,"" he said.
Underscoring the huge cost pressure companies were facing, the yen-based import prices rose a record 29.2% in August from a year earlier, the data showed.

Japan's economy has emerged from last year's slump thanks to robust exports. But continuing state of emergency curbs have dampened prospects for a solid recovery in the current quarter.
Core consumer prices fell 0.2% in July from a year earlier, marking the 12th straight month of declines and staying distant from the BOJ's elusive 2% target.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased solidly in August, leading to the biggest annual gain in nearly 11 years, suggesting that high inflation is likely to persist for a while as the unrelenting COVID-19 pandemic continues to pressure supply chains.
Strong demand and supply constraints were underscored by other data on Friday showing the pace of inventory accumulation at wholesalers slowed in July. It is now taking wholesalers the fewest months in seven years to clear shelves. 
""Supply chain bottlenecks have persisted longer and more intensely than most predicted at the beginning of this year, and widespread labor shortages are among the main input issues producers are dealing with,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""This means consumer price inflation should remain elevated for a while."" 
The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7% last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0%, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7% advance in services following a 1.1% jump in July.
A 1.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in July, with food rebounding 2.9%.
Transportation and warehousing prices shot up 2.8%.
The latest global wave of COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, has disrupted production at factories in Southeast Asia, key raw materials suppliers for manufactures in the United States. Congestion at Chinese ports is also adding to the pressure on U.S. supply chains.
In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3%, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010 when the series was revamped, after surging 7.8% in July.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI gaining 0.6% on a monthly basis and rising 8.2% year-on-year.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
LOGISTICS DELAYS
Though surveys from the Institute for Supply Management this month showed measures of prices paid by manufacturers and services industries fell significantly in August, they remained elevated. Factories and services providers still struggled to secure labor and raw materials, and faced logistics delays. 
This was corroborated by the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on Wednesday compiled from information collected on or before Aug. 30 showing ""contacts reported generally higher input prices but, as with labor, they were mostly concerned about getting the supplies they needed versus the price.""
The supply bottlenecks are making it harder for businesses to restock after running down inventories in the first half of the year. In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories rose 0.6% in July after surging 1.2% in June. Sales increased 2.0%. At July's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.20 months to clear shelves, the fewest since July 2014, from 1.22 in June.
""Producers are struggling to replenish their stockpiles against surging demand,"" said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
With inventories tight, producers are easily passing on the higher costs to consumers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has steadfastly maintained that high inflation is transitory. 
Though most economists share this view, some argue that strong wage growth from a tightening labor market suggests inflation could be more persistent. 
""Today's data on wholesale prices should be eye-opening for the Fed, as inflation pressures still don't appear to be easing and will likely continue to be felt by the consumer in the coming months,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 3.6% in the 12 months through July after a similar gain in June. Data next week will likely show the consumer price index rising 0.4% in August and increasing 5.3% on a year-on-year basis, according to a Reuters survey.
High inflation and supply constraints, which tanked motor vehicle sales in August, have prompted economists to slash their third-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates to as low as a 3.5% annualized rate from as high as 8.25%. The economy grew at a 6.6% rate in the second quarter.
""The danger with inflation is once prices go up, they don't go back down and the economy and producers and consumers all have to live in a costlier world where many don't have the means to do more than just barely survive,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. 
There are, however, signs that inflation is likely nearing its peak. Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices rose 0.3%, the smallest gain since last November. The so-called core PPI shot up 0.9% in July. 
In the 12 months through August, the core PPI accelerated 6.3%. That was the largest rise since the government introduced the series in August 2014 and followed a 6.1% increase in July.

Details of the PPI components, which feed into the core PCE price index, were mixed. Healthcare costs fell 0.2%. Portfolio management fees rose 1.1% and airline tickets increased 8.9% after soaring 9.1% in July.
""Soft medical services suggest that evidence of persistently stronger inflation in PCE may be more limited,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada posted strong jobs growth in August and the unemployment rate fell to its lowest point since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data that could boost Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's hopes for reelection later this month. 
Canada added 90,200 jobs last month, close to analysts' average estimate of 100,000, and the jobless rate dropped to 7.1%, below the 7.3% estimate, Statistics Canada reported on Friday. Employment is now within 1% of pre-pandemic levels. 
The ruling Liberals led by Trudeau, now in the crucial last stage of the campaign before the Sept. 20 election https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-trudeau-tries-boost-reelection-campaign-after-inconclusive-debate-2021-09-10, have seized upon the country's economic rebound to trumpet their fiscal policies, including heavy spending to fight the pandemic.
""These results are a testament to the hard work of Canadians, as well as the strength of our plan to get Canadians through the pandemic to recovery,"" Mona Fortier, the junior finance minister, said in a statement. 
The employment data showed the summer reopening had bolstered the hardest-hit segments of the services sector.
""It was a solid report, probably a little bit better than we expected. The main story is the economy is slowly but surely grinding back,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
Trudeau's hopes of extending his six years in power were dealt a setback last month after data showed Canada's economy unexpectedly contracted https://www.reuters.com/business/canadian-economy-shrank-11-q2-july-gdp-seen-down-04-2021-08-31 in the second quarter and again in July. Next week's inflation numbers are the final major economic release before the vote. Trudeau is in a close race with his main rival, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole.
Economists said while the jobs data was mostly positive, the number of hours worked by Canadians barely changed and remains 2.6% below pre-pandemic levels, which could weigh on economic growth.
""As much as it is nice to see more people going back to work it is a concern that we are not seeing more hours worked in the economy,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities.
The services sector dominated the job gains, led mostly by the hard-hit accommodation and food services segments. Service-sector employment returned to pre-pandemic levels last month, though that was mostly due to growth in professional services, public administration and educational services.
The construction sector posted its first employment gain since March, helping keep the goods sector in positive territory. That was partially offset by a decline in agricultural jobs.
Analysts noted that challenges remain, especially as a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections threatens to unravel some gains in the services sector. Labor shortages amid a persistent mismatch between job seekers' skills and employers needs will also weigh.

""If Canada wants stable economic growth, we need to make sure we're creating opportunities for a post-pandemic workforce,"" the Canadian Chamber of Commerce's Leah Nord said in a statement.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.5% higher at 1.26 to the greenback, or 79.37 U.S. cents.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory gate inflation hit a 13-year high in August driven by roaring raw materials prices despite Beijing's attempts to cool them, putting more pressure on manufacturers in the world's second-largest economy.
The producer price index (PPI) rose 9.5% from a year earlier in August, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Thursday, faster than the 9.0% increase tipped in a Reuters poll and the 9.0% reported in July. That was the fastest pace since August 2008.
China's economy has recovered strongly from last year's coronavirus slump but has been losing steam recently due to domestic COVID-19 outbreaks, high raw material prices, tighter property curbs and a campaign to reduce carbon emissions.
Commodity prices have been on a tear in recent months, hurting the bottom lines of many mid- and downstream factories. China's coal prices soared to a record high on Tuesday over supply concerns as major coal regions started fresh rounds of safety checks.
Earnings at China's industrial firms have slowed for five straight months.
But coal and metals prices will likely drop back as construction activity falls amid restrictions on the property sector and slowing credit growth, Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.
And the higher comparison base towards the end of last year will also pull down overall inflation. ""We doubt producer price inflation will rise much further,"" he said.
The coal, chemicals and metals industries drove much of the price increases in August, according to a statement released alongside the data by Dong Lijuan, an NBS official.
Prices in the coal mining and washing sector grew 57.1% in August from a year earlier.
A separate NBS statement showed that the consumer price index (CPI) in August rose 0.8% from a year earlier, compared with a 1.0% gain in a Reuters poll and below the government target of around 3% this year.
China tightened social restrictions to curb the COVID-19 Delta variant including travel limits, which have hampered service-sector demand, although Beijing has largely contained the latest coronavirus outbreaks.
Declines in airfares, travel and hotel room prices due to the pandemic slowed consumer inflation on a monthly basis, according to NBS's Dong.
Service-sector activity plunged in August to the lowest level since the pandemic's first wave in April 2020, a recent survey showed, as COVID-19 restrictions threatened to derail the recovery.
Many analysts expect the People's Bank of China to deliver a further cut to the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later this year to lift growth, on top of July's cut, which released around 1 trillion yuan ($155.32 billion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.
""We expect monetary policy to remain prudent with a slightly loosening bias for the rest of the year,"" said Jing Liu, senior economist for Greater China at HSBC, in a note.
China's consumer price inflation, which is likely to stay muted, will not constrain a slight loosening stance, she added.
The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, stood at 1.2% on year, versus a 1.3% rise in July.

586,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 10:31AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventory accumulation slowed in July, lagging further behind sales, and it is now taking wholesalers the shortest time in seven years to clear shelves.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories rose 0.6% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers increased 1.2% in June. Wholesale inventories climbed 11.5% in July from a year earlier.
Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP increased 0.7% in July.
Business inventories were depleted in the first half of the year, but shortages amid persistent supply bottlenecks because of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent ports congestion in China are frustrating efforts to replenish stocks. 

Still, inventory rebuilding is expected to underpin economic growth in the second half of the year.
Sales at wholesalers increased 2.0% in July after accelerating 2.3% in June. At July's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.20 months to clear shelves, the fewest since July 2014, from 1.22 in June.

587,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers increased in August by more than forecast as persistent supply chain disruptions squeeze production costs higher. 
The producer price index for final demand increased 0.7% from the prior month and 8.3% from a year ago, a fresh series high, Labor Department data showed Friday. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI advanced 0.6%, and was up 6.7% from August of last year.
The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.6% month-over-month advance in both the overall PPI and the core figure.
A variety of challenges across the production pipeline -- from materials shortages and shipping bottlenecks to rising labor expenses -- have driven up costs for producers. Many companies have passed along those additional costs onto consumers through higher prices in recent months, further stoking consumer inflation.
The PPI report showed prices for goods increased 1% after a 0.6% gain in the prior month, while the cost of services rose 0.7%. 
Meats, residential natural gas, industrial chemicals and motor vehicles were among the goods that moved higher. The rise in services reflected a 7.8% gain in margins for health, beauty and optical goods retailing. 
The PPI data come ahead of next week’s consumer price index report, which is forecast to show a 0.4% advance in the CPI from the prior month and a 5.3% increase from August of 2020.
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure often preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- rose 0.3% from the prior month and increased 6.3% from a year earlier. 
Global Inflation
Producers around the world are raising prices amid soaring costs for commodities and shipping. A separate report out earlier this week showed prices paid to producers in China jumped in August from a year earlier by the most in 13 years.
Costs are growing earlier in the U.S. production pipeline as well. Processed goods for intermediate demand, which include materials and components used in manufacturing and construction, rose 1% in August and were up 23% from 12 months ago, a fresh 46-year high.
Meantime, several districts surveyed by the Federal Reserve “indicated that businesses anticipate significant hikes in their selling prices in the months ahead,” according to the U.S. central bank’s Beige Book released Wednesday.
The elevated cost pressures and supply chain bottlenecks are augmenting the uncertainty already faced by businesses. PPG Industries Inc (NYSE:PPG)., which specializes in paints and coatings, withdrew its 2021 financial guidance on Tuesday as supply-chain disruptions drag on sales and higher raw-material costs hurt profit.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy unexpectedly slowed to a crawl in July as the Delta variant of COVID-19 spread rapidly after lockdown restrictions were eased and as a 'pingdemic' kept many workers at home self-isolating. 
Economic output rose just 0.1% in July, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday, the smallest monthly increase since January when Britain went into a new national lockdown.
Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected month-on-month growth of 0.6% in gross domestic product. Only two of the 26 analysts had expected such a weak reading. 
Finance minister Rishi Sunak said he was confident that the economy would continue to recover from the pandemic.
But the slowdown in growth may bolster the case of Bank of England officials who think it is premature to talk about withdrawing stimulus, despite growing inflation pressure.
Earlier this week, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said he saw a levelling-off in the recovery taking place, with labour shortages, global supply chain problems and Brexit disruption combining to stunt the economic recovery.
""Stalling GDP and rising inflation will leave a whiff of stagflation in the air,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at the Capital Economics consultancy.
Britain saw a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in July as the Delta variant spread rapidly, leading to hundreds of thousands of workers being ordered to stay at home under self-isolation rules which have been relaxed. 
The ONS said some businesses had complained of staff being unable to come to work because they were required to self-isolate - the so-called pingdemic https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/pingdemic-english-businesses-buckle-under-covid-isolation-demands-2021-07-19 - and a fall in construction output was linked to post-lockdown problems in global supply chains.
SHOPPPERS REIN IN SPENDING 
The dominant services sector was flat in July from June with output in consumer-facing services falling for the first time since January, driven mostly by a drop in the retail sector.
Industrial output grew by 1.2%, boosted by the return to production of an oil field, but manufacturing was flat.
Construction output fell by a monthly 1.6%.
Early signs of how Britain's economy fared in August have suggested that consumers got back to spending, with unofficial measures of retail sales and broader expenditure bouncing back.
Data published on Thursday showed spending on payment cards returned to 99% of its pre-pandemic level in early September.
But businesses continued to struggle in August with staff shortages and supply chain problems - and it remains to be seen how this week's announcement of tax hikes for workers and employers, to fund health and social care, will affect the economy.
""This week the market voted that the impact would be negative, as the share price of economically sensitive companies such as house-builders fell,"" said Emma Mogford, fund manager of Premier Miton's Monthly Income Fund.

Separate ONS data showed Britain's goods trade deficit hit a seven-month high in July at 12.7 billion pounds ($17.60 billion), widened by a slowdown in exports to the European Union which have been hit by post-Brexit trade barriers.

Overall sales in China stood at 1.8 million vehicles in August, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.
China's vehicle sales jumped 13.7% in the first eight months of 2021 from the same period a year ago, as the market recovered from pandemic lows.
CAAM now expects 2021 growth to be slower than a previously forecast 6.5%, said Chen Shihua, a senior official at CAAM.
A prolonged global chip shortage has unsettled major automakers including Ford Motor (NYSE:F), Honda Motor, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), forcing many to idle or curtail production.
The shortage was unlikely to be resolved soon as the pandemic rages on in many parts of the world, Chen said.

One bright spot in the data was the strong sales of new energy vehicles, which more than doubled in August to 321,000 vehicles. These include battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
The government's promotion of greener vehicles to cut pollution has prompted electric car makers such as Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc, Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) Inc and BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd to expand manufacturing capacity in China.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports likely surged for the sixth straight month in August thanks to strong global demand for machinery goods and a flattering comparison with last year's pandemic-induced slump, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
Japan's wholesale prices were expected to stay at more than 10-year highs in August due to global commodity inflation and a weak yen, while firms' machinery orders likely rose in July, according to analysts polled by Reuters.
Exports likely jumped 34.0% in August from a year earlier, the sixth month of double-digit gains, though they were seen slowing from July's 37.0% increase, the poll showed.
Export growth has been strong even as factory halts and supply issues due to the spread of COVID-19 variants in Southeast Asia and a global chip shortage are hitting Japanese carmakers.
Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, said there are heightened worries about whether a steady economic recovery holds up.
""China's economic recovery has stalled recently and the spread of the Delta variant in advanced nations is having a suppressing effect,"" he said.
Imports likely rose 40.0% year-on-year in August, which would result in a trade deficit of 47.7 billion yen ($434.74 million) after two straight months of surpluses, the poll showed.
Separate data from the Bank of Japan is expected to show Japan's wholesale prices rose 5.6% year-on-year in August, matching the prior month's 13-year high.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which tracks the prices companies charge each other for their goods, probably rose 0.2% month-on-month in August.
The finance ministry will announce the trade data at 8:50 a.m. on Sept. 16 (2350GMT, Sept. 15), while the CGPI data is due at 8:50 a.m. on Sept. 13 (2350GMT, Sept. 12).
Cabinet Office data due at 8:50 a.m. Wednesday (2350 GMT Tuesday) will likely show core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series as a leading indicator of capital expenditure in the coming six to nine months, gained 3.1% month-on-month in July.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electricity utilities, likely grew 15.7% in July partly because of a double-digit drop in the same month last year.

Japan's economy grew faster than initially estimated in the April-June quarter, helped by solid capital expenditure, although a resurgence in COVID-19 is undermining service-sector consumption and clouding the outlook.

(Reuters) - Applications to start new U.S. businesses declined in August for just the third time this year and the first time since June as the recent surge in coronavirus cases put entrepreneurs on hold. 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that business applications fell 4.7% to a seasonally adjusted 427,842 last month. The data is derived from business applications for tax identification numbers. 
There were a seasonally adjusted 50,564 applications from corporations, down 2.5% from July. Applications for businesses with planned wages totaled 51,240, a decrease of 3.7% from the prior month. 
Economic growth nationwide is forecast to accelerate this year at the fastest pace in four decades. However, the rise in the number of Americans testing positive for the coronavirus and the lingering Delta variant have halted plans for both entrepreneurs and job applicants. 
""The latest COVID surge brings another wave of uncertainty that may weigh on entrepreneurs' willingness to start new businesses,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""The Delta variant will also make it harder for new businesses to hire if people are fearful of contracting the virus in their new job.""
Business applications fell in all four U.S. regions, led by a 6.2% drop in the South. Applications were lower across all industries except in mining, real estate and unclassified services. Mining posted a 6.6% increase from July. 

The largest drop was in utilities, which recorded a 12.8% decline, with other sizable drops in accommodation and food services, as well as the arts and entertainment category. 
Based on last month's figures, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau, which compiles the data, projected about 31,994 new business start-ups with payroll tax liabilities would form within four quarters of application, down 4.5% compared with the estimates for July.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell to the lowest level in nearly 18 months last week, offering more evidence that job growth was being hindered by labor shortages rather than cooling demand for workers.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed the number of people on state unemployment rolls plunging to levels last seen in mid-March 2020 when the economy was reeling from mandatory shutdowns of nonessential businesses to slow the first wave of COVID-19 cases.
The continued downward trend in layoffs followed on the heels of a report on Wednesday showing job openings raced to a new record high in July, indicating a tightening labor market, which some economists argued could put pressure on the Federal Reserve to announce when it would start scaling back its massive monthly bond-buying program. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has offered no signal on when the U.S. central bank plans to cut its asset purchases beyond saying it could be ""this year.""
""There is likely to be a fierce debate at the coming Fed meeting on how tight the labor market is, but if policymakers focus on the most timely data we've got, they will realize that the labor market is close to meeting their more stringent criteria for an interest rate hike let alone the trigger for tapering,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 35,000 to a seasonally adjusted 310,000 for the week ended Sept. 4, the lowest level since mid-March 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 335,000 applications for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims, which economists say offer a better read of the labor market, fell 8,005 to 284,287 last week. 
The second straight weekly decline in claims came even as filings surged in Louisiana after Hurricane Ida devastated U.S. offshore energy production and knocked off power. There were also notable increases in California, Virginia and Michigan. But those rises were offset by big decreases in claims in Florida, Georgia, New York, Missouri and Tennessee. 
Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. They are closing in on the upper end of the 200,000-250,000 range viewed as consistent with healthy labor market conditions. 
President Joe Biden hailed the declining claims as ""further evidence of a durable economic recovery.""
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

DOWNWARD TREND 
The continued downward trend in claims suggested the labor market was holding up, despite a resurgence in infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus. Rising cases contributed to holding back job growth in August, with nonfarm payrolls increasing only 235,000, the smallest gain since January. Payrolls surged 1.053 million in July.
""There has been no pickup in job separations even as the economy endures another wave of new virus infections,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Job openings surged to a record 10.9 million at the end of July. The Fed's Beige Book report compiled from information collected on or before Aug. 30 showed ""all Districts noted extensive labor shortages that were constraining employment and, in many cases, impeding business activity.""
About 8.4 million people are officially unemployed. This labor market imbalance has been blamed on lack of affordable childcare, fears of contracting the coronavirus, generous unemployment benefits funded by the federal government as well as pandemic-related retirements and career changes. 
There is cautious optimism that the labor crunch will ease starting in September following the expiration of the government-funded unemployment benefits on Monday, including a $300 weekly subsidy, blamed by businesses and Republicans for discouraging the jobless from seeking work.
The new school year is underway, with most school districts offering in-person learning. 
But the Delta variant could cause reluctance among some people to return to the labor force. There is also no guarantee that the expiration of the expanded benefits will force the unemployed to look for work. An early termination of these benefits by about 25 states led by Republican governors over the summer did not expand the labor pool.
The claims report also showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid fell 22,000 to 2.783 million in the week ended Aug. 28, the lowest level since mid-March 2020. 
At least 11.930 million people were receiving benefits under all programs during the week ended Aug. 21. According to Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation, more than 8 million people lost all their pandemic benefits on Monday and another 2.1 million saw their benefits cut by $1,200 per month.
This so-called unemployment insurance cliff could contribute to curbing economic growth this quarter, though consumer spending is likely to remain underpinned by the strengthening labor market and the accompanying strong wage gains. 
Households also accumulated more than $2 trillion in savings during the pandemic and have seen their wealth boosted by record-high stock market and house prices.

""That's going to weigh on growth, but the consumer spending will still increase, just at a somewhat weaker pace,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Growth estimates for the third quarter have been slashed following dismal automobile sales in August, soaring COVID-19 cases and fading fiscal stimulus.

593,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 11:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Up to 1 million people could still be on Britain's furlough programme when it expires at the end of the month, official figures suggested on Thursday after the number of people leaving the scheme had slowed.
The finance ministry said 1.6 million workers were still furloughed at the end of July, down from almost 2 million a month earlier but a slower decline than in previous months.
More up-to-date data, based on reports from businesses, suggested that the fall slowed further last month.
Britain's statistics office said 6% of the workforce was furloughed as of Aug. 22.
""The number of people coming off furlough over the summer has slowed to a trickle, as some firms and sectors – notably overseas tourism – struggle to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity,"" Charlie McCurdy, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said.
""As a result, up to a million employees could still be on furlough when the scheme closes at the end of this month.""
Finance minister Rishi Sunak, who rushed out the furlough scheme to keep people employed when the coronavirus pandemic struck last year, celebrated the fall in furlough levels to their lowest since the start of the pandemic.
He pointed to how young people in particular were getting back to work.
Bank of England officials are trying to gauge whether workers still on scheme when it expires can fill the record number of jobs currently open or become unemployed.

Earlier on Thursday the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said businesses faced the most severe shortage of job candidates on record due to the economy's post-lockdown surge and Brexit.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey on Wednesday said he was anxious about job vacancies not being filled. The end of the furlough scheme would help to correct this but he said he had ""concern about the persistence in the labour market story"".

594,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 05:35AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory gate inflation hit a 13-year high in August driven by roaring raw materials prices despite Beijing's attempts to cool them, putting more pressure on manufacturers in the world's second-largest economy.
The producer price index (PPI) rose 9.5% from a year earlier in August, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Thursday, faster than the 9.0% increase tipped in a Reuters poll and the 9.0% reported in July. That was the fastest pace since August 2008.
China's economy has recovered strongly from last year's coronavirus slump but has been losing steam recently due to domestic COVID-19 outbreaks, high raw material prices, tighter property curbs and a campaign to reduce carbon emissions.
Commodity prices have been on a tear in recent months, hurting the bottom lines of many mid- and downstream factories. China's coal prices soared to a record high on Tuesday over supply concerns as major coal regions started fresh rounds of safety checks.
Earnings at China's industrial firms have slowed for five straight months.
But coal and metals prices will likely drop back as construction activity falls amid restrictions on the property sector and slowing credit growth, Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.
And the higher comparison base towards the end of last year will also pull down overall inflation. ""We doubt producer price inflation will rise much further,"" he said.
The coal, chemicals and metals industries drove much of the price increases in August, according to a statement released alongside the data by Dong Lijuan, an NBS official.
Prices in the coal mining and washing sector grew 57.1% in August from a year earlier.
A separate NBS statement showed that the consumer price index (CPI) in August rose 0.8% from a year earlier, compared with a 1.0% gain in a Reuters poll and below the government target of around 3% this year.
China tightened social restrictions to curb the COVID-19 Delta variant including travel limits, which have hampered service-sector demand, although Beijing has largely contained the latest coronavirus outbreaks.
Declines in airfares, travel and hotel room prices due to the pandemic slowed consumer inflation on a monthly basis, according to NBS's Dong.
Service-sector activity plunged in August to the lowest level since the pandemic's first wave in April 2020, a recent survey showed, as COVID-19 restrictions threatened to derail the recovery.
Many analysts expect the People's Bank of China to deliver a further cut to the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later this year to lift growth, on top of July's cut, which released around 1 trillion yuan ($6.47 trillion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.
""We expect monetary policy to remain prudent with a slightly loosening bias for the rest of the year,"" said Jing Liu, senior economist for Greater China at HSBC, in a note.

China's consumer price inflation, which is likely to stay muted, will not constrain a slight loosening stance, she added.
The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, stood at 1.2% on year, versus a 1.3% rise in July.

Investing.com – China’s factory gate inflation rose to a 13-year high in August. Soaring raw material prices contributed to the gains while exerting further pressure on Chinese manufacturers.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day showed that the producer price index grew 9.5% year-on-year. The rate was faster than the 9% growth reported during the previous month, which was also the figure in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. It was also the fastest pace of growth since August 2008.
Recent COVID-19 outbreaks, high raw material prices, tighter property curbs and a campaign to reduce carbon emissions have all contributed to the slowdown in China’s economic recovery from COVID-19.
The coal, chemicals and metals industries drove much of the commodity price increases in August, NBS official Dong Lijuan said in a statement released alongside the data.
Meanwhile, the NSB data also said that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.1% month-on-month, lower than the 0.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 0.3% growth reported during the previous month.
The CPI grew 0.8% year-on-year, lower than the 1% growth reported during the previous month and in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
Consumption was hit by tighter restrictive measures, including travel limits, to curb the latest COVID-19 outbreak. Declines in airfares, travel and hotel room prices thanks to these measures slowed consumer inflation on a monthly basis, said NBS's Dong.
The People's Bank of China is now widely expected to further cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later in 2021. It already cut the amount in July 2021, a move that released around CNY1 trillion ($154.72 billion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.
""We expect monetary policy to remain prudent with a slightly loosening bias for the rest of the year,"" HSBC senior economist for Greater China Jing Liu said in a note.
China's consumer price inflation, which is likely to stay muted, will not constrain a slight loosening stance, the note added."
596,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 10:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory-gate inflation accelerated in August to a 13-year high, with commodity prices remaining elevated despite Beijing’s battle to curb gains.  
Producer prices rose 9.5% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Thursday, faster than the 9% gain in July. The consumer price index rose 0.8% last month from a year earlier, following a 1% gain in the previous month. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted both rates would be unchanged. 
The rally in commodity prices has been a major driver of factory-gate inflation this year, and even though the government has taken targeted steps to curb the rapid price gains, such as boosting supplies and attempting to cutting back on hoarding, they’ve had limited effect so far.
Business prospects are being affected in different ways by the surge in PPI. Consumer-goods makers and other downstream manufacturers are seeing profits squeezed, while upstream sectors, like raw materials producers, are benefiting.
The People’s Bank of China sees inflation pressure in the economy as controllable, saying last month that the pickup in producer prices in the first half was likely temporary. The economic recovery has also lost steam recently following the outbreak of new virus cases, adding to downward pressure on inflation.
Growth in consumer prices remained subdued in the month, in part because of sluggish consumer spending after authorities imposed restrictions to contain the spread of the delta variant last month. Non-food CPI climbed 1.9% from a year ago.
Pork prices, a key element in China’s CPI basket, continued to fall sharply in the month, resulting in the biggest drop in the food price index since 2017. Core CPI, which strips out volatile items such as food and energy, rose 1.2%. 
While muted consumer inflation pressure provides room for more policy support, this week’s strong export data and comments from central bank officials suggest a smaller chance of more easing in the near future, economists say.

597,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 08:10PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - British employers are facing the most severe shortage of job candidates on record due to the post-lockdown surge in the economy and Brexit, pushing up starting pay for permanent staff at an unprecedented pace, a recruiters' body said.
In a survey which will be studied by the Bank of England as it weighs up the risk of a longer-term inflation problem, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said employers were increasingly upbeat about the outlook in August.
But their attempts to hire staff were being frustrated by shortages of staff. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said on Wednesday he was concerned about getting jobs filled.
REC said a reluctance by employees to switch roles due to the pandemic, fewer European Union workers and skill shortages were contributing to the staffing squeeze.
""Candidate shortages continue to plague businesses, who are all recruiting from the same pool of talent and struggling to fill gaps,"" said Claire Warnes, head of education, skills and productivity at KPMG UK, which co-produces the survey.
The pace of recruitment for permanent posts hit the highest in the survey's nearly 24-year history last month. Temporary hiring and open vacancies were not far off July's record levels.
Salaries for newly placed permanent staff rose at the fastest rate on record. Wage inflation for temp workers was the second-quickest.
Warnes said the expiry of the government's furlough scheme at the end of this month did not mean the staffing ""crisis"" was going to go away as more people become available for work.
""Many businesses will have changed their business model during the pandemic, and so significant numbers of staff returning from furlough may need re-skilling to rejoin the workforce in the same or another sector,"" she said. 
Separately, the British Chambers of Commerce said staff shortages and global post-lockdown supply chain disruption were likely to slow Britain's economic growth in the coming months.
That meant the economy would recover its pre-pandemic size only in the first quarter of 2022, later than the BoE's prediction of the last quarter of 2021, the BCC said.
Investment by businesses was likely to fall this year as the hit to firms' finances from the pandemic, bigger tax bills and concerns over future COVID restrictions outweigh the boost from a tax incentive announced by finance minister Rishi Sunak.

The BCC said business investment would be 5.4% lower than its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2023 while consumer spending is projected to be 5.1% higher.
""It is concerning that business investment  looks like being  the weak point of the recovery because it undermines the UK's ability to raise productivity and increase our long-term growth prospects,"" Suren  Thiru, the BCC's head of economics, said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings raced to a new record high in July while layoffs rose moderately, suggesting last month's sharp slowdown in hiring was due to employers being unable to find workers rather than weak demand for labor. 
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Wednesday also showed a steady increase in the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs, a sign of confidence in the labor market.
""This is a super tight job market,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""The ongoing struggle to find the right worker for the right role continues.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, jumped 749,000 to 10.9 million on the last day of July, the highest level since the series began in December 2000. It was the fifth straight month that job openings, which have been increasing since January, hit a record high. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast vacancies rising to 10 million. July's broad increase was led by the healthcare and social assistance, finance and insurance, and accommodation and food services industries.
Job openings rose in the Northeast, South, Midwest and West regions. The job openings rate surged to a record 6.9% from 6.5% in June, driven by medium-sized businesses with 50-249 workers. The rate for large firms with 5,000 or more employees fell.
Hiring slipped 160,000 to 6.7 million, pulled down by decreases in retail trade, durable goods manufacturing and educational services. State and local government education hiring increased, as did federal government employment. 
The hiring rate fell to 4.5% from 4.7% in June. The hires rate dropped for large businesses.
Stocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
TIGHT LABOR MARKET 
The job openings to hires ratio, a measure of labor market tightness and companies' ability to find workers, rose to 1.64 in July. The JOLTS data followed in the wake of a government report last Friday that showed nonfarm payrolls increased by only 235,000 jobs in August, the smallest gain since January, after surging by 1.053 million in July.
Labor market tightness was underscored by the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on Wednesday, based on information collected on or before Aug. 30, which showed ""all Districts noted extensive labor shortages that were constraining employment and, in many cases, impeding business activity.""
The COVID-19 pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, creating worker shortages even as 8.4 million people are officially unemployed. 
Lack of affordable childcare, fears of contracting the coronavirus, generous unemployment benefits funded by the federal government as well as pandemic-related retirements and career changes have been blamed for the disconnect. 
The labor crunch is expected to ease starting in September, with the government-funded unemployment benefits having expired on Monday. The new school year is underway and most school districts are offering in-person learning. 
But soaring COVID-19 cases, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, could cause reluctance among some people to return to the labor force. Employment is 5.3 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
""While we expect the labor market will continue to make some progress in coming months, it will likely take some time for these severe labor imbalances to get resolved,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
The JOLTS report also showed 107,000 people voluntarily quit their jobs in July, lifting the total to 4.0 million. That reflected increases in the wholesale trade as well as state and local government education areas. 
There were decreases in the number of people quitting in the transportation, warehousing, utilities and federal government categories. Though the overall quits rate was unchanged at 2.7%, the rate for the private sector - a leading indicator of wage growth - increased to 3.1% from 3.0%. 
The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence, and July's rise in the private rate suggested further wage gains, which could keep inflation high for a while. Annual wage growth topped 4% in August. 
Some economists said labor market tightness could put pressure on the Fed to announce when it would start scaling back its massive monthly bond-buying program. Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month affirmed the ongoing economic recovery, but offered no signal on when the U.S. central bank plans to cut its asset purchases beyond saying it could be ""this year.""
""It takes two to tango and the problem with job creation would appear to be a reluctance to supply labor, not a diminishment of demand, and we would love to hear the economic theory that explains how continued Fed bond purchases encourage workers to return to work,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, a senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 

Layoffs and discharges rose a modest 105,000 to 1.5 million. That lifted the layoffs rate to 1.0% from 0.9% in June. There were 83 unemployed workers for every 100 job openings in July.
""Even if demand slows down or even falters, job seekers remain in a relatively favorable bargaining position,"" said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's economy grew faster than the initially estimated in the April-June quarter, helped by solid capital expenditure, although a resurgence in COVID-19 is undermining service-sector consumption and clouding the outlook.
Revised gross domestic product (GDP) data by the Cabinet Office released on Wednesday showed the economy grew an annualised 1.9% in April-June, beating economists' median forecast for a 1.6% gain and the initial estimate of a 1.3% expansion.
It followed Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's announcement last Friday that he was stepping down, paving the way for the Sept. 29 ruling party leadership race, in which contenders will outline their plans to revive the world's third-largest economy.
The upward revision was caused by better-than-initially-estimated business spending, as a brisk global economic recovery powered capital expenditure and factory output, which more than offset weak service-sector activity.
Still, Japan's economic recovery remains fragile due to slow COVID-19 vaccinations and as pandemic restrictions hamper private-sector activity.
""Japan's recovery is lagging behind other advanced economies. As such, the economy's fully-fledged recovery needs to wait at least until early next year,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
However, global chip shortages may put a drag on Japanese car production and shipments while signs of China's economic slowdown emerge as sources of concern.
""The 1.9% April-June growth was not enough to push back the nearly 4% dip in January-March - less than a half of it,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. ""On average, 'stalling' could be the main description of Japan's economy during the first half of 2021.""
The second-quarter GDP growth figures translated into a quarter-on-quarter expansion of 0.5% in price-adjusted terms, better than an initial reading of a 0.3% growth and the median estimate for a 0.4% gain.
The capital expenditure component of GDP grew 2.3% in the second quarter from January-March, bigger than the median forecast for 2.0% growth and the preliminary 1.7% gain.
Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of Japan's GDP, grew 0.9% in April-June from the previous three months, up slightly from a preliminary estimate of a 0.8% gain.
Domestic demand contributed 0.8 percentage points to revised growth figures, while net exports - or exports minus imports - shaved 0.3 percentage point off the second quarter growth.
Separate data on Wednesday showed the economy watchers survey, a gauge of service-sector sentiment fell to a seven-month low in August and at the fastest pace since February 2020.

The government downgraded the watchers' overall assessment of the economy, saying ""there are weaknesses in the recovery due to the effect of COVID-19.""
The data came a day after a weaker-than-expected July household spending reading, which suggested https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/japans-july-household-spending-rises-less-than-expected-2021-09-07 the COVID-19 resurgence could have started hampering consumer activities even earlier in the current quarter.

600,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 08:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s economy was expanding at a faster pace than initially estimated last quarter ahead of a record surge in virus cases that contributed to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s decision to step down.
Gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of 1.9% in the three months to June, buoyed by companies’ capital spending, extra government spending and stronger private consumption, according to a revised report by the Cabinet Office on Wednesday. 
Economists had expected growth of 1.6% compared with an initial government estimate of 1.3%.
The heftier spending by businesses suggests the corporate world is already looking at growth beyond the pandemic. 
Still, the subsequent surge in cases during Japan’s Olympic summer is likely to have had a bigger impact on spending by firms and shoppers this quarter. It remains unclear who will replace Suga, but economists expect the new premier will unveil a stimulus package to shore up the recovery as the nation heads into a general election this autumn.

Eurostat said on Tuesday that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro increased by 2.2% quarter-on-quarter for a 14.3% year-on-year rise. These compared with earlier estimates of respectively 2.0% and 13.6%.
The economies of every euro zone country expanded except Malta, although for Luxembourg there was no data.
However, GDP volumes in the single currency bloc were still 2.5% below their pre-COVID peaks. The United States is already 0.8% higher than its end 2019 level.
Eurostat said household consumption in the April-June period added 1.9 percentage points to the overall quarterly figure, with government spending and investment adding 0.3 and 0.2 points respectively.
A draw-down of inventories pulled 0.2 percentage points off the overall figure, while the net impact of trade was zero.
Eurostat said also employment rose 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter and by 1.8% year-on-year. The former figure was above the previously reported 0.5% increase, the latter was the same as that released in August.

602,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 03:56AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices rose sharply last month in a further sign of strong momentum in the market even after the partial withdrawal of tax breaks on property purchases, a survey from mortgage lender Halifax showed on Tuesday.
House prices rose by 0.7% in August, the biggest month-on-month rise for three months and following a 0.4% rise in July, Halifax said.
In annual terms, house price growth cooled to 7.1% from 7.6% in July, the weakest reading for five months.
The number of property purchases slumped in July when a year-long exemption from stamp duty for the first 500,000 pounds ($687,550) of a house purchase ended in England and Northern Ireland. 
But other gauges of the housing market suggest the gradual expiry of the tax breaks has not resulted in a sharp slowdown.
""We believe structural factors have driven record levels of buyer activity – such as the demand for more space amid greater home working,"" Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax, said.

""These trends look set to persist and the price gains made since the start of the pandemic are unlikely to be reversed once the remaining tax break comes to an end later this month.""
Last week, rival mortgage lender Nationwide said its measure of British house prices rebounded surprisingly strongly in August to show their second-biggest monthly rise in 15 years after a fall in July.

603,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 03:46AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports unexpectedly grew at a faster pace in August thanks to solid global demand, helping take some of the pressure off the world's second-biggest economy as it navigates its way through headwinds from several fronts. 
The Asian giant staged an impressive recovery from a coronavirus-battered slump, but economic momentum has weakened recently due to the Delta variant-driven COVID-19 outbreaks, high raw material prices, slowing factory activity, tighter measures to tame hot property prices and a campaign to reduce carbon emissions.
Shipments from the world's biggest exporter in August rose 25.6% year-on-year, picking up speed from a 19.3.% gain in July, customs data showed on Tuesday, pointing to some resilience in China's industrial sector.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast growth of 17.1%. 
""While near-term headwinds remain, supply constraints in China have eased and we think the global economic recovery will continue to underpin China’s exports later this year and in 2022,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics.
Exports from neighbouring countries also showed encouraging growth last month, with South Korean shipments accelerating on strong overseas demand
The shipments breakdown showed a broad-based uptick across all goods types, said Sheana Yue, assistant economist at Capital Economics.
""In particular, the rebound in Chinese-made consumer goods such as electronics, furniture and recreational products possibly reflected retailers in advanced economies replenishing their inventories ahead of the Christmas shopping season,"" said Yue. 
Moreover, some of the port gridlock appears to have cleared in a boost to China's shippers last month.
The eastern coastal ports have suffered congestion as a terminal at the country's second biggest container port shut down for two weeks due to a COVID-19 case. That put further pressure on global supply chains already struggling with a shortage of container vessels and high raw material prices.
The stretched global shipping capacity has left many boxes of finished goods piled up on Chinese factory floors, a factor set to bump up Chinese export numbers over coming months, said Meng Xianglong, founder of Heji Trade & Credit Research Centre based in the port city of Ningbo.
""I think it's expected that China's robust export growth will extend until the end of this year (around Christmas) or even into the beginning of the next year,"" Meng said, adding that some factories are fully booked until the first quarter of 2022. 
MORE STIMULUS ON TAP?
However, behind the robust headline figures, businesses are struggling on the ground. Companies faced increasing pressure https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-factory-activity-expands-slower-pace-august-official-pmi-2021-08-31 in August as factory activity expanded at a slower pace while the services sector slumped into contraction. A global semiconductor shortage has added to the strains on exporters.
The country appears to have largely contained the latest coronavirus outbreaks of the more infectious Delta variant, but it prompted measures including mass testing for millions of people as well as travel restrictions of varying degrees in August.
Many analysts expect the central bank to deliver a further cut to the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later this year to lift growth, on top of July's cut https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-rrr-cut-idUSKCN2EF0U4 which released around 1 trillion yuan ($6.47 trillion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.
Imports increased 33.1% year-on-year in August, beating an expected 26.8% gain in the Reuters poll, led by still high commodity prices and partly reflecting the statistical effect of the low figures a year ago. 
Commodity prices remain elevated despite Beijing's attempts to cool them. In July, imports grew 28.1%.
China's coal imports in August rose 35.8% from a year ago due to tight domestic supply and strong demand, while iron ore imports also picked up for the first time in five months.

China posted a trade surplus of $58.34 billion in August, versus the poll's forecast for a $51.05 billion surplus and $56.58 billion in July.
The trade surplus with the United States - a source of years-long friction between the two economic powers - rose to $37.68 billion from $35.4 billion in July, Reuters calculations based on the customs data showed.

Investing.com – China’s trade data for August was surprisingly better than expected, with solid global demand counteracting the impact from the country’s latest COVID-19 outbreak and supply chain bottlenecks.
The country’s economic recovery from COVID-19 was halted due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19 cases involving the Delta strain. High raw material prices, slowing exports, tighter measures to curb property prices and a campaign to reduce carbon emissions also contributed to the slowdown.
Exports grew 25.6% year-on-year, according to data released earlier in the day. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com had predicted a 17.1% increase while the previous month’s growth was 19.3%.
Some of the gridlock in Chinese ports seems to have cleared, giving export figures a boost. Ports on China’s eastern coast were congested as Ningbo Zhoushan port, the country’s second-largest container port, shut down for two weeks thanks to a COVID-19 case. The closure placed further pressure on global supply chains already dealing with a shortage of container vessels and high raw material prices.
Meanwhile, imports grew 33.1% year-on-year, with forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicting a 26.8% growth and a 28.1% growth recorded for the previous month. The trade balance was $58.34 billion, against the $51.05 billion figure in Investing.com forecasts and the previous month’s $56.59 billion reading.
China has brought its latest COVID-19 outbreak largely under control, but the economic damage from restrictive measures imposed to do so has already been done. Investors now widely expect the People’s Bank of China to further reduce the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later in the year. The central bank already cut the amount in July, which released around CNY1 trillion ($154.82 billion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.",,,,,
605,"<span>Sep 06, 2021 11:45PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- China’s export growth unexpectedly surged in August, with port disruptions due to fresh outbreaks of the delta virus having limited impact on trade.
Exports rose 25.6% in dollar terms from a year earlier, while imports grew 33.1%, the customs administration said Tuesday, resulting in a trade surplus of $58.3 billion for the month. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast exports would increase 17.3% and imports would rise 26.9%.
The pickup came despite port delays and high shipping costs, which have disrupted global supply chains. Signs of a slowdown are starting to emerge globally as Covid cases rise, and while officials have warned of weaker export growth for the rest of the year as risks and challenges build, it’s yet to weigh on the actual value of exports. 
Manufacturing surveys last week showed a contraction in new export orders for a fourth consecutive month in August, which may signal a slowdown in the future. Beyond trade, the economy is taking a knock from a plunge in services activity related to Covid restrictions, a tightening in property curbs and lower infrastructure spending.

Spending rose by 15.4% last month compared with its pre-pandemic level in August 2019, marked by higher spending across all categories apart from international travel, Barclaycard said. 
Theatres, music festivals and theme parks saw a big jump in spending.
""Socialising, shopping, and staycations were top of the agenda for Brits in August, as families and friends made the most of the school holidays, giving a welcome boost to hospitality and leisure businesses,"" said Raheel Ahmed, Barclaycard head of consumer products.
Other surveys have pointed to a recent slowdown in Britain's economy after an initial surge following the relaxation of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. 
A separate survey from the British Retail Consortium on Tuesday showed retail spending rose 3.0% in August compared with a year ago, with clothing stores performing strongly - something echoed by the Barclaycard report. 

Still, the BRC said this marked a slowdown from annual growth of 6.4% in July.
""As post-lockdown pent-up demand has softened, the growth in retail sales we have seen over the past few months slowed for August. Nonetheless, we still saw growth above pre-pandemic levels, as people returned to stores in greater numbers,"" said BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson.

The figures published by the Federal Statistics Office showed orders for goods 'Made in Germany' rose by 3.4% on the month in seasonally adjusted terms. A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a fall of 1.0% on the month.
A breakdown of the data showed that domestic orders fell 2.5% on the month and foreign orders rose by 8.0%.
Orders from the euro area fell by 4.1%, while orders from the rest of the world rose by 15.7%, mainly due to large orders from the shipbuilding sector.
Bastian Hepperle, economist at Bankhaus Lampe, said: ""The development in Germany is disappointing: the order books are still well filled and the order backlog is high.""
""Due to a lack of materials and primary products, there are considerable difficulties in processing orders,"" he added.
A survey showed last week that German manufacturers struggled to meet strong demand for industrial goods in August as supply shortages for raw materials and components such as semiconductors held back production and pushed up prices.

The German economy rebounded in the second quarter https://reut.rs/3mt1SDq with a growth rate of 1.6% compared to the previous three months as an easing of COVID-19 curbs spurred consumers to dip into record savings piled up during the winter lockdown.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 54.1 in August from 55.8 in July, remaining above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
The output sub-index stood at 55.4 against 59.7 in July, its weakest reading since October last year.
""The non-oil economy went slightly off the boil in August, as output growth slipped to the weakest level for ten months amid a slowdown in new business gains,"" said David Owen, economist at IHS Markit.
""Whilst domestic orders remained strong and firms saw an upturn in tourist numbers, many businesses continued to find market conditions challenging amid the pandemic,"" he said.
The world's largest crude exporter was hit hard last year by the twin shock of the coronavirus and record-low oil prices, but the economy has recovered this year amid improved demand due to the easing of coronavirus-related restrictions.
New business continued to expand in August but at a slower pace, partly because of a softer increase in export sales as rising COVID-19 cases in other parts of the world weighed on the recovery in foreign demand, the survey said.
The rate of job creation was unchanged from July and remained marginal as businesses found levels of staffing sufficient to complete existing work.

""Job creation disappointed again in August, due to a further fall in backlog volumes and a subdued outlook for future activity"", said Owen.
""Whilst firms expect an improvement in domestic business conditions in the coming months, the unpredictability of the pandemic meant that downside risks remained high.""

The percentage of people who said they did not look for work because of COVID-19 health concerns also remained largely unchanged during a period when coronavirus cases caused by the Delta variant shot up across the United States. 
The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics figures were part of an ongoing additional survey of households carried out by the U.S. government that has accompanied the monthly jobs report since the beginning of the pandemic. Overall, U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in August, the main report showed. 
Daily new COVID-19 cases have climbed to a seven-month high in the United States, with more than 160,000 infections on average reported nationwide in recent days, and several real-time data indicators have pointed to a slowdown in economic activity as cases surged. 
""Ultimately, the Delta variant wave is a harsh reminder that the pandemic is still in the driver's seat, and it controls our economic future,"" said Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at Glassdoor.

Approximately 5.65 million people were unable to work in August or reported reduced hours due to their business either closing entirely or cutting back operations, up from roughly 5.15 million the prior month, according to the survey.

“The bad news is that it missed by two thirds basically of expectations and the good news is that it gives the Fed cover to push off tapering. It just means more Fed for longer.
""My guess is the announcement will be in November instead of September and the implementation will probably be late this year or more likely early next year. Beginning taper in October is now off the table.""
""So bad news is good news, is the name of the game with this jobs report.""
MICHAEL ARONE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISORS, BOSTON
    ""The number's a big disappointment and its clear the delta variant had a negative impact on the labor economy this summer. You can tell because leisure and hospitality didn't add any jobs and retail actually lost jobs. It suggests areas that are highly sensitive to the pandemic suffered as the delta variant surged.""
    ""Markets are still signaling a positive open. Bond yields have ticked down some. Investors will conclude that perhaps this will put the Fed further on hold in terms of the timing of tapering. Markets may be ok with that. The market is always concerned the Fed will begin to tighten monetary policy prematurely. A number like this suggests that there's still some more time before the Fed begins to taper.""
DAVID PETROSINELLI, SENIOR TRADER, INSPEREX, NEW YORK
“It's not good news for stocks, obviously. There were a lot of crosscurrents in these numbers at the end of the summer. But at the end of the day, the Delta variant of COVID is definitely keeping people out of the labor force. 
“There’s other stuff in the report to hang on to. Average hourly earnings was big and the unemployment rate was down to. There's some stuff that hit the screws, but the headline number of jobs created was definitely smaller, definitely a disappointment."" 
STEVE RICK, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CUNA MUTUAL GROUP, MADISON, WISCONSIN (email)
""Following the strong jobs gains from July, it is disappointing to see the August jobs failed to meet expectations. However, this is not completely surprising given the emergence of the Delta variant which has continued to beat down the already hurting leisure and hospitality sectors. Though it is disheartening that the labor market couldn’t maintain momentum from the rapid growth, it shows us that our best way to true economic recovery is continuing the work of fully containing COVID-19 cases. 
  ""The beginning of the summer showed a surge in economic growth as COVID-19 cases plummeted and people got vaccinated. In July alone, 943,000 jobs were added to the economy and unemployment fell to 5.4%, the lowest since the pandemic began. The average growth for the three months prior to July was 567,000. While we’ve taken a bit of a step backwards with climbing case numbers again, this summer has illustrated economic rebound potential post-COVID.""

“It’s a disaster. It came way under estimates. Hourly wages took off and it looks to me as if wage inflation is not that far away. Labor part stuck at 61.7%
""What does this all mean? It means that the market is likely going to encounter a lukewarm trading session. 
""It doesn’t put pressure on the Fed to make a taper announcement but judging from what I see here it’s an impact of resurgence of COVID and the service sector, people are staying at home and this will change. 
""These numbers are weak now but will strengthen in the months to come as the supplemental unemployment runs out. 

""The hourly wages is a hint that people are going to be demanding more money and with the threat of the virus still around and companies will start to raise salaries.
""Look at the price of gold. It’s up. Rates are higher. It’s because of the increase in hourly wages. The market is telling you wage inflation is not that far away.”

Investing.com -- Job creation in the U.S. slowed sharply in August as the spread of Covid-19 across southern states and the big coastal cities increasingly acted as a brake on hiring. 
Nonfarm payrolls expanded by only 235,000 through the middle of last month, the Department of Labor said on Friday. That was the smallest gain in seven months and far short of expectations for a gain of 750,000. The disappointment was only slightly mitigated by an upward revision of over 100,000 in July's job gains, to over 1.05 million.
The numbers all but rule out an early move by the Federal Reserve to start running down the bond purchases that have been the mainstay of its monetary support for the economy since the first wave of the pandemic. The spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus, more highly-transmissible than previous strains, had been flagged as a key variable in starting the withdrawal of stimulus by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his speech at Jackson Hole last week.
The report was dominated by the failure of the leisure and hospitality sectors - labor-intensive sectors with high levels of direct interface with customers - to generate any net jobs at all in the month, after being the biggest driver of job growth in the previous two months.
""While payrolls have recovered dramatically given the magnitude of the Covid recession, the deceleration in August raises the specter of a slowdown similar to what we saw last winter,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist with Glassdoor, via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). He pointed out that overall employment is still more than 5 million below its pre-pandemic level.
U.S. stock futures turned negative in response to the news, however, seeing negative implications for the strength of the economic recovery. Despite the weak-looking headline number, average earnings rose 0.6% on the month, rather than slowing to 0.3% as expected. The annual rate of average earnings accelerated to 4.3%, the highest in six months. 
By 8:45 AM ET (1245 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 28 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down by a similar amount. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 3 basis points to 1.32%, its highest level in a week.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity remained strong last month, despite fears about the Delta variant of the coronavirus and widespread supply chain issues, according to a survey which suggested the bloc's economy could be back to pre-COVID-19 levels by year-end.
IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, dropped to 59.0 last month from July's 15-year high of 60.2, still well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction but below a 59.5 ""flash"" estimate.
""Growth momentum in the euro zone is fading according to recent surveys and nowcast indicators. The big question is whether the recovery can carry on at a decent pace and quickly close the gap with pre-pandemic GDP,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. 
The economy will grow 2.2% this quarter, a Reuters poll published earlier on Friday predicted and IHS Markit said the euro zone economy was on track to be back at pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, if not sooner. [ECILT/EU]
But ongoing supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic meant the cost of raw materials soared again this month. The input prices index was a near record 69.5 - although down from July's 69.9.
Inflation surged to a ten-year high of 3.0% in August with further rises likely, official data showed on Tuesday, challenging the European Central Bank's benign view on price growth and its commitment to look past what it deems a temporary increase.
Still, with much of the service industry reopening after the lifting of many restrictions its PMI remained well above breakeven at 59.0, albeit below July's 59.8 which was the highest reading since June 2006.
Services activity in Germany, Europe's largest economy, expanded at a strong pace as businesses which had been hit by coronavirus lockdowns catered for pent-up demand, although staff shortages and costs pressures put a dent in France's growth.
Italy's services industry recorded another month of steep growth, sustaining hopes of a strong economic rebound, and in Spain the sector expanded for the fifth month in a row as more COVID-19 travel restrictions were phased out.
In Britain, outside the common currency union, the recovery lost more momentum than originally estimated as staff shortages and supply chain issues weighed on companies in the country's huge services sector. [GB/PMIS]

Meanwhile, euro zone retail sales, a proxy for consumer demand, were much weaker than expected in July, pulled down mainly by a sharp fall in the number of goods bought online, official date showed.
Fears lockdown measures could be re-imposed have also put a dent in optimism. The euro zone services business expectations index in the PMI survey dipped to a four-month low of 68.9 from 69.1.

Despite the impact of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, India's economic growth reached a record 20.1% in the June quarter but analysts have said vaccination coverage remains crucial to sustaining the recovery.
The IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 56.7 in August - its strongest pace since the pandemic hit the country in March 2020 and well above the 50-level that separates growth from contraction.
It had been below 50 for three months and was 45.4 in July.
""The Indian service sector bounced back in August, led by the reopening of several establishments and improved client confidence due to growing vaccine coverage,"" said Polyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. 
""Service providers foresee a brighter outlook, with firms indicating that the economic recovery could be sustained if restrictions continue to be lifted and further waves of contamination can be avoided."" 
Overall new orders climbed at the fastest rate since January 2013, as optimism reached its highest level in five months. New export orders, however, continued to decline. 
But employment remained in contractionary territory for the ninth month in a row, underscoring weakness in the labour market. 
Persistent supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic meant input costs rose at their quickest rate since April and firms were unable to pass on some of the surge to customers. Prices charged rose at the slowest pace in four months.
""Another worrying aspect was the evidence that inflationary pressures continued to mount. Input costs increased at the fastest rate in four months, one that outpaced its long-term average,"" added De Lima.

Although the survey indicated inflation could stay beyond the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4% for some time, analysts believe the likelihood of the central bank tightening policy in the coming months remains low as it focuses more on economic growth.
The overall composite index rose to 55.4 last month from July's 49.2, well above the 50-mark for the first time in four months, as strong growth in services activity offset a softer rebound in manufacturing.

Rising vaccination rates and looser COVID-19 restrictions caused Spain's economy to expand by a better-than-expected 2.8% in the second quarter. The government expects 6.5% growth this year after 2020's record 10.8% contraction.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely grew more than initially reported in the second quarter thanks to stronger business spending, a Reuters poll showed, though a resurgence of coronavirus infections is seen weighing on growth going forward.
Separate data due next week will likely show household spending rebounded in July from a year earlier, in a sign consumer sentiment recovered somewhat before the highly infectious Delta variant spread rapidly in Japan.
Revised gross domestic product (GDP) data is expected to show Japan's economy grew an annualised 1.6% in April-June, more than a preliminary reading of 1.3% growth, the poll of 19 economists showed.
The stronger figure was in part due to an expected 2.0% rise in capital spending, a larger increase than a preliminary 1.7% gain, analysts projected. The world's third-largest economy contracted 1.0% in the first quarter.
""The view that Japan's economy remained stagnant in April-June is unchanged,"" said Saisuke Sakai, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""Dragged down by the state of emergency curbs, the recovery was weak compared to the dip in January-March.""
Household spending likely rose 2.9% year-on-year in July after a 5.1% fall in June, the poll also showed, as the Olympics opened in Tokyo and a flattered comparison to the slump seen a year earlier.
Household spending was seen up a seasonally adjusted 1.1% in July from the previous month, according to the poll.

The government will release the revised second-quarter GDP data at 8:50 a.m. local time on Sept. 8 (2350 GMT on Sept 7), and announce household spending data at 8:30 a.m. on Sept. 7 (2330 GMT, Sept. 6).
Other data releases next week are expected to show the current account balance was in a surplus of 2.3 trillion yen in July, up from 905.1 billion yen in the prior month, analysts said.

Investing.com – China’s services sector entered contraction territory in August, with recent COVID-19 restrictions continuing to thwart the country’s economic recovery.
The Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) was 46.7, the lowest level since April 2020. It was also below the 50-mark indicating growth and down from the previous month’s 54.9 figure.
Data released earlier in the week showed that the Caixin manufacturing PMI was at 49.2, while the manufacturing PMI and the non-manufacturing PMI were at 50.1 and 47.5 respectively.
The services sector recovered at a slower pace than its manufacturing counterpart but had been boosted by increasing consumption in recent months.
The strict restrictions, including those on travel, put into place to curb China’s latest COVID-19 outbreak hit the transportation, catering, accommodation and entertainment sectors particularly hard.
Although it seems the outbreak has since been largely contained, the damage has already been done.
""Service costs were still under great pressure amid elevated labor and transportation costs amid the COVID-19 resurgence. Sluggish market demand limited businesses' bargaining power, causing prices charged by service providers to slip after a month of growth,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe told Reuters.
Rooms that were originally CNY300-400 ($46.44-$61.92) are now discounted to around CNY200 and ""still no one is coming,"" the manager of a hotel in Zhangjiajie, Hunan province, told Reuters. The province was a hotspot of the latest COVID-19 outbreak.
""COVID-19's Delta variant is so terrible, people don't want to go out,” said the manager, adding that extra business over national holidays for the remainder of 2021 still will not make up for losses incurred during the summer vacation period.
Even businesses that were less impacted by COVID-19 took a hit.
""Inter-provincial flight-plus-hotel travel packages didn't resume until mid-August, which had a pretty big impact on business. Now the peak season has already passed,"" a bed and breakfast owner in Sanya, Hainan province, told Reuters."

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 46.7 in August from 54.9 in July, plunging to the lowest level since the pandemic's first wave in April 2020. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The grim readings in the private survey, which focuses more on smaller firms in coastal regions, tally with findings in an official survey earlier this week which also showed growth in the services sector slipped into contraction.
China's services sector was slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, but has been helped by a gradual improvement in consumption in recent months.
The country appears to have largely contained the latest coronavirus outbreaks of the more infectious Delta variant, with just one locally transmitted case reported on Sept. 1 after several days of zero cases. 
But it spurred authorities across the country to impose measures including mass testing for millions of people as well as travel restrictions of varying degrees in August, hitting especially the catering, transportation, accommodation and entertainment industries.
""Service costs were still under great pressure amid elevated labour and transportation costs amid the Covid-19 resurgence,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.
Sub-indexes for new business, prices charged, and employment in the Caixin survey all contracted in August. New export business rose.
""Sluggish market demand limited businesses' bargaining power, causing prices charged by service providers to slip after a month of growth,"" said Wang.
Rooms that were originally 300-400 yuan are now discounted to around 200 yuan and ""still no one is coming,"" said the manager of a hotel in Zhangjiajie, Hunan province, one of the hotspots of the August epidemic.
""Delta is so terrible, people don't want to go out.""
Some extra business over national holidays in the rest of the year won't make up for the loss of the summer vacation period, he said. 
Business owners in areas with few virus cases were also hit.
""Inter-provincial flight-plus-hotel travel packages didn't resume until mid-August, which had a pretty big impact on business - now the peak season's already passed,"" said a bed and breakfast owner in Sanya, in the southern island province of Hainan.

626,"<span>Sep 02, 2021 07:46PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Employers in Britain are still hunting for more recruits than they were just before the pandemic, according to a survey which added to signs of a tight labour market following the COVID-19 lockdowns and Brexit.
The Recruitment & Employment Confederation said on Friday that 1.66 million job advertisements were active during the week to Aug. 29, higher than the 1.55 million average in January and February 2020 and little changed from levels earlier in August.
New job ads posted during the week stood at 193,000, also above the January-February 2020 average of 171,000.
""Demand for workers remains very high across the economy and shows no signs of weakening,"" REC Chief Executive Neil Carberry said. ""With businesses in the particularly squeezed food, logistics and hospitality sectors starting to gear up for Christmas, the months ahead could be difficult – even with a large number of people coming off furlough in August and September,"" he said. 
Britain's unemployment rate of 4.7% in the three months to June is higher than before the crisis when it stood at just under 4% but it has defied forecasts that it would hit 10% or higher during the pandemic crisis thanks in large part to the government's wage subsidy scheme.

That scheme is due to be phased out by the end of September. But the low unemployment rate is also partly due to a rise in workers who are not looking for employment are therefore excluded from calculations for the jobless rate.
Britain's government has rejected calls from retail and logistics companies to temporarily ease post-Brexit immigration rules which they say are contributing to a shortage of truck drivers and acute supply chain disruption.

(Reuters) - Half of U.S. small-business owners reported unfilled job openings in August as finding qualified workers remains an ongoing challenge, a trade group said on Thursday.
The National Federation of Independent Business said in its monthly jobs report that 50% of small business owners reported unfilled job openings in August on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from 49% in July. August's reading is 28 percentage points higher than the 48-year average of 22%.
The report also showed that 91% of owners reported few or no qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill last month.
Employers nationwide continue to face labor shortages during a year in which economic growth is forecast to expand at its fastest pace in four decades. However, applicants have faced tough decisions of their own as COVID-19's Delta variant spreads rapidly.
""Small employers are struggling to fill open positions and find qualified workers resulting in record high levels of owners raising compensation,"" NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement. ""Owners are raising compensation in an attempt to attract workers and these costs are being passed on to consumers through price hikes for goods and services, creating inflation pressures.""
Furthermore, 44% of small businesses surveyed currently have job openings for skilled workers and 27% have openings for unskilled labor. 
""Instead of describing the current environment as a labor shortage, we view this as a temporary mismatch between labor supply and demand that will improve in the coming months,"" said Mahir Rasheed, an economist at Oxford Economics. 

The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week, while layoffs dropped to their lowest level in more than 24 years in August, suggesting the labor market continues to heal even as COVID-19 infections surge.
On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report nonfarm U.S. payrolls increased by 750,000 jobs in August after rising by 943,000 in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast to have fallen to 5.2% from 5.4% a month earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week, while layoffs dropped to their lowest level in more than 24 years in August, suggesting the labor market was charging ahead even as new COVID-19 infections surge.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed the number of people on state unemployment rolls tumbling to a 17-month low in the third week of August.
Declining layoffs should help to ease concerns about the economy even if August's closely watched employment report on Friday shows a slowdown in nonfarm payrolls growth. 
""Regardless of tomorrow's report, keep in mind that the weekly jobless figures say the labor market screws continue to tighten,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""There is no sign that the Delta variant is leading to job losses across the country.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 340,000 for the week ended Aug. 28, the lowest level since mid-March 2020 when mandatory closures of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of coronavirus cases. 
There were notable declines in applications in California, Illinois and Virginia, while Ohio and Missouri reported big increases. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 345,000 applications for the latest week. 
Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. They, however, remain above the 200,000-250,000 range viewed as consistent with healthy labor market conditions. 
The latest wave of COVID-19 cases, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, and an acute shortage of workers have left some economists expecting moderate job gains in August. Labor market indicators last month were mixed, with a measure of factory employment contracting and private payrolls undershooting expectations. But hiring by small businesses accelerated and consumers' views of the labor market remained fairly upbeat.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 index touching a record high. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
WORKER SHORTAGES
While last week's claims data has no bearing on August's employment report as it falls outside the survey period, applications trended lower last month. The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid plunged 160,000 to 2.748 million in the week ended Aug. 21, the lowest level since mid-March 2020.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 750,000 jobs last month after rising by 943,000 in July.
""We expect the jobs report to show that the economy continued to add jobs at a rapid pace in August, defying COVID-19 Delta variant outbreaks across the country,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. 
That optimism was underscored by a separate report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers decreased 17% to 15,723 in August, the lowest number since June 1997. So far this year, employers have announced 247,326 job cuts, down 87% compared to the same period last year.
The pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, creating worker shortages even as 8.7 million people are officially unemployed. There were a record 10.1 million job openings at the end of June. Lack of affordable childcare, fears of contracting the coronavirus, generous unemployment benefits funded by the federal government as well as pandemic-related retirements and career changes have been blamed for the disconnect. 
The labor crunch is expected to ease starting in September. The government-funded unemployment benefits lapse on Sept. 6 and schools are reopening for in-person learning. 
But soaring COVID-19 cases could cause reluctance among some people to return to the labor force. The claims report showed about 12.2 million people were receiving benefits under all programs in mid-August. This number is expected to drop sharply after next Monday's expiration of government programs, which will affect about 7.5 million people. 
About 25 states led by Republican governors terminated the expanded benefits several months ago. Those steps did not lead to an increase in hiring, leaving some economists to caution against expectations for an increase in the labor pool.
""Many states already have ended the programs ahead of the federal expiration but so far we have yet to see clear changes associated with the ends of these programs in many of the different variables we have studied,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The labor market recovery is gaining steam despite a slowdown in economic activity caused by the latest coronavirus wave, fading fiscal stimulus and supply constraints. As a result of the expiration of the expanded benefits, weekly unemployment checks for nearly 3.0 million people will be reduced by $300, which economists say will hurt consumer spending.
But the moderation in growth is likely to be mitigated by a shrinking trade deficit. The trade gap narrowed 4.3% to $70.1 billion in July, the Commerce Department said in a separate report on Thursday.

Economists have sharply marked down their gross domestic product estimates for the third quarter to a low as a 2.9% annualized rate from as high as a 9% pace. The economy grew at a 6.6% rate in the second quarter. 
""The slowdown is not broad-based and primarily reflects payback from stimulus spending and ongoing supply issues,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada posted a narrower trade surplus in July than in the previous month, missing analyst expectations, as imports rose at a faster pace than exports, Statistics Canada data showed on Thursday.
Canada's surplus with the world was C$778 million ($616.6 million) in July, down from a downwardly revised C$2.6 billion surplus in June, the largest in nearly 13 years.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had on average forecast a surplus of C$1.40 billion in July.
""All things considered, I'd say it's an upbeat month,"" said Peter Hall, chief economist at Canada's export development agency, noting that exports rose in seven of 11 categories.
Exports were up 0.6% in the month, hitting another record high at C$53.8 billion, as gains in motor vehicles and parts, along with energy and other sectors offset a sharp decrease in exports of lumber and forestry products.
""One of the real highlights of the month is that back-to-back sharp increase in the auto sector, giving us a sense that even with the chip shortage the movements of autos and parts are actually occurring,"" said Hall.
Imports, meanwhile, jumped 4.2% to hit a record high of C$53.0 billion, mostly on inbound motor vehicles and parts.
Canada's trade activity with the United States, its largest trading partner, reached record levels in July, mostly driven by growth in auto sector trade. Trade activity with the rest of the world declined.
Economists noted that while risks remain from the computer chips shortage, shipping constraints and pandemic, the July numbers suggest trade could help boost economic activity in the third quarter.
""There's still plenty of data to go for Q3, but it looks like trade will add to GDP growth in the quarter,"" said Benjamin Reitzes, Canadian rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Markets.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that factory orders increased 0.4% in July after advancing 1.5% in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders gaining 0.3%.
Orders increased 18.0% on a year-on-year basis. Though demand is shifting back to services, appetite for goods remain strong. This, together with an urgency by businesses to restock after inventories were run down in the first half of the year, should underpin manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy.
The Institute for Supply Management reported on Wednesday an unexpected pickup in August even as manufacturers complained that labor and raw materials remained scarce.
The rise in factory goods orders in July was led by primary metals and machinery. But supply constraints depressed orders for computers and electronic products as well as those for electrical equipment, appliances and components. Orders for transportation equipment fell 2.1%.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, edged up 0.1% in July instead of being unchanged as reported last month.

Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.9%. Core capital goods shipments were previously reported to have advanced 1.0% in July.
Business spending on equipment was robust in the second quarter, notching the fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth. That contributed to hoisting the level of GDP well above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a downwardly revised 2.1% annualized rate last quarter. It was previously reported to have advanced at a 2.3% pace. Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity would be raised to a 2.4% rate. 
Productivity grew at a 4.3% rate in the January-March quarter. It surged early in the pandemic before slumping in the final three months of 2020. Economists attributed the jump to the hollowing out of lower-wage industries, like leisure and hospitality, which they said tended to be less productive.
Compared to the second quarter of 2020, productivity increased at a 1.8% rate. 
Hours worked increased at a 6.0% rate last quarter, revised up from the 5.5% pace estimated last month.
Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - grew at a 1.3% rate. They were previously reported to have climbed at a 1.0% pace in the second quarter. Unit labor costs fell at a 2.8% rate in the first quarter. 
They advanced at a 0.2% pace from a year ago, instead of rising at a 0.1% rate as previously reported.
Unit labor costs have also been distorted by the pandemic's disproportionate impact on lower-wage industries.

Hourly compensation increased at a 3.4% rate last quarter, rather than the previously reported 3.3% pace. That followed a 1.4% growth pace in the first quarter. 
Compensation increased at an unrevised 2.0% rate compared to the second quarter of 2020.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that the trade gap fell 4.3% to $70.1 billion. Data for June was revised to show the deficit at $73.2 billion instead of $75.7 billion as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a $71.0 billion deficit. Imports slipped 0.2% to $282.9 billion. Goods imports dropped 1.2% to $236.3 billion, likely restrained supply constraints. Demand is also rotating to services from goods amid vaccinations against COVID-19. 
Exports increased 1.3% to $212.8 billion in July. Goods exports shot up 1.8% to $148.6 billion.
If sustained, the narrowing trade deficit could see trade contributing to gross domestic product growth in the third quarter after being a drag on GDP for four straight quarters. 

But, with businesses desperate to rebuild inventories, which were depleted in the first half of the year, July's decline in goods imports could be temporary. 
Growth estimates for the third quarter are converging around a 5% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.6% pace in the second quarter.

Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs fell 14,000 to 340,000 in the week ended Aug. 28, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a slight decrease to 345,000 new applications.
Continuing claims for state benefits fell to 2.7 million in the week ended Aug. 21.
Initial claims have been drifting lower for months, thanks to the broader reopening of the economy and elevated demand for workers. Even so, claims remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels, and the fast-spreading delta variant has injected uncertainty into the economic outlook, posing a risk of future layoffs.
The recent surge in infections has already begun to impact consumer behavior. High-frequency data point to softening demand for services such as air travel, restaurant dining and hotel occupancy. Looking ahead, the fall season may bring labor disruptions as children across the country return to in-person schooling, especially in places with lower vaccination rates.
The claims data come just before the monthly jobs report out Friday, which is forecast to show 725,000 jobs were added in August.
Unadjusted initial claims in California, Illinois and Virginia saw the biggest decreases last week. Missouri and Ohio posted the largest increases.
Roughly half of states ended federal pandemic unemployment programs -- including an extra $300 weekly payment -- before their official Sept. 6 expiration date in hopes of spurring job creation.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazil's economy contracted slightly in the three months to June, government statistics agency IBGE said on Wednesday, stalling more than expected as a second wave of the pandemic hurt demand. 
The 0.1% decline in Brazil's gross domestic product from the prior quarter was worse than the median forecast for 0.2% growth in a Reuters poll and marked a sharp slowdown from 1.2% growth in the first quarter.
Brazil's economic rebound sputtered as a severe second wave of COVID-19 cases triggered restrictions in major cities during April and May, hurting household consumption and manufacturing.
Still, more government spending and services activity helped avoid a wider downturn, offsetting a drop in fixed investments and weaker agricultural output during a weak coffee harvest.
Inflation has also surged during the recovery, triggering aggressive interest rate hikes https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-economy-rates-idUSL1N2PB39E by the central bank and weighing on the outlook for next year, when President Jair Bolsonaro faces an uphill battle to win re-election. 
Central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto told lawmakers the latest GDP data could lower the market consensus outlook for growth this year.
""With today's number, we think there may be a slight downward revision. Let's see,"" he told a congressional hearing.
However, the Economy Ministry's annual forecast is unlikely to change and Brazil's economy is still expected to grow more than 5% this year, Economic Policy Secretary Adolfo Sachsida told Reuters. 
As vaccination rates gather steam and coronavirus cases continue to fall, the 2021 growth outlook in a weekly central bank poll of economists climbed as high as 5.3% this month before settling at 5.2% in the latest poll.
""The pandemic is improving, opening up the economy, so the outlook is more positive in the third quarter and the end of year, if vaccination really advances,"" said Carlos Pedroso, chief economist at Banco MUFG Brasil.
However, he warned that a severe drought would continue to hurt agribusiness and raise the risk of energy rationing if reservoirs run dry at major hydropower plants.
Vice President Hamilton Mourao said on Wednesday that the drought, one of the worst in the past century, could lead to energy rationing, contradicting other officials https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/drought-may-force-brazil-ration-power-says-vice-president-mourao-2021-09-01.
Despite the stagnation in the second quarter, activity was 12.4% higher than a year earlier, when the onset of the pandemic hammered Brazil's economy. Economists had expected a 12.8% rise.
Resurgent demand, a weaker currency and soaring prices for commodities and energy have pushed 12-month inflation in Brazil to nearly 9%, forcing the central bank to make its biggest rate hike in 18 years and scrap an outlook for 'neutral' policy. 

Central bank sources have told Reuters they are aware that Bolsonaro has been unhappy about a recent law reinforcing the independence of the central bank, but he had not applied any direct pressure on monetary policy.
The bank's policymakers have also voiced indirect criticism of his efforts to raise public spending to win votes.

WASHINGTON(Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly picked up in August amid strong order growth, but a measure of factory employment dropped to a nine-month low, likely as workers remained scarce.
The survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Wednesday continued to highlight persistent problems securing enough raw materials, a situation worsened by disruptions caused by the latest wave of COVID-19 infections, primarily in Southeast Asia, as well as ports congestion in China.
""A surprising turn of events for manufacturing activity in the U.S., but it doesn't change the story of supply disruptions and shortages holding back stronger growth,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The ISM said its index of national factory activity inched up to 59.9 last month from a reading of 59.5 in July. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 58.6. 
Manufacturing is holding up even as spending is rotating back to services from goods because of vaccinations against COVID-19. All of the six largest manufacturing industries, including computer and electronic products, chemical products and transportation equipment reported moderate to strong growth. 
Manufacturers of computer and electronic products said while a global semiconductor shortage was impacting supply lines, they had so far ""been able to manage it without impacting clients.""
Chemical goods producers said they continued to ""see extended lead times due to port delays and sea container tightness."" Transportation equipment makers reported that ""strong sales continue, but production is limited due to supply issues with chips."" 
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index rebounded to a reading of 66.7 last month after two straight monthly declines. Fourteen out of 18 manufacturing industries, furniture and related products, machinery and electrical equipment, appliances and components reported growth in new orders.

Demand is being driven by businesses desperate to replenish stocks after inventories were drawn down sharply in the first half of the year.

INFLATION ABATING
Scarce inputs have boosted prices for both manufacturers and consumers. But there appears to be light at the end of the tunnel. The ISM measure of delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations eased further in August, indicating some improvement in the pace of deliveries. 
The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers fell to an eight-month low of 79.4 from a reading of 85.7 in July. This measure has dropped from a record 92.1 in June. 
It was the latest indication that inflation has probably peaked. Data last week showed the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure recorded its smallest monthly gain in five months in July.
But worker shortages persist, with ISM chair Timothy Fiore highlighting ""a clear cycle of labor turnover as workers opt for more attractive job conditions."" 
A measure of factory employment contracted last month and fell to its lowest level since November. 
Together with the ADP National Employment Report, which showed on Wednesday that private payrolls increased by 374,000 jobs last month after rising 326,000 in July, the ISM factory index poses a downside risk to job growth in August. Economists had forecast the ADP report would show private payrolls increased by 613,000 jobs.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for August on Friday. But it has a dismal record predicting the private payrolls count in the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employment report because of methodology differences.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 728,000 jobs last month after rising 943,000 in July.
""ADP is far from consistent in predicting changes in the BLS payrolls data,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency economics in White Plains, New York. ""Overall, job growth has strengthened in recent months, even as companies continue to report labor supply shortages."" 
The pandemic has upended the labor market dynamics, creating worker shortages even as 8.7 million people are officially unemployed. The were a record 10.1 million job openings at the end of June. Lack of affordable child care, fears of contracting the coronavirus, generous unemployment benefits funded by the federal government as well as pandemic-related retirements and career changes have been blamed for the disconnect. 
The labor shortage is expected to ease starting in September. The government-funded unemployment benefits lapse on Sept. 6 and schools are reopening for in-person learning. 

But the resurgence in new COVID-19 cases, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, could cause reluctance among some people to return to the labor force.
The labor shortages led to a building up of the backlog of uncompleted work at factories in August.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday its index of national factory activity inched up to 59.9 last month from a reading of 59.5 in July. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 58.6.
Manufacturing is holding up even as spending is rotating back to services from goods because of vaccinations against COVID-19. But shortages of labor and raw materials, especially semiconductors, remain a constraint.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 57.2 in August from 56.2 in July. It was the PMI's highest level since April and the 14th straight month above the 50 threshold marking growth in the sector.
""Canada's manufacturing sector recorded another robust improvement in operating conditions in August,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
""The latest uptick gained momentum from that seen in July after demand in both domestic and international markets rose further.""
The gauge of new orders advanced to 55.8 from 55.3 in July, while the stocks of purchases index was at 53.7, up from 52.8.
That marked the second-highest level of pre-production inventories in the near 11-year history of the survey as higher sales, freight delays and material shortages encouraged firms to raise the level of stocks they hold as a buffer.
Restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic have contributed to bottlenecks globally.
The factory sector's main concern ""has been price and supply chain pressures which have often stemmed from material shortages,"" Patel said. ""With costs intensifying over the course of the month, prices look set to remain elevated for some time.""

The input prices index rose to a series high of 77.2 from 72.0 in July, while the measure of output prices was also elevated as firms passed on higher material and shipping prices to their clients.
Still, firms grew more upbeat about prospects for growth. The future output index climbed to 66.7 from 63.1 in July.

(Reuters) - Mortgage applications decreased last week in step with a drop in refinancing as mortgage rates remained unchanged.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted market composite index tracking mortgage applications fell 2.4% from a week earlier, reflecting a 3.8% decline in applications to refinance existing loans in the week ending Aug. 27. 
The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages was unchanged at 3.03%. Purchase applications rose 0.6%, hitting the highest level since early July, the MBA said.

After hitting record lows at the end of 2020 below 2.9%, mortgage rates climbed in the first part of this year and peaked in the spring. Rates had been drifting lower since, held down in large part by the U.S. Federal Reserve's extraordinary stimulus measures aimed at helping the economy rebound from the novel coronavirus pandemic.
""Despite low rates, refinance applications declined, with some borrowers still waiting for rates to drop even lower,"" said Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting. ""Recent uncertainty around the economy and pandemic have kept rates low over the past month, which is why the refinance index has oscillated around these levels.""

LONDON (Reuters) -British house prices rebounded surprisingly strongly in August, chalking up their second-biggest monthly rise in 15 years after a fall the month before when a pandemic-era tax break began to be phased out.
Mortgage lender Nationwide Building Society said British house prices rose by 2.1% month on month in August after a 0.6% fall in July, well above economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll for a modest 0.2% increase.
Property purchases slumped in July when a year-long exemption from stamp duty for the first 500,000 pounds ($687,550) of a house purchase ended in England and Northern Ireland.
""The bounce back in August is surprising because it seemed more likely that the tapering of stamp duty relief in England at the end of June would take some of the heat out of the market,"" Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said.
But the pick-up in prices in August suggests the importance of other factors such as a shortage of houses and demand for more spacious accommodation suited to working from home, which have pushed up prices in Britain and in other countries.
""With the amount of second-hand stock on the market currently extremely limited, house prices could continue to surprise on the upside even after the stamp duty holiday takes a little heat out of demand,"" said Andrew Wishart, property economist at consultants Capital Economics.
House prices in August were 11.0% higher than a year ago, a bigger increase than the 10.5% rise Nationwide recorded in July and bucking economists' expectations in a Reuters poll for a slowdown to 8.6%.
Britain's official government house price index showed prices rose by 13.2% in the year to the end of June, the biggest annual rise since November 2004.
Demand for property priced 125,000-250,000 pounds, which still benefits from the tax break until the end of September, as well as lack of homes to buy, could be behind the rise, Nationwide said. 

Underlying demand was likely to remain strong in the short term but could weaken later when the stamp duty exemption ends and the government withdraws furlough support for workers who have been unable to work due to the pandemic, it added.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global factory activity lost momentum in August as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic-disrupted supply chains, raising concerns faltering manufacturing would add to economic woes caused by slumping consumption, surveys showed on Wednesday.
Many firms reported logistical troubles, product shortages and a labour crunch which have made it a sellers' market of the goods factories need, driving up prices.
While factory activity remained strong in the euro zone, IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 61.4 in August from July's 62.8, below an initial 61.5 ""flash"" estimate.
""Despite the strong PMI figures, we think that lingering supply-side issues and related producer price pressures might take longer to resolve than previously expected, increasing the downside risk to our forecast,"" said Mateusz Urban at Oxford Economics.
In Britain, where factories also faced disruptions, manufacturing output grew in August at the weakest rate for six months. The United States likely suffered a similar slowdown, data is expected to show later on Wednesday. [GB/PMIM]
Canada's economy unexpectedly shrank last quarter and in July, official data showed on Tuesday - hurt by decreases in manufacturing, construction and retail trade - and Australia reported slower growth in the second quarter on Wednesday.
CHINA BRAKES
Meanwhile, Southeast Asia - a low-cost manufacturing hub for many global companies - was hit particularly hard with factory activity shrinking in Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia because of virus outbreaks and output suspensions.
And in a worrying sign for the global economy, China's factory activity slipped into contraction in August for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years as COVID-19 curbs, supply bottlenecks and high raw material prices weighed on output.
China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI fell to 49.2 in August, from 50.3 in July, breaching the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.
The result was well below market expectations, underscoring the fragile nature of China's recovery that had helped the global economy emerge from pandemic-induced doldrums.
The private survey followed an official PMI on Tuesday, which showed the index falling in August but staying above the 50 mark.
""The elephant in the room for the long North Asia, short ASEAN view is China. This morning, the Caixin Manufacturing PMI followed yesterday's official number South, falling under 50,"" said Jeffrey Halley at OANDA.
""That rounds out a grim week for China's PMIs as COVID-19 lockdowns and the same supply chain challenges the rest of the world is experiencing erode economic performance.""
Export power-houses Japan, South Korea and Taiwan also saw manufacturing activity expand at a slower pace in August, a sign chip shortages and factory shutdowns in the region could delay a sustained recovery from the pandemic-induced slump.
The surveys highlight the pandemic's broadening damage in Southeast Asia, where soaring infections and subsequent lockdown measures have hurt both the service and manufacturing sectors.
Delta variant outbreaks in the region have caused supply chain headaches for the world's largest manufacturers, many of which rely on auto parts and semiconductors made in low-cost bases such as Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia.
""If the strict lockdown measures continue, Southeast Asia may find it hard to remain a global production hub,"" said Makoto Saito, an economist at NLI Research Institute.
Japan's PMI eased and new export orders posted their first contraction since January. South Korea's index fell to 51.2.
In Vietnam and Malaysia, activity was hurt by lockdown measures and rising infections that forced some factories to suspend operations. Vietnam saw factory activity shrink while Malaysia's PMI stood at 43.4 in August.

Once seen as a driver of global growth, Asia's emerging economies are lagging advanced economies in recovering from the pandemic's pain as delays in vaccine rollouts and a spike in Delta variant cases hurt consumption and factory production.
Growth in India's factory sector activity slowed as persistent pandemic-related weakness weighed on demand and output, forcing firms to cut jobs again following a brief recovery in July.

Eurostat said the unemployment rate in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell to 7.6% of the workforce, in line with economists' consensus in a Reuters poll, from 7.8% in June.
This meant there were 12.334 million people registered as unemployed in the euro zone in July, down from 12.684 million in June.

Spain and Greece remained the two EU countries with the highest unemployment rate, with 14.3% and 14.6% respectively, but there, too, the number of jobless fell sharply.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 60.3 last month from July's 60.4, slightly higher than a preliminary reading of 60.1. 
While still far above the 50 mark that denotes growth, the reading was again flattered by supply chain delays which in normal times reflect strong demand.
Global shipping problems, tight supplies of semiconductors and shortages of some goods such as motor vehicles have contributed to rising inflation in many countries - including in Britain.
Despite a healthy influx of new orders, IHS Markit's gauge of British factory output slid to its lowest level since February. The slowdown was evident especially in producers of intermediate goods, who often sit in the middle of supply chains.
Survey respondents said supplier delays had been caused by a shortage of materials, shipping delays, port bottlenecks, Brexit and a shortage of logistics industry staff - all contributing to rising costs.

Last month a separate survey of small- and medium-sized manufacturers showed nearly all are struggling with cost pressures.
Wednesday's survey showed manufacturers remained upbeat nevertheless, as the survey's gauge of future output rose to a three-month high.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 57.5 points from 58.0 in July – its lowest reading since February's 56.1.
The index was nevertheless slightly above a preliminary reading for August of 57.3 points and remained well above the 50 point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
""Economic conditions in France's manufacturing sector remain strong as we head towards the end of the third quarter, although further slowdowns in the rate of output and new order growth suggest we're well past the peak"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""Fears are however starting to mount as to when the material shortages, delivery delays and intense price pressures will take their toll,"" Hayes added.
A global semiconductor chip shortage has caused major delays to manufacturing, with automakers cutting down on production and electronic device makers struggling to keep up with a pandemic-led surge in demand for phones, TVs and gaming consoles.
The strained supply chains increasingly leave firms with little choice but to raise their prices.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said this week that the French economy was ""doing well"" thanks to a rise in consumer spending, even with restrictions still in place to tackle a fourth coronavirus wave in the country.

He said the aim now was for the euro zone's second-biggest economy to return to pre-COVID-19 growth levels by year-end.

IHS Markit's final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of Europe's biggest economy, fell to 62.6 from 65.9 in July.
That was the lowest in six months but still comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
The German economy rebounded in the second quarter with a growth rate of 1.6% compared to the previous three months as an easing of COVID-19 curbs spurred consumers to dip into record savings piled up during the winter lockdown.
The government expects the economy to grow 3.5% this year and 3.6% next, though supply bottlenecks and rising COVID-19 cases are leading companies to take a dimmer view.
Corporate efforts to increase industrial production in light of vibrant demand were often hampered by supply shortages for basic materials and intermediate products, the survey showed.
""Growth in output has now fallen behind that of new orders to an extent previously unseen in over 25 years of data collection,"" IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said.
The supply bottlenecks led to rising backlogs of work, falling stock levels and acute price pressures across Germany's large manufacturing sector. Among the items most often reported by survey participants as having risen in price were aluminium, electronics, plastic, steel and timber.

The supply problems and related price pressures also clouded the outlook in manufacturing, with the sub-index on firms' optimism about future activity falling to its lowest level since last October, the survey showed.
""Still, many goods producers are hopeful that conditions will have improved come next summer, and a further steep rise in employment levels shows that efforts are still being made to expand capacity and prepare for higher output in the future,"" Smith said.

The easing of restrictions imposed to stop the coronavirus from spreading has driven demand but many firms have reported logistical troubles, product shortages and a labour crunch.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 61.4 in August from July's 62.8, below an initial 61.5 ""flash"" estimate.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Friday and seen as a good guide to economic health, fell from July's 61.1 to 59.0. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""Euro zone manufacturers reported another month of buoyant production in August, continuing the growth spurt into its 14th successive month,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The overriding issue was again a lack of components, however, with suppliers either unable to produce enough parts or facing a lack of shipping capacity to meet logistics demand.""
An ongoing shortage of materials and a lack of transport availability meant sellers of the goods factories need were again able to ramp up their charges. The input prices index thus remained high at 87.0, although shy of July's record 89.2.
As a result, factories again sharply increased the prices they charge. 
Euro zone inflation surged to a 10-year high last month, official data showed on Tuesday, challenging the European Central Bank's benign view on price growth.

The ECB wants inflation at 2% but prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 3.0% in August, fuelled by unusually large increases in the prices of industrial goods.
Despite those price rises, demand remained resilient and factories built up a backlog of work even though they increased headcount and depleted their stocks of finished goods.

The CBI said its monthly growth indicators, based on business surveys it conducted between July 27 and Aug. 17, rose to +34 from July's +33, driven by stronger growth in consumer services and retail. 
But manufacturing activity slowed, and most businesses expect a slower pace of growth over the next three months, in part due to supply-chain difficulties and a lack of workers.
""Evidence of labour shortages has been growing – in some cases, these shortages are having a material impact on operations. Meanwhile, disruption to global supply chains during the pandemic has led to sharp rises in material and shipping costs, adding further pressure,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.

Leach said it was unclear how persistent the labour shortages and other disruption were likely to be. 
Changes to COVID self-isolation rules - which had required hundreds of thousands of workers to stay at home in July and August - were likely to help, and there still remained many people who had lost work in the pandemic, she said.

The BRC's measure of shop price inflation - unlike most other inflation measures - is typically negative. July's reading showed a fall of 1.2% and the average annual decline over the past 12 months was 1.5%.
""There are some modest indications that rising costs are starting to filter through into product prices,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
Price rises were most noticeable for electrical goods due to global shipping delays and a shortage of microchips, she said.

Food prices were also likely to rise over the coming months due to rising commodity prices, increased transport costs reflecting a shortage of truck drivers, and greater post-Brexit costs for importing food from the European Union, she added.

The Federal Statistics Office said retail sales dropped 5.1% on the month in real terms after a revised jump of 4.5% in June and an increase of 4.6% in May. The July reading missed a Reuters forecast for a fall of 0.9%.
The monthly comparison was distorted heavily by the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions on shopping in most parts of the country in June, the statistics office said.
Retail sales - a volatile indicator often subject to revisions - edged down by 0.3% in real terms year on year, it added. Compared with February 2020, the month before the coronavirus crisis hit Germany, retail sales were up 3.8%.
The German economy returned to growth in the second quarter but bounced back less strongly than other euro zone countries as supply chain bottlenecks slowed industrial output.
Supply problems with raw materials and intermediate goods, coupled with rising COVID-19 cases because of the more contagious Delta variant, are driving companies to take a dimmer view of the coming months.

Bankhaus Lampe analyst Alexander Krueger believes that retail sales are likely to recover in the comings months, with the labour market strong and more companies scaling back short-time work schemes introduced during the pandemic.
However, overall support for the economy from household spending could be less strong in the third quarter than many had hoped for, he added.

Authorities have stepped up efforts to rein in housing prices this year with measures such as restrictions on home purchases and higher mortgage rates. 
The southern city of Guangzhou on Tuesday introduced a pricing reference for resale homes to curb its red-hot market. Around 10 cities including Shanghai and Shenzhen have already implemented similar pricing systems. 
""In the third and fourth quarter, property control measures will continue to be refined, and become more comprehensive and frequent, to plug any (policy) loopholes,"" said Cao Jingjing, research director at China Index Academy.
Prices in the biggest tier-one cities such as Shanghai and Beijing rose the slowest, compared with price growth in tier-two cities and even smaller cities, up 0.11% versus July's 0.54% growh.
The slowdown in tier-1 cities was mainly due to control policies in those markets and COVID-19 related measures in Shanghai due to a recent outbreak in the financial hub, said Cao.

New orders decreased at the fastest pace since November, while total sales were dampened by weaker foreign customer demand, which showed its sharpest fall since May 2020. 
Employment fell for a third consecutive month as some firms did not replace voluntary leavers. 
""Cost cutting efforts were also reflected in a sharp drop in input buying,"" Jones said.

Average cost burdens rose once again in August albeit at the slowest pace for almost a year, as the surveyed companies cited higher supplier charges and raw materials shortages.

Data on Tuesday showed Asia's third-largest economy grew by a record annual pace of 20.1% last quarter, driven by a surge in manufacturing and a strong rebound in consumer spending, but spiking infections from the Delta variant of the coronavirus and slow vaccination rates in some states are likely to hurt growth.
The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by IHS Markit, fell from July's three-month high of 55.3 to 52.3 in August, but stayed above the 50-level that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Although new orders and output expanded for a second month, growth slowed sharply in August.
""August saw a continuation of the Indian manufacturing sector recovery, but growth lost momentum as demand showed some signs of weakness due to the pandemic,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit.
""Uncertainty regarding growth prospects, spare capacity and efforts to keep a lid on expenses led to a hiring freeze in August."" 
Employment slipped back into contractionary territory in August after growing in July for the first time in 16 months, indicating the job market is far from pre-pandemic levels.
Shortages of raw materials and higher freight fees continued to put pressure on input costs, forcing firms to increase prices at the fastest pace since May, indicating inflation would remain elevated.
However, that was not expected to prompt the Reserve Bank of India to tighten monetary policy, as support for economic growth continues to be the central bank's main priority.

Still, optimism weakened in August as companies were concerned about inflation and the pandemic's lingering impact.

Investing.com – China’s factory activity entered contraction territory for the first time in nearly one-and-a-half years in August. Lockdown measures to contain the latest COVID-19 outbreak, supply bottlenecks and high raw material prices all contributed to a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy’s recovery.
The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was at 49.2, below the 50-mark indicating growth. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com had predicted a 50.2 reading, while July’s number was 50.3.
Just the day before, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released data that showed the manufacturing PMI at 50.1 and the non-manufacturing PMI at 47.5, in August.
Whilst the strict lockdowns, imposed as part of China’s ‘zero-COVID-19-cases’ goal, were successful in curbing the latest outbreak across several provinces, it also had an economic impact.
""The latest COVID-19 outbreak posed a severe challenge to the economic normalization that began in the second quarter of 2020,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in comments released alongside the data.
The COVID-19 restrictions also led to dampened demand and sourcing difficulties, including a chips shortage that also impacted the manufacturing sector.
""Due to the lack of chips this year, the demand for auto parts has decreased. Our factory has been continuously reducing production, and in July and August, I heard that some factories stopped production. At the moment, it looks like chips will continue to be in short supply,"" an auto parts exporter surnamed Huang told Reuters.
The slowdown in the manufacturing sector also highlighted the fragility of the ongoing economic recovery. Expectations are now growing that China will introduce further support measures to get the recovery back on track.
The Caixin services PMI is due on Friday."

The slowdown in the manufacturing sector underscores the fragility of the ongoing economic recovery and the impact of strict coronavirus curbs in the country, backing expectations Beijing will roll out more support measures to revitalise growth.
Two separate official surveys released on Tuesday showed China's factory activity grew at a slower pace, while the services sector slumped into contraction.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.2 last month, from 50.3 in July, breaching the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction. 
The result was well below expectations by analysts polled by Reuters, who had forecast the index at 50.2. New export orders tumbled into contraction for the first time since February, while factories laid off more workers than they hired.
The strict lockdown measures of China's ""zero-cases"" approach to COVID-19 controls successfully squashed an outbreak of the more infectious Delta variant across several provinces in August, but also hit economic activity.
""The latest COVID-19 resurgence has posed a severe challenge to the economic normalization that began in the second quarter of last year,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in comments released alongside the data.
Many analysts expect the central bank to deliver a further cut to the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later this year to lift growth, on top of July's cut which released around 1 trillion yuan ($6.47 trillion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.
A sub-index for production fell to 47.7, the slowest pace of expansion since February last year at the height of the pandemic, while another sub-index for new orders slipped to 48.0.
Companies reported COVID-19 restrictions had dampened demand and led to sourcing difficulties.
A shortage of chips has also been crimping manufacturing. 
""Due to the lack of chips this year, the demand for auto parts has decreased,"" said an auto parts exporter in eastern China's Suzhou surnamed Huang.
""Our factory has been continuously reducing production, and in July and August, I heard that some factories stopped production. At the moment it looks like chips will continue to be in short supply,"" he said.

An index of confidence in the year ahead stood steady. Input and output prices continued to rise and at a faster pace.
""Authorities need to take a holistic view and balance containing COVID-19, stabilizing the job market, and maintaining stability in supply and prices,"" Caixin's Wang said.

658,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 09:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s economy expanded faster than expected last quarter as strong household and government spending outweighed a drop in export volumes, underscoring the central bank’s view that it entered a renewed lockdown with solid momentum.
Gross domestic product rose 0.7% in the three months through June from the prior quarter, when it advanced an upwardly revised 1.9%, Australian Bureau of statistics data showed Wednesday. Economists had forecast a 0.4% gain. From the year earlier period, when GDP tumbled in response to Covid lockdowns, the economy expanded 9.6% versus a forecast 9.1%.
GDP was underpinned by “continued growth across household spending, private investment and public sector expenditure,” Michael Smedes, head of National Accounts at the ABS, said in a statement. “Lockdowns had minimal impact on domestic demand, with fewer lockdown days and the prolonged stay at home orders in New South Wales only commencing later in the quarter.”
The Australian dollar was little changed after the release, trading at 73.13 U.S. cents at 11:47 a.m. in Sydney.
The result underscores Australia’s powerful rebound from the virus through the first part of the year, when it recouped output and employment lost during 2020’s lockdowns. That recovery is under threat from an outbreak of delta that started in Sydney -- now in its 10th week of lockdown. Infections have spread along the populous east coast, forcing shutdowns across the economy, as in many countries around Asia.
Today’s report showed:
The data, even more than normal, is a look at the economy through the rearview mirror given that Australia’s two largest cities are in lockdown. Sydney and Melbourne, when combined with their surrounding states, account for more than half of the nation’s GDP.
Australia’s labor market had been tightening rapidly until the delta outbreak The jobless rate dropped to 4.6% in July, the lowest level since 2008, though that was largely due to a fall in participation as Sydneysiders were unable to hunt for work. 
Unemployment is expected to rise in coming months due to the restrictions imposed to combat Covid.
On a more positive note, in response to the worsening outbreak, authorities have ramped up vaccinations as they seek to emulate northern hemisphere counterparts in trying to navigate an approach to living with the virus.
The central bank has so far maintained that Australia’s economy will bounce back rapidly from the latest outbreak, as it did in 2020. However, the prolonged duration of lockdowns and the likelihood that the virus won’t be suppressed quickly could cast doubt on such an outcome

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports accelerated in August, towed by solid demand for memory chips, petrochemicals and other major items, with the trade ministry seeing only a limited impact from the coronavirus Delta variant across the region.
Exports rose 34.9% in August from a year earlier, accelerating from 29.6% in July but falling short of 35.7% growth predicted in a Reuters survey.
Imports soared 44.0% from a year earlier, the fastest growth since May 2010 and quicker than a 38.1% rise in July. That brought the trade balance to a $1.67 billion surplus.
Breakdown of Wednesday's data showed exports of semiconductors, petrochemicals and cars jumped 43.0%, 81.5% and 16.9%, respectively, while those of wireless devices, biohealth products and secondary batteries soared 62.2%, 17.1% and 10.9%, respectively.
By destination, overall exports to China, the United States and European Union rose 26.8%, 38.1% and 41.6%, respectively.
""Despite concerns about production disruptions due to the spread of the recent Delta variant ... its impact on exports is seen limited so far,"" the ministry said in a statement.
""As the global Delta variant spread and shipping delay remain as risks, however, the ministry will make all-out efforts to sustain the export momentum in the second half of the year.""
South Korea has been setting record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the past weeks, even as tighter curbs were enforced to prevent the spread of the Delta variant during its peak summer holiday season.
A separate survey on Wednesday showed factory activity grew at a slower pace last month, as output contracted for the first time in 12 months and demand eased on surging virus infections and supply chain disruptions.

To support the pandemic-hit economy, the government on Tuesday unveiled a record 604.4 trillion won ($521.21 billion) budget plan for next year.

The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) for August stood at 51.2, falling from 53.0 in July but staying above the 50 threshold, which indicates expansion in activity, for an 11th straight month.
""A renewed rise in virus infections and severe, sustained supply chain disruptions, notably in the key semiconductor market, dampened operating conditions,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit.
That resulted in a contraction in output levels, while the resurgence in coronavirus across the wider region partially offset solid demand from key export markets such as the United States and Japan, Bhatti added.
The sub-index for output stood at 49.1, ending the 11th consecutive month of expansion, and falling from 53.5 a month earlier.
Total new orders rose further last month, but at the softest pace in 10 months, while export orders growth also eased as the highly contagious Delta variant and related curbs dented global demand.
Still, firms were seen raising staffing levels for another month in preparation of incoming orders in the second half of the year.
Meanwhile, the survey signalled further rises in average cost burdens at South Korean manufacturers on continued raw material shortages, which led to higher output prices.
""Firms commonly noted that global shortages of raw materials and freight capacity, notably in the semiconductor market had led to weaker readings across the majority of indices,"" Bhatti said.

""Yet businesses remained confident that this would pass, and activity would rise over the next 12 months.""
The sub-index for future output, which indicates business confidence, rose to 61.2 in August from 59.5 in July, on hopes of a wider economic recovery from the pandemic and that supply chain bottlenecks would ease.

Manufacturers withstood the pandemic's hit in part thanks to their positive outlook for the coming twelve months, even as the highly infectious COVID-19 Delta variant is pushing countries in Asia-Pacific back into lockdown mode.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in August eased to 52.7 on a seasonally adjusted basis from 53.0 in the previous month, and up slightly from a 52.4 flash reading.
""A sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in South East Asia was among the key factors listed by Japanese manufacturers for the easing in demand,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.
""Severe supply chain disruption partly caused by pandemic restrictions and raw material shortages remained a dampener on production and orders.""
The PMI survey showed that overall new orders expanded at their slowest pace since January, while new export orders posted their first contraction since that month.
Overall output saw a rise, but its pace eased from the prior month as the intensifying health crisis and a lack of raw materials weighed on production.
The survey also showed output for intermediate goods grew at their fastest pace in four-and-a-half years, offsetting weaker demand for investment and consumer products.

Input prices maintained a sustained increase, while companies' expectations for the year ahead remained firm, though they eased to the softest since January.
""Though still optimistic, Japanese goods producers were wary of the continued impact of the pandemic and supply chain disruption,"" said Bhatti.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian home prices rose at the fastest annual pace since 1989 in August as coronavirus lockdowns weighed more on supply than demand, though months of blistering gains are increasingly putting housing beyond the reach of many.
Data from property consultant CoreLogic out on Wednesday showed national home prices climbed 1.5% in August, even as the spread of the Delta variant shut Sydney and Melbourne.
Values were up an eye-watering 18.4% on last year, the biggest gain since July 1989, with houses surging 20.8% amid a pandemic-driven shift to working from home.
The boom has been a key support for household wealth and consumer confidence. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the value of homes rose a record A$450 billion in the March quarter alone to reach A$8.3 trillion ($6.09 trillion).
However, it also means homes are becoming increasingly unaffordable.
""Housing prices have risen almost 11 times faster than wages growth over the past year, creating a more significant barrier to entry for those who don't yet own a home,"" said CoreLogic's research director, Tim Lawless.
He noted national home values had risen by roughly A$103,400 in the past year, or A$1,990 per week, far beyond average annual wage growth of 1.7%.
While lockdowns had some impact on auctions and sales, they also constrained the supply of listed homes. As a result, prices in Sydney still rose 1.8% in August to a median A$1.04 million, with Melbourne up 1.2%
""We are still seeing a disconnect between advertised supply and housing demand, which is keeping upwards pressure on prices despite challenges faced by both buyers and sellers,"" said Lawless.
Cities with few restrictions fared even better, with Brisbane rising 2.0% and Adelaide 1.9%.

Buyers have been encouraged by the outlook for super-low borrowing costs, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) saying rates were likely to remain at just 0.1% until 2024.
Regulators, however, have been warning banks not to loosen lending standards and analysts suspect they could tighten loan rules in coming months if the market remains this hot.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell to a six-month low in August as worries about soaring COVID-19 infections and higher inflation dimmed the outlook for the economy.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumers less inclined to buy a home and big-ticket items like motor vehicles and major household appliances over the next six months, supporting the view that consumer spending will cool in the third quarter after two straight quarters of robust growth.
Still, more consumers planned to go on vacation, indicating a rotation in spending from goods to services was underway as economic activity continues to normalize following the upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Increased spending on services, which account for the bulk of economic activity, should keep a floor under consumer spending.
""The report does raise the warning flag that if the pandemic worsens, and given the continued unwillingness of many to get vaccinated that is a real possibility, we could see people stashing away funds just in case,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""We could see growth moderate faster than expected.""
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 113.8 this month, the lowest since February, from 125.1 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 124.0. The cutoff for the survey was Aug. 25, before the killing of 13 service members in Afghanistan and Hurricane Ida slammed Louisiana.
The measure, which places more emphasis on the labor market, held up well compared to other surveys. The University of Michigan's survey of consumers showed sentiment tumbling to near decade lows in August because of rising prices for goods like food and gasoline, as well as the resurgence in COVID-19 cases that has been driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
""While the resurgence of COVID-19 and inflation concerns have dampened confidence, it is too soon to conclude this decline will result in consumers significantly curtailing their spending in the months ahead,"" said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board in Washington.
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months rose to 6.8% from 6.6% last month. There are signs, however, that price pressures have peaked, with data last week showing the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure posting its smallest gain in five months in July.
Wall Street's main indexes hovered near record highs. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
LABOR MARKET HOLDING UP
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, slipped to a still-high reading of 42.8 this month from 44.1 in July, which was the highest since July 2000.
This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's closely watched employment report.
""It continues to send a pretty favorable signal about labor market conditions,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 750,000 in August after rising 943,000 in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast falling to 5.2% from 5.4% last month.
Though fewer households intended to buy long-lasting manufactured goods such as motor vehicles and household appliances like washing machines and clothes dryers this month, more expected to travel domestically, with many intending to fly to their destinations. 
Households accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic, laying a strong foundation for consumer spending. Gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter are around a 5% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.6% pace in the second quarter.
The Conference Board survey also showed less enthusiasm among consumers for home purchases over the next six months amid higher house prices, which are sidelining some first-time buyers from the market. 
Demand for housing soared early in the pandemic as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and home schooling, but supply severely lagged, fueling house price growth. COVID-19 vaccinations have allowed some employers to recall workers to offices. Schools and universities have reopened for in-person learning. 
A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index jumped a record 18.6% in June from a year ago after rising 16.8% in May. Economists, however, believe that house price inflation has peaked, with homes becoming less affordable especially for first-time buyers.

""Some early data suggests that the buyer frenzy experienced this spring is tapering, though many buyers still remain in the market,"" said Selma Hepp, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic. ""Nevertheless, less competition and more for-sale homes suggest we may be seeing the peak of home price acceleration. Going forward, home price growth may ease off but stay in the double digits through year-end.""
A third report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) showed its house price index rose a record 18.8% in the 12 months through June. House prices surged 17.4% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2020. FHFA believes house prices peaked in June.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) has adjusted upwards its economic growth forecast for the region this year to 5.9%, as expectations improve for a global recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The United Nations body had projected an expansion in the region's gross domestic product (GDP) of 5.2% at the start of July, but said the panorama was looking brighter amid the gradual reopening of economies and relaxation of sanitary measures around the region. 
ECLAC warned however that a better performance this year would still not see countries in the region returning to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity and that longer term growth remained uncertain, given the uneven progress of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out in Latin America.
It also said some economies had structural problems that had hindered sound growth even before the pandemic. 
Private consumption will be the biggest driver of growth in 2021 and 2022, representing more than half of the increase in economic activity, ECLAC said. 
Public consumption would play a lesser role, it said, since the extraordinary measures implemented by governments to combat the pandemic mostly consisted of direct cash transfers to households ""that for accounting purposes are reflected in an increase in private consumption.""

ECLAC adjusted its 2021 projection for Brazil's economy upwards to 5.2% from 4.5% previously and that of Mexico to 6.2% from the previous projection of 5.8%. 
The agency maintained its projection for 2022 regional growth at 2.9%. 
 
"
665,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 11:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Euro zone inflation surged to a 10-year-high in August with further rises likely, challenging the European Central Bank's benign view on price growth and its commitment to look past what it deems a temporary increase.
Consumer inflation in the 19 countries sharing the single currency accelerated to 3% this month from 2.2% in July, far above expectations for 2.7% and moving well clear of the ECB's 2% target. 
The increase was fuelled by energy costs, but food prices also surged, while there were unusually large increases in the prices of industrial goods too, according to Eurostat, the EU's statistics agency. 
Markets mostly shrugged off the data, with stocks rising and yields increasing just a basis point or two, suggesting the narrative of temporary inflation and ultra-easy central bank policy for years to come remains the central one. 
Still, the numbers are likely to make for uncomfortable reading at the ECB.
The central bank has repeatedly raised its inflation projection this year only for the actual numbers to beat its forecasts, and price growth now seems likely to peak only in November. 
With inflation in Germany, the euro zone's largest economy and the ECB's biggest critic, expected to approach 5% in coming months, the bank is likely to come under increasing public pressure to address price developments that are reviving long-dormant memories of runaway prices.
ONE-OFF FACTORS?
The ECB argues that a slew of one-off factors including production bottlenecks related to the economy's reopening after the COVID-19 pandemic account for the bulk of the inflation surge, and that price growth will quickly moderate early next year.
""The effects of re-opening and supply problems could intensify in the next few months. But we suspect that they will begin to fade next year as global consumption and trade patterns return to something like their pre-pandemic norms,"" Capital Economics said in a note. 
""We think the headline rate will drop to about 2% in January and trend down throughout 2022 to end next year at around 1%,"" it added.
Longer-term market based inflation expectations [EUIL5YF5Y=R] are also holding well below 2%, even if they have moved steadily higher this year. 
ECB policymakers agree and predict that inflation will languish well below the bank's target for years to come, so they even reinforced their commitment last month to keeping monetary policy exceptionally loose to generate price pressures.
Speaking to Reuters last week, ECB chief economist Philip Lane argued that these inflation surprises still did not challenge his views about the temporary nature of price pressures as wage growth, a necessary component of durable inflation, remained muted.
While ECB policymakers are acknowledging that they underestimated price pressures in the near term, they continue to point to weak underlying inflation readings as supporting evidence for loose policy.
Core inflation, however, also surged in August with inflation excluding volatile food and fuel prices accelerating to 1.6% from 0.9%, while an even narrower measure that also excludes alcohol and tobacco, rose to 1.6% from 0.7%.
The ECB will next meet on Sept. 9 and must decide on the pace of its bond purchases over the coming quarter. While some adjustment is possible, Lane argued that it would be at the margins as the ECB is committed to maintaining ""favourable financing conditions"".

After Tuesday's reading, not all observers are quite so sanguine.
""This is not to say that there is no upside risk to the inflation outlook,"" ING economist Bert Colijn said. ""So hold tight: inflation has the potential to go higher from here.""

(Reuters) -U.S. single-family home prices in 20 key urban markets rose in June from a year earlier at the fastest pace on record, a closely watched survey showed on Tuesday.
The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas gained 19.1% through the 12 months ended in June from an upwardly revised 17.1% in the 12 months through May, marking the largest annual price increase in the survey's two decades. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast an increase of 18.5%. 
On a month-to-month basis, the 20-city composite index rose 1.8% from May, in line with estimates from economists polled by Reuters. 
Among the 20 cities, Phoenix, San Diego, and Seattle reported the largest year-over-year gains in June.
A separate report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) on Tuesday showed its house price index rose a record 18.8% in the 12 months through June. House prices surged 17.4% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2020.
The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
Home prices have surged this year as a result of limited supply and increased demand from potential buyers seeking to enter the market. In comparison to the run-up prior to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the current boom does not include a frenzy of speculators and buyers with low credit scores purchasing homes and trying to flip them. 
""Today’s S&P Case Shiller Index spotlights a hot summer’s housing market, where buyers prepared with cash for down payments and low interest rate loans placed competing bids for an evaporating supply of homes available for sale and drove prices higher,"" said George Ratiu, manager of economic research for Realtor.com.

Contracts to purchase previously owned homes declined for the second consecutive month in July in step with limited supply that's been unable to match demand from potential homebuyers, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Monday.
""Rising prices during summer months reflected a combination of peak demand and larger homes for sale, as families with school-age children competed to secure a place for the new school year,"" Ratiu said. ""In a noticeable shift, July saw real estate markets welcome a larger influx of new listings, as homeowners across the country decided to move on with pandemic-delayed plans to sell.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's businesses and the broader economy came under increasing pressure in August as factory activity expanded at a slower pace while the services sector slumped into contraction, raising the likelihood of more near-term policy support to boost growth. 
The world's second-biggest economy staged an impressive recovery from a coronavirus-battered slump, but momentum has weakened recently due to domestic COVID-19 outbreaks, high raw material prices, slowing exports, tighter measures to tame hot property prices and a campaign to reduce carbon emissions.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell to 50.1 in August from 50.4 in July, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Tuesday, holding just above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected it to slip to 50.2.
""The worse-than-expected August PMIs add conviction to our view that the growth slowdown in H2 could be quite notable,"" Nomura economists wrote in a note.
""We expect Beijing to maintain its policy combination of 'targeted tightening' for a few sectors, especially the property sector and high-polluting industries, complemented by 'universal easing' for the rest of the economy.""
Nomura is not alone in its views as many other analysts also expect the central bank to deliver a further cut to the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later this year to lift growth, on top of last month's cut which released around 1 trillion yuan ($6.47 trillion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.
The manufacturing PMI showed demand slipped sharply, with new orders contracting and a gauge for new export orders falling to 46.7, the lowest in over a year. Factories also laid off workers, at the same pace as July.
SERVICES SECTOR DOWNTURN
Adding to signs of a broadening economic slowdown, COVID-19-related restrictions drove services sector activity into sharp contraction for the first time since the height of the pandemic in February last year.
The official non-manufacturing PMI in August was 47.5, well down from July's 53.3, data from the NBS showed.
""The latest surveys suggest that China's economy contracted (in August) as virus disruptions weighed heavily on services activity. Industry also continued to come off the boil as supply chain bottlenecks worsened and demand softened,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note.
While most of the weakness should reverse with relaxing COVID-19 restrictions, tight credit conditions and weakening foreign demand will continue to weigh on China's economy, he said. 
""This epidemic in multiple provinces and locations was a fairly big shock to the services industry, which is still in recovery,"" said Zhao Qinghe, of the NBS.
Catering, transportation, accommodation and entertainment industries were most affected, said Zhao. Construction activity accelerated to the fastest pace since March.
There are signs China may have largely contained the latest coronavirus outbreaks, with zero locally transmitted cases reported on Aug 30., for the third day in a row.
But it spurred authorities across the country to impose measures including mass testing for millions of people as well as travel restrictions of varying degrees and port shutdowns.
Meishan terminal at China's Ningbo port resumed operations in late August after shutting down for two weeks due to a COVID-19 case. The closure caused logjams at ports across the country's coastal regions and further strained global supply chains amid a resurgence of consumer spending and a shortage of container vessels.

Higher raw material prices, especially of metals and semiconductors, have also pressured profits. Earnings at China's industrial firms in July slowed for the fifth straight month.
The official August composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, fell to 48.9 from July's 52.4.

The Labour Office said the number of people out of work fell by 53,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.538 million. A Reuters poll had forecast a fall of 40,000.
""""A decline in August is rather unusual. It is remarkable,"" Labour Office head Detlef Scheele told journalists at a news conference, adding that unemployment usually rises in summer as companies postpone hiring until after the holidays.
The seasonally-adjusted jobless rate fell to 5.5%, the lowest since March 2020, when Germany entered its first coronavirus lockdown.
The number of employees put on reduced working hours in job protection schemes, also known as Kurzarbeit, also declined, Scheele said, expecting the figure to drop to one million soon, after peaking at around 6 million in April 2020.

Companies have become more active in recruitment in August especially in the electric and mechanical engineering sector, data by the Munich-based Ifo institute showed last week.
Coronavirus cases have been rising in Germany since July, but the number of deaths has fallen with more than half of the population fully vaccinated, pushing the government to stop using the coronavirus infection rate as its yardstick for deciding on restrictions.

The increase leaves the economy 3.2% below pre-crisis levels reached at the end of 2019, a gap the government expects to be closed before the end of this year.
Activity recovered quickly in the second half of the second quarter as the economy emerged from lockdown and a vaccination programme gained speed.
Consumer spending, the traditional motor behind the French economy, rose 1.0% in the second quarter while business investment was up 1.9%, INSEE said.

However, consumer spending got off to a soft start in the third quarter with monthly data for July from INSEE showing that it fell 2.2% from June, more than the 0.5% fall expected on average in a Reuters poll of economists' expectations. 
The government expects the economy to grow 6% this year after contracting 8.0% last year.

INSEE said its index of EU-harmonised consumer prices rose 0.7% from July, giving a 12-month inflation rate of 2.4%, jumping from 1.5% in July to hit the highest since October 2018.
The surge exceeded expectations for a rate of 2.1% in a Reuters poll of 16 economists in which the highest forecast was 2.2%.

Inflation has jumped worldwide as economies recover after the coronavirus crisis, straining supply chains and creating shortages that are driving prices higher.
French central bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said last week that although tight supply chains would push inflation higher in the short term, he continued to expect the increase to be temporary.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's industrial output shrank in July as car production took a hit from a coronavirus resurgence in Asia that has cast doubt over the recovery in the world's third-largest economy.
A spike in highly contagious Delta variant cases has forced governments in Asia to impose fresh lockdowns and curbs, which are causing disruptions in parts supply across the region, adding to a global chip shortage.
""There's a risk output will stall heading into the year-end,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Car production is likely to be a drag on output in August and September.""
Factory output dropped 1.5% in July from the previous month, official data showed on Tuesday, hit by a decline in the production of autos, including passenger cars and small buses.
The fall offset growing output of production machinery items, such as those used for manufacturing semiconductors, and electronic parts and devices.
That meant output fell back below pre-coronavirus pandemic levels again after surging 6.5% in the prior month, though it was stronger than a 2.5% drop forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to advance 3.4% in August and 1.0% in September.
Overall output was projected to get a boost from a sharp jump in production machinery manufacturing next month, even as that of transport equipment, which includes car production, was seen shrinking more than 7% from the previous month.
But the forecast for the decline in transport equipment was probably not fully factoring in parts supply disruptions in Southeast Asia, a government official said.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, the world's largest automaker by sales volume, said this month it would cut September production by 40% from its previous plan due to the chip crunch.
Manufacturers' finely tuned supply chains mean carmakers often optimise car parts supplies, increasing the risk of output delays once inventories run out and replacement parts fail to turn up, said Minami.
Separate data on Tuesday showed the jobless rate edged down for the second straight month, dropping to 2.8% from 2.9% in June, with the actual number of those unemployed posting the first year-on-year fall in 18 months.
An index gauging job availability gained slightly to 1.15 from 1.13 in June, labour ministry data showed.
A separate government survey showed consumer confidence worsened in August, falling to a three-month low, as wider curbs in response to rising numbers of COVID-19 cases weighed on people's willingness to spend.

Japan's economy expanded an annualised 1.3% in the second quarter, driven by solid consumption and exports.
But growth is expected to remain modest in the current quarter, with some analysts forecasting a possible contraction, as the country struggles with a COVID-19 resurgence, which has burdened medical facilities and shows no signs of abating.

Investing.com – China’s economic recovery from COVID-19 came under more pressure in August, with factory activity expanding at a slower pace and the services sector tumbling into contraction territory.
A recent COVID-19 outbreak, high raw material prices, a slowdown in exports, tighter measures to regulate property prices and a carbon emissions reduction campaign all contributed to weakening momentum for a strong recovery to date.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) was at 50.1 in August. This was lower than the 50.2 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com as well as the previous month’s 50.4 figure.
The non-manufacturing PMI at 47.5, below the 50-mark indicating growth and below the previous month’s 53.3 reading.
""The worse-than-expected August PMIs add conviction to our view that the growth slowdown in the second half could be quite notable. We expect Beijing to maintain its policy combination of 'targeted tightening' for a few sectors, especially the property sector and high-polluting industries, complemented by 'universal easing' for the rest of the economy,"" Nomura analysts said in a note.
Other analysts also expect the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to further cut the amount that cash banks must hold as reserves later in 2021 to lift growth. PBOC already cut the amount in July 2021, which released around CNY1 trillion yuan ($154.54 billion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.
The recent lockdowns that were implemented to curb the country’s latest COVID-19 outbreak also contributed to a steep fall in service sector activity.
""The latest surveys suggest that China's economy contracted (in August) as virus disruptions weighed heavily on services activity. Industry also continued to come off the boil as supply chain bottlenecks worsened and demand softened,"" Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note.
While most of the weakness should reverse with relaxing COVID-19 restrictions, tight credit conditions and weakening foreign demand will continue to weigh on China's economy, the note added."
674,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 09:36PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic activity weakened in August as an outbreak of the delta virus variant curbed consumer spending and travel, while surging materials costs and supply-chain woes hindered production.  
The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 50.1 from 50.4 in July, the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday, slightly lower than the 50.2 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 
The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, slumped to 47.5, signaling a contraction for the first time since March 2020. 
China imposed stringent measures, including travel curbs, mass testing and quarantines, for about a month to bring a new wave of Covid cases under control. The outbreak was the most widespread since the initial flareup in 2020, sweeping across nearly 50 cities in 17 provinces in the country. Confidence among businesses weakened and consumers cut back on spending after authorities rushed to close tourist sites, call off cultural events and cancel flights. 
Beyond the virus outbreaks, the economy’s recovery is also showing signs of faltering in the wake of recent regulatory crackdowns and weak demand at home. The central bank has signaled it may provide more targeted support for some industries, while the government has pledged to accelerate fiscal spending in the second half of the year, helping to cushion growth.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany's annual consumer price inflation accelerated to a fresh 13-year high in August, data showed on Monday, underlining growing price pressures as Europe's largest economy recovers from the pandemic and companies struggle with supply shortages.
Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries (HICP), rose 3.4% compared with 3.1% in July, preliminary figures from the Federal Statistics Office showed.
The August reading was in line with a Reuters poll and marked the highest since July 2008, when the harmonised inflation rate also hit 3.4%.
The national inflation rate (CPI) even soared to 3.9% in August, hitting its highest since December 1993 when the economy boomed following German reunification.
""This is due to higher energy and food prices, while the core inflation probably even fell slightly form 2.9% to 2.8%,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Ralph Solveen said.
Germany's preliminary consumer price figures do not include values for core inflation.
LBBW economist Elmar Voelker said the inflation rate would rise further in the coming months, pointing to special factors and base effects from a temporary reduction in VAT rates in the second half of 2020 that affected comparisons.
""From the beginning of 2022, price pressures ... will probably ebb, but the exciting question will be how quickly and how strong this weakening will be,"" Voelker added.
Recent hikes in producer and import prices could be an early indication that increased inflation rates will ultimately be more persistent at the consumer level than previously thought.
""In this case, the debate within the European Central Bank, which is currently still primarily centered around the risk of low inflation, could take on a new direction,"" Voelker said.
German central bank chief Jens Weidmann has said he is worried about the prospect of the ECB's low-interest-rate environment being extended for too long.
Weidmann said last month his advisers anticipated inflation nearing 5% in Germany later this year.
Data released earlier on Monday showed German inflation outpaced wage growth in the second quarter as rising price pressures caused by the economic recovery and supply bottlenecks in manufacturing reduced the spending power of consumers.
The latest data suggests wages will not keep up with inflation also for the rest of the year. This means there are no signs yet of a wage-price spiral which is seen as a prerequisite for inflation to remain at an elevated level in the medium term.
In Spain, EU-harmonised consumer prices rose 3.3% year-on-year in August from 2.9% in July, separate data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed.
The German and Spanish figures suggest that euro zone inflation, due on Tuesday, has strengthened further in August.
A Reuters poll of analysts predicts euro zone inflation (HICP) to jump to 2.7% from 2.2% in the previous month.

""We think euro zone inflation will remain high this year, peaking at close to 3% in Q4, before returning to 1.5% next year,"" Oxford Economics analyst Daniela Ordonez said.
The ECB, which next meets on Sept. 9, will have to decide whether to maintain an elevated volume of bond purchases or allow them to decline, given a drop in yields and a weakening of the euro since the last policy meeting.

The European Commission's economic sentiment index, released on Monday, eased to 117.5 in August from an all-time high of 119.0 in July. Optimism deteriorated in all major sectors -- in industry to 13.7 from 14.5, in services to 16.8 from 18.9 and among consumers to -5.3 from -4.4.
Still, selling price expectations in industry, heralding likely future inflationary pressures, hit a record in August.
Also among consumers, inflation expectations rose to 31.1 in August from 30.0 in July, though they were still well below the all-time high of 38.7 from 2001.
German inflation already outpaced wage growth in the second quarter, data showed on Monday, as rising price pressures caused by an economic recovery and supply bottlenecks in manufacturing reduced the spending power of consumers.

Still, hiring plans in construction, retail trade and services drove employment expectations up by 1.2 points to 112.8 in the euro zone, its highest level since November 2018, signalling more spending power and consumer demand ahead.
Overall, France recorded the sharpest drop in economic sentiment of 4.5 points, followed by the Netherlands. Italy and Spain were also weaker. Sentiment in the biggest euro zone economy, Germany, eased only slightly by 0.3 points.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales rose for a fifth straight month in July, beating expectations as the consumer sector continued its recovery, although a coronavirus resurgence has cast doubts over the spending outlook.
A surge in Delta variant cases this month forced the government to widen state of emergency restrictions, which are now threatening to hurt consumer spending and derail a fragile economic recovery.
Retail sales advanced 2.4% in July from the same month a year earlier, government data showed on Monday, slightly faster than economists' median forecast for a 2.1% rise in a Reuters poll. It followed a 0.1% increase in June.
""The recent strength in retail sales is unlikely to last,"" Marcel Thieliant, Senior Japan Economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
""The severe Delta wave now hitting the country coupled with an ever-expanding list of prefectures under states of emergency resulted in a renewed weakening in consumption this quarter,"" Thieliant said.
The better-than-expected rise in retail sales in July came as authorities struggled https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/tale-two-cities-bubble-tokyo-outside-2021-07-29 to get a defiant public to heed stay-at-home restrictions in major cities like Tokyo, which hosted the Olympics during the month.
The trade ministry data found strong demand for a variety of items such as cars, clothing, general merchandise and food while fuel was helped by higher petrol prices.
Small retail establishments like convenience stores and drug stores saw biggest sales growth from a year earlier.
However, growth was also flattered by the comparison with last year's steep slide, when consumer demand was hurt by the coronavirus pandemic.
Compared with the previous month, retail sales gained a seasonally adjusted 1.1% as consumption continued the surprising growth seen in the second-quarter, helped by the Tokyo Olympics.
The world's third-largest economy grew at a better-than-expected rate in the April-June quarter, thanks largely to private consumption, which makes up more than half of the country's gross domestic product.

But rebounding consumer activity poses a challenge to policymakers as the more contagious Delta variant of COVID-19 upends the nation's healthcare system, with state of emergency curbs now covering nearly 80% of Japan's population.
""People's mobility has been decreasing, and consumption may peak out in August,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute, noting that the downward trend could drag until September.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI)is expected to slip to 50.2 in August from 50.4 in July, a fifth month of slowing growth, according to the median forecast of 33 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates expansion from the previous month.
PMIs for manufacturing and services will likely moderate in August due to COVID-19 outbreaks of the more infectious Delta variant and ensuing lockdown measures, said analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in a note.
""With slowing growth momentum and dovish signals (from China's central bank) we expect more easing, but still at a measured pace as policymakers eye headwinds in 2022."" 
The world's second-largest economy staged an impressive recovery from a coronavirus-battered slump, but growth has recently shown signs of losing steam due to domestic COVID-19 outbreaks, slowing exports, tighter measures to tame hot property prices and a campaign to reduce carbon emissions. 
To bolster the economy, the People's Bank of China(PBOC) in mid-July cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves, releasing around 1 trillion yuan ($6.47 trillion) in long-term liquidity.
Many analysts expect another cut later in the year.
China's latest coronavirus outbreaks appear to have been largely brought under control, with zero locally transmitted cases reported on Aug 29., for the second day in a row.
But it spurred authorities across the country to impose counter-epidemic measures including mass testing for millions of people as well as travel restrictions of varying degrees and port shutdowns.
Meishan terminal at China's Ningbo port resumed operations in late August after shutting down for two weeks due to a COVID-19 case. The closure caused logjams at ports across the country's coastal regions and further strained global supply chains amid a resurgence of consumer spending and a shortage of container vessels.
Higher raw material prices, especially of metals andsemiconductors, have also pressured profits. Earnings at China's industrial firms in July slowed for the fifth straight month.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big andstate-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector,will both be released on Tuesday.

The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published onWednesday. Analysts expect the headline reading will slip to 50.2 from July's 50.3.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending slowed in July as a decline in motor vehicle purchases due to shortages offset a rise in outlays on services, supporting views that economic growth will moderate in the third quarter amid a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.
But the foundation for the recovery remains solid, with the report from the Commerce Department on Friday showing wages rising and Americans further boosting savings. Inflation appears to have peaked, which could preserve households' purchasing power. Businesses are also restocking and exporting more goods, suggesting a slowdown in growth this quarter could be temporary.
""There are clear downside risks to spending if more events and trips are canceled and more products are delayed getting to shelves,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""But it's a bit early to throw in the towel on the economic outlook given supportive wage and saving trends and a likely boost from business investment, inventories, and trade in the third quarter.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3% last month after advancing 1.1% in June. Last month's rise was in line with economists' expectations.
Demand is rotating back to services like travel and leisure, but spending has been insufficient to compensate for the drop in goods purchases, which are also being impacted by shortages.
Goods spending fell 1.1% last month, led by motor vehicles. A global shortage of semiconductors is hampering auto production. There were also decreases in spending on recreational goods as well as clothing and footwear. Still, goods spending is 20% above its pre-pandemic level.
Spending on services rose 1.0%, a broad increase led by food services and accommodations. Outlays on services last month were 1% above their February 2020 level. Healthcare, transportation and recreation are yet to recoup their pandemic losses. 
Credit card data suggests spending on services like airfares and cruises as well as hotels and motels slowed in August amid soaring COVID-19 cases driven by the Delta variant. 
Fears about the virus knocked consumer sentiment to a more than 9-1/2-year low in August.
Inflation continued to rise last month, fanned by the unrelenting supply constraints and the economy's move toward normalcy after the upheaval caused by the pandemic. But the pace of increase is slowing.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, climbed 0.3% in July. That was the smallest gain in five months and followed a 0.5% advance in June. In the 12 months through July, the so-called core PCE price index rose 3.6% after a similar increase in June. The core PCE price index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell in a speech to the Jackson Hole economic conference on Friday defended his long-held view that high inflation would be transitory. Powell said the economy continued to make progress towards the U.S. central bank's benchmarks for reducing its massive support, but stopped short of signaling the timing for any policy shift.
Powell's comments buoyed U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq scaling record highs. 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
INCOME, SAVINGS RISE
High inflation chipped away at consumer spending last month. Consumer spending adjusted for inflation dipped 0.1%. The so-called real consumer spending rose 0.5% in June. Real consumer spending is slightly above the second-quarter average.
""Spending growth in the current quarter is still guaranteed to be far below the 11.6% annualized rate of the first half of the year, but at least it is starting in positive territory,"" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Jersey City.
The Atlanta Fed cut its third-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 5.1% rate from a 5.7% pace. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases, which is global, could cause more supply disruptions.
The economy grew at a 6.6% pace in the second quarter, which raised the level of gross domestic product above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
But the drag from slowing consumer spending this quarter is likely to be limited by a narrowing trade deficit and the replenishing of depleted inventories by businesses. 
In another report on Friday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit decreased 6.2% to $86.4 billion last month as imports fell and exports rose. 
Retail inventories gained 0.4%, while stocks of goods at wholesalers increased 0.6%. 
Overall, the economy remains supported by record corporate profits. Households accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic. Growth is expected to pick up in the fourth quarter, in part driven by inventory accumulation. 
The saving rate increased to 9.6% last month from 8.8% in June as some of the money disbursed by the government under the Child Tax Credit program to qualifying households was socked away. Personal income shot up 1.1% after gaining 0.2% in June.
Wages also rose as companies compete for scarce workers, increasing 1.0% in July. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation rebounded 0.7% after three straight monthly declines. 

Household wealth is also being boosted by high stock market prices and accelerating home prices.
""The overall position of the household sector is strong and consumers have plenty of buying power,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.

(Reuters) -U.S. consumer sentiment plunged to its lowest level in nearly a decade in August as consumers' views of their personal financial prospects continued to worsen due to smaller income gains amid higher inflationary trends, a survey showed on Friday.
The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 70.3 in August - the lowest since December 2011 - from July's final reading of 81.2. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 70.7.
August's final reading was little changed from the preliminary reading of 70.2 earlier this month. The losses were widespread across all demographic groups and regions.
""The extraordinary falloff in sentiment also reflects an emotional response, from dashed hopes that the pandemic would soon end and lives could return to normal,"" Richard Curtin, the survey director, said in a statement. 
The economy is still expected to grow this year at its fastest pace in four decades after falling into a brief recession in 2020 caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
However, the recovery is showing some indication of cooling off and COVID-19 cases have continued to climb in August as the more transmissible Delta variant spreads rapidly across the country. Labor shortages across the service sector also persist while supply chain disruptions have continued.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations declined to 65.1 in August, its lowest reading since October 2013, from July's 79.0, and was little changed from the mid-month reading of 65.2.
The survey's one-year inflation expectation eased to 4.6% from 4.7% in July, while the survey's five-year inflation outlook ticked up to 2.9% from 2.8%.

""With the economy moving past peak growth and peak inflation, we expect cooler inflation readings in the coming months to support an uptick in optimism among consumers,"" said Mahir Rasheed, an economist at Oxford Economics. ""Greater vaccine uptake and a stronger labor market will also encourage greater optimism with vaccination rates improving while restraints on labor supply will relax in the fall.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, also slowed in July, supporting views that economic growth will ease in the third quarter.

The INSEE official statistics agency said its monthly consumer confidence index fell to 99 from 100 in July, just short of the average expectation for 100 in a Reuters poll of 10 economists.
The index had peaked at 102 in June - the highest since the pandemic started - as vaccination rates picked up and coronavirus restrictions were eased.
But with France now facing its fourth coronavirus wave as the Delta variant spreads, the government began requiring people earlier this month to show proof of vaccination to enter cafes, restaurants, trains and big shopping malls.
Nonetheless, the survey found that the proportion of households considering that it is a good time to make large purchases remained stable in August above the long-term average while saving intentions rose for the first time in three months.
Concerns about unemployment were also unchanged from July with 'help wanted' signs increasingly popping up as companies face growing trouble finding staff.
The share of households expecting prices to rise in the coming months rose slightly as strained supply chains increasingly leave firms little choice but to raise their prices.

The relatively small decline in consumer confidence suggests that at least for now the new health pass is having a limited impact on economic activity even though it has fuelled regular weekend protests across the country.
After a stronger than expected first half of the year, French central bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Thursday the bank could raise its 2021 growth forecast of 5.75% when it updates its estimates next month, adding that economic impact from the Delta variant was expected to be limited.

Elevated raw material prices and supply chain constraints from extreme weather as well as sporadic coronavirus cases dragged on earnings in the manufacturing sector, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Friday. 
Industrial firms' profits in July increased 16.4% on an annual basis - the slowest clip this year - to 703.67 billion yuan ($108.51 billion), the NBS said. That compared to a 20% gain in June.
China's economy has staged an impressive recovery from a coronavirus-battered slump, but the expansion is losing steam as businesses grapple with higher costs and supply bottlenecks, and as consumers remain cautious with spending. 
The headwinds to growth back expectations Beijing will keep, or even bolster, its accommodative stance. The People’s Bank of China in mid-July lowered the reserve requirement ratio for banks, releasing around 1 trillion yuan ($154.19 billion) in long-term liquidity.
""On economic fundamentals, signs of a notable economic slowdown have emerged, and I expect policymakers to fine-tune the macro-economic policy, currently neutral but with a loosening bias, in an pre-emptive way to counter the headwinds,"" said Nie Wen, Shanghai-based economist at Hwabao Trust. 
""If growth keeps sliding, the government might even roll out quantitative measures,"" said Nie. 
Zhu Hong, senior statistician at the NBS, attributed the slower growth in July to sporadic COVID-cases and flooding, as well as high commodity prices that have pressured profitability for small mid-stream and downstream firms. 
""Overall, profits at industrial firms above the designated size maintained a steady growth in July, but we have to recognise that the unevenness and uncertainty in the recovery of corporate earnings still exist,"" Zhu said. 
In the first seven months of the year, industrial firms' profits grew a hefty 57.3% on year, due to base effects, although the pace slowed from the 66.9% surge in first half of 2021. 
China's factory output growth slowed sharply in July, and analysts expect it to come under increasing pressure due to COVID-19 social distancing rules and tightening measures in the property sector and high-polluting industries.
Commodity prices have been on a tear in recent months, hurting the bottom lines of many mid- and downstream factories. Chinese coke and coking coal futures hit record highs this week while iron ore futures rose for the fourth day on Thursday.
COVID-19 cases of the more transmittable Delta strain in July and record rainfalls in transportation hub Henan province have also hurt industrial production. The terminal at China's major Ningbo port paused services as part of the government's effort to curb the spread of the virus.

Liabilities at industrial firms rose 8.2% on an annual basis at end-July, down from 8.5% growth as of end-June.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales plunged in July as coronavirus lockdowns shut shops and services in the nation's largest city, further evidence the economy is set to contract sharply this quarter as the Delta variant of the virus spreads.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Friday showed retail sales fell 2.7% in July to A$29.8 billion ($21.55 billion) from June, when travel restrictions had already caused a 1.8% drop. It was the largest decline this year and even worse than market forecasts of a 2.3% fall.
The A$360 billion retail sector accounts for around 18% of gross domestic product and further weakness is expected this month as lockdowns engulf Melbourne and Canberra.
Sales in New South Wales state collapsed by nearly 9% in July, and a similar drop is likely for Victoria in August. 
The harsh hit to consumption, employment and hours worked is sure to see economic output shrink this quarter ending what had been a remarkably strong rebound from last year's pandemic-driven downturn.
""We estimate that 550,000 workers have been stood down because of the lockdowns,"" said CBA's head of Australian economics Gareth Aird. 
""We have downwardly revised our Q3 GDP estimate to look for a contraction of 4.25%, from -2.75% previously.""
That might even trigger another recession, though analysts are hopeful that recent rapid progress in vaccinations will allow stricken cities to open up enough in the fourth quarter to avoid such a bleak outcome.
The vaccination pace has picked up markedly after a hesitant start to hit an average of 260,000 a day in the past week. Just over 32% of the adult population is now fully vaccinated, while 55% have at least one dose.
The conservative government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison has laid out plans to start opening the economy once 70% of adults are vaccinated, and to avoid lockdowns altogether once 80% are covered.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has also been counting on a rapid recovery in consumption once restrictions ease, which is why it decided to press ahead with plans to trim its bond buying campaign despite the latest lockdowns.

However, with Sydney and Melbourne now set to be shut for far longer than first thought the central bank is under pressure to delay the taper at its next policy meeting on Sept. 7.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. corporate profits surged to a fresh record high in the second quarter, boosted by robust demand and higher prices, suggesting that an anticipated slowdown in economic growth this quarter because of soaring COVID-19 cases could be temporary. 
The jump in profits reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday was despite businesses facing increased costs owing to shortages of raw materials and labor. The resurgence in infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus is chipping away demand for services like air travel and cruises, leading economists to cut their third-quarter growth estimates.
""Based on the profits data, any slowdown in growth as a result of slower consumer spending is likely to prove temporary,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Profits from current production increased by $234.5 billion, or at a 9.2% quarterly rate, to a record $2.8 trillion, after rising at a 5.1% pace in the first quarter. They were driven by a $169.8 billion surge in profits at domestic nonfinancial corporations. There were also gains in domestic financial corporations profits as well as rest-of-the-world profits.
Pre-tax profits as a share of GDP, a proxy for economy-wide profit margins, rose 0.7 percentage points to 12.3%, their highest since 2014. 
National after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, conceptually most similar to S&P 500 profits, increased $303.6 billion, or at a 12.8% pace, up from the 9.4% pace notched in the January-March period.
Profits were up 69.3% from a year ago, partially exaggerated by low base comparisons in the second quarter of 2020 following mandatory shutdowns of nonessential businesses.
""Elevated margins suggest higher costs have not yet meaningfully eaten into firms' profits, as firms appear to have more pricing power today than they typically would this early in an expansion,"" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Gross domestic product increased at a 6.6% annualized rate, the government said on Thursday in its second estimate of GDP growth for the April-June period. That was revised up from the 6.5% pace of expansion reported in July. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected that second-quarter GDP growth would be raised to a 6.7% pace. The economy grew at a 6.3% rate in the first quarter, and has recouped the steep losses suffered during the two-month COVID-19 recession.
The level of GDP is now 0.8% higher than it was at its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019. The upward revisions to last quarter's GDP growth reflected a slightly more robust pace of consumer spending and business investment than initially estimated. Demand was driven by one-time stimulus checks from the government to some middle- and low-income households. 
The Federal Reserve has maintained its ultra-easy monetary policy stance, keeping interest rates at historically low levels and boosting stock market prices. 
Stocks were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower. 
SPEED BUMP
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, appears to be cooling. Credit card data suggests spending on services like airfares, cruises as well as hotels and motels has been slowing.
""This is a speed bump due to the interaction of Delta and supply-side constraints,"" said Michelle Meyer, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities in New York. ""We still believe the foundation for the economy is solid and all signs point to strong underlying demand.""
Bank of America Securities has slashed its GDP growth estimate for the third quarter to a 4.5% pace from a 7.0% rate. 
Growth is expected to pick up in the fourth quarter, in part driven by businesses replenishing inventories, which were drawn down in the first half of the year to meet the strong demand. Overall, economists expect growth of around 7% this year, which would be the strongest performance since 1984.
Though the boost from fiscal stimulus is waning, demand remains underpinned by a strengthening labor market. 
A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 353,000 for the week ended Aug. 21. 
Adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations is tricky around this time of the year, a task that has been complicated by the pandemic. That could account for the increase in applications last week. Unadjusted claims dropped 11,699 to 297,765 last week.
Companies are clinging to their workers amid worker shortages blamed on a lack of childcare facilities and fears of contracting the virus. There were a record 10.1 million job openings as of the end of June. 
At least 25 states led by Republican governors have pulled out of federal government-funded unemployment programs, including a $300 weekly payment, which businesses claimed were encouraging unemployed Americans to stay at home. 

There is, however, no evidence that the early termination of federal benefits has led to an increase in hiring in these states. The government-funded benefits will expire on Sept. 6, affecting more than 11 million people.
""While states implementing an early termination argued that benefits were impeding labor supply, we only find a marginal effect,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""It appears the expiry of benefits will weigh more on the personal income ledger of the economy than it does to support employment growth.""

The GfK institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, dropped to -1.2 points for September, from a revised -0.4 points a month earlier. The reading compared with a Reuters forecast for -0.7.
""Prices have been rising rapidly since the middle of this year. This has a dampening effect on the consumer mood,"" GfK consumer expert Rolf Buerkl said in a statement.
Germany's harmonised annual consumer prices rose 3.1% in July, hitting a 13-year high and fuelling a debate about whether the increase in the cost of living will persist.
An increase in coronavirus infections and a slower pace of vaccinations have also hit consumers' expectations for the economy and affected their propensity to buy, Buerkl added. 
Germany reported 11,561 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday and a seven-day incidence rate of 61.3 per 100,000 people, according to the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.
Some 59.4% of the population are fully vaccinated with around 64.4% having received at least one dose.
The consumer climate indicator forecasts the development of real private consumption in the following month.
An indicator reading above zero signals year-on-year growth in private consumption. A value below zero indicates a drop compared with the same period a year ago.
According to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1% in private consumption.
The ""willingness to buy"" indicator represents the balance between positive and negative responses to the question: ""Do you think now is a good time to buy major items?""

The income expectations sub-index reflects expectations about the development of household finances in the coming 12 months.
The additional business cycle expectations index reflects the assessment of those questioned of the general economic situation in the next 12 months.

688,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 09:06AM ET</span>",,,,,"(Reuters) - U.S. auto retail sales are expected to fall in August, as the global semiconductor shortage coupled with the fast spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus squeezed inventory at dealerships, consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said.
Retail sales of new vehicles are expected to fall 14.3% to 987,100 in August from a year earlier, they said in a report released on Thursday.
The chip shortage continues to weigh on manufacturing activity, with automakers cutting production despite strong demand for personal transportation during the COVID-19 crisis. 
""Global light vehicle demand remains under pressure from the severe inventory constraints caused by the semiconductor shortage as well as disruption from the COVID-19 Delta variant,"" said Jeff Schuster, president of Americas operations and global vehicle forecasts at LMC.
Dealers currently have about 942,000 vehicles in inventory, compared with about 3 million, two years ago, according to the report.
""The industry has insufficient inventory at dealerships to meet strong consumer demand. The consequence is that the retail sales pace is depressed, but transaction prices are elevated."" said Thomas King, president of data and analytics division at J.D. Power.
Average transaction prices are expected to rise 16% to $41,378, partly due to fewer manufacturer incentives.

Tight inventories are unlikely to meaningfully improve in September as ongoing supply chain issues and recent announcements of further production cuts by several manufacturers continue to weigh, the report said.
The consultants lowered their forecast for 2021 global light vehicle sales by 2 million units to 83.8 million units, due to a lack of sufficient production volume.

689,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Applications for U.S. state unemployment rose for the first time in five weeks as the labor market makes its way to a full recovery in fits and starts.
Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs totaled 353,000 in the week ended Aug. 21, up 4,000 from the prior week, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a slight increase to 350,000 new applications.
Continuing claims for state benefits fell slightly to 2.9 million in the week ended Aug. 14.
The increase in unemployment claims likely reflects volatility in the weekly data against a backdrop of elevated labor demand. The delta variant that’s fueled a recent surge in new infections across the country poses a risk, though there’s so far been little evidence to suggest that health concerns are leading to dismissals.
Still, lawmakers are wary of the threat the highly infectious variant poses to a broader economic recovery.
Companies are postponing a return to the office, issuing mask requirements and vaccine mandates to curb the spread. The Biden administration has emphasized the need to reopen the economy, but cautioned that businesses need to protect workers and consumers.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian economic growth likely touched a record high in the quarter through June, reflecting a very weak base last year and a rebound in consumer spending, a Reuters poll found.
The Aug. 20-25 Reuters poll of 41 economists showed gross domestic product rose 20.0% in the three-month period, compared with a record contraction of 24.4% in the same quarter a year earlier.
Forecasts in the poll ranged from 10.5% to 31.6%, showing the considerable uncertainty around those base effects. 
The rebound came despite the drag from the deadly second wave of the coronavirus, which forced states across India to reimpose localised lockdowns and stop mobility completely from late April to early June.
But unlike during the nationwide lockdown last year, repeat state-level lockdowns had a less pronounced impact on the economy as they left more room for consumers to spend. 
""India's second COVID-19 wave acted as a stumbling block to the robust recovery that was underway. Still, the economic damage appears to be less than previously expected,"" said Rahul Bajoria, chief India economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
If the poll median is realised, it would be India's fastest growth since official quarterly data started being released in the mid-1990s. That's up sharply from 1.6% in the previous quarter, but a bit slower than the Reserve Bank of India's 21.4% projection.
The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic began in April just as the economy was beginning to rally from a lull at the start of the year, throwing the recovery off course, although not as much as many feared.
""Humanitarian costs of the health crisis were high, but the economic impact was less severe than the first wave and activity rebounded faster,"" said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS Bank.
A separate Reuters poll a month ago predicted India's GDP would expand 19.8% in the April-June quarter, little different to the latest median, and 9.4% for the current fiscal year. [ECILT/IN]

However, the spread of potential new virus variants poses a threat.
""The recovery remains uneven,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA. ""The risks to watch out for are a third wave of COVID-19, a slower than expected pace of vaccinations, and lastly, new variants that may emerge which may not be very amenable to the vaccines which exist right now.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -The prices Japanese companies charge each other for services rose for a fifth straight month in July, data showed on Thursday, a sign the economy was holding up despite the hit from a resurgence in COVID-19 cases and curbs to combat the pandemic.
But the annual pace of increase slowed for two straight months and paled in comparison to a recent jump in wholesale inflation, underscoring the pain the pandemic has inflicted on the country's service sector.
""Companies' pricing behavior is fundamentally different in Japan,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute. ""Companies have imprinted the idea that if they raise prices, the customer will go away.""
The services producer price index rose 1.1% in July from a year earlier after a revised 1.3% gain in June, Bank of Japan data showed.
The increase was driven by a 1.4% rise in transportation fees with international freight costs jumping 24.6%, highlighting the cost pressure companies are facing amid robust global demand.
Hotel service fees rose 10.8% to mark the biggest annual increase in nearly six years, reflecting a boost to demand from the Tokyo Olympics during July 23 to Aug. 8, the data showed.
""The recent increase in infections will weigh on services producer prices, though we could see service demand perk up if progress in vaccinations help re-open the economy,"" said Shigeru Shimizu, head of the BOJ's price statistics division.
Robust exports have helped Japan's economy emerge from last year's doldrums, though stop-and-go state of emergency curbs have weighed on consumption and dashed policymakers' hope of a sharp rebound in July-September growth.
Rising commodity prices are also pinching margins for firms, many of which remain cautious about passing on higher costs to customers due to weak household spending.

Japan's wholesale prices spiked 5.6% in July from a year earlier to mark the fastest annual increase in 13 years.
By contrast, core consumer prices fell 0.2% in July to mark a 12th straight month of declines on weak domestic demand.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian business investment jumped to two-year highs in the June quarter as firms ramped up spending plans for the year ahead, bullish plans that are now being threatened by coronavirus lockdowns across Sydney and Melbourne.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Thursday confirmed the economy had a good head of steam in the second quarter before the lockdowns likely threw it into reverse.
Business investment rose 4.4% in the second quarter to a real A$32.7 billion ($23.76 billion), topping forecasts of a 2.5% rise and the highest amount since 2019.
That strength suggests the gross domestic product report due next week will show reasonable growth for the quarter, and a huge improvement from last year when lockdowns tipped the economy into recession.
Generous tax breaks helped boost spending on equipment by 4.3% to the highest since late 2012, while building investment rose a solid 4.6%.
Promisingly firms also lifted spending plans for the year to June 2022 by almost 13% to A$127.7 billion.
""Given that businesses were surveyed in July, after the current Delta outbreaks had emerged, the data is surprisingly upbeat,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief Australia economist for BIS Oxford Economics.
""But risks to this outlook are clearly to the downside,"" she warned. ""Momentum in capex is likely to slow sharply, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, and there are risks of a longer term drag if major projects are now abandoned as too risky.""
Analysts are certain the economy will shrink sharply this quarter, with much of retailing and services shut in Australia's two most populous states, but are hopeful growth will rebound next quarter should restrictions ease as hoped.

For now, the outlook is uncertain with NSW reporting a record 1,029 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday and looking likely to remain locked down until at least October. [L1N2PW2RP]

(Reuters) - Mortgage applications increased last week, as purchasing applications posted their largest increase since early July while mortgage rates edged down.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages declined to 3.03% from 3.06% in the week ending Aug. 20. The seasonally adjusted market composite index tracking mortgage applications rose 1.6% from a week earlier, reflecting a 0.9% increase in applications to refinance existing loans. 
Purchase applications rose 3.0%, the MBA said.
After hitting record lows late last year below 2.9%, mortgage rates climbed in the first part of this year and peaked in the spring. Rates had been drifting lower since, held down in large part by the U.S. Federal Reserve's extraordinary stimulus measures aimed at helping the economy rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, but ticked higher last week after data showed a hiring surge last month.
""The purchase index was at its highest level since early July, despite still continuing to lag 2020’s pace,"" said Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting. ""There was also some easing in average loan sizes, which is potentially a sign that more first-time buyers looking for lower-priced homes are being helped by the recent uptick in for-sale inventory for both newly built homes and existing homes.""
Existing home sales climbed for the second consecutive month in July, a report from the National Association of Realtors showed Monday.

New home sales also increased in July after three consecutive monthly declines, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. However, momentum in the housing market appears to be slowing down as housing prices have continued to surge this year amid tight supply.
""Strong demand, still-low mortgage rates and a modest increase in the inventory of existing homes are supportive of home sales,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""However, supplies are still historically tight, and home prices at or near record levels will continue to temper the pace of home sales.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods were unexpectedly flat in July amid supply constraints and a shift in demand to services, suggesting that business spending on equipment could slow in the second half after robust growth over the past year.
Still, business investment in equipment remains strong, with the report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing shipments of these capital goods accelerating last month. Orders are 18% above their pre-pandemic levels. Investment in equipment is expected to help offset cooling consumer spending and keep the economy on a solid growth path this quarter.
""Overall, the July data point to solid equipment spending growth at the start of third quarter,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""But with producer prices running hot and the recovery tilting in favor of high-contact services, we're likely to see a gradual moderation in real equipment spending growth in the second half of 2021."" 
Last month's unchanged reading in orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, followed an upwardly revised 1.0% increase in June. These so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have advanced 0.7%. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders climbing 0.5%. Shipments of core capital goods rose 1.0% last month after increasing 0.6% in June. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
Business spending on equipment notched four straight quarters of double-digit growth, helping to power the economy's recovery from a short and sharp COVID-19 pandemic recession, driven by strong demand for goods, thanks to record-low interest rates and massive fiscal stimulus. 
July's slowdown in core capital goods orders likely reflected supply chain bottlenecks as well as the rotation of spending back to services from goods. There were decreases in orders for computers and electronic products. An ongoing global semiconductor shortage has hampered production of these goods.
Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components also fell. But orders for primary metals, machinery and fabricated metal products increased.

VERY LEAN INVENTORIES
With inventories extremely lean after they were depleted in the first half of the year, core capital goods orders are likely to pick up in the coming months and underpin manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy. Unfilled core capital goods orders increased 0.9% in July after rising 1.2% in June.
""As production has not kept up with demand but demand has remained persistently strong, we would expect strong demand to keep production supported well into 2022 as supply issues are eventually resolved,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. 
The resilience is welcome amid signs that consumer spending is cooling as the Delta variant of the coronavirus causes a resurgence in new infections across the country.
Retail sales fell in July in part because of motor vehicle shortages. Credit card data suggests spending on services like airfares, cruises as well as hotels and motels has been slowing. 
Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) last week cut their third-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 5.5% annualized rate from a 9% pace. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities slashed its GDP growth estimate for this quarter to a 4.5% pace from a 7.0% rate. The economy grew at a 6.5% rate in the second quarter, pulling the level of GDP above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, dipped 0.1% in July after rising 0.8% in June. They were pulled down by a 2.2% decline in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 1.4% increase in June.

Orders for civilian aircraft tumbled 48.9%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received 31 aircraft orders last month compared to 219 in June. Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 5.8% in July after climbing 1.8% in June. 

Automakers have been adjusting their production schedules, including foregoing annual plant shutdowns for retooling in July, to manage their chip supply. That likely contributed to the jump in motor vehicle orders last month.
""Make no mistake, auto-production is still struggling to keep up with demand,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German business morale fell for the second month running in August, as supply bottlenecks and rising COVID-19 cases drove companies to take a dimmer view of the coming months in Europe's largest economy, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The Ifo institute said its business climate index came in at 99.4, missing an analyst consensus of 100.4 in a Reuters poll and down from a downwardly revised reading of 100.7 in July.
""The mood in the German economy has clouded over again,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement. ""Supply bottlenecks for intermediate products in manufacturing and worries about rising infection numbers are putting a strain on the economy.""
Concerns were growing in the hospitality and tourism sectors in particular, he added.
Data on Tuesday showed the economy grew more than expected in the second quarter as the easing of COVID-19 curbs spurred consumers to dip into record savings piled up during the winter lockdown, and the state pressed on with a huge debt-financed stimulus push.
But with government officials warning of a fourth COVID-19 wave during the autumn, the months ahead look more problematic.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters the outlook for that period gave cause for concern as 70% of industrial businesses surveyed complained about supply chain bottlenecks.
Earlier, the Statistics Office said German exports to China declined for the first time in nearly a year in July, easing by 3.9% year-on-year to 8.4 billion euros ($9.9 billion).
""The decline in German companies' exports to China in July is a sobering sign,"" said Volker Treier, head of foreign trade at the DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce, adding that shipping problems were disrupting international supply chains.
Earlier this month, BMW raised its 2021 profit forecast after strong quarterly results, but said the global semiconductor chip shortage and rising raw materials prices would hurt its performance in the second half of the year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes increased in July after three straight monthly declines, but housing market momentum is slowing as surging housing prices amid tight supply sideline some first-time buyers from the market.
Though the report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed a big increase in new housing inventory, the jump was driven by a record rise in homes that are yet to be built. Builders are taking longer to complete houses, hobbled by expensive raw materials as well as scarce land and workers.
""While demand for new homes remains strong, high prices and backlogs in construction will temper sales in the months ahead,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Homebuilders are reportedly turning away buyers as they attempt to reduce the backlog of sales."" 
New home sales rose 1.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 708,000 units last month. June's sales pace was revised up to 701,000 units from the previously reported 676,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for 10.6% of U.S. home sales, increasing to a rate of 700,000 units in July. Sales dropped 27.2% on a year-on-year basis in July. The median new house price soared 18.4% from a year earlier to a record $390,500 in July. 
Sales jumped to a rate of 993,000 units in January, the highest since the end of 2006, driven by historically low mortgage rates and a desire for spacious accommodations as Americans worked from home and took online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The market for new homes is being driven by an acute shortage of previously owned houses. But builders have struggled to fully take advantage of the supply squeeze, hampered by soaring lumber prices as well as shortages of other building materials and household appliances.
Though lumber prices have dropped sharply from May's record highs, they remain above their pre-pandemic levels. Reports this month showed single-family building permits fell in July, while confidence among homebuilders hit a 13-month low in August. 
A report on Monday showed sales of previously owned homes rose modestly in July.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes hitting record highs, boosted by oil and travel-related shares. The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower. 
LOWER-COST STATES
Last month's gain in new home sales was driven by a 1.3% rise in the populous South and a 14.4% jump in the West. Sales plunged 24.1% in the Northeast and decreased 20.2% in the Midwest. 
""The pandemic has accelerated the migration to suburban markets and metro areas in lower-cost states such as Arizona, Utah, Texas and Florida,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""By contrast, new home sales weakened in areas where population growth has slowed, in part due to an outflow of residents seeking more affordable real estate, lower taxes and other lifestyle advantages.""
New home sales were concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. Sales in the under-$200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for a mere 1% of transactions.
""Affordability is becoming an increasing issue in the new-home market,"" said Bernard Yaros, and economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Single-family sales prices are up 20% from their pre-pandemic level, which is a touch lower than the run-up in sales prices in the existing-home market but still enough to deter potential homebuyers.""
There were 367,000 new homes on the market in July, the highest since November 2008 and up from 348,000 in June. Homes yet to be built accounted for record 28.6% of supply. Completed houses made up only 9.8% of supply. 

At July's sales pace it would take 6.2 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 6.0 months in June. About 75% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.
""We expect sales to move upward as the year continues, as sufficient demand is present, but the pace at which acceleration occurs will likely be determined by the speed at which homebuilders can clear their current backlogs and overcome material availability and other supply constraints,"" said Mark Palim, deputy chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington.

Britain's tax office said 73,740 homes were sold in July on a seasonally adjusted basis - 63% fewer than in June when buyers had rushed to complete sales before a COVID emergency tax break was reduced - although 4% more than in July 2020. 
Sales were down 24% compared with the same month in 2019, before the pandemic.
British finance minister Rishi Sunak last year temporarily scrapped the stamp duty tax on the first 500,000 pounds ($685,550) of property purchases in England and Northern Ireland. 
That full exemption expired at the end of June but buyers in England and Northern Ireland will benefit from a 250,000 pound exemption until the end of September.

BERLIN (Reuters) -The German economy grew more than expected in the second quarter as the easing of COVID-19 curbs spurred consumers to dip into record savings piled up during the winter lockdown and the state pressed on with a huge debt-financed stimulus push.
Gross domestic product grew an adjusted 1.6% on the quarter, the Federal Statistic Office said on Tuesday, up from its previous estimate of 1.5% and following a revised first quarter contraction of 2%.
On the year, Europe's largest economy expanded by a calendar-adjusted 9.4% in the second quarter, leaving economic activity 3.3% below the pre-crisis levels of the fourth quarter of 2019.
Private consumption grew by 3.2% between April and June, contributing 1.6% percentage points to overall growth and pushing the savings rate down to 16.3%. In the first quarter, when shops, bars and restaurants were closed under Germany's lockdown, that rate hit a record high of 22%.
Public consumption expanded 1.8%, contributing 0.4% to the overall growth rate.
State spending to cushion the impact of the coronavirus crisis, financed with unprecedented new borrowing, blew a 80.9 billion euro ($95 billion) hole in the public finances in the first half of the year, the statistics office said.
This equated to a public sector deficit of 4.7% of GDP, the largest in 26 years and what Carsten Brzeski from ING Bank termed ""the downside of the rapid economic recovery.""
The stimlus should help lift the economy back to pre-crisis levels before the end of 2021 but will leave the government that emerges from next month's federal election with a heavy burden to shoulder, Brzeski said.

Germany's quarter-on-quarter GDP growth compared with a second quarter euro zone average of 2% and growth of 0.9%, 2.7% and 2.8% respectively the bloc's next biggest economies, France, Italy and Spain.

The companies signed up for $9.9 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $9.1 billion a year earlier. However, borrowings fell 5% from the previous month.
""Despite supply chain disruptions in some sectors of the economy, signs of inflation, and the emergence of the Delta coronavirus, July new business volume in the equipment finance industry is strong,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said in a statement.
Petta also cited a pick-up in consumer spending and slowing unemployment as reasons to be optimistic about equipment investment and industry performance for the second half of the year.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 76.5%, down from 76.7% in June.

705,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 01:07PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - U.S. business activity growth slowed for a third straight month in August as capacity constraints, supply shortages and the rapidly spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus weaken the momentum of the rebound from last year's pandemic-induced recession. 
Data firm IHS Markit said on Monday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to 55.4 - the lowest since last December - from 59.9 in July. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector.
Shortages of raw materials and labor now appear to be holding back output as well as fanning inflation, according to the IHS Markit data. New order growth was the weakest so far this year, while employment grew at the slowest rate in more than a year. 
""Not only have supply chain delays hit a new survey record high, but the August survey saw increasing frustrations in relation to hiring,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. ""Jobs growth waned to the lowest since July of last year as companies either failed to find suitable staff or existing workers switched jobs."" 
The IHS Markit survey's flash services sector PMI fell to a reading of 55.2 from 59.9 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 59.5 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
The survey's flash manufacturing PMI slid to 61.2 in August from July's all-time high reading of 63.4. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, would dip to 62.5.
IHS Markit's measures of prices paid by services companies and manufacturers both rose, with factory input prices hitting another record high.
The survey's findings dovetail with a growing view that the pace of economic expansion is tailing off after two successive quarters of growth above 6%, a back-to-back performance not seen since the 1980s and fueled by massive fiscal stimulus. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economists, for example, last week slashed their third-quarter gross domestic product estimate to 5.5% from 9%, and the slowing momentum calls into question the consensus among Federal Reserve policymakers that growth would hit 7% this year.
JACKSON HOLE CONFERENCE
The Fed will hold its annual Jackson Hole economic symposium later this week in a virtual format for the second straight year due to the pandemic. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak on the economic outlook on Friday.

Powell's remarks will be closely watched for any fresh signal on how soon the Fed may cut back on its crisis-era accommodation. That policy turn appears to be in the offing by the end of the year as the economy remains squarely in growth mode and inflation well over target despite the latest headwinds from the Delta variant and the fading boost from government spending. The labor market, for instance, has added roughly 1.9 million jobs in the past two months, although the IHS Markit data suggests that pace has cooled in August.
The government is due to publish its revised estimate of second-quarter GDP on Thursday, with economists polled by Reuters estimating growth to be marked up to an annualized rate of 6.7% from the advance estimate of 6.5%. The economy in the second quarter also regained a record level of output, recouping all of the record-setting drop triggered by the pandemic in just four quarters.

(Reuters) -U.S. existing home sales increased for the second consecutive month in July as inventories improved moderately, while prices eased from the prior month's record level.
Existing home sales increased 2.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.99 million units last month from June's upwardly revised pace of 5.87 million units, the National Association of Realtors said on Monday. Sales were unchanged in the Northeast, but increased in the Midwest, South and the West.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would decline to a rate of 5.83 million units in July.
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, increased 1.5% on a year-on-year basis. The median sales price slipped to $359,900 from June's record level, but was still up 17.8% from the year-earlier period.
The sales rate increase suggests the drop-off in sales after a sharp run-up late in 2020 and early this year may have run its course. 
""We see inventory beginning to tick up, which will lessen the intensity of multiple offers,"" Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said in a statement. ""Much of the home sales growth is still occurring in the upper-end markets, while the mid- to lower-tier areas aren't seeing as much growth because there are still too few starter homes available.""
Homebuilding fell more than expected in July amid supply constraints, the Commerce Department reported last week, as surging construction costs and home prices continued to constrain the housing market. There was, however, a rebound in building permits following three consecutive monthly declines.
Demand for housing soared throughout the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, the combination of robust demand and record-low mortgage rates has far outpaced supply. This has also made it harder for potential homebuyers to enter the market.
For example, a report from the Mortgage Bankers Association last week showed that applications for loans to purchase a house declined in the week ending Aug. 13. 
""Going forward, the market for existing homes will be supported by strong demand and mortgage rates that remain relatively low,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""However, inventory remains lean despite the increase in July, and that will keep a floor under home prices, which are unaffordable for many prospective buyers.""

Data on new home sales for July are due on Tuesday. Sales are forecast to rise to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 700,000 units, according to a survey of economists polled by Reuters, after hitting a 14-month low in June. 
""Continued economic recovery is key to maintaining sales momentum,"" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. ""Anything that disrupts progress, such as rising COVID cases, could knock home sales off course.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Business activity in the euro zone grew strongly this month, only dipping from July's two-decade high monthly pace, as a rapid COVID-19 vaccination drive allowed more firms to reopen and customers to venture out, a survey showed.
Without ongoing supply chain disruptions, activity could have expanded faster, but fears new coronavirus strains may lead to renewed restrictions continued to dent optimism.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a guide to economic health, fell to 59.5 in August from 60.2 last month. It was ahead of the 50-mark separating growth from contraction but just shy of a Reuters poll estimate for 59.7.
""The euro zone economy is firing on all cylinders again as reopening has had the expected positive effect on growth. Concerns about the impact of the Delta variant and input shortages remain but have not derailed the rebound thus far,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
Both the services and manufacturing indices remained in growth territory in Germany, confirming Europe's biggest economy was on a recovery path, an earlier survey showed.
Economic growth in Germany could miss projections this year and the resurgence of the pandemic may put unexpected strain on the economy in the autumn, the Bundesbank said in a monthly report on Monday.
In France, the bloc's second-biggest economy, growth in business activity slowed compared to July but remained resilient, as problems with supplies of goods and COVID-19 health protocols impacted trade.
But Britain's post-lockdown economic bounce-back slowed sharply as companies struggled with unprecedented shortages of staff and materials, although strong inflation pressures cooled.
""Overall, August's flash PMIs underline two key risks to our forecasts. First, that the economic recovery might be slowing a bit faster than we had thought, posing a downside risk to our view that the economy will return to its pre-pandemic level by October,"" said Kieran Tompkins (NYSE:TMP) at Capital Economics.
""Second, that materials and staff shortages might feed into second-round effects of rising wage growth, meaning that inflation is higher for longer.""
Markets were unmoved by the PMI data and were instead focused on worries about the Delta variant hampering growth as investors weighed up the possible timeline for the tapering of monetary stimulus ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole this week. [MKTS/GLOB]
JOB BOOST
Firms increased headcount in the euro zone at a near-record pace but were still unable to complete all new business coming in, building up a backlog of work at the third-fastest pace in survey history. The composite employment index held at 56.1.
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry nudged down to 59.7 from July's 15-year high of 59.8. The Reuters poll had predicted 59.8.
Demand slowed marginally from July - suggesting the rebound will continue - but the services business expectations index, which measure optimism about the year ahead, dropped to 68.6 from 69.1.
""We continue to see the potential spread of more virulent virus variants and the prolongation of supply chain issues as the main risks to the economic recovery,"" said Maddalena Martini at Oxford Economics.
""Therefore, the level of uncertainty around the forecast remains very high, but we still expect a strong recovery over the coming quarters.""

Manufacturers had another solid month, their PMI remaining well above the breakeven mark at 61.5, albeit below July's 62.8 and the 62.0 poll estimate. An index measuring output that feeds into to the composite PMI fell to 59.2 from 61.1.
But supply delays - the delivery times index was near a survey low - again played a key role in driving up the costs of the raw materials factories need. The input prices index was 87.3, although down from July's record high of 89.2.

The Confederation of British Industry's index for stock adequacy fell to the lowest since the survey began in 1977, sinking to -14 from July's -11, the third record low in as many months.
The survey also showed expectations for output price growth over the next three months remained close to June's nearly 30-year high, something the Bank of England will note after it said this month that it planned modest tightening of monetary policy.
The CBI's index for industrial output growth in the three months to August slipped from a record high in July, easing back to +22 from +37. But orders edged up to +18 from +17. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of +16 for orders.
""Manufacturing activity remained strong this month, with total order books remaining firm and most sub-sectors reporting rising output,"" Alpesh Paleja, a CBI economist, said.
""However, early signs from the data suggest that growth in activity may have peaked.""
The slowing of output growth was largely caused by the motor vehicles sub-sector which has been hit hard by a shortage of chips.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's post-lockdown economic rebound slowed sharply in August as companies struggled with unprecedented shortages of staff and materials, though strong inflation pressures cooled a bit, a survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS flash composite PMI dropped for the third month in a row, sinking to 55.3 from 59.2 in July, its lowest since February and a sharper fall than a median forecast of 58.4 in a Reuters poll of economists.
The pace of growth was still slightly above the pre-pandemic average but IHS Markit said there were clear signs of the recovery losing momentum after a buoyant second quarter. 
""Despite COVID-19 containment measures easing to the lowest since the pandemic began, rising virus case numbers are deterring many forms of spending, notably by consumers, and have hit growth via worsening staff and supply shortages,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.
The equivalent PMI for the euro zone slowed much less, dropping to 59.5 from 60.2.
Companies have complained that self-isolation requirements for contacts of people with COVID-19 have made it hard for them to find staff but those requirements were dropped from Aug. 13 for those fully vaccinated.
""Some businesses are finding recruitment difficult. With supply chain disruptions also persisting inflationary pressures remain a concern for now despite the slowdown in CPI inflation in July,"" Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank economist Rhys Herbert said.
On a brighter note, the PMI's employment growth measure hit its highest since the series began in 1998 as furloughed workers return, and businesses were more optimistic about future output. 
The PMI's gauge of input prices fell after hitting its highest in more than 20 years in July, and the prices charged by factories moved further away from June's record high.
The Bank of England is watching to see whether a jump in inflation turns into more stubborn price growth.
The central bank said earlier this month it expected ""modest monetary tightening"" would be needed over its three-year forecast period.

The fall in the PMI was mostly driven by services firms who make up the bulk of Britain's economy. Manufacturing dipped only slightly although automotive and electrical goods production fell into decline mainly due to supply constraints.
Data for the survey was collected between Aug. 12 and Aug. 19.

The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 52.4 in August from a final 53.0 in the prior month.

The au Jibun Bank Flash Services PMI index dropped to a seasonally adjusted 43.5 from the previous month's final of 47.4, hitting its lowest since May 2020, when Japan's economy went through a deep COVID-19 slump.
The weak reading pushed down activity for the overall private sector, which contracted at the quickest pace since August 2020, said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.
""The decline in overall private sector activity was led by the larger services sector, where business activity fell for the 19th consecutive month,"" Bhatti said.

""Private sector businesses noted that the recent surge in COVID-19 cases related to the Delta variant had dampened prospects.""
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Composite PMI, which is estimated by using both manufacturing and services, fell to 45.9 from July's final of 48.8, hitting its lowest since August last year.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales surged 4.2% in June from May, led by a strong rebound in demand for clothing and accessories, while July retail sales likely fell 1.7%, data showed on Friday.
The June gain was slightly below the average analyst estimate of 4.4%, Statistics Canada data showed. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, retail sales were up 4.7%, just beating expectations of 4.6%. 
Sales increased in eight of 11 subsectors, representing 69.5% of retail trade, as COVID-19 restrictions were eased and Canadians flocked back to nonessential stores, Statscan said.
""There's nothing like some retail therapy to cure the post-lockdown blues,"" Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. 
""The general rebound following lockdowns shows the willingness of Canadians to spend and, more broadly, how quickly the economy can bounce back when Covid cases are low,"" he added.
While the preliminary estimate for July was disappointing, economists noted that even with the decline, retail sales remain well above their pre-COVID-19 levels. The drop in July could also signal a shift to more spending in bars and restaurants.
""It's very possible that spending was redirected to services as that sector more fully reopened,"" said Benjamin Reitzes, Canadian rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Markets.
Canadian provinces eased restrictions through the spring as new COVID-19 cases fell amid a successful inoculation campaign. But a Delta variant-driven rebound of COVID-19 cases is starting to cloud the outlook.

Clothing and accessory sales spiked 49.1% in June, with sporting good sales up 27.9% and home goods up 23.2%. Sales of new cars rose by 3.3% and used cars jumped 3.0%.

716,"<span>Aug 20, 2021 09:18AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Retail sales in Canada rebounded as brick-and-mortar shops were allowed to reopen after months of Covid-19 shutdowns, though early data shows that momentum was short-lived.
The value of receipts rose 4.2% in June, Statistics Canada reported Friday in Ottawa. However, that bounce-back was quickly reversed in July with a preliminary estimate showing a 1.7% decline on the month. That brings total sales down about 5% from their post-pandemic peak in March. 
The report suggests consumers were initially eager to buy goods when businesses reopened, though the weakness in July could reflect a shift in consumption to services. That kind of change has been expected by economists, who anticipate more spending on things like restaurant meals and haircuts now that they’re allowed.
“Canadians probably started replacing goods purchases with services. And even with the retreat in July, retail sales are still well above pre-Covid levels,” Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said by email.
June’s retail gains were broad-based with 8 of the 11 categories posting increases. Clothing and accessories stores led, rising 49.1% as they reopened after months long lockdowns.

LONDON (Reuters) -British retail sales unexpectedly fell in July, official data showed on Friday, suggesting at least some consumers skipped shopping to follow England's run in the Euro 2020 soccer tournament, or stayed at home due to rising COVID-19 cases.
Retailers reported that the tournament - in which England reached the final - and bad weather kept shoppers away from stores, the Office for National Statistics said.
Sales volumes fell by 2.5% from June, the biggest drop since January when Britain returned to lockdown. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4% month-on-month rise.
An ONS official said there had been no feedback from retailers that worries about rising coronavirus cases were behind the drop in sales.
But analysts said the size of the fall probably reflected the impact of the fast-spreading Delta variant and the requirement for hundreds of thousands of people to isolate after being ""pinged"" by a government tracing app.
""July's sharp decline in retail sales can be blamed largely on rising COVID-19 cases, which prompted some households to steer clear of shops and forced others into self-isolation,"" said Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The self-isolation requirement for contacts of someone with COVID-19 has now been dropped for people who have had two vaccinations. 
The ONS said food store sales were down by 1.5%, reflecting a jump in June and the opening of more hospitality venues. Non-food stores reported a fall of 4.4%, though sales remained 5.8% above their pre-pandemic levels in February 2020.
In a possible sign of renewed caution among shoppers, or July's bad weather, online sales rose to 27.9% of total spending after hitting a pandemic low in June.
Earlier this month, Barclaycard said its data for July showed a jump in entertainment spending as people returned to cinemas, theatres and sports events.
BOUNCE-BACK SLOWS 
Britain's economy has recovered most of its nearly 10% slump in 2020 when the country suffered one of the world's heaviest coronavirus death tolls and stayed locked down for longer than many other European nations.
But there are signs that the bounce-back has slowed after a strong March and April as restrictions began to be lifted.
An opinion poll published on Friday by market research firm GfK showed consumer confidence dipped only slightly in August from its highest level since before the pandemic.
But it also showed consumers were less willing to make major purchases and were opting to save more money.
The recovery in the economy has also helped finance minister Rishi Sunak to reduce the government's huge borrowing.
The ONS said the budget deficit in the first four months of the 2021/22 financial year was running 26 billion pounds ($35.43 billion) below an estimate set out by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's forecaster, in March.
July's borrowing of 10.4 billion pounds was less than a median forecast of 11.8 billion pounds in the Reuters poll.
Sunak is on course to spend a total of 350 billion pounds in his response to the coronavirus crisis, but his jobs subsidies programme, the most expensive element, is being wound down.
The deficit in July also narrowed thanks to higher tax receipts as individuals filed tax returns before a deadline.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think tank, said the deficit remained huge at 10.8% of economic output in the 12 months to July, more than four times its historic average, and would probably require ""very difficult decisions"" when Sunak gives a half-yearly update on the public finances on Oct. 27.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's core consumer prices narrowed their annual pace of falls for three straight months in July, a sign global commodities inflation was offsetting some of the deflationary pressure from a pandemic-induced spending slump.
But analysts expect consumer inflation to stay well below levels seen in the United States and Europe, as Japan's decision on Tuesday to extend state of emergency curbs into mid-September is seen dealing a blow to already weak household spending.
""Cost-push inflation is driving up goods prices, while service prices remain weak due to the pandemic's impact,"" said Toru Suehiro, an economist at Daiwa Securities.
""Given the increase in Delta variant cases, this trend will continue for the time being.""
Japan's core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil but excludes fresh food prices, fell 0.2% in July from a year earlier, marking the 12th straight month of declines, government data showed on Friday.
The fall was due in part to a change in the base year for the CPI that gives a heavier weighting to mobile charge fees, which plunged a record 39.6% in July.
But the drop was smaller than market forecasts for a 0.4% fall and a 0.5% decrease in June due to the boost from rising food and fuel costs, including a 19.6% spike in gasoline bills.
Prices of refrigerators and air conditioners, as well as accommodation fees, also rose in a sign some households were keen to spend after hunkering down during repeated stop-and-go state of emergency curbs.
But the pent-up demand is still too weak for companies to pass on rising costs to households as aggressively as their counterparts in western economies, analysts say.
The drop in Japan's consumer prices contrasts sharply with moves in wholesale prices, which spiked 5.6% in July to mark the fastest annual increase in 13 years.
The so-called core-core consumer price index, which strips away not just fresh food but energy costs, fell 0.6% in July from a year earlier.
The data may lead to a cut in the Bank of Japan's inflation forecast at its next quarterly review due in October, as its current projections do not take into account of the base-year effect, some analysts say.
In present projections made in July, the BOJ expects core consumer prices to rise 0.6% in the year ending in March 2022.
""The BOJ's current outlook is based on the scenario that economic activity will start to normalise toward the end of this year,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""But the timing of the recovery may be delayed.""

Japan's economy rebounded more than expected in the second quarter after slumping in the first three months of this year, a sign consumption and capital expenditure were recovering from the coronavirus pandemic's initial hit.
But many analysts expect growth to remain modest in the current quarter as curbs reimposed to combat a spike in infections weigh on household spending.

LONDON (Reuters) - Already-expensive British home prices will see further substantial gains over the next few years, bolstered by low borrowing costs, supply shortages and a desire for more living space, a Reuters poll of housing market analysts found.
As in much of the developed world, millions of Britons have spent the past 17 months working from home as measures imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic shut offices and restricted travel.
That enforced time at home, which has allowed some to accumulate more savings and is likely to continue at least part time, has meant people want more room as they adapt their properties to be both living and working areas.
""The current trend of wanting more space has some way to run. It takes many years for supply to catch up with demand after the type of fundamental shift in buyer requirements over the last year,"" said Ray Boulger at mortgage broker John Charcol.
Asked what would be the biggest driver of UK home prices over the next 12 months, four of 12 respondents to an additional question in the Aug. 13-19 Reuters poll cited a desire for more living space, three named supply shortages and five others said easy monetary policy.
CHEAP MONEY
As the pandemic battered the economy, the Bank of England - like its peers - slashed interest rates to a record low 0.10% and restarted its bond buying programme, making it far cheaper for those who can to pay a mortgage on a home.
""The low cost of borrowing is the thing that underpins house price affordability and therefore house price growth the most,"" said Russell Quirk at real estate firm Proper PR.
""If you look at the correlation between lower interest rates over the last 10 or 12 years and house prices there is a direct correlation - the cheaper money gets the more expensive house prices get.""
On the flip side, when asked what posed the biggest downside risk to prices, six of 12 respondents said higher interest rates. Others mentioned new coronavirus variants, high unemployment or a return to a full-time office working week.
While a Reuters poll of economists earlier this week found the central bank would wait until 2023 before raising interest rates, they did say there was a chance an increase may come sooner than that.
""If things go to plan and we learn to live with COVID-19, tighter monetary policy is probably the biggest risk,"" said Aneisha Beveridge at estate agent Hamptons.
Still, medians in the wider poll of 15 market experts showed house prices would rise 6.0% this year, 3.5% next year and 3.0% in 2023, far outstripping expectations for overall inflation. 
The forecasts for this year and next were higher than in a May poll and the highest since polling began for those periods.
In London they were predicted to rise 2.8% this year, 2.5% in 2022 and 2.4% the following year.
Those price rises mean affordability will worsen over the coming few years, according to six of 12 respondents to an additional question. Four said it would stay the same and two said it would improve.

""Demand will continue to push prices as will low mortgage rates. Yet wage inflation will also boom. The result will be prices that are yet more 'unaffordable' especially for stretched first-time buyers (of property),"" Quirk said. 
The average asking price for a home was 337,371 pounds ($461,962) this month, according to property website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY), more than 10 times the average British salary. With wage rises unlikely to keep pace with home price increases that affordability gap will probably widen.

720,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy is on track for a lasting, probably stronger recovery in the third quarter driven by lively domestic demand after gross domestic product expanded by 1.5% on the quarter from April to June, the finance ministry said on Friday.
A third wave of coronavirus infections and a longer-than-expected lockdown caused the economy, Europe's largest, to shrink by 2.1% in the first three months of the year compared to the previous quarter.
The finance ministry said in its monthly report that sentiment surveys and forward-looking indicators such as truck toll mileage pointed to ""unbroken optimism"" among businesses and high activity in the economy over the summer months.
The re-opening of the economy and falling COVID-19 cases in early summer have pushed up household spending which translated into booming retail sales in May and June, it said.
The economic recovery has also lifted tax revenues, though accumulated tax revenues from January to July are still 1.7% lower compared to the same period in the pre-pandemic year of 2019, the ministry said. This shows what a large hole the pandemic has blown in Germany's public finances.

Finance Minister Olaf Scholz got the green light from parliament to suspend debt limits in the constitution to allow record new borrowing of up to 240 billion euros this year and more than 130 billion euros last year.
Scholz, the centre-left Social Democrat candidate to succeed conservative Angela Merkel as chancellor in a September election, has proposed suspending the debt brake for a third year in a row in 2022 to allow additional borrowing of nearly 100 billion euros next year.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - New Zealand's runaway housing market, which has accelerated rapidly during the pandemic, will cool next year, according to a Reuters poll of property market analysts, but affordability will stay stretched or worsen over the next few years.
House prices have nearly doubled in the last seven years thanks to super-low interest rates, slashed from 3.50% to 0.25% over that period, leaving first-time homebuyers and low-income earners behind as prices climbed beyond their reach.
After soaring 30% in just the past 12 months, the most among OECD nations, home prices were forecast to jump another 20% this year, according to a Reuters poll of 10 property market analysts taken Aug. 11-19.
With a series of Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) interest rate rises set to start in the coming months, that blistering pace of house price appreciation was expected to slow dramatically to 2.5% next year and in 2023.
""While we think the annual (house price rise) is very close to its peak, the ratio of house prices to incomes is simply off the chart,"" said Sharon Zollner, chief economist at ANZ. ""Properties available for sale remain very low, and the only real solution to this madness is to build more houses. 
""But the scary thing is, even if we assume house price inflation from here to the end of time is zero, and that income growth can run at the very solid pace of 5% per annum, it would still take six years for this ratio to return to pre-COVID-19 levels,"" Zollner added. ""Without outright house price falls, it's a slog.""
Only two analysts in the poll forecast a fall in prices, and one of them said not until 2023. All but one who answered a question about affordability over the next two to three years said it would stay the same or worsen.
CONSIDERABLE TIME 
Measures introduced this year by the government and the RBNZ - with rates still at record lows - so far have failed to cool the market.
""Nationwide affordability continues to worsen,"" said Brad Olsen, principal economist at Infometrics. ""(For) house price to income ratios to fall back from around 7 to the more affordable ratio of 3 would require a 56% fall in house prices or a 130% increase in incomes, meaning improved affordability will take a considerable time.""
Earlier this month, the Human Rights Commission announced an inquiry into New Zealand's property market, saying the housing crisis is having a ""punishing impact"" on marginalized communities and is leaving many people homeless.
However, all respondents in the poll to an additional question said central bank and government measures to cool property prices would have a significant impact, including one who said very significant.
Asked what was the biggest downside risk, analysts said higher interest rates or tighter monetary policy.

""The house always wins ... We expect that house prices will continue to rise over the coming year, but that the pace of increase will slow as mortgage rates lift from their recent lows,"" said Michael Gordon, chief economist at Westpac.
""That's likely to take some of the steam coming out of the housing market,"" Gordon added. ""And combined with changes to the tax system, the middle part of the decade is likely to see some modest price declines.""

722,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 03:56PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth for the second quarter is likely to be revised higher following a recent raft of stronger than initially thought data covering that period, which reflected the economy's reopening amid improved public health. 
The Commerce Department's quarterly services survey, or QSS report, on Thursday added to a flow of data such as retail sales and inventories in suggesting that gross domestic product grew much faster than the 6.5% annualized rate reported by the government in its advance estimate last month.
The QSS provided data on services spending and intellectual property products investment, which will be incorporated by the Commerce Department's statistics agency, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, into its second estimate of GDP growth.
""We think these components will be revised up slightly in the BEA's upcoming GDP release as a result of the QSS data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Following the QSS data, upward revisions to June core retail sales and steady inventory accumulation, economists expect second-quarter GDP growth could be revised to as high as a 7.3% pace, when the BEA to be publishes its second estimate next Thursday. 
The QSS report showed services industry revenue increased 4.0% in the second quarter, and was 5.7% above its pandemic level. The growth in revenue was led by the leisure and hospitality as well as the travel sectors. 
Though a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus poses a risk, economists were generally optimistic that the services industries would continue to grow in the second half of the year.
""This wave of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. will likely have less economic cost,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""A number of the high-frequency measures that we monitor have softened a little, but nothing that raises a red flag.""

Nevertheless, economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday cut their third-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 5.5% rate from a 9% pace, citing higher inflation and the Delta variant. They, however, lifted their forecasts for the fourth quarter and 2022.
The economy is expected to grow by about 7% this year, which would be the strongest performance since 1984.

(Reuters) -Growth in factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region slowed for the fourth consecutive month in August after hitting its highest pace in nearly half a century earlier this spring, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index fell to 19.4, the lowest since December, from 21.9 in July. That was below economists' expectations for a reading of 23.0, according to a Reuters poll.
Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. The survey covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
It is seen as one of the first monthly indicators of the health of U.S. manufacturing leading up to the national report by the Institute for Supply Management, next due out September 1.
Supply constraints have continued to slow manufacturing activity nationwide, indicating that the economics recovery might be slowing down in a year in which growth is projected to accelerate at its fastest pace in nearly four decades. In March, the Philly Fed's factory activity gauge hit its highest level since 1973.
""Manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region will stay entrenched in a solid growth mode through the end of 2021,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. ""There’s still plenty of pent-up activity yet to be released, and solid goods demand and rising capital investment will keep the gears of regional manufacturers turning at a healthy clip.""
The Philly Fed employment index increased to a record-high of 32.6 from 29.2 in July. 
Additionally, the price paid index rose to 71.2 in August from 69.7 in the month prior, after reaching a 42-year high in June.

""Covid still poses the greatest downside risk to the regional recovery currently,"" Klachkin said.
Though manufacturing production at factories surged in July, manufacturing itself is being underpinned by domestic demand. That is effectively straining the supply chain and manufacturers struggling with shortages of both raw materials and labor.

(Reuters) -A gauge of future U.S. economic activity increased in July, suggesting the economy continued to expand from the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic even in the face of a resurgence in cases fueled by the Delta variant.
The Conference Board on Thursday said its index of leading economic indicators (LEI) rose 0.9% last month to 116.0. Economists polled by Reuters had expected an increase of 0.8%. 
Even though the U.S. economy is forecast to grow this year at its fastest pace since the 1980s, there are signs the recovery could be cooling off. Supply-chain bottlenecks continue to slow manufacturing growth, and consumer sentiment plummeted in early August to a decade-low as Americans gave faltering outlooks on everything from personal finances to inflation and employment.
Meanwhile, consumer price increases slowed in July, the Labor Department said last week, but inflation overall remained at a historically high level amid supply-chain disruptions as well as stronger demand for travel-related services.
""The U.S. LEI registered another large gain in July, with all components contributing positively,"" said Ataman Ozyildirim, the Conference Board's senior director of economic research. ""While the Delta variant and/or rising inflation fears could create headwinds for the U.S. economy in the near term, we expect real GDP (gross domestic product) growth for 2021 to reach 6.0% year-over-year, before easing to a still robust 4.0% growth rate for 2022.""
The LEI's coincident index, a measure of current economic conditions, rose 0.6% in July after increasing 0.4% in June. 

But the lagging index increased 0.6% last month after being unchanged in June and increasing 0.8% in May.
""Even with more moderate growth in the second half of the year, the economy’s momentum remains encouraging with constraints on labor supply easing, a trove of excess savings still waiting to be drawn down, and strong vaccine numbers that will insulate the economy from the worsening health situation more so than prior waves,"" said Mahir Rasheed, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a 17-month low last week, pointing to another month of robust job growth, though surging COVID-19 infections pose a risk to the labor market recovery.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed the number of people on state jobless rolls dropped in early August to levels last seen in mid-March 2020, when the economy almost ground to a halt amid mandatory business closures aimed at slowing the first wave of COVID-19 cases.
The labor market's prospects were boosted by other data showing a measure of manufacturing employment in the mid-Atlantic region rose to a record high this month and factories increased hours for workers. But the pace of growth in factory output slowed for a fourth straight month amid scarce raw materials and a shift in spending to services from goods. 
""We can infer that hiring remains strong in August, pointing to a healthy jobs report for this month,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 29,000 to a seasonally adjusted 348,000 for the week ended Aug. 14. The fourth straight weekly decline pushed claims to their lowest level since mid-March 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 363,000 applications for the latest week. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility dropped 19,000 to 377,750, also a 17-month low.
Last week's decrease in filings was led by Texas. There were also notable declines in Illinois, Kentucky and Michigan. But applications increased in Virginia, California and New Mexico.
Claims have declined from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. They, however, remain above the 200,000-250,000 range that is seen as consistent with healthy labor market conditions. Claims have been grinding lower, with employers hanging on to their workers amid a labor shortage as vaccinations allow the economy to fully reopen. More than half of the population has been fully immunized against COVID-19.
The drop in claims below the 350,000 level is a major milestone for the economy, which fully recovered in the second quarter the sharp loss in output suffered during the very brief pandemic recession. President Joe Biden hailed the progress, noting that an average of more than 830,000 Americans were filing claims when he took office in January. 
""While our economic recovery is far from complete, the Biden plan to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out is working and delivering real results for American workers,"" Biden said in a statement. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mixed after minutes of the Federal Reserve's July 29-28 policy meeting released on Wednesday showed U.S. central bank officials believed their employment benchmark for decreasing support for the economy ""could be reached this year.""
The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

GOOD OMEN FOR HIRING
The claims data covered the period that the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls portion of August's closely watched employment report. 
With claims firmly below 400,000, payrolls growth likely remained strong after the economy created a whopping 943,000 jobs in July. 
The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid tumbled 79,000 to 2.820 million in the week ended Aug. 7, the lowest level since mid-March 2020. 
Data next week on the so-called continuing claims will offer more clues on how hiring fared in August. But surging COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, loom large. Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday cut their third-quarter GDP growth estimate.
While economists generally do not see large-scale business shutdowns as happened early in the pandemic, there are worries that soaring COVID-19 cases could keep some unemployed people at home, especially if children are unable to attend schools in person.
Lack of childcare facilities and fears of contracting the virus have been blamed for worker shortages, which are partly contributing to employment remaining 5.7 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. There were a record 10.1 million job openings as of the end of June. About 8.7 million people were officially unemployed in July. 
At least 25 states led by Republican governors have pulled out of federal government-funded unemployment programs, including a $300 weekly payment, which businesses claimed were encouraging unemployed Americans to stay at home. There is, however, no evidence that the early termination of federal benefits has led to an increase in hiring in these states.
The government-funded benefits will expire on Sept. 6. At least 11.7 million people were collecting unemployment benefits under all programs at the end of July.
A report from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday showed its measure of manufacturing activity in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, fell to 19.4 this month from 21.9 in July. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing

Manufacturers were also a little less upbeat about business prospects over the next six months. But with inventories depleted, manufacturing is likely to continue growing at a steady clip. 
""Overall the report doesn't signal an obvious big shift in momentum in the manufacturing sector,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

726,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Applications for U.S. state unemployment benefits dropped for a fourth consecutive week, a trend that suggests labor market conditions are improving as the economy recovers.
Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs dropped 29,000 to 348,000 in the week ended Aug. 14, a pandemic low, Labor Department data showed Thursday. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had called for a decline to 364,000.
Continuing claims for state benefits fell to 2.8 millionin the week ended Aug. 7, also the lowest since the pandemic began.
The decrease in initial claims points to strengthening business and fewer dismissals as economic activity improves. That said, a pickup in initial filings in the next few weeks could point to labor market weakness as the delta variant of Covid-19 spreads. 
Some states and cities have reintroduced mask mandates in recent weeks in response to coronavirus variants, and businesses have pushed back their return-to-office plans. But there’s little evidence so far to suggest the delta variant has resulted in layoffs, especially because restrictions haven’t been put on restaurants, bars and entertainment venues.
Texas and Illinois posted the largest declines in initial claims last week. Virginia posted the largest increase, followed by New Mexico and California. 
More than 20 governors have prematurely ended federal unemployment programs -- including an extra $300 weekly payment -- put into place during the pandemic, hoping that removing the enhanced payments would incentivize workers to look for jobs. Lawsuits in some of those states challenging the governors’ legal authority to end the aid could restore the halted benefits until they officially expire in early September. 
The initial claim figures coincide with the survey week for the Labor Department’s monthly job report.
Continuing claims in all programs declined to 11.7 million in the week ended July 31. That compares to a high of about 32.8 million in June 2020.

The median forecast from a poll of 12 economists expects export orders to jump 20.85% from the year-ago period. Forecasts for growth ranged from 14% to 30%.
Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asia's exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.
The island's June export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, leapt 31.1% year-on-year to $53.73 billion.

Taiwan's manufacturers, such as the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, are a key part of the global supply chain for technology giants including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The data for July will be released on Friday.

The jobless rate declined to 4.6% in July, compared with economists forecasts for a rise to 5%, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed Thursday. The economy added 2,200 positions, versus a forecast 43,100 drop, while the participation rate fell to 66%.
“The labor market changes in New South Wales between June and July had a large influence on the national figures,” Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS, said in a statement. “There were big falls in New South Wales in both employment and unemployment, with the labor force reducing by around 64,000 people. In addition, hours worked in New South Wales fell by 7%.”
The Australian dollar edged lower and was trading at 72.17 U.S. cents at 12:06 p.m. in Sydney. 
The resilience is unlikely to last as coronavirus outbreaks have emerged all along the east coast, forcing lockdowns and curtailing activity in Australia’s most populous region. Even so, the Reserve Bank plans to push ahead with its tapering of bond buying next month, wagering the economy will roar back from an expected contraction this quarter.
“Businesses in the travel, hospitality and retail sectors are particularly exposed to domestic travel restrictions, which will weigh on employment in the months to come,” said Sarah Hunter, chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics. “Overall, employment and GDP are set to record a substantial contraction in the September quarter, and momentum will not return until the government’s vaccination targets are reached and restrictions can be materially eased.”
A slow nationwide vaccine rollout is Australia’s biggest obstacle to getting the economy back to normal and reopening borders that were closed in early 2020. 
At one point in July, half of Australia’s population was under stay-at-home orders as South Australia joined Victoria and New South Wales in lockdown down.

729,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 07:55PM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - Nearly all small British manufacturers are struggling with rising costs, according to a survey on Thursday that showed widespread worries over recruitment and logistics caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit.
Business support groups South West Manufacturing Advisory Service (SWMAS) and Manufacturing Growth Programme said rising supply chain prices had presented difficulties for 96% of respondents. Some 55% described the problem as ""major"".
Global shipping problems, tight supplies of semiconductors and shortages of some goods such as motor vehicles have contributed to rising inflation in many countries.
Thursday's survey suggested the problems were hurting margins among small manufacturers. The proportion expecting profits to rise in the next six month fell to 46% from 52% at the start of this year.
Around half of the firms surveyed said recruitment and transport problems were hindering growth for manufacturers who account for about 10% of British economic output.
""It appears we are seeing the first signs of supply chain struggles starting to hinder the upturn,"" said Nick Golding, managing director of SWMAS.
""The challenges highlighted have been caused in part by government policies as a direct result of Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Official data published on Wednesday showed signs of continued inflation pressure in prices paid and charged by factories. Output costs rose in annual terms by the most in nearly 10 years.
Thursday's survey of 260 small and medium-sized British manufacturers was conducted last month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers hit a more than three-and-half-year high in August and service-sector sentiment turned positive, the Reuters Tankan poll showed, suggesting the economy was shaking off the drag from the COVID-19 slump.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey, found that manufacturers' mood would slip a little while staying buoyant in three months and service-sector sentiment would recover further.
The poll follows a gross domestic product report this week that showed the world's third-largest economy grew an annualised 1.3% in April-June, thanks to brisk exports and stronger-than-expected consumption.
In the Reuters poll of 503 big and medium-sized companies, in which 252 firms responded on condition of anonymity, managers expressed optimism over a demand recovery to pre-coronavirus levels, due to strong overseas orders for products such as high-tech goods.
""The semiconductor market is booming and demand for related materials is strong,"" a manager at a ceramics maker wrote in the poll, adding its industrial products and car parts businesses were benefiting from it.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 33 from 25 in July, its highest since January 2018, the poll conducted Aug. 4-16 showed. The service index rose to 5 from minus 3 the previous month, its highest since February last year. 
Some managers, however, worried about uncertainty from the virus and the impact of rising raw material costs and a prolonged state of emergency in parts of Japan that now covers nearly 60% of the population.
""Raw material prices are rising worldwide and there is uncertainty over the outlook,"" a manager at a chemical maker wrote in the survey.
The Reuters Tankan poll showed manufacturers' business confidence was seen falling to 31 in November, while that of service-sector firms was expected to rise to 13.
""Conditions aren't bad considering the coronavirus, but they aren't at a level that should have been expected either,"" a manager at a food maker said.

The BOJ's own ""tankan"" business survey released in July showed business confidence improved to a two-and-half-year high, while service-sector sentiment turned positive for the first time in five quarters.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.

The reading is a preliminary estimate of the BLS' annual ""benchmark"" revision to the closely watched payrolls data. The leisure and hospitality sector, which was hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, accounted for the bulk of the revision, with employment growth revised down by 597,000 or 4.6%.
Leisure and hospitality employment is 1.7 million below its peak in February 2020, though the industry has led the labor market recovery from the pandemic.
""It is somewhat ambiguous what this means for future employment in this sector beyond March 2021,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
""This could suggest that more jobs need to be added to return closer to pre-pandemic levels but also that the pandemic-related hit to that sector was more severe and or longer-lasting than previously reported.""
But the transportation and warehousing sector added 247,900 more jobs than previously thought, while professional and business services payrolls were revised up by 214,000. Government employment was raised by 255,000 jobs. 

Once a year, the BLS compares its non-farm payrolls data, based on monthly surveys of a sample of employers, with a much more complete database of unemployment insurance tax records.
A final benchmark revision will be released in February along with the BLS' report on employment for January. Government statisticians will use the final benchmark count to revise payroll data for months both prior to and after March.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell more than expected in July, the latest sign that surging construction costs and home prices continued to constrain the housing market early in the third quarter.
Though the report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed a rebound in building permits after three straight monthly declines, the gain was in the volatile multi-family home segment, which will do little to ease an acute housing shortage that is driving up prices.
The number of houses authorized for construction but not yet started last month was the third highest on record, indicating builders remained hesitant to undertake new projects.
""There is no question that home building has hit some sort of near-term ceiling, with surging home prices reducing affordability and leading to a record drop in the proportion of consumers that feel now is a good time to buy a home,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Housing starts dropped 7.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.534 million units last month. Data for June was revised up to a rate of 1.650 million units from the previously reported 1.643 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would fall to a rate of 1.600 million units. 
Homebuilding fell in the Northeast, Midwest and West, but rose in the populous South. Starts increased 2.5% on a year-on-year basis in July. Single-family starts, which account for the largest share of the housing market, fell 4.5% to a rate of 1.111 million units. Starts for the multi-family segment tumbled 13.1% to a rate of 423,000 units. 
Permits for future homebuilding rose 2.6% to a rate of 1.635 million units in July. Single-family permits fell 1.7% to a rate of 1.048 million units. They are lagging starts, suggesting a modest rebound in single-family homebuilding.
Permits for multi-family housing projects jumped 11.2% to a rate of 587,000 units, reflecting a rebound in demand for rental accommodation as the economy fully reopens.
The report followed on the heels of a survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Tuesday showing confidence among single-family homebuilders dropped to a 13-month low in August because of higher material costs and home prices, which are cooling demand for houses.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed in volatile trade. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
HIGH HOUSE PRICES   
Building costs remain an issue even though lumber futures have tumbled from a record high of $1,711 per thousand board feet in May. Land and labor shortages persist.
Homebuilding has struggled to gain traction since racing to a rate of 1.725 million units in March, which was the highest level since June 2006. 
Housing demand boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which fueled a migration from cities to the suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans sought spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling. The robust demand, also driven by record-low mortgage rates, far outpaced supply. 
The inventory of previously owned homes is near record lows, leading to double-digit annual growth in home prices. 
But the pandemic tailwind is gradually fading as vaccinations allow companies to recall workers back to offices in city centers and schools reopen for in-person learning for the new academic year. 
Potential homebuyers are also balking at the high house prices. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home decreased last week.
Residential investment contracted in the second quarter after three straight quarters of double-digit growth. A modest rebound is expected in the third quarter.
Last month, building permits fell in the Northeast and South. They rose in the West and Midwest. 
The backlog of homes yet to be started increased 2.6% to 241,000 units, the third-highest reading in the series' history, which should help to keep housing starts supported.
""Some of these permitted units that haven't been started will be canceled, but most will eventually show up as starts as homebuilders work through their pipeline of homes under construction, supply chain bottlenecks are resolved, and prices of critical inputs such as lumber come off the boil,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Housing completions jumped 5.6% to a rate of 1.391 million units last month. Single-family home completions increased 3.6% to a rate of 954,000 units. The pandemic has lengthened the time from when a permit is issued for single-family home construction to completion, which economists blamed on supply constraints.
Realtors estimate that single-family housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap.

The stock of housing under construction climbed 0.4% to a rate of 1.373 million units last month.
""Solid housing demand and low inventory will incentivize homebuilders and support housing starts, but higher input and labor costs will temper activity,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We expect a modest pickup in housing starts in third quarter in the wake of last quarter's 2% decline.""

(Reuters) - Mortgage applications declined last week, especially for refinancing, as mortgage rates rose back over 3% for the first time in about a month.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages inched up to 3.06% from 2.99% in the week ending Aug. 13. The seasonally adjusted market index tracking mortgage applications fell 3.9% from a week earlier, reflecting a 5.3% decrease in applications to refinance existing loans. 
After hitting record lows late last year below 2.9%, mortgage rates climbed in the first part of this year and peaked in the spring. Rates had been drifting lower since, held down in large part by the U.S. Federal Reserve's extraordinary stimulus measures aimed at helping the economy rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, but ticked higher last week after data showed a hiring surge last month.

""Mortgage rates followed an overall increase in Treasury yields last week, which started higher from the strong July jobs report before slowing because of weaker consumer sentiment and concerns about rising COVID-19 cases,"" said Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting. ""The eligible pool of homeowners who stand to benefit from a refinance is smaller now.""
Purchase applications declined 0.8%, the MBA said.

734,"<span>Aug 18, 2021 05:40AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices rose in June at the fastest annual rate since 2004 as the market surged ahead of a phasing out of a tax break on property purchases, official data showed on Wednesday.
House prices were 13.2% higher than in June 2020, the Office for National Statistics said, following a 9.8% annual increase in May.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak cut stamp duty, a tax on house purchases, in July 2020. But from last month it started to return to its pre-pandemic level.
The tax cut aimed to reverse a slump in property sales at the start of the pandemic, and helped fuel a surge in property prices and some new construction. Many households were already seeking more spacious housing suited to working from home.
""Prices went berserk as the stamp duty taper closed in,"" said Lucy Pendleton from London-based estate agent James Pendleton.

More timely gauges of the housing market suggest the market has cooled a little since June - but only a little.
At the top end of the scale, house prices in the north west of England rose in June by 18.6% in annual terms, the ONS said. London stood at the bottom end but house prices there were still up 6.3%.

LONDON (Reuters) -British inflation fell to the Bank of England's 2% target last month in an unexpectedly sharp slowdown that economists said was most likely a blip as the reopening of the economy after lockdown drives prices higher.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected Wednesday's official data to show a 2.3% rise in consumer prices in July following a 2.5% rise in June.
Sterling showed little reaction to the figures as investors judged they were unlikely to alter the rising trend for inflation and would not sway Bank of England policymakers much.
Earlier this month the BoE said it expected to tighten monetary policy moderately over the next three years. 
July's slowdown in inflation reflected a jump in prices in the same month last year when Britain's economy was emerging from its first coronavirus lockdown.
Prices of clothing and footwear and computers, games and toys also dragged on the rate of price growth last month, the Office for National Statistics said.
""The fall in year-on-year inflation last month masks the strength of inflationary pressures currently within the UK economy,"" Yael  Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said.
Earlier this month the BoE said it expected inflation to jump to 4.0% around the end of the year, which would be a decade high. But the BoE stuck to its view that the acceleration of inflation would prove to be temporary.
""We see inflation falling back to around 2% at the end of next year as production facilities expand, requiring only minimal tightening by the Bank of England in the short term,"" Selfin said.
As in earlier months, Wednesday's figures showed second-hand cars were a big driver of inflation in July - a phenomenon also seen in the United States.
Global shipping problems, tight supplies of semiconductors and shortages of some goods such as motor vehicles have contributed to rising inflation in many countries.

The ONS data showed signs of continued inflation pressure in prices paid and charged by factories.
Output costs rose in annual terms by the most in nearly 10 years, increasing by 4.9% compared with July last year. Input costs also rose by more than expected, jumping by almost 10%.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports marked a fifth straight month of double-digit growth in July, driven by U.S.-bound shipments of automobiles in a positive sign for a trade-led economy, although a key gauge of capital spending fell for the first time in four months.
The mixed batch of indicators underscored fragility in the world's third-largest economy, which grew 1.3% in the April-June quarter due to solid exports and a surprise gain in private consumption.
However, prolonged coronavirus curbs on bars, restaurants and other face-to-face service sector businesses cloud the outlook, piling pressure on Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to deploy another big stimulus package.
Ministry of Finance data out on Wednesday showed Japanese exports grew 37.0% year-on-year in July, a tad slower than a 39.0% increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll, although the gain was exaggerated by the contrast to the prior year's COVID-induced slump.
It followed a 48.6% growth in the prior month.
""Exports remained in an uptrend, which will continue in the coming months even though car production may face supply constraint due to chip shortages,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""Although the service sector may take a hit from a prolonged COVID pandemic, corporate capital spending and output will stay on firm footing,"" he said.
Still, Suga may roll out stimulus package of around 30 trillion yen ($274 billion), which will be used as a show of political will to back the economy at the time of the elections, Maruyama added.
By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 18.9% in the year to July, led by chip-making equipment and plastic, the data showed.
U.S.-bound shipments, another key market for Japanese goods, grew 26.8% in July led by exports of cars, car parts and motors, it showed.
Imports rose 28.5% in the year to July, versus the median estimate for a 35.1% increase, bringing the trade balance to a surplus of 441 billion yen ($4 billion), compared with the median estimate for a 202.3 billion yen surplus.
Brisk external demand has helped underpin Japan's factory activity although a global chip shortage and signs of stalling in China's economic recovery are sources of concern.
Separate data by the Cabinet Office showed core machinery orders, a highly volatile indicator of capital spending for the coming six to nine months, fell 1.5% in June from the previous month, versus a 2.8% decline expected by economists in a Reuters poll.

Year-on-year, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electricity utilities, jumped 18.6% in June, a third straight month of annual gain, prompting the Cabinet Office to maintain its view machinery orders are showing signs of pick-up.

(Reuters) -U.S. homebuilder confidence in the market for single-family homes fell in August to its lowest reading in 13 months, driven by higher construction costs and supply shortages, a report released on Tuesday showed.
The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index declined 5 points to a reading of 75 this month, its lowest level since July 2020, from 80 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index to remain unchanged from the month prior. 
A reading above 50 means more builders view market conditions as favorable than poor. The index hit an all-time high of 90 in November 2020.
Surging home prices and limited supply has put a lid on home sales throughout this year. Consequently, fewer U.S. consumers believe that now is a good time to purchase a home.
""Some prospective buyers are experiencing sticker shock due to higher construction costs,"" said NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke. ""While the demographics and interest for home buying remain solid, higher costs and material access issues have resulted in lower levels of home building and even put a hold on some new home sales.""
The NAHB survey's measure of single-family home sales expectations in the next six months held steady at a reading of 81 in August, while a gauge of current sales conditions decreased 5 points to 81.
The prospective buyers index fell 5 points to 60.
""Many of the constraints exacerbated by Covid, including high materials prices, a limited supply of workers and limited land plots for construction, will continue dragging on homebuilder activity heading into the autumn,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. ""For instance, while lumber prices have come down, plenty of raw materials are still very expensive.""
The report also revealed some regional divergences that may indicate an impact from the surge in the Delta variant of the coronavirus, with most of the report's softness concentrated in the South and Midwest where caseloads have been rising the fastest.

NAHB's Midwest index dropped to its lowest reading since June 2020, while its gauge tracking the South declined to its lowest level since July 2020. That contrasted with the West region, which ticked up 1 point, and the Northeast, which rose to a 4-month high.
""I think the surge in Covid cases in those regions might have contributed to the decline in prospective buyer traffic, helping to drag down the overall index,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics. Still, ""I think any impact from the virus was probably at the margin and that higher home prices, which are making homebuying unaffordable for many, played a bigger role.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in July as shortages depressed motor vehicle purchases and the boost to spending from the economy's reopening and stimulus checks faded, suggesting a slowdown in economic growth early in the third quarter.
The weak sales reported by the Commerce Department on Tuesday also reflected a rotation in spending back to services from goods. Retail sales mostly capture the goods component of consumer spending, which accounts for a smaller share, with bulky services such as healthcare, travel and hotel accommodation making up the rest.
The school year gets into full swing later in August and most education districts are reverting to in-person learning. As such, consumer spending is likely to remain strong and keep the economy growing, though rising COVID-19 cases and a plunge in consumer sentiment this month to a decade low are wild cards.
""If anything, today's data suggests that spending is not keeping pace at the start of the third quarter after the fiscal stimulus-fueled and re-opening-led surge in consumption growth in second quarter,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut. 
""We still expect sales to bounce back for the quarter as a whole. Spending will benefit from recent strength in job gains and a boost from back-to-school spending as kids begin to return to in-school classrooms.""
Retail sales dropped 1.1% last month. Data for June was revised up to show retail sales increasing 0.7% instead of rising 0.6% as previously reported. Retail sales are 17.2% above their pre-pandemic level.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales slipping 0.3%. Sales increased 15.8% compared to July last year. 
Receipts at auto dealerships fell 3.9% after declining 2.2% in June. Motor vehicle production has been hampered by a global shortage of semiconductors. 
There was some encouraging news, with a separate report from the Federal Reserve on Tuesday showing motor vehicle output surged 11.2% in July as automakers either pared or canceled annual retooling shutdowns to work around the chip shortage. That boosted manufacturing production last month. 
Online retail sales dropped 3.1%, payback after Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) pulled forward its Prime Day to June from July. Sales at clothing stores fell 2.6%. A rebound is expected as parents shop for the new school year. Qualifying households in mid-July started receiving money under the expanded Child Tax Credit program, which will run through December.
Sales at building material stores fell as did receipts at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. 
But consumers increased spending at restaurants and bars, leading to a 1.7% rise in receipts. Sales at restaurants and bars increased 38.4% compared to July 2020. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report.
Sales at electronics and appliance stores gained 0.3%.
The National Retail Federation said July's decline did ""nothing to derail our outlook for a record year,"" noting that consumer finances were in good shape. The labor market is strengthening, while higher stock and house prices are boosting household wealth. 
Stocks on Wall Street slipped after the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow industrials closed at record highs on Monday. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.

DELTA VARIANT WILD CARD
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales fell 1.0% last month after an upwardly revised 1.4% increase in June. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have accelerated 1.1% in June.
Spending is shifting from goods to services like travel and entertainment, with more than 50% of the United States' population fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
Rising infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus could, however, slow the services spending boom.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in late July urged fully vaccinated Americans to resume wearing masks in indoor public places in areas where the virus is surging.
""We've long held the view that discretionary services would lift overall consumer spending this year as the economy trended back to some semblance of normal,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""But now with the resurgence of COVID, those gains may be more tepid."" 
Still, the foundation for consumer spending growth remains strong. Employers are raising wages as they try to fill a record 10.1 million job openings. Households are sitting on at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, notched double-digit growth in the second quarter, helping to pull the level of GDP above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.

The economy grew at a 6.5% annualized rate in the second quarter. The anticipated slowdown in consumer spending was likely to be offset by strong growth elsewhere. With the latest data in hand, including reports from the Treasury and Labor Department, the Atlanta Fed raised its GDP growth estimate for the third quarter to a 6.2% rate from a 6.0% pace.
""A slower pace of consumer spending in the months ahead could act to dampen overall growth, but likely only modestly so,"" said Ben Ayers, a senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.

Business inventories rose 0.8% after advancing 0.6% in May, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. June's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
Inventories increased 6.6% on a year-on-year basis in June.
Retail inventories gained 0.3% in June as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.9% drop in May.
Motor vehicle inventories decreased 0.3% as estimated last month. A global semiconductor shortage is undercutting auto production, leading to stocks being run down and holding back retail sales.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.5%, instead of 0.6% as estimated last month.
Business inventories were depleted at a rapid clip in the second quarter amid booming domestic demand fueled by massive fiscal stimulus and the economy's reopening following disruptions early in the COVID-19 pandemic.
The government reported last month that consumer spending picked up in the second quarter, with outlays on goods rising solidly, even as demand rotates back to services because of COVID-19 vaccinations. The double-digit growth in consumer spending last quarter helped to lift the level of GDP above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Inventory rebuilding is expected to underpin economic growth in the second half of the year.
Wholesale inventories increased 1.1% in June. Stocks at manufacturers advanced 1.0%.
Business sales increased 1.4% in June after falling 0.2% in May. At June's sales pace, it would take 1.25 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.26 months in May.

Manufacturing output jumped 1.4% last month after falling 0.3% in June, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing production rising 0.6%.
Last month, production at auto plants soared 11.2%. The shortage of semiconductors has forced auto companies to adjust their production schedules. The Fed noted that ""a number of vehicle manufacturers trimmed or canceled their typical July shutdowns,"" when they retool their plants.
Despite the surge, production of motor vehicles and parts in July was about 3.5% below its recent peak in January 2021, the Fed said. 
Excluding autos, manufacturing output rose 0.7% in July. Overall manufacturing in July was 0.8% above its pre-pandemic level. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, is being underpinned by strong domestic demand. But that is straining the supply chain, leaving manufacturers struggling with shortages of raw materials and labor. 
The situation could be worsened by the resurgence in COVID-19 infections from the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
The increase in manufacturing output and a 1.2% rise in mining combined to boost industrial production by 0.9% last month. Industrial output rose 0.2% in June. Mining was driven by higher oil prices, which are supporting drilling activity. Utilities output fell 2.1%.

Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, increased 1.1 percentage points to 76.6% in July. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector rose 0.7 percentage point to 76.1%. It is 3.5 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.
Officials at the U.S. central bank tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

The survey’s headline business activity index fell to 27.8 in August from 41.7 in July, moving away from record-setting pace of growth seen over the past few months. 

While still optimistic, business owners were less positive about future conditions than they were in recent months, according to the survey of firms in New York, northern New Jersey and southwestern Connecticut. 
More than half of respondents said they expect employment to increase in the coming months and the index for future employment held near its record high. The survey was conducted between August 2 and August 9.

742,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. retail sales fell in July by more than forecast, consistent with a steady shift in spending toward services and indicating consumers may be growing more price conscious as inflation picks up.
The value of overall retail purchases dropped 1.1% last month following a upwardly revised 0.7% increase in June, Commerce Department figures showed Tuesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.3% decrease. Excluding autos, sales decreased 0.4% in July.
The data suggest that consumers are beginning to curb spending on merchandise in favor of services now that many pandemic-related restrictions have been lifted. At the same time, the emergence of the delta variant poses a risk to economic activity and could curb demand for services like travel and entertainment.
Higher prices for things like groceries, meals out, personal care and apparel risk limiting discretionary spending in the coming months. A report last week from the University of Michigan showed buying conditions deteriorated to the lowest since April of last year as inflation remained elevated. The retail sales data are not adjusted for price changes.
Economists forecast consumer spending to grow at an annualized 4.5% pace in the current period, significantly slower than the pace estimated a month ago and a sharp deceleration from the sizzling 11.8% rate seen in the second quarter.
This week includes earnings reports from many retailers, including  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) and Macy’s Inc. Earlier Tuesday, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. posted stronger-than-expected comparable sales and the retail giant boosted its full-year outlook.
Results from  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD)., however, showed weaker-than-expected results that signal a cooling in the home-improvement boom.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The euro zone economy grew 2% in the second quarter, the European Union statistics office said on Tuesday, confirming its earlier reading as the easing of coronavirus restrictions spurred economic activity after a brief recession.
In a separate release Eurostat also said that employment in the 19-nation bloc grew 0.5% in the April-June period compared to the previous quarter, in line with forecasts of economists polled by Reuters.
The healthy 2% increase in gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the previous quarter was paired with a 13.6% rise from the same period last year, when the euro zone economy suffered the worst phase of the pandemic.
The annual GDP reading was slightly revised downward from Eurostat's earlier estimate of 13.7% growth, released at the end of July.
The quarter-on-quarter growth followed two quarters of GDP decline with the euro zone economy shrinking by 0.6% in the last quarter of 2020 and by 0.3% in January-March.
The GDP growth fuelled a rise in employment in April-June, with the indicator increasing 0.5% on the quarter and 1.8% on the year. The annual growth was above forecasts of a 1.5% rebound after a series of falls.
Strong growth is expected to continue in the third quarter, said Jessica Hinds of research firm Capital Economics, forecasting a limited fallout on the euro zone economy from the spread of the more contagious Delta variant of the new coronavirus.
HOUSEHOLD SPENDING
Despite the robust rebound in the second quarter, the euro zone economy remains some 3% smaller than it was at the end of 2019, unlike the U.S. and Chinese economies, which have pulled above their pre-pandemic peaks.
Among the euro zone's largest economies, Spain and Italy posted the largest GDP rises, growing respectively by 2.8% and 2.7% on the quarter, Eurostat data showed, confirming its previous reading.
Italy, which was among the euro zone's worst hit countries last year, grew also in the first quarter of 2021, when the bloc's GDP fell.
Germany and France recorded more moderate GDP increases, respectively of 1.5% and 0.9% on the quarter.
A third final release of GDP figures for the second quarter will be issued by Eurostat on Sept 7. That reading will include a breakdown by economic sectors. 
Available data from euro zone countries show that household spending was a major driver of growth in the second quarter, with figures released on Tuesday by the Netherlands indicating a nearly 6% jump in consumer spending there as bars and restaurants were allowed to gradually reopen from March after a six-month lockdown.
Trade is also contributing to the economic expansion. In June euro zone exports of goods outside the bloc rose by more than 20% on the year to nearly 210 billion euros ($247 billion), Eurostat said last week.

Industry output has instead fallen both in June and May on the month, more than offseting a production rise in April, Eurostat data showed.

LONDON (Reuters) -The number of employees on British company payrolls has moved closer to pre-pandemic levels and pay growth hit a record high, albeit distorted by the effects of coronavirus lockdowns, official data showed on Tuesday.
As Britain's economy extends its recovery from last year's slump, payrolls https://tmsnrt.rs/3xWIyjQ rose by 182,000 in July to 28.9 million - 201,000 below the level before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
The Office for National Statistics also said the headline unemployment rate fell to 4.7% in the three months to June, its lowest since the three months to August 2020. 
Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected the unemployment rate to hold at 4.8%.
The figures are likely to bolster Bank of England officials' confidence that the economy will emerge from the pandemic with less long-term damage than first feared by many forecasters.
""Overall, today's report once again points to a rapidly firming labour market,"" said Investec economist Ellie Henderson.
""However, with the latest data indicating that 1.9 million people were still in furloughed employment in June, the real test will be how the labour market responds to the ending of the furlough scheme in September,"" she said, referring to the government's job-retention scheme. 
On the strength of Tuesday's labour market report, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) brought forward its forecast for the first BoE interest rate increase by six months to the second quarter of 2022 - broadly in line with expectations in financial markets. 
A Reuters poll of economists published on Monday suggested the BoE would wait until 2023, despite the bounce-back in the economy. [ECILT/GB]
The ONS said hours worked in a week surpassed the 1 billion mark for the first time since the pandemic began and there was no sign of a surge in redundancies before the expiry of the furlough programme at the end of September. At its peak, in May 2020, the scheme paid the wages on 8.9 million jobs.
""I know there could still be bumps in the road but the data is promising,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said. 
The BoE believes unemployment has probably peaked and no longer expects a jump when the furlough scheme ends.
Vacancies in the three months to July hit a record high of 953,000, up by 168,000 on their pre-pandemic level, the ONS said. Many employers have said they are struggling to find staff as the economy emerges from lockdowns.
PAY POWERS HIGHER
The ONS said average weekly earnings in the three months to the end of June rose by 8.8% compared with a year earlier - the highest reading since records started 20 years ago but skewed upwards by the effects of the pandemic.
More people on low wages lost their jobs than people who are better paid.
The average weekly earning figures for the May-July period, due to be published next month, are used in the ""triple lock"" process for deciding the increase in the value of state pensions. 
Sunak has suggested he will not automatically follow that process this year.
Underlying total pay could be rising at between 4.9% and 6.3% a year, the ONS said, noting uncertainties about how the estimates were reached.

Samuel Tombs, an economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he thought pay growth was likely to lose momentum after the end of the furlough programme.
""As such, there is enough slack in the labour market to prevent wage growth concerning the (Bank of England),"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries in June climbed to their highest since February 2020, Treasury Department data showed on Monday, in what analysts described as broad-based demand that helped drive yields lower for the month.
Major foreign holders held $7.202 trillion in Treasuries, up from $7.135 trillion in May. Foreign holdings of Treasuries in June were the second largest on record. The month also saw about $67 billion in Treasury purchases, the largest monthly increase in a year.
""Some of the biggest additions to foreign Treasury holdings were in custodian countries such as Ireland, Cayman Islands, and Luxembourg, which tells me that buying was pretty broad-based,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rates strategist, at TD Securities in New York.
""This is consistent with the rally in Treasuries during the month. You obviously had buying in May and June, but it looks like in June, it had the effect of driving rates lower,"" he added. 
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields started June with a yield of 1.6062%, falling 14 basis points to 1.4680% by the end of that month. 
Japan remains the largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries with holdings of $1.277 trillion in June, from $1.266 trillion the previous month.
China's holdings, on the other hand, declined to $1.061 trillion in June, from $1.078 trillion in May. China's June holdings were the lowest since October 2020.
On a transaction basis, foreigners bought $10.86 billion in Treasuries, after selling $93.36 billion in May, data showed. U.S. Treasury outflows in May were the largest since April 2020. 
In March this year, Treasuries showed record inflows of $118.87 billion.
Data also showed U.S. corporate bonds had inflows for a sixth straight month with $13.835 billion in June, from $17.31 billion in May.

Foreign investors, meanwhile, bought $25.2 billion in U.S. equities in June after selling $2.4 billion in May. 
Overall, net foreign acquisitions of U.S. long-term and short-term securities, including banking flows, showed a net inflow of $31.5 billion in June, from $98.2 billion in May.

(Reuters) -The New York Federal Reserve said on Monday its barometer of manufacturing business activity in New York State declined more than expected in August as shipments growth nearly stalled and new orders grew at a much softer pace than a month earlier.
The regional Fed's ""Empire State"" index on current business conditions fell around 25 points to 18.3, lower than a reading of 29.0 forecast by analysts polled by Reuters. The index had hit a record high of 43 in July.
A reading above zero signals the New York manufacturing sector is expanding.
Supply constraints have continued to slow manufacturing activity nationwide, indicating that the economic recovery might be cooling off in a year in which growth is projected to accelerate at its fastest pace in almost four decades.
The headline index was lower than all but one of the 30 estimates in the Reuters forecast, and the 24.7 point drop was the largest since April 2020, early on in the pandemic.
""We expect constraints on pandemic-stricken supply chains and labor markets to ease gradually in the coming months, but these headwinds risk staying strong as the Delta variant spreads rapidly,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. 
New York's manufacturing firms were optimistic, however. The survey's six-month outlook gauge rose seven points to 46.5. 

The indexes for future new orders and shipments rose to similar levels. 
""Looking ahead, solid goods demand, rising business investment, and revitalizing growth overseas will keep manufacturing’s gears churning healthily into 2022,"" Klachkin said.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory output and retail sales growth slowed sharply and missed expectations in July, as new COVID-19 outbreaks and floods disrupted business operations, adding to signs the economic recovery is losing momentum.
Industrial production in the world's second largest economy increased 6.4% year-on-year in July, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday. Analysts had expected output to rise 7.8% after growing 8.3% in June.
Retail sales increased 8.5% in July from a year ago, far lower than the forecast 11.5% rise and June's 12.1% uptick.
China's economy has rebounded to its pre-pandemic growth levels, but the expansion is losing steam as businesses grapple with higher costs and supply bottlenecks. New COVID-19 infections in July also led to fresh restrictions, disrupting the country's factory output already hit by severe weather this summer.
Asian share markets slipped on Monday after the data showed a surprisingly sharp slowdown in the engine of global growth.
Data earlier this month also showed export growth, which has been a key driver of China's impressive rebound from the COVID-19 slump in early 2020, unexpectedly slowed in July.
Consumption, industrial production and investment could all slow further in August, analysts from Nomura said in a note, due to COVID-19 controls and tightening measures in the property sector and high-polluting industries.
Production controls sent crude steel output to the lowest monthly level since April 2020 in July.
Meanwhile China tightened social restrictions to fight its latest COVID-19 outbreak in several cities, hitting the services sector, especially travel and hospitality in the country.
""Given China's 'zero tolerance' approach to Covid, future outbreaks will continue to pose significant risk to the outlook, even though around 60% of the population is now vaccinated,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, in a note.
The country has also faced severe weather in several provinces, with record rainfall in Henan province last month causing floods that killed more than 300 people.
Higher commodity prices are also pressuring small and medium-sized firms in particular. Smaller companies are unable to pass on recent rises in raw material costs to buyers, said a sales manager at a medical equipment factory in the eastern province of Jiangsu.
""We don't dare to increase our prices...but our prices cannot fall, otherwise there will be no profit at all,"" he said.
China's producer price inflation, which grew 9.0% from a year earlier in July, will likely remain high for some time, the NBS said on Monday.
GROWTH OUTLOOK
A growing number of analysts have been cutting their third quarter growth estimates for China. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 7.9% in the April-June quarter from a year earlier.
ANZ downgraded its GDP forecast for 2021 to 8.3% from 8.8% after the disappointing July data.
""Although they are unlikely to inject massive stimulus to boost headline growth, the central bank will maintain an easing bias,"" said ANZ analysts in a note. 
After the central bank reduced the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves in July, many analysts expect another cut later this year to support growth.
China's central bank injected billions of yuan through medium-term loans into the financial system on Monday, which many market participants interpreted as an effort to prop up the economy, although the cost of such borrowing was left unchanged.
Policy insiders told Reuters earlier in August that China is poised to quicken spending on infrastructure projects while the central bank supports the economy with modest easing steps.
Fixed asset investment grew 10.3% in January-July from the same period a year ago, compared with an 11.3% rise tipped by a Reuters poll and a 12.6% increase in January-June.

Property investment, a crucial growth driver of China's recovery from COVID-19 disruptions, grew 12.7% in January-July, versus a 15% rise in the first half of this year.
China's new home prices rose at the slowest clip in six months in July, as authorities further tightened rules in the red-hot property sector.

Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.3% in July from a month earlier, slowing from a 0.5% gain in June, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
Separate data showed property investment also rose at a slower pace in January-July from a year earlier, amid tightened financing rules.
China's property market rebounded quickly from the COVID-19 crisis last year, triggering concerns about financial risks in an overheated market.
That has prompted authorities to step up curbs this year, including restrictions on borrowing by developers, caps on banks' lending to the sector, guiding banks to raise mortgage rates and a crackdown on illegal funding in the market.
""In most cities, both newly built and resale homes have seen a clear slowdown in price growth,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with property agency Centaline.
""The housing price growth is expected to continue to soften, as the credit policy returns to normal (from easy to tight),"" Zhang said.
Last month, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party repeated an earlier government warning that ""homes are for living in, not for speculation"".
Authorities in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen earlier this month said that 2.155 billion yuan ($332.46 million) of loans meant for business use had been unlawfully used for home purchases.
Price growth in China's biggest cities such as Shanghai and Beijing eased in July to 0.4% from June's 0.7% growth, the NBS said.
In Beijing, which has China's most stringent property curbs, residents are not allowed to buy additional homes after owning two properties.
Centaline's Zhang said authorities had slapped a record 380 new curbs on the sector this year.
Prices in smaller tier-three cities rose 0.2% on-month, versus a 0.3% gain in June. Tier-two cities, which include some provincial capitals, gained 0.4%, slowing from June's 0.5% rise.
In August, Jinhua, a small city in eastern Zhejiang province, and Huizhou, in southern Guangdong province, took action after the housing ministry told them to strengthen controls.
The softening has spread with 51 cities reporting month-on-month gains in July, the smallest number since January and down from 55 in June.
Compared with a year earlier, China's new home prices grew 4.6% in July, down from a 4.7% increase in June.

Investing.com – China's factory output and retail sales grew at a slower pace in July, signaling that the economic recovery in the world's second-largest economy is losing momentum. Business operations were disrupted by the latest COVID-19 outbreak and adverse weather, which also contributed to the disappointing data.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day said industrial production rose 6.4% year-on-year in July, down from the 7.8% in forecasts prepared in Investing.com and the 8.3% growth recorded in June. Retail sales grew 8.5% year-on-year in the same month, also down from the 11.5% growth in Investing.com forecasts and June’s 12.1% growth.
Although China’s economy has recovered to pre-COVID-19 growth levels, businesses are facing higher costs and supply bottlenecks that are causing the growth to lose steam.
China's recovery also remains uneven due to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks and natural disasters, NBS spokesperson Fu Linghui said at a briefing earlier in the day.
The country tightened restrictive measures in several cities thanks to its latest COVID-19 outbreak, hitting the services sector, particularly travel and hospitality, hard.
“July’s data suggest the economy is losing steam very fast... the resurgence of delta also adds extra risk to August’s activities,” Australia and New Zealand Banking Group chief economist for Greater China Raymond Yeung told Reuters.
Severe weather in some provinces, with July's record rainfall in Henan province causing floods that killed more than 300 people, added to the country’s woes.
All this could impact the government’s growth target, currently set at a modest above-6% for 2021. However, the data could prompt investors to lower their growth forecasts for 2021, which currently stand at a median of 8.5%, according to Bloomberg.
The People’s Bank of China on Monday rolled over only CNY600 billion ($92.62 billion) of the CNY700 billion in one-year loans that matured, in a step to reduce liquidity. However, the rate on the loans remained unchanged at 2.95%."
750,"<span>Aug 15, 2021 10:27PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic activity slowed more than expected in July, with fresh virus outbreaks adding new risks to a recovery already hit by floods and faltering global demand.
All the main data missed forecasts: retail sales expanded 8.5% in July from a year earlier, lower than the 10.9% predicted by economists; industrial output increased 6.4% versus the median estimate of 7.9%; fixed-asset investment grew 10.3% in the first seven months of the year, compared with a forecast of 11.3%. The unemployment rate rose to 5.1%.
China’s most widespread virus outbreaks since last year are weighing on an economic recovery that was already starting to soften into the second half of the year. The new virus cases since mid-July have been linked to the fast-spreading delta variant, prompting yet another round of targeted lockdowns, travel curbs and mass testing across the country.
The government’s aggressive moves to achieve a goal of zero Covid-19 infections could prove economically costly as consumers cut back on spending and supply chains get disrupted. Financial institutions like  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc.,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) have already cut their growth projections for the third quarter and full year.
“July’s data suggest the economy is losing steam very fast,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. “The resurgence of delta also adds extra risk to August’s activities.”
On a two-year average basis, which strips out statistical distortions from last year’s pandemic shutdowns, the data show a notable slowdown across the board:
Consumption, especially of services, is taking a knock from the targeted lockdowns. Authorities rushed to close tourist sites, call off cultural events and cancel flights to contain the virus outbreaks since last month.
Factory production faced a number of other constraints in July, including disruptions from heavy rain and floods, a continued shortage of computer chips, faltering demand and environmental curbs.
“Given the continuously evolving global situation of the epidemic, the increasingly complex and severe external environment, and the combined impact of sporadic local outbreaks of Covid-19 and natural disasters on the economy of some regions, the economic recovery is still unstable and uneven,” the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement.
China‘s benchmark 10-year bond yield fell one basis point to 2.87% after earlier being about two basis points higher on the day. Futures contracts of the same tenor rose after the economic data release.
Adding to the economy’s woes are a slowdown in export growth, rising factory-gate prices and a real estate market that remains subdued given tighter restrictions on the property market. Local governments have also been slow to sell bonds this year, implying a moderate rollout of infrastructure spending.
The government has set a modest growth target of above 6% for this year. The slowdown may prompt economists to lower their growth forecasts for the year, which currently stand at a median of 8.5%, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Policy makers have signaled more targeted support for the economy as they look to cushion the recovery. At a Politburo meeting last month, where economic priorities for the second half of the year were laid out, top leaders pledged more steps to help struggling small businesses, a boost to fiscal spending and providing sufficient liquidity via monetary policy.
Economists now see the chance of more cuts to the reserve requirement ratio for banks in coming months after a surprise reduction in July. Some are even calling on the People’s Bank of China to lower interest rates, though the central bank said in its latest quarterly report that rates were at a “reasonable level” and vowed to avoid flooding the economy with stimulus.
On Monday, the central bank reduced liquidity by only rolling over 600 billion yuan ($92.7 billion) of the 700 billion yuan in 1-year loans that matured, while keeping the rate on the loans unchanged at 2.95%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy rebounded more than expected in the second quarter after slumping in the first three months of this year, data showed, a sign consumption and capital expenditure were recovering from the coronavirus pandemic's initial hit.
But many analysts expect growth to remain modest in the current quarter as state of emergency curbs reimposed to combat a spike in infections weigh on household spending.
The world's third-largest economy grew an annualised 1.3% in April-June after a revised 3.7% slump in the first quarter, preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) data showed on Monday, beating a median market forecast for a 0.7% gain.
Still, the rebound was much weaker than that of other advanced economies including the United States, which marked a 6.5% annualised expansion in the second quarter, highlighting the fallout from Tokyo's struggle in containing the pandemic.
""There's not much to be optimistic on the outlook with a spike in infections heightening the chance of stricter curbs on activity,"" said Yoshihiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Japan's economy stagnated in the first half of this year and there's a risk of a contraction in July-September. Any clear rebound in growth will have to wait until year-end,"" he said.
An unexpected rebound in April-June consumption also highlighted the dilemma the government faces, as citizens are becoming less responsive to voluntary, repeated stop-and-go requests to stay home.
""I have very mixed feelings about this GDP result. It shows that households' consumption appetite is very strong despite the state of emergency curbs,"" Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters after the data's release.
""Our priority is to prevent the spread of the virus. It's very bad for the economy for this situation to drag on.""
Consumption rose 0.8% in April-June from the previous quarter, confounding market forecasts for a 0.1% decline and rebounding from a 1.0% drop in January-March, the data showed.
Capital expenditure also increased 1.7% after falling 1.3% in the previous quarter. As a result, domestic demand contributed 0.6% point to GDP growth.
Exports rose 2.9% in April-June from the previous quarter in a sign the global recovery continued to underpin the world's third-largest economy.
""Private consumption grew unexpectedly and capital expenditure turned out to be firm. That said, the data left the impression that the economy's rebound from the first quarter slump was weak,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.

Japan's economy emerged from last year's initial blow from the pandemic thanks to robust exports, though slow vaccinations and repeated state of emergency curbs have hurt consumption.
A spike in Delta variant cases in Asia has caused supply chain disruptions for some Japanese manufacturers, which could weigh on factory output and add to gloom for an already fragile recovery.

LONDON (Reuters) - Asking prices for houses in Britain slipped over the past month for the first time this year, as the partial removal of a temporary cut to property purchase taxes took the edge off demand for larger homes, a survey showed on Monday.
Real estate website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said asking prices fell by 0.3% in its August survey after a 0.7% increase in July, dragged down by ""upper end"" houses of four bedrooms or more, which saw asking prices fall by 0.8% in July.
The August survey covered property first advertised on Rightmove between July 11 and Aug. 7.
The readings chimed with a report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors last week, which also suggested the reversal of property purchase tax cuts had started to affect an otherwise strong market.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak cut stamp duty, a tax on house purchases, in July 2020. But from last month it started to return to its pre-pandemic level.
The tax cut aimed to reverse a slump in property sales at the start of the pandemic, and helped fuel a surge in property prices and some new construction. Many households were already seeking more spacious housing suited to working from home.
""Our analysis shows that average prices have only fallen in the upper-end sector, which is usually more affected by seasonal factors such as the summer holidays and has also seen the greatest withdrawal of stamp duty incentives,"" said Tim Bannister, director of property data at Rightmove. 

He said buyer demand remained strong, with Rightmove predicting a renewed bounce in selling activity and asking prices during the coming months.
""We also anticipate that more property will come to market when those owners have more clarity over their employers' long-term balance of home and office working,"" Bannister said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British employers plan to increase staff numbers by the most in more than eight years over the coming months and few intend to make staff redundant when government furlough support ends next month, a survey showed on Monday.
The quarterly survey by Britain's Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD http://www.cipd.co.uk) added to signs of labour market shortages as the economy emerges from the coronavirus pandemic, though it offered less evidence of wage or inflation pressures
The CIPD said the net employment intentions balance - the difference in percentage points between employers who are hiring and those cutting staff - rose to +32 from +27 three months earlier, its highest since the survey began in early 2013.
""Employers are very optimistic, indicating strong recruitment intentions, and redundancy expectations appear much lower than originally predicted during the pandemic,"" Jonathan Boys, labour market economist at CIPD, said.
Only 13% of employers plan to make staff redundant, down from 33% a year ago when there were much greater fears that a premature end to government furlough support would create a spike in unemployment.
Earlier this month the Bank of England forecast that the unemployment rate would not rise beyond its current 4.8%, much lower than the peak of around 7.5% it saw earlier.
The CIPD survey also showed staff shortages, especially in the hospitality sector where many employers shed staff during the pandemic due to lengthy closures of hotels, pubs, restaurants and other venues.
But there was less sign that this was leading to big rises in wages, in contrast to some other surveys of recruiters and employers. The BoE has said it is keeping a close eye on wage pressures because of the potential longer-term inflation impact.
The CIPD survey showed that employers offered an average annual pay rise of 2% to staff this summer, unchanged from the spring and in line with pre-pandemic norms.

Raising pay was not generally seen as the solution to staff shortages either. Only 23% of employers with hard-to-fill vacancies said they would raise wages, compared with 44% who aimed to train existing staff to fill these roles.
The CIPD survey was based on online polling of 2,042 employers conducted by YouGov between June 16 and July 12.

(Reuters) -U.S. consumer sentiment dropped sharply in early August to its lowest level in a decade, in a worrying sign for the economy as Americans gave faltering outlooks on everything from personal finances to inflation and employment, a survey showed on Friday.
The unexpected reading could give Federal Reserve policymakers pause if it translates in the months ahead to a dent in economic activity. The central bank has been getting closer to a decision on when to begin pulling back the extraordinary stimulus it put in place to shield the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The University of Michigan said its preliminary consumer sentiment index fell to 70.2 in the first half of this month from a final reading of 81.2 in July. That was the lowest level since 2011, and there have been only two larger declines in the index over the past 50 years. Those were at the depths of the 2007-2009 recession and during the first wave of shutdowns in April 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic.
The losses were widespread across income, age, and education subgroups and spanned all regions. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would remain unchanged at 81.2.
U.S. stock market indexes slipped immediately after the report was released, while the price of gold gained ground. U.S. Treasury bond yields hit session lows.
""The renewed plunge suggests the latest wave of virus cases driven by the Delta variant could be a bigger drag on the economy than we had thought,"" said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics.
Economic growth is still expected to grow this year at its fastest pace in four decades after falling into a brief recession in 2020 caused by the coronavirus pandemic. But the recovery is showing some indication of cooling off.
COVID-19 cases have doubled in the past two weeks to reach a six-month peak as the more transmissible Delta variant spreads rapidly across the country. Labor shortages across the service sector also persist while supply chain disruptions have continued.
""The pandemic's resurgence due to the Delta variant has been met with a mixture of reason and emotion...mainly from dashed hopes that the pandemic would soon end,"" Richard Curtin, the survey director, said in a statement.
The survey's gauge of current economic conditions also declined to a reading of 77.9 from 84.5 in July while its measure of consumer expectations slid to 65.2 from 79.0 in July. 
The survey also showed consumers raising their expectations for medium term inflation, another measure the central bank is closely monitoring to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored. 

The survey's one-year inflation expectation edged lower to 4.6%, down from 4.7%, but its five-year inflation outlook ticked up to 3.0% from 2.8% in July.
Consumer price increases slowed in July, the Labor Department said on Wednesday, but inflation overall remained at a historically high level amid lingering supply-chain disruptions and stronger demand for travel-related services.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -European Union exports to Britain rose in June after a volatile start to the country's first year outside the single market, while the bloc's exports to the rest of the world dropped slightly in the same month.
The EU statistics office Eurostat said on Friday seasonally adjusted exports to Britain increased by 4.7% in June on the month, whereas imports from the UK were ""nearly unchanged"" and the bloc's exports to other countries dropped 0.6%.
The month-on-month rise in exports to Britain followed a plunge, surge and second drop earlier this year, which were also recorded in imports, as firms adapted to new trade requirements after Brexit. The EU's trade with the rest of the world has remained largely stable in the first half of the year.
Seasonally-adjusted exports to Britain remained below the levels of the last months of 2020 in June but were higher than June 2020 when COVID restrictions were stricter, Eurostat figures showed.
On the year, non adjusted figures showed that the 27-country bloc recorded a 22.3% increase in exports in June for a total volume of 188.3 billion euros ($221.1 billion), and a 29.6% rise in imports resulting in a trade surplus of 14.8 billion euros, down from 20 billion euros in June 2020.
The smaller euro zone, which comprises 19 of the 27 EU members, recorded a nearly 22% increase of exports and a rise of almost 17% in imports on the month which resulted in a 18.1 billion euros surplus in June from 7.5 billion euros in May. In June 2020, the euro zone surplus was 20 billion euros.
IMPORTS FROM BRITAIN
In the first half of the year, EU imports of goods from Britain were nearly 20% below their levels in the same period of 2020 and in June and May were also lower than volumes recorded at the end of last year, Eurostat data showed.
The figures were at odds with data released on Thursday by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) which showed British exports to the European Union in May and June exceeded their levels immediately before it left the single market at the start of this year, excluding volatile trade in precious metals.
The discrepancy is partly due to a change in the way Eurostat calculates trade with Britain after Brexit.
When Britain was still part of the EU's single market, all goods which moved from Britain to an EU member state were treated as British exports.
But since the start of the year, goods which had an origin outside Britain - China for example, are now treated as imports from that country, rather than from Britain.
""Statistics Eurostat publishes for 2021 are not on the same basis as statistics for previous years,"" the ONS said last month.
""The larger falls seen in the Eurostat data over this time period will reflect not only changes in trade, but also the fact that imports are being recorded as being from different countries than was previously the case,"" it added. 
Eurostat agreed with this interpretation of its data.

In the first half of this year, exports to Britain rose by 5.5% compared with the same period last year, leading to an EU trade surplus with the country of 69.6 billion euros in June, Eurostat said.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's economy will grow at its fastest pace in more than a decade in 2021, the statistics office said on Friday, upgrading its outlook on a strong rebound in exports for the tech heavyweight island.
The revision came as the statistics office bumped up its export growth forecast for this year, with global demand for the island's technology products buoyed by a work-and-study-from-home boom during the COVID-19 pandemic, as workers and students rushed to buy smartphones, tablets and laptops.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to rise 5.88% this year, the fastest pace since it expanded 10.25% in 2010, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said, and up from a growth forecast of 5.46% made in June.
Giving its first forecast for 2022, the office said it saw GDP growth reaching a more modest 3.69% next year. 
""The distance business opportunities catalysed by the epidemic have accelerated the digital transformation of global companies, and demand for technology products is strong,"" the statistics agency said.
While it warned of uncertainty over virus variants, the future of monetary and fiscal policy globally amid growing inflation concerns and possible international carbon taxes, it saw a bullish outlook for Taiwan next year.
Taiwan stands ready to benefit from the global economic recovery, especially with production of more advanced chip nodes coming online at home, the office noted.
Taiwan's exports are a bellwether of demand for global tech giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), as the island is a major producer of semiconductors, a global shortage of which has rattled firms like auto makers and boosted Taiwanese corporate profits.
The statistics agency forecast exports in 2021 would rise 28.15% year-on-year, up from a previous prediction for a 20.4% increase.
For next year, it said it saw exports expanding 5.22% year-on-year.

In the second quarter, GDP expanded by a revised 7.43% from a year earlier, slightly down from a preliminary reading of 7.47%, the agency added. It slowed from 8.92% growth in the first quarter as a sudden spike in domestic COVID-19 cases that began in May weighed on consumption.
The outbreak has since been contained and restrictions, including on personal gatherings and in-restaurant dining, were eased last month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's export boom extended into in July but consumer prices likely fell, a Reuters poll showed, highlighting the divergence between manufacturers benefiting from robust global demand and retailers suffering from a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.
The mixed batch of data will likely highlight the challenge policymakers face in combating a spike in Delta variant cases, without choking off a fragile economic recovery.
Exports likely surged 39.0% in July from a year earlier after a 48.6% spike in the previous month, according to analysts polled by Reuters, though the figures are inflated by the base effect of last year's pandemic-induced slump.
""Exports will remain strong with capital and IT-related goods serving as main drivers thanks to robust global demand for capital expenditure,"" said Kenta Maruyama, an economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting.
Imports likely rose 35.1% in July from a year earlier partly due to rising raw material costs, the poll showed.
In a sign of weak domestic demand, Japan's core consumer prices likely fell 0.4% in July from a year earlier, according to the poll.
The drop is partly due to a change in the base year for the consumer price index (CPI) that gives a heavier weighting to cellphone charge fees, which have fallen sharply recently.
Analysts expect the base-year change to shave about 0.7 percentage point off core CPI. Under the new base year, core consumer prices fell 0.5% in June, according to the government, compared with a 0.2% gain under the old base year.
""Japan won't see inflation accelerate as much as in the United States and Europe with service-sector firms under strain from the pandemic,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.

Core machinery orders, meanwhile, likely shrank 2.8% in June, falling for the first time in four months in a worrying sign for capital expenditure, the poll showed.
The government will release the trade and machinery orders data at 8:50 a.m. on Aug. 18 (2350GMT, Aug. 17). The consumer price data is due out 8:30 a.m. on Aug. 20 (2330GMT, Aug. 19).

758,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 12:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Producer prices posted their largest annual increase in more than a decade amid inflation pressures while the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits fell again last week as the economic recovery continues to be bumpy.
U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in July, the Labor Department said on Thursday, suggesting inflation could remain high as strong demand fueled by the recovery continues to hurt supply chains. In the 12 months through July, the PPI jumped 7.8%, a record high since the measure was introduced in 2010. 
The producer price index for final demand increased 1.0% last month after rising 1.0% in June. Three-quarters of the gain was driven by a record one-month increase in final demand services, while the goods advance was half what it was in June.
The report followed data on Wednesday that showed U.S. consumer prices increases slowed in July even as they remained at a 13-year high on a yearly basis amid tentative signs inflation has peaked as supply-chain disruptions caused by the pandemic work their way through the economy.
""We expect the July report to mark the peak of producer price inflation as supply pressures gradually unwind in the coming months and demand moderates from its blistering pace in the first half of the year. However, stubborn pandemic disruptions will continue to hamper supply through year-end,"" said Mahir Rasheed, an economist at Oxford Economics.
The recent pace of price increases has intensified debate at the U.S. Federal Reserve over whether faster action may be needed in dialing back its extraordinary support of the pandemic-hit economy, including beginning to reduce its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said the current burst in inflation is likely temporary but other officials have become increasingly wary price increases will persist above the central bank's 2% inflation target, a flexible average.
Last month's increase in the costs of services was led by a 1.7% jump in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by retailers and wholesalers. Twenty percent of the increase in services was due to margins for automobiles and parts retailing, which rose 11.2%.
There were also gains in the prices of airline passenger services, hospital outpatient care, machinery and equipment wholesaling, and traveler accommodation services.
The swiftness of the economic recovery has caused a mismatch between supply and demand. Producers have had to grapple with low inventories, higher commodity prices, a global shipping container crisis and increased labor costs due to a shortage of willing workers. 
The lack of inventory because of supply chain issues are making it easier for producers to pass on the costs to consumers. 
JOBLESS CLAIMS CONTINUE TO FALL
Elsewhere, initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 375,000 for the week ended August 7, a separate Labor Department report showed on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 375,000 applications for the latest week. Unadjusted claims, which offer a better read of the labor market, decreased 5,198 to 320,517 last week.
Claims remain well above their pre-pandemic level of 256,000, though they have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. 
There are still fears that rising coronavirus cases, caused by the Delta variant, could slow the employment recovery amid a shortage of workers. There were a record 10.1 million job openings at the end of June. About 8.7 million people are officially unemployed.
The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid fell 114,000 to 2.866 million during the week ended July 31.
Those collecting benefits under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation programs dropped by nearly 730,000 in the week ended July 24. At a combined 8.67 million, their rolls were the lowest since May 2020.

The labor market recovery has a long way to go. About 12.055 million people, the same as the prior report, were receiving unemployment checks under all programs in late July, the lowest level since late March 2020.
The economy has swiftly regained momentum and past its pre-pandemic peak in the second quarter as trillions in government relief and increasing vaccinations against COVID-19 fueled spending on goods and services.
 
"
759,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers rose in July by more than expected, suggesting that higher commodity costs and supply bottlenecks are still adding to inflationary pressures for companies.
The producer price index for final demand increased 1% from the prior month and 7.8% from a year earlier, Labor Department data showed Thursday. Excluding volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI also rose 1% and was up 6.2% from July 2020.
The increase in the PPI from a year ago was the largest in data back to 2010.
The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.6% month-over-month advance in the overall PPI and a 0.5% increase in the core figure.
Producer prices have been accelerating for much of this year against a backdrop of robust demand, supply chain constraints and shortages of materials. The increases in input costs, combined with recent upward pressure on wages, help explain higher consumer inflation.
A report Wednesday showed the consumer price index climbed in July at a more moderate pace, though not enough to provide major relief from the cost increases weighing on sentiment and driving policy debate.
Federal Reserve officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, say recent price increases represent temporary shocks that are associated with the reopening of the economy. Some policy makers and investors, however, worry that cost pressures will lead to more persistent inflation.
Services Inflation
Almost three-fourths of the jump in the July PPI reflected a record 1.1% pickup in services. The advance in final demand services was broad and included strength in margins at wholesalers and retailers.
The PPI report showed prices for goods increased 0.6% after a 1.2% advance in the prior month.
Prices of energy climbed by the most in four months, while food costs fell for the first time this year.
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure often preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- jumped 0.9% from the prior month, the most since January. Those costs were up 6.1% from July 2020.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy grew by a faster-than-expected 1.0% in June, the first full month of indoor service for many hospitality firms, and also helped by the healthcare sector due to a rise in routine medical checkups after the pandemic.
But the official data https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/gdpmonthlyestimateuk/june2021 showed British gross domestic product remained 2.2% smaller than it was immediately before the pandemic struck the country, a reminder of the damage done by Britain's long coronavirus lockdowns last year.
Britain's economy slumped by almost 10% in 2020, one of the biggest hits suffered by a rich nation, and the Bank of England expects it to regain its pre-pandemic size only at the end of 2021. The U.S. economy has already made up the hit.
The GDP figures have yet to show the impact of a surge in coronavirus cases in July although other data published on Thursday showed consumer spending in the week to Aug. 5 rose to within a whisker of its February 2020 level.
The month-on-month growth for the overall economy in June was stronger than an increase of 0.8% expected in a Reuters poll of economists.
Sandra Horsfield, an economist with Investec, said confidence among consumers and businesses was likely to build over time as long as there was no return to lockdowns.
""How smooth the transition will be is the big unknown, with perhaps the biggest question marks hanging over the performance of the labour market once the furlough scheme fully ends in late September,"" she said.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak repeated on Thursday that he had no plans for a further extension of the furlough programme which has protected the incomes of millions of workers.
SERVICES LEAD THE WAY
Britain's huge services sector grew by 1.5% in June. Healthcare contributed the most to growth, as family doctors saw more of their regular patients due to an easing of coronavirus precautions, the Office for National Statistics said.
Output from food and beverage services such as pubs and restaurants jumped by more than 10%, helped by the Euro 2020 soccer tournament.
Industrial output shrank by 0.7%, hit by maintenance of oil field production sites and a swing in the volatile pharmaceutical industry. The narrower measure of manufacturing grew by 0.2%, while construction output fell by 1.3%.
Compared with the first quarter of this year, when much of Britain's economy was in the grip of a third lockdown, economic output was up by 4.8%, the ONS said.
The International Monetary Fund expects Britain's economy to grow by 7% in 2021, the same as the United States, as it bounces back from last year's slump.
However, the Bank of England thinks Britain's economy will eventually settle back into its pre-crisis rut of slow growth. It expects British GDP to grow 5.75% next year but by only 1.25% in 2023.
Last week the BoE laid out its plans for a ""modest tightening"" of its huge stimulus programme.
The ONS lowered its estimate for growth in May to 0.6% from an originally reported 0.8% increase but revised up April's rebound to 2.2% from 2%.

Gross domestic product in the three months to the end of June was 22.2% higher than in the same period of 2020, reflecting the impact of the first coronavirus shutdown last year and the lifting of restrictions this year.
Separate trade data from the ONS showed British exports to the European Union in May and June exceeded their levels immediately before Britain left the EU's single market at the start of this year, excluding volatile trade in precious metals.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese wholesale prices rose in July at their fastest annual pace in 13 years, data showed on Thursday, a sign that global commodity inflation and a weak yen were pushing up raw material import costs for a broad range of goods.
There is uncertainty, however, on whether companies will start to pass on the higher costs to households and prop up consumer inflation, which remains stuck around zero due to weak consumption, unlike in other advanced nations, analysts say.
""The pass-through of raw material costs to consumer goods prices is slow,"" said Chisato Oshiba, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""While wholesale inflation is accelerating at a very fast pace now, it will take time for this to lead to higher consumer prices,"" she said.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, rose 5.6% in July from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed, increasing for the fifth straight month and beating a median market forecast for a 5.0% gain.
It accelerated sharply from a 5.0% increase in June and marked the fastest pace of growth since September 2008, when emerging market demand triggered a spike in prices dubbed the commodities ""super cycle"".
On a month-on-month basis, wholesale prices rose 1.1% in July after gaining 0.6%, marking the biggest increase in nearly two years.
Prices rose for many raw materials including those for wood, which spiked 33.1% in July from a year earlier, and oil and coal goods, which saw prices rise 38.8%.
Some countries, including the United States and Britain, have seen inflation rise faster than expected as demand recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, triggering debate on how quickly they should wean their economies off massive monetary stimulus.
Few analysts expect Japan to see the same kind of rise in consumer inflation. Slow vaccinations and curbs in activity to combat the pandemic have hurt consumption, discouraging firms from passing on higher costs to households.
The dynamics were evident in wholesale price data. Domestic final goods prices rose just 2% in July from a year earlier, even as raw material prices spiked 48%.
Back in 2008, Japan's annual core consumer inflation hit 2.4% in July and August on rising commodity costs, but slowed to 0.2% in December and started falling from March 2009.
The spike in inflation during the period was driven largely by a handful of raw material costs, with prices of most items staying roughly flat, the BOJ said in a report issued in July.
""Given such historical experience, any rise in consumer prices driven by increases in upstream costs will highly likely to be transitory,"" the BOJ report said.
Japan's economy has emerged from last year's slump thanks to robust exports.

But a resurgence in infections forced the government to impose fresh state of emergency curbs, dashing policymakers' hope for a strong rebound in July-September growth.
Core consumer prices rose just 0.2% in June from a year earlier due to weak household spending, well below the BOJ's elusive 2% target. Analysts expect a change in the base year from the July data, due on Aug. 20, to push down core consumer inflation by around 0.7 of a percentage point.

763,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 07:12PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's red-hot housing market cooled a little last month in July as the partial removal of a temporary cut to property purchase taxes caused a slight drop in demand from new buyers, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said its monthly gauge of house prices eased in July to +79 from +82 in June, which had been highest level since the late 1980s. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of +76.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak cut stamp duty, a tax on house purchases, in July 2020. But from last month it started to return to its pre-pandemic level.
The tax cut aimed to reverse a slump in property sales at the start of the pandemic, and helped fuel a surge in property prices and some new construction. Many households were already seeking more spacious housing suited to working from home.
""Although the tapering in stamp duty is beginning to have some impact on RICS activity indicators, the overall tone to the market remains firm with the metrics capturing price expectations showing few signs of wavering,"" said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist.

While buyer enquiries weakened for the first time after four months of increases, Rubinsohn said buyers continued to put a premium on spacious properties - explaining why house price expectations remained elevated.
Mortgage lender Halifax said last week that this had helped to keep momentum in the market, after it reported an unexpected month-on-month increase in house prices for July.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday posted a July budget deficit of $302 billion, a record for that month, as COVID-19 relief spending stayed elevated while receipts returned to a more normal pace after a delayed July tax deadline last year.
The Treasury Department said the July deficit compared to a year-earlier $63 billion budget gap. Receipts for the month totaled $262 billion, down 54% percent from July 2020, while outlays were $564 billion, down 10% from the year-earlier period.
The U.S. deficit for the first 10 months of fiscal 2021 came to $2.540 trillion, down 10% from the year-earlier record of $2.807 trillion.
A U.S. Treasury official said that the smaller year-to-date outlays and deficits reflected some tapering of COVID-19 relief spending, with Labor Department outlays for supplemental unemployment benefits down 8% to $359 billion, and Small Business Administration outlays down 40% to $338 billion.

Meanwhile, revenues reflected the general recovery of the U.S. economy, with year-to-date corporate tax receipts up 61% to $324 billion and non-withheld individual taxes up 35% to $763 billion.
The Treasury official declined to comment when asked whether the July budget results would alter the department's forecasts on when the federal government would exhaust extraordinary measures to continue borrowing under the statutory debt limit of $28.4 trillion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer prices increases slowed in July even as they remained at a 13-year high on a yearly basis and there were tentative signs inflation has peaked as supply-chain disruptions caused by the pandemic work their way through the economy.
The data could provide some support to Fed officials who have repeatedly said that the current burst in inflation is temporary and likely to fade as the handful of categories that have caused inflation to surge in recent months get back on an even keel.
The consumer price index increased 0.5% last month after climbing 0.9% in June, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. In the 12 months through July, the CPI advanced 5.4%. The drop in the month-to-month inflation rate was the largest in 15 months.
Price gains for used cars and trucks, which have accounted for an outsized chunk of the inflation boost in recent months, rose 0.2%, a sharp drop from the 10.5% increase the prior month. Prices for airline fares also edged down 0.1%. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.3% after increasing 0.9% in June. That was the smallest gain in four months and the first deceleration in the so-called core CPI since February.
The core CPI rose 4.3% on a year-on-year basis after advancing 4.5% in June. Annual inflation rates have been lifted by the fading out of last spring's weak readings from the CPI calculation but those so-called base effects are leveling off.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the overall CPI would rise 0.5% and the core CPI would rise 0.4%. U.S. Treasury prices slipped following the release of the data.[US/] 
""It fits the Fed's narrative and they can pretty much stand pat on their current strategy,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago.
AS SOME PRICES EASE, OTHERS RISE
The U.S. Federal Reserve is paying close attention to price pressures as it mulls when to begin to reduce its massive bond holdings and how soon to begin lifting rates from near zero. It also remains on the lookout for any signs that price pressures may broaden.
Inflation ""seems to have crested"" and should drop back in coming months, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. 
Even if inflation has peaked, it is expected to remain elevated through part of 2022. There were also possible hints that the rise in price pressures may not fall back rapidly as other sectors saw price gains holding or accelerating. 
New vehicle prices rose by 1.7%, the third straight month of gains above 1.5%. A global semiconductor shortage which has held back auto production has stripped automakers of inventory and could continue to cause price gains in the months ahead.
Prices for shelter and energy also increased while the recent jump in bar and restaurant prices showed no sign of a slowing. They rose 0.8% in July, the fourth month of accelerating gains, and an indication that a continuing shortage of workers and rising wages are being passed through. 
The swiftness of the economic recovery has caused a mismatch between supply and demand with consumers bolstered by low interest rates and nearly $6 trillion in government relief. 

The U.S. vaccination drive, with nearly 170 million Americans immunized against COVID-19, and the arrival of summer with less restrictions compared to last year, have caused a surge in demand for airline travel, hotel and motel accommodation. Hotel room rates rose by 6% in July. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, jumped 3.5% in June, the largest gain since December 1991.
 
"

Faced with supply constraints and surging demand, businesses are raising prices for goods and services as cost pressures mount. Ongoing challenges including materials shortages, shipping bottlenecks and hiring difficulties will likely continue to put broader upward pressure on prices in the months ahead.
At the same time, the outsized gains may ease as some price surges linked to the economy’s reopening ebb.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.5% gain in the overall CPI from the prior month and a 5.3% year-over-year increase.

(Reuters) - Mortgage applications rose last week as the key 30-year mortgage rate held below 3% for a second straight week.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages inched up to 2.99% from 2.97% in the week ending Aug. 6. The seasonally adjusted market index tracking mortgage applications rose 2.8% from a week earlier, the MBA said. 
""Homeowners continue to respond to lower rates, with refinance activity climbing to the highest level since February 2021,"" Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.
After hitting record lows late last year below 2.9%, mortgage rates climbed in the first part of this year and peaked in the spring. Rates have been drifting lower since, held down in large part by the U.S. Federal Reserve's extraordinary stimulus measures aimed at helping the economy rebound from the coronavirus pandemic.

The MBA's mortgage market index rise reflected a 3.2% increase in applications to refinance existing loans, while purchase applications rose 1.8%.
""With low for-sale inventory keeping home-price appreciation in many markets at record highs, the jump in FHA purchase applications is potentially a sign that more first-time buyers are finding purchase options despite the high prices,"" Kan said.

The world's biggest auto market saw sales drop 11.9% from the same month a year earlier to 1.86 million vehicles, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).
For the first seven months of the year, China's vehicle sales have jumped 19% as the market recovered from pandemic lows. CAAM said that rebound is set to peter out with sales for the rest of 2021 expected to be below relatively high year-ago levels, although the market is still expected to log growth overall on an annual basis.
Chen Shihua, a senior CAAM executive, cautioned that the global chip shortage, which has led to automakers curtailing production, was unlikely to resolve itself soon as the pandemic rages on in many parts of the world.

One bright spot in July was continued strong sales of new energy vehicles, which more than doubled to 271,000. These include battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
The government's promotion of greener vehicles to cut pollution has prompted electric car makers such as Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc, Xpeng Inc and BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd to expand manufacturing capacity in China.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's bellwether economy expanded more than initially estimated in the second quarter and the government raised its forecast for 2021 as COVID-19 vaccinations progressed at home and in other key markets.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to grow 6% to 7% in 2021, versus a prior estimate for an expansion of 4 to 6%, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said.
GDP grew 14.7% year-on-year in the second quarter, higher than the 14.3% growth seen in the government's advance estimate. Analysts had expected a 14.2% increase, according to a Reuters poll.
In absolute terms, GDP remained 0.6% below its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter of 2019.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy contracted 1.8% in the second quarter, a reversal from the 3.3% expansion in the prior quarter.
""Barring a major setback in the global economy, the Singapore economy is expected to continue to see a gradual recovery in the second half of the year, supported in large part by outward-oriented sectors,"" said Gabriel Lim, permanent secretary for trade and industry.
He said easing border restrictions would also help in the recovery of consumer-facing sectors and alleviate labour shortages in sectors that are reliant on migrant workers.
However, aviation- and tourism-related sectors are projected to recover more slowly than previously expected, with activity expected to remain significantly below pre-COVID levels even by the end of the year.
The small and open economy is charting an uneven recovery after posting its worst ever recession last year due to the pandemic. Much of its fast growth this year is due to the low comparison base of last year when the virus paralysed economies around the world.
The central bank had maintained its accommodative monetary policy at its last meeting in April. The next policy review is due in mid-October.
The revised 2021 forecast was consistent with the current monetary policy stance, which remained appropriate, said Edward Robinson, the deputy managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
Economists do not expect the MAS to make any moves in October, citing benign domestic inflation and the need to measure the effectiveness of vaccines against new virus variants, which will impact the pace of reopening and recovery. 
""That gives them more room to respond and probably tighten in April next year,"" said Brian Tan, regional economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).

Jeff Ng, senior treasury strategist at HL Bank, expects economic activity to improve in 2022.
""Going forward by the end of the year, Singapore will be looking to move forward to the endemic stage of the recovery,"" he said.

770,"<span>Aug 10, 2021 08:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s consumer confidence declined this month, though not as far as might have been feared given its two largest cities are under stay-at-home orders to try to contain an outbreak of the delta variant of coronavirus.
The sentiment index dropped 4.4% to 104.1 points in August, the lowest point in a year,  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp. said Wednesday in a statement. But optimists still outweighed pessimists, with 100 points the dividing line between the two.
“This is a significant further loss of confidence but better than might have been expected,” said Matthew Hassan, senior economist at Westpac. “The virus situation locally is clearly troubling, but consumers appear reasonably confident that it will come back under control, and that once it does, the economy will see a return to robust growth.”
The highly contagious delta variant has caused shutdowns across the nation’s eastern coast, its most populated area. The Reserve Bank of Australia estimates household spending drops about 15% during lockdowns and has acknowledged the economy will likely contract this quarter.
Still, the RBA expects a solid recovery to resume, and has decided to stick with plans to taper bond purchases for now.
The apparent resilience of consumer sentiment will give some comfort to the RBA, suggesting the consumer and the wider economy remain well placed to snap back once virus restrictions ease, Hassan said.
Sydney has been hitting record daily infections despite being in its seventh week of strict stay-at-home orders. The city accounts for 25% of Australia’s output and 22% of employment. The crisis reflects a tardy vaccine roll-out that’s left the population vulnerable to the delta variant during the southern hemisphere winter.
“The availability of effective Covid vaccines is a key source of support for confidence,” Hassan said. “Notably, sentiment is much stronger amongst those that have either been vaccinated or plan to get the jab.”
The poll was based on responses from 1,200 people and conducted from Aug. 2-7.

772,"<span>Aug 10, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. worker productivity growth slowed in the second quarter and labor costs were far weaker than previously estimated in the first quarter, the Labor Department said on Tuesday.
Nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 2.3% annualized rate last quarter. Data for the first quarter was revised lower to show productivity rising at a 4.3% rate instead of the previously reported 5.4% pace.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity to rise at a 3.5% rate. Productivity jumped early in the pandemic before slumping in the final three months of 2020, and has since rebounded. The see-sawing has been partly attributed to the cratering of lower-wage industries, like leisure and hospitality, which have been reopening over the past few months at an increasingly brisk pace.
Compared to the second quarter of 2020, productivity rose at a 1.9% pace. Hours worked increased at a 5.5% rate last quarter, accelerating from a revised 4.0% growth pace in the January-March period.
Overall output is now 1.2% above pre-pandemic levels but hours worked remain 2.8% below it, the report also showed. The resurgence in economic activity has not been matched by people flooding back into the workforce. On Monday, U.S. job openings jumped to a fresh record high in June, Labor Department data showed.
Small business owners across the United States grew less confident in the economic recovery in July as labor shortages remained an issue, according to a National Federation of Independent Business survey released on Tuesday.
The cooling in the most recent data notwithstanding, Oxford Economics lead U.S. economist Lydia Boussour said the pandemic appears to have ""induced an upside shock to productivity.""
""The adoption of technology has accelerated, new firms are being created at an historic pace, and the shift to remote work is likely to outlast the crisis,"" she wrote in a note on Tuesday. ""While some of the pandemic-driven efficiencies could take years to be fully realized, we think these four forces will lead to a sustained productivity revival in the medium run.""

Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - rose at a 1.0% rate. They contracted at a revised 2.8% pace in the first quarter. Unit labor costs increased at a 0.1% rate from a year ago. They have also been distorted by the pandemic's disproportionate impact on lower-wage industries.
Hourly compensation rose at a 3.3% rate last quarter. That followed a revised 1.4% growth pace in the first quarter. Compensation increased at a 2.0% rate compared to the first quarter of 2020.

(Reuters) - Small business owners across the United States grew less confident in the economic recovery in July as labor shortages remained an issue, according to a survey released on Tuesday.
The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Optimism Index fell 2.8 points to a reading of 99.7 in July, almost erasing all of June's gain. Six of the 10 index components declined, three improved and one was left unchanged.
""Small business owners are losing confidence in the strength of the economy and expect a slowdown in job creation,"" Bill Dunkelberg, the NFIB's chief economist, said in a statement.
While the economy is projected to expand this year at its fastest pace since the 1980s, there are signs it may be cooling. Supply chain bottlenecks continue to dent manufacturing growth, and consumer sentiment has declined recently amid concerns about inflation.
A net 27% of businesses plan to create new jobs in the next three months, down one point from the month prior, the NFIB survey showed.
Last week, the trade group said in its monthly jobs report that a record high 49% of small business owners reported unfilled job openings in July on a seasonally adjusted basis.
The quality of labor ranked as businesses' ""single most important problem,"" with 26% of respondents selecting it among 10 issues, near the survey high of 27%, the NFIB said in its latest optimism survey. 
""As owners look for qualified workers, they are also reporting that supply chain disruptions are having an impact on their businesses,"" Dunkelberg said. ""Ultimately, owners could sell more if they could acquire more supplies and inventories from their supply chains.""

Some 57% of respondents said they had few or no qualified applicants for open jobs in July, up one point from June.
Businesses in the NFIB survey also flagged inflation as a worry, with 44% planning to increase prices in the next three months, which was unchanged from June's record high reading.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's current account surplus jumped in the first half of this year as exports to the United States and Asia boomed, data showed on Tuesday, with robust global demand for durable goods helping to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic.
In contrast, the country's services deficit widened in January-June from a year earlier as the pandemic kept foreign visitors from entering the country, the finance ministry data showed, highlighting the pain the crisis has inflicted on Japan's once-booming tourism industry.
A separate survey showed sentiment in Japan's services sector improved in July though an index gauging the outlook worsened, underscoring the fragile nature of the country's recovery.
""Infection numbers continue to rise, triggering government requests for people to avoid travelling during the summer holiday season,"" analysts at SMBC Nikko Securities wrote in a research note. ""Private consumption may have held up in July but seen slumping in August.""
Japan reaped a current account surplus of 10.47 trillion yen ($94.78 billion) in the first half of this year, up 3.5 trillion yen from the same period last year, due largely to a 22.2% jump in exports, the data showed.
Exports of cars, auto parts and chip-making equipment boomed particularly for those bound to Asia and North America, the data showed, a sign that manufacturers benefited from strong global demand for durable goods.
By contrast, Japan saw its services deficit widen by 146.7 billion yen to 2.09 trillion yen in January-June due to a 97.6% drop in overseas visitors, the data showed.

Japan's economy emerged from last year's pandemic-induced doldrums thanks to solid exports. But slow vaccine rollouts and a resurgence in COVID-19 infections have weighed on consumption, clouding its recovery prospects.
The tourism industry has been hit hard by closed borders and the government's stay-at-home requests. Many analysts say the Tokyo Olympic Games, which ended on Sunday, gave little boost to the economy as no spectators were allowed for most events.

Business confidence slumped to minus-8 points from plus-11 in June, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) Ltd. said in a statement Tuesday. The conditions index -- measuring hiring, sales and profits -- dropped to 11 points from a revised 25. The survey ran from July 20-30.
The result showed “optimism collapsing on the back of ongoing restrictions,” said Alan Oster, chief economist at NAB. “The fear is that lower capacity utilization and a fading pipeline on work may see businesses pull back on hiring and investment intentions.”
The highly contagious delta variant has caused shutdowns across Australia’s east coast, the nation’s most populated area, with Sydney now in its seventh week of lockdown. The central bank estimates household spending tends to drop about 15% during lockdowns and expects the economy will likely contract this quarter.
Indeed, a weekly gauge of consumer confidence released by Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd. earlier Tuesday fell below the neutral level of 100 for the first time since early November last year.
All three components of NAB’s business conditions fell: trading dropped 20 points, profitability 19 and employment declined 8 points.
“We know that once restrictions are removed that the economy has tended to rebound relatively quickly,” Oster said. “The hope is that the economy again rebounds strongly, and we see little pullback in the very positive investment and hiring intentions we have seen by business in recent months.”
Reserve Bank chief Philip Lowe signaled last week that he’s adopting a similar outlook, pushing ahead with a planned taper of bond purchases in the expectation there will be a rapid recovery. In addition, the governor maintains that fiscal policy is the best tool for aiding households during such episodes -- and federal and state governments have boosted assistance.
Australian authorities are trying to ramp up vaccinations to counter the outbreak after a sluggish roll out left the population vulnerable to delta.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's bank lending rose in July at the slowest annual pace in nearly nine years, data showed on Tuesday, a sign companies were emerging steadily from a cash crunch last year caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
But the slowdown in lending also reflected sluggish consumption as households hoarded cash instead of spending, underscoring the fragile nature of Japan's economic recovery.
Total bank lending rose 1.0% in July from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed, slowing from a 1.4% gain in June and marking the lowest year-on-year increase since November 2012.
Bank lending surged last year when companies were in need of immediate cash to ease the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on business.
""Some companies were paying back loans they tapped as a precaution,"" a BOJ official told a briefing. ""Bank deposits remain at high levels, which shows households are cautious about boosting spending,"" he added.
The average balance of bank deposits rose 5.7% in July from a year earlier at 831 trillion yen ($7.53 trillion), far exceeding the 578 trillion yen for that of bank lending, the data showed.
Major banks saw lending fall 1.4% in July from a year earlier after a 1.6% drop in June, largely in reaction to last year's surge in fund demand to deal with the pandemic's shock.
Regional banks increased lending by 2.3% in July, a slowdown from a 2.9% gain in June, suggesting that cash constraints were easing even for small and mid-sized borrowers.

Japan's economy emerged from last year's hit from the pandemic thanks to robust overseas demand, though the outlook is clouded by a resurge in COVID-19 infections that is crippling private consumption.

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, shot up by 590,000 to 10.1 million on the last day of June, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Monday.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast job openings would rise to 9.28 million in June. Vacancies increased in all four regions and the job openings rate rose to 6.5% from 6.1%. 
Employers have struggled to quickly rehire workers to keep up with the speed from which the economy has emerged from the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, which upended many businesses as restrictions and fears of the virus kept people home.
The ratio of openings to hires, despite easing in June, remained at historically elevated levels,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Peter McCrory said. 
Graphic: Openings still far exceed hires, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/znvnedaolpl/chart_eikon.jpg 
Acute labor shortages have been reported, particularly in leisure and hospitality. Generous unemployment benefits, childcare issues and lingering worries about the virus have also been cited as factors holding back people returning to the workforce.
The largest increases in vacancies in June were in professional and business services, retail trade and accommodation and food services. 
But Monday's data offered a hopeful sign as hiring rose to 6.7 million in June from 6.0 million in the prior month, the second largest increase since the government started tracking the series in 2000. It fell short only of the number of hires in May 2020, which was fueled by the economy reopening after the first wave of shutdowns. Economists generally are expecting a larger bump in hiring as schools reopen and crisis-era unemployment benefits come to an end. 
Graphic: Hiring was brisk in June, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/zjpqkqzgqpx/chart_eikon.jpg 
It also tallies with more recent data. The government reported on Friday that job growth accelerated in July as U.S. employers hired the most workers in nearly a year and continued to raise wages.
The rise in hiring in June was led by retail trade, with 291,000 more positions filled, while state and local government education filled 94,000 jobs.
Worries remain, however, that a resurgence in infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, could once again discourage some unemployed people from returning to the labor force.
Elsewhere, the report showed the number of people voluntarily leaving their employment in June increased to 3.9 million from 3.6 million in May, well above pre-pandemic levels. 
Graphic: Quits: Retail and accommodation & food services, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/lgpdwmzzevo/chart_eikon.jpg

Mexico's national statistics agency INEGI said consumer prices increased by 5.81% in the year through July, above the consensus forecast of a Reuters poll for a reading of 5.77%.
The July reading was the lowest since March, and compared with a rate of 5.88% in June.
The Bank of Mexico, which will hold its next monetary policy meeting on Thursday, targets an inflation rate of 3%, with a one percentage-point tolerance range above and below that.
Expectations have been growing that Banxico, as the bank is known, could hike its benchmark interest rate for the second meeting in a row in a bid to contain price pressures in Latin America's no. 2 economy.
""We expect supply-side shocks to fade in coming months, but core inflation will struggle to revert to target until the second half of next year,"" said Joan Domene, senior economist at Oxford Economics.
The INEGI data showed that the index of core annual inflation, which strips out some volatile items, accelerated to 4.66%, the highest rate since the end of 2017. That figure was in line with the reading of the Reuters poll.
""We believe that Banxico's June hike marked the start of a normalization cycle that will bring the policy rate to a terminal level of 5.25% by year-end,"" said Domene, who forecast there would be rate hikes of 25 basis points at every monetary policy meeting until December.

Seventeen of 19 analysts surveyed by Reuters said they expect Banxico to raise the rate by 25 basis points to 4.50% on Thursday.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers' inflation expectations for the near future remained elevated last month while the outlook for their financial prospects over the next year dimmed, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
Median expectations for inflation over the next year stayed at a series high of 4.8% in July, following a substantial jump in June, according to the monthly survey. 
Expectations for what inflation will be over the next three years increased slightly to a median of 3.7% from 3.6% in June, reaching the highest level since August 2013. 
The survey of consumer expectations, which is based on a rotating panel of 1,300 households, can be a helpful gauge for the U.S. central bank as it weighs its inflation outlook. 
Fed policymakers are discussing how and when to begin removing the support provided during the coronavirus pandemic, with some officials concerned recent inflationary pressures may last longer than anticipated. The Fed last year cut its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero and began buying $120 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month to bolster the economy.
Consumers' expectations for how much home prices will rise over the next year dropped to a median 6.0% in July from 6.2% in June. That drop was driven mostly by respondents aged 40 and higher, as well as by those living in the West and the Midwest. 

More people said they were worse off financially now than they were a year ago, and fewer respondents said they expect their financial situation to improve a year from now. The average perceived odds of missing a minimum debt payment over the next three months rose to 10.4%, above the trailing 12-month average of 10.0%. 
The mean perceived probability of becoming unemployed over the next year rose to 12.2%, but was still the second lowest reading for the survey launched in 2013.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German exports rose more than expected in June despite persisting supply bottlenecks in manufacturing, data showed on Monday, suggesting a solid recovery in Europe's biggest economy.
The data, released by the Federal Statistics Office on Monday, brought some relief after manufacturing figures showed on Friday that industrial output unexpectedly fell in June due to supply bottlenecks for intermediate goods.
""Exports are now up for the 14th month in a row. What a run!"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
Seasonally adjusted exports jumped by 1.3% on the month in June after a slightly revised rise of 0.4% in May. Imports rose 0.6 % after an increase of 3.4% the prior month.
The strong rise in exports widened the trade surplus to 13.6 billion euros from a revised 12.8 billion euros in May.
A Reuters poll had pointed to a 0.4% increase in exports, a 0.5% rise in imports and a trade balance of 13.4 billion euros.
Compared to February 2020, the month before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, seasonally adjusted exports rose by 1.1% and imports jumped by 10%, underlining strong domestic demand and massive state spending during the crisis.
The monthly trade data did not include a breakdown by country.
On the year, exports jumped 23.6% and imports soared 27%, mainly driven by business with the United States and China, Germany's two most important trading partners outside the European Union's single market.
Exports of ""Made in Germany"" goods to the United States were up by nearly 40% on the year in June and exports to China rose 16%. Exports to Britain increased 11% on the year while imports from the UK were up by 11.5%.
VP Bank analyst Gitzel cautioned there was risk that the supply bottlenecks for intermediate products in manufacturing could soon be reflected more clearly in the export figures.
""The problem of material shortages will eat its way through the entire economic figures,"" Gitzel added.

The central bank said last month economic growth could accelerate further this summer if there were no ""significant setbacks"" in the fight against the pandemic and if supply bottlenecks eased.
On this condition, the Bundesbank expects the economy to reach its pre-pandemic levels at the end of the third quarter, growing 3.7% this year and 5.2% next year.

The world's second-biggest economy is on track to expand more than 8% this year but analysts say pent-up coronavirus demand has peaked and forecast growth to moderate amid supply chain bottle necks and outbreaks of the Delta variant of COVID-19.
The producer price index (PPI) grew 9.0% from a year earlier, matching the high seen in May, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement on Monday. Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the PPI to rise 8.8%, unchanged from June.
Consumer inflation slowed slightly, the data showed, giving policymakers room to act if required.
China's economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the expansion is losing steam as businesses face intensifying strains from higher commodity prices and global supply chain bottlenecks.
""We believe domestic inflationary pressure is largely controllable, and Beijing will unlikely overreact to the stronger-than-expected July inflation data,"" analysts from Nomura wrote in a note.
""Instead, we expect Beijing to maintain its unique policy mix of 'targeted tightening + universal easing' through the remainder of this year.""
China cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves in July, releasing around 1 trillion yuan ($154.40 billion). Many analysts expect another cut later in the year.
The global spread of the more-infectious Delta variant of the virus and new outbreaks of cases at home, on top of recent heavy rainfall and floods in some Chinese provinces have also disrupted economic activity. 
""The pandemic worsened and caused more disruption in the global supply chain,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. 
The PPI, a benchmark gauge of a country's industrial profitability, inched up 0.5% on a monthly basis, accelerating from a 0.3% uptick in June. 
ECONOMY LOSING MOMENTUM
Higher crude oil prices and increased demand for thermal coal as China copes with hot weather helped drive up prices, said Dong Lijuan, an official with NBS, in a statement released alongside the data.
Prices in the coal mining and washing and ferrous metal extraction industries jumped 45.7% and 54.6% in July year on-year, respectively.
China's ""zero tolerance"" policy to COVID cases will probably put further stress on the supply chain, and inflation pressure may persist in the second half, said Zhang.
China reported 125 new cases of COVID-19 on the mainland for Aug. 8, with most local infections in the central province of Henan and the eastern province of Jiangsu. 
Uncertainties caused by the fresh outbreak in China and government response measures led analysts from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) to recently revise down their third quarter growth forecasts.
The country's export growth unexpectedly slowed in July, with firms citing extra pressure from high raw material costs.
China, as the top steel consumer of both coal and iron ore, has stepped up efforts to tame rising commodity prices that have squeezed manufacturers' margins, including stepping up inspections on trading platforms and releasing state reserves.
Benchmark iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange fell 13.1% in July, the steepest drop since February 2020.
A separate NBS statement showed that the consumer price index (CPI) in July rose 1.0% from a year earlier, compared with a 1.1% gain in June and below the government target of around 3% this year.
The Reuters poll forecast the index to inch up 0.8%. On a month-on-month basis, the CPI rose 0.3%, compared with a 0.2% increase tipped by the poll and June's 0.4% decline.

The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, stood at 1.3% on year, versus a 0.9% rise in June.

783,"<span>Aug 08, 2021 10:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory inflation surged again in July, following a short-lived retreat in the previous month, as commodity prices remained high despite the government’s steps to rein in costs.
The producer price index grew 9% in July from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday, quickening from 8.8% in the previous month and beating the median forecast of an 8.8% gain. The consumer price index rose 1% in July, compared to the median estimate of a 0.8% increase.
China’s steady economic recovery extended into the second half of the year, although the momentum is weakening. A new round of coronavirus outbreaks across the country is dimming the growth outlook as local authorities restrict travel, hurting domestic demand. It could also temporarily boost inflation pressure, if lockdowns were implemented on a larger scale and supply and logistics are disrupted.
The severity of the economic damage will largely depend on how fast Beijing can bring the pandemic under control, economists said.
Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY) in Singapore, expects CPI to move higher to about 2% at the end of the year as pandemic disruptions possibly push up food prices, he said before the data were released.
Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.3% suggesting domestic demand is getting stronger. Pork prices, a key element in China’s CPI basket, dropped 43.5%, driving food prices down by 3.7%. Non-food prices, climbed 2.1% partly on the pass-through from elevated upstream prices.
With domestic demand remaining subdued, the central bank has ample policy room to shift to a more dovish stance to support the economy, as reflected by its surprise move in July to cut the the reserve requirement ratio for banks.
The Communist Party’s top leadership also pledged more targeted support for the economy at the Politburo meeting late last month, reiterating a commitment to stabilize commodity prices and pledging more effective fiscal support for the economy in the second half.

784,"<span>Aug 07, 2021 03:15AM ET</span>","BEIJING (Reuters) -China's export growth unexpectedly slowed in July following outbreaks of COVID-19 cases, while imports also lost momentum, pointing to a slowdown in the country's industrial sector in the second half even as easing global lockdowns boost commerce. 
The world's biggest exporter has staged an impressive economic rebound from a coronavirus-induced slump in the first few months of last year after quickly containing the pandemic, and its rapid vaccination rollout has helped drive confidence.
But new infections in July, mainly caused by the highly transmissible Delta strain have spread to tens of Chinese cities, prompting local authorities to lock down affected communities, order millions to be tested and temporarily suspend operations of some businesses, including factories. 
Seasonal floods and bad weather last month also affected industrial production in some areas such as central China. 
Exports in July rose 19.3% from a year earlier, compared with a 32.2% gain in June. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a gain of 20.8%.
""The pandemic worsened in other Asian developing countries, which may have led to a relocation of trade toward China. But leading indicators suggest exports may weaken in coming months,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
Outbreaks of COVID-19 cases in eastern and southern Chinese provinces, the country's main export hubs, had crimped factory output.
Aside from the drag from efforts to counter the spread of the Delta variant, Chinese exporters also struggled with an ongoing global semiconductor shortage, logistics bottlenecks, and higher raw material and freight costs. 
""Although orders are recovering, there are too many uncertainties in the second half of the year, like how the domestic epidemic develops and the cost of raw materials. And at the same time, foreign production capacity is slowly picking up,"" said an exports sales manager based in Suzhou surnamed Ye.
Imports in July rose a slower 28.1% from a year earlier, lagging a 33% increase forecast in the Reuters poll, and 36.7% growth the previous month. Demand has dropped in recent months for iron ore, a key ingredient in steelmaking.
China's crude oil imports, however, rebounded in July from a six-month low as state-backed refiners ramped up output after returning from maintenance.
China's factory activity expanded at a slower pace in July due to higher raw material costs, equipment maintenance and extreme weather.
The slower Chinese shipments also reflected the moderation in U.S. business in July amid supply constraints, suggesting a cooling in the world's biggest economy after what was expected to have been a robust second quarter.
China posted a trade surplus of $56.58 billion in July, compared with the poll's forecast for a $51.54 billion surplus and $51.53 billion surplus in June. 
Its trade surplus with the United States rose to $35.4 billion, Reuters calculations based on customs data showed, up from $32.58 billion in June.

The economy is on track to grow more than 8% this year but analysts say pent-up coronavirus demand has peaked and forecast that growth rates are starting to moderate.

785,"<span>Aug 06, 2021 05:08PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer credit grew at the fastest rate ever in June, as Americans increased their credit card usage to drive consumer spending in the second quarter, data from the Federal Reserve showed on Friday.
Total consumer credit expanded at a pace of $37.69 billion, which was the quickest rate ever and followed a $36.69 billion increase in May, the U.S. central bank said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected consumer credit to increase at a rate of $23.00 billion in June.
An alternate measure tracking the monthly change in the total amount of credit outstanding increased by the most since December 2010, the data showed. That measure showed that revolving credit, which mostly measures credit-card use, rose by $17.858 billion, the largest gain since 2006, after climbing by $9.089 billion in May.
The surge in June could explain the sustained robustness in consumer spending during last quarter, even as the flow of stimulus money from the government ebbed.
""We expect consumer credit growth will continue at a healthy clip in the second half of 2021, supported by strong consumer spending and an easing of lending standards for consumer loans,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, notched a second straight quarter of double-digit growth. That helped to pull the level of gross domestic product above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
But growth in nonrevolving credit, which includes auto loans as well as student loans made by the government, slowed to a pace of $19.831 billion from a rate of $27.601 billion in May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers hired the most workers in nearly a year in July and continued to raise wages, giving the economy a powerful boost as it started the second half of what many economists believe will be the best year for growth in almost four decades.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed the unemployment rate dropped to a 16-month low of 5.4% and more people waded back into the labor force. The report followed on the heels of news last week that the economy fully recovered in the second quarter the sharp loss in output suffered during the very brief pandemic recession.
""We are charting new economic expansion territory in the third quarter,"" said Brian Bethune, professor of practice at Boston College in Boston. ""The overall momentum of the recovery continues to build."" 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 943,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since August 2020, the survey of establishments showed. Data for May and June were revised to show 119,000 more jobs created than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would increase by 870,000 jobs. 
The economy has created 4.3 million jobs this year, leaving employment 5.7 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. 
President Joe Biden cheered the strong employment report. ""More than 4 million jobs created since we took office,"" Biden wrote on Twitter. ""It's historic - and proof our economic plan is working."" 
(GRAPHIC: Nonfarm payrolls - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/lbpgnrxaqvq/nfpr.png) 
Hiring is being fueled by pent-up demand for workers in the labor-intensive services sector. Nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief money from the government and COVID-19 vaccinations are driving domestic demand. 
But a resurgence in infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, could discourage some unemployed people from returning to the labor force.
July's employment report could bring the Federal Reserve a step closer to announcing plans to start scaling back its monthly bond-buying program. The U.S. central bank last year slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero and is pumping money into the economy through the bond purchases.
""This is the last employment report Chair (Jerome) Powell sees before Jackson Hole, and we have to imagine that he lays the groundwork for a potential September tapering announcement,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""We think the odds continue to rise that tapering begins before the end of 2021.""
Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index hitting record highs. The dollar jumped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
BROAD EMPLOYMENT GAINS
Employment in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 380,000 jobs, accounting for 40% of the job gains, with payrolls at restaurants and bars advancing by 253,000.
Government payrolls increased by a whopping 240,000 jobs as employment in local government education rose by 221,000. Education jobs were flattered by a seasonal quirk. 
Hiring was also strong in the professional and business services, transportation and warehousing, and healthcare industries. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 27,000 jobs, while construction employment rebounded by 11,000 jobs. Retail trade and utilities were the only sectors to shed jobs. 
(GRAPHIC: Jobs by industry - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INDUSTRY/qmypmdoolvr/chart.png) 
Details of the smaller household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived were also upbeat. Household employment shot up by 1.043 million jobs, leading the unemployment rate to decline half a percentage point to its lowest level since March 2020. 
The jobless rate, however, continued to be understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Without this misclassification, the unemployment rate would have been 5.7% in July.
About 261,000 people entered the labor force, lifting the participation rate to 61.7% from 61.6% in June. The employment-to-population ratio, viewed as a measure of an economy's ability to create employment, rose to 58.4% from 58% in June.
Even more encouraging, the number of long-term unemployed dropped to 3.4 million from 4 million in the prior month. They accounted for 39.3% of the 8.7 million officially unemployed people, down from 42.1% in June. The duration of unemployment fell to 15.2 weeks from 19.8 weeks in June. 
(GRAPHIC: Unemployment duration - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/byprjoaygpe/ueduration.png) 
There was also an improvement in the number of people who have permanently lost their jobs. With economic growth this year expected to be around 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984, further recovery is expected. 
Faced with a record 9.2 million job openings, employers continued to raise wages to attract workers. Average hourly earnings increased 0.4% last month, with sharp gains in the hospitality industry. That followed a similar rise in June and lifted the year-on-year increase in wages to 4.0% from 3.7%. 
(GRAPHIC: Wage growth - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/mypmnmrebvr/wages.png) 
Lack of affordable child care and fears of contracting the coronavirus have been blamed for keeping workers, mostly women, at home. There also have been pandemic-related retirements as well as career changes. Republicans and business groups have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly payment from the federal government, for the labor crunch.

Half of the nation's states led by Republican governors have ended these federal benefits before their Sept. 6 expiration. Economists are cautiously optimistic that the worker shortage will ease in the fall when schools reopen for in-person learning and sustain the strong pace of hiring.
""August should be another big month, and September as well, as there are still millions who need to find work quickly,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories rose 1.1%, instead of 0.8% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers advanced 1.3% in May. Wholesale inventories increased 10.5% in June from a year earlier.
Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP increased 1.2% in June.
The government reported last week that consumer spending picked up in the second quarter, with outlays on goods rising solidly, even as demand rotates back to services because of COVID-19 vaccinations. The double-digit growth in consumer spending last quarter helped to lift the level of GDP above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Business inventories were depleted at a rapid clip in the second quarter. The goods trade deficit surged to a record high in June as imports rose to an all-time high, the government reported on Thursday.
Sales at wholesalers increased 2.0% in June after climbing 0.8% in May. At June's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.22 months to clear shelves, down from 1.23 in May.

Government payrolls added 240,000 jobs to the headline figure. Private payrolls posted a steady gain.
A resurgence in economic activity has sparked a surge in labor demand -- particularly in the leisure and hospitality industry -- since the beginning of the year. At the same time, payrolls remain well short of pre-pandemic levels and many employers have struggled to fill a record number of vacant positions.
The figures mark another step toward the Federal Reserve’s goal of “substantial” further progress in the labor market recovery. Fed officials including Chair Jerome Powell and Governor Lael Brainard have indicated the labor-market recovery had some way to go before the central bank could begin tapering asset purchases.
Fed Governor Christopher Waller said this week that if the next two monthly employment reports show continued gains, he could back such a move.

Although there are signs China's strong industrial recovery in the first half of the year may be losing some momentum, overseas demand has remained strong in recent months even as factories in many countries return from lockdowns.
Headline trade numbers are also being helped by the statistical base effects when compared with sharp declines a year ago.
Exports are expected to have risen 20.8% in July from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 21 economists, compared with a 32.2% gain in June.
Imports likely rose 33.0% last month year-on-year, the poll showed, compared to 36.7% growth in May. Despite China's attempts to cool surging raw materials prices, commodity prices remain elevated. 
Exports grew much faster than expected in June, as solid global demand led by easing lockdowns and vaccination drives eclipsed fresh virus outbreaks and port delays.
But overall trade growth in the world's second-biggest economy may slow in the second half of 2021, a customs official warned last month.
""Export growth has likely slowed further in July both in year-over-year and month-over-month terms...Korea also reported weaker growth of imports from China. A typhoon around Yangtze River Delta might have also reduced total trade growth in the month due to port disruptions,"" said analysts from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a note.
Exporters are grappling with higher freight costs and lingering logistics bottlenecks.
The acceleration in Delta-variant coronavirus outbreaks in several countries, coupled with natural disasters, has put huge pressure on global supply chains and slowed global container turnaround times.
Container shipping rates from China to the United States have scaled fresh highs above $20,000 per 40-foot box amid rising retailer orders ahead of the peak year-end U.S. shopping season.
China reported on Friday its highest daily count for new coronavirus cases in its current outbreak at 124, fuelled by a surge in locally transmitted infections in a growing number of cities. 
""The next two weeks would be critical to see whether (China is) still effective in dealing with the Delta variant. In any case, consumption, especially summer tourism, is under heavy pressure,"" Larry Hu from Macquarie Capital Limited said in a note.

China's factory activity expanded in July at the slowest pace in 17 months as higher raw material costs, equipment maintenance and extreme weather weighed on business activity, adding to concerns about a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy.
The trade surplus is expected to be $51.54 billion in July, from $51.53 billion in June, the poll showed. The data will be released on Saturday.

The Federal Statistics Office said industrial output dropped by 1.3% on the month after a downwardly revised decline of 0.8% in May. A Reuters poll had pointed to a rise of 0.5%.
The fall was driven by a drop in the production of capital goods, such as machinery and vehicles, which fell 2.9%, the data showed. Consumer goods output continued to grow, rising by 3.4%.
Industrial production fell by 0.6% in the quarter ending in June compared to the previous quarter, with the automotive industry reporting a drop of 11.2%.
In addition to timber shortage impacting the construction industry, the economy ministry said the drop was due to semiconductor supply bottlenecks. 
""The eagerly awaited semiconductors in Europe will continue to be a long time coming,"" said Thomas Gitzel, an economist at VP bank said.
Earlier on Friday, an Ifo economic institute survey showed that German industry cut its production outlook in June due to the supply issues.
""Bottlenecks for important intermediate products are now making themselves felt,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe, the head of surveys at ifo, said 

But the ministry and analysts remained cautiously optimistic about the overall outlook due to high demand and strong exports.
""If the flow of material starts up again, industrial production will be able to wipe out its gap,"" Gitzel said.

791,"<span>Aug 06, 2021 02:35AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices rose in July after falling in June as demand for bigger homes following pandemic lockdowns helped to soften the impact of a reduced tax break for buyers, mortgage lender Halifax said on Friday.
House prices last month were 0.4% higher than in June when they fell by a monthly 0.6%, Halifax said. 
In annual terms, prices were 7.6% higher than in July 2020, the slowest rise since March.
Russell Galley, Halifax managing director, said he expected the market to settle after the recent buying surge which was driven by the tax incentive, but a shortage of home on the market was likely to support prices.
Under the incentive scheme, the first 500,000 pounds ($696,000) of any property purchase in England or Northern Ireland were exempt from the stamp duty tax until the end of June. A 250,000 pound tax-free allowance is now running until the end of September.
Galley said the recovery in the economy from its coronavirus shock and higher confidence among consumers suggested annual price growth, while slowing, would remain ""well into positive territory by the end of the year.""

Rival mortgage lender Nationwide said last week its measure of house prices showed a monthly fall of 0.5% in July, the first drop since March. That slowed the annual increase to 10.5% from June's leap of 13.4%, the steepest in 17 years.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Desperation among homebuyers is pushing New Zealand house prices to record highs, overpowering the government's efforts to rein in the red-hot market and putting in jeopardy a key policy promise by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.
Nearly 15,000 homes sold for more than NZ$1 million ($705,100) during the last 12 months, compared with just 5,500 in 2020, according to the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand’s (REINZ) Million Dollar Price Report.
In the capital, Wellington, a 50-year-old derelict house deemed ""too dangerous to enter"" sold for almost NZ$1 million - a price far higher than expected.
""The new owners didn't step foot inside before purchasing it... even we could not enter,"" said Ben Atwill of real estate group Ray White, which made the sale. ""From what I am seeing, there is no stopping the premium dollars from coming through.""
Such runaway home prices have made New Zealand's property market one of the most unaffordable in the world, and measures introduced by the government and the central bank have so far done little to cool demand.
This is largely because of pandemic-inspired policies that have translated into cheaper mortgages, allowing affluent buyers and investors to upsize their homes and build up portfolios of rental investment properties, while locking out low and mid-income earners https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot/how-new-zealands-much-admired-covid-19-response-helped-fuel-housing-crisis-2021-04-16.
The government has tried to rein in the market with policy tweaks by applying new taxes for property investors and putting checks on ""flipping"" activity, in which investors buy a house, quickly renovate it and sell it for a large markup. Such investment has pushed house prices up by nearly 30% to a national average of NZ$820,000, on top of a 90% rise in the preceding decade.
Homebuyers don't want to miss out on what seems like a gold rush, and there is no evidence investors are leaving in a hurry, said independent economist Tony Alexander, who publishes a survey of real estate agents with REINZ.
""They (investors) know that if they stay longer they will come out better,"" Alexander told Reuters, adding that rising inflation was encouraging investment in real estate rather than in savings products.
'ALARM BELLS' 
New Zealand's central bank said this week that it was concerned about high-risk borrowing and that house prices were above sustainable levels. It is proposing tighter mortgage lending and debt-to-income restrictions https://www.reuters.com/article/newzealand-lending-rbnz-idUSL4N2P93NK.
Economists expect the bank to go further and raise interest rates at its policy meeting on Aug. 18.
""The Reserve Bank has highlighted that it's not seeing as much of a reaction to the changes made so far,"" said Brad Olsen, Principal Economist and Director at Infometrics. ""The risk of having such a large pile of debt has continued to ring alarm bells."" 
Housing has become a policy headache for Ardern, who secured a second term in office last year on the back of her success in handling the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand has had about 2,500 coronavirus cases, with the last one in February.
Opinion polls this week showed her party's popularity has dropped since the election, while her rivals were gaining support. 
When she was elected in 2017, one of the issues in her platform was ending the free run of property investors and building affordable homes. 
But her centre-left government's flagship affordable-housing project, Kiwibuild, foundered. The government has not been able to remove the red tape around land approval, making land artificially scarce. Private developers say the costs and consent process make properties unaffordable.
Ardern has so far been unwilling to introduce a capital gains tax to cool the market.
""Capital gains tax is a political dynamite,"" Olsen said. ""A lot of people who vote also own homes so the housing issue is inextricable linked to politics."" 

The Human Rights Commission this week launched an inquiry into the housing crisis https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-human-rights-commission-launches-inquiry-into-housing-crisis-2021-08-02, saying it was causing a humanitarian crisis as young people were being deprived of their basic right to live in a decent home.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely recovered slightly in the second quarter from a steep slump at the start of the year, a Reuters poll showed, as solid exports and capital expenditure cushioned some of the blow to consumption from the coronavirus pandemic.
But analysts expect the world's third-largest economy to lag other advanced nations emerging from the doldrums, as expanded state of emergency curbs and a resurgence in infections weigh on household spending.
""There won't be much of a rebound from the first quarter's big contraction. The data will show the economy continues to stagnate,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Conditions won't improve much in July-September, as expanded COVID-19 curbs and surging infections hurt consumption during the summer.""
Preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) data will show the economy grew an annualised 0.7% in April-June, after a 3.9% slump in the first quarter, according to analysts polled by Reuters. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP likely grew 0.2%, the poll showed.
Capital expenditure is forecast to have expanded 1.7% as manufacturers ramped up spending to make up for investment delays caused by the pandemic last year, the poll showed.
Consumption shrank 0.1% as the health crisis continued to weigh on service spending, though the drop is smaller than the previous quarter's 1.5% decline, the poll showed.
While exports remain strong, external demand likely shaved 0.1% point off growth as imports rose more than overseas shipments, according to the poll.
The government will release the GDP data at 8:50 a.m. on Aug. 16 (2350GMT, Aug. 15).
Separate data is expected to show wholesale inflation hit 5.0% in July from a year earlier, a sign rising raw material costs were hitting corporate margins, the poll showed.
The data is due 8:50 a.m. on Aug. 12 (2350GMT, Aug. 11).
Japan's economic contraction in the first quarter marked the first fall in three quarters, as curbs on activity to combat the pandemic hit consumption.
While robust global demand has boosted exports and capital expenditure, a worldwide chip shortage has disrupted auto production and clouded the outlook for Japanese manufacturers.

""Growth in exports and output appears to be slowing,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.
""Japan's factory output may experience some volatility if the chip shortage lasts longer than expected.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits declined further last week, while layoffs dropped to their lowest level in just over 21 years in July as companies held on to workers amid a labor shortage.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed the number of people on state jobless rolls dropped in late July to its lowest level since March 2020, when mandatory closures of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 cases.
Though the data falls outside the survey period for July's closely watched employment report, it bolstered economists' expectations for another month of strong payrolls gains. The employment report for July is due to be released on Friday.
""From an employment-estimating perspective, this suggests a hefty increase in nonfarm payrolls tomorrow,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 385,000 for the week ended July 31. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 fewer applications received than previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 384,000 applications for the latest week. Unadjusted claims, which economists say offer a better read of the labor market, decreased 20,602 to 323,763 last week. 
There is no sign yet that a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, is disrupting economic activity. Nearly half of the population has been fully vaccinated. 
Claims fell in Florida, one of the states hardest hit by the current COVID-19 wave. There were also notable declines in applications in Texas, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Tennessee. 
""The latest week's data was the first in the thick of rising Delta variant COVID-19 cases, and so far that rise in infections hasn’t pushed up layoffs,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""Together with microdata such as airline flights and restaurant bookings, it appears that for now, the economy overall is holding fast against the fourth wave of infections.""
Claims remain above their pre-pandemic level of 256,000, though they have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. There are still concerns that rising coronavirus cases could slow the labor market recovery amid a shortage of workers. There were a record 9.2 million job openings as of the end of May. About 9.5 million people are officially unemployed.

The economy fully recovered in the second quarter the sharp loss in output suffered during the very brief pandemic recession. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed the U.S. trade deficit surged to a record high in June as efforts by businesses to rebuild inventories to meet robust consumer spending drew in more imports.

The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 366,000 to 2.930 million during the week ended July 24, the lowest level since the pandemic started. The decline in the so-called continuing claims was led by California, which saw 256,370 people dropping off unemployment rolls. 
Continuing claims declined 59,809 in Pennsylvania. There were also decreases in some of the states led by Republican governors that terminated federal government benefits before their Sept. 6 expiration. 
Republicans and business groups have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly payment from the federal government, for the labor crunch. 
Still, the labor market recovery has a long way to go. About 12.975 million people were receiving unemployment checks under all programs in mid-July.
The Labor Department is expected to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 870,000 jobs in July after rising 850,000 in June, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would leave employment about 5.9 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
July's nonfarm payrolls estimate is highly uncertain, with labor market indicators mixed. In a separate report on Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers fell 7.5% to 18,942 in July, the lowest number since June 2000. 
So far this year, employers have announced 231,603 job cuts, down 87.5% compared to the same period last year.

Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed its employees working index rose moderately in July from June. The ADP employment report on Wednesday showed the smallest private payrolls gain in five months in July. 

That was, however, countered by two Institute for Supply Management surveys showing a rebound in manufacturing and services industries employment last month. The Conference Board's labor market differential, derived from data on consumers' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, in July hit its highest level since 2000.
""Labor market churn will pick up further in the coming months as the conditions in the labor market remain ripe for workers to seek better opportunities,"" said Dante DeAntonio, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada unexpectedly posted a trade surplus of C$3.23 billion ($2.58 billion) in June, the largest in almost 13 years, as exports jumped on higher shipments of oil and autos, Statistics Canada data indicated on Thursday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a trade deficit of C$0.68 billion in June. The surplus was the largest since the C$3.45 billion recorded in September 2008.
Exports leapt by 8.7%, the biggest increase since July 2020, to hit a record high C$53.76 billion as economies continue their recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""This is a very pleasant surprise,"" said Peter Hall, chief economist at Canada's export development agency.
""International supply chains are becoming less encumbered and ... fundamental underlying demand that has been with us all the way along is actually manifesting itself in growth,"" he said by phone.
The value of crude oil exports rose by 25.7% on higher volumes after a slowdown in production in April and May.
Exports of motor vehicles and parts - hobbled in recent months by a shortage of computer chips - rose by 14.9% but remain more than 8% lower than in June 2020.
""The auto sector is still struggling to cope with shortages and, with energy exports now close to a record high, the scope for further gains is limited,"" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said in a note.
The shortages also helped cut imports of autos and parts, which fell 3.8%. Overall imports dipped by 1.0%.
Royce Mendes, senior economist with CIBC, said in a note that exports of goods and services ""should provide less of a drag on GDP in the second quarter than previously anticipated"".

The Canadian dollar held onto earlier gains, trading at C$1.2504 to the U.S. dollar, or 80.0 U.S. cents.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that the trade gap increased 6.7% to $75.7 billion in June, an all-time high.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a $74.1 billion deficit. Goods imports rose 1.8% to $239.1 billion, also a record high. Exports of goods gained 0.2% to $145.9 billion in June, an all-time high.

JAKARTA (Reuters) -Indonesia pulled out of recession in the second quarter, reporting its strongest annual growth rate in 17 years, but analysts warned its economic recovery will suffer a setback due to a recent surge in COVID-19 infections.
Southeast Asia's largest economy grew 7.07% in the April-June quarter compared with a year earlier, its first expansion in five quarters, Statistics Indonesia reported on Thursday.
The expansion rate beat a 6.57% forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll and was the highest since the October-December quarter of 2004. The first quarter's contraction was revised to 0.71%.
Surging exports - including impressive 56% growth in commodity shipments - a rebound in consumption and investment, and bigger government spending boosted activity. 
However, the statistics bureau said the high growth rate was also due to low base effects when compared to the weak pandemic-stricken second quarter last year.
Despite the better-than-expected outcome, analysts are downgrading their outlooks for the economy due to the virus' resurgence and mobility restrictions imposed since July.
Indonesia recorded a grim milestone of more than 100,000 deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, with 3.57 million people infected, though health experts believe the true numbers may be far higher.
""Indonesia's GDP bounce will be short-lived,"" said Krystal Tan, an economist with ANZ who is among those pencilling in slower growth this year. ANZ's new forecast is 3.8%, down from 4%.
""The pace of recovery will be capped until COVID-19 risks fade.""
The central bank had already lowered its projection to a range of 3.5% to 4.3%, from 4.1% to 5.1%, slightly below the government's 3.7% to 4.5% outlook. Indonesia's economy shrank last year for the first time since 1998, by 2.1%. 
The current stay-at-home order, applied in areas with high infection numbers including much of Java and Bali islands, has been extended until at least Aug. 9, but authorities are eyeing a September reopening. Only essential and critical sectors of the economy are allowed to operate at varying capacities now. 
A few analysts flagged a risk of a double-dip recession if curbs are extended for longer.
The government is trying to bring down the number of people being treated with COVID-19 to around 100,000 per day, from 500,000 now, so that the economy can regain momentum in the fourth quarter and grow more than 5%, chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto said.
Authorities have also pledged to accelerate a vaccination drive, which many economists say is needed for a more sustainable recovery. Since the vaccination campaign began in January, just 8% of the population have been fully inoculated so far.
""Relatively slow vaccination progress means lockdowns may be needed from time to time to contain COVID outbreaks, which will likely result in a more volatile and delayed growth recovery,"" Oxford Economics said in a research note.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati also promised to accelerate spending and extend tax breaks.

Meanwhile, analysts say the central bank, which has slashed interest rates to record lows and injected over $57 billion of liquidity into the financial system, is unlikely to deliver more rate cuts.
A potential boost to GDP growth in the third quarter comes from strong demand for the country's commodities, said Bank Mandiri economist Faisal Rachman. In the second quarter, exports jumped nearly 32% on-year.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German industrial orders rose more than twice as much as expected in June, driven by bookings from domestic clients for large manufacturing products, but weaker turnover suggested that supply bottlenecks continued to hold back production.
The figures published by the Federal Statistics Office showed orders for goods 'Made in Germany' jumped by 4.1% on the month in seasonally adjusted terms.
This was the strongest increase in 10 months and easily beat a Reuters forecast of a 1.9% increase, more than offsetting a slightly revised drop of 3.2% in May.
Excluding major orders, new orders in manufacturing still rose 1.7% on the month.
Domestic orders soared nearly 10%, with producers of data processing equipment, lens systems, planes and ships benefiting from unusually strong demand, the economy ministry said.
""Incoming orders also rose in the important car and mechanical engineering sectors,"" the ministry added.
Orders for engineering companies soared 53% in June from the previous year due to stronger demand from both domestic and foreign customers, industry association VDMA said on Thursday.
""Investments in equipment, machines and services are high on the agenda around the world,"" VDMA chief economist Ralph Wiechers said.
The German economy, Europe's largest, returned to growth in the second quarter but bounced back less strongly than expected as manufacturers struggle to get intermediate goods and building materials to ramp up production.
""Although the order backlog is high, it cannot be processed quickly due to ongoing delivery bottlenecks for intermediate products and materials,"" Bankhaus Lampe analyst Bastian Hepperle said.
In a further sign that more orders are currently not translating into higher output, real turnover in manufacturing fell by 1.4% on the month in June in seasonally adjusted terms, the office said. On the year, real turnover rose by 8.6%.
The supply bottlenecks in manufacturing will continue to hold back production, so industry is likely to slow down the economic recovery in the third quarter as well, Hepperle added.
Undersupply of semiconductors, as outbreaks of the Delta coronavirus variant in Southeast Asia have crippled its factory sector, is leading to production downtimes in the car industry and many other industrial sectors.
""But the shortage of skilled workers is also becoming more and more noticeable,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said.

The current recovery is supported by strong retail sales, which jumped in May and June following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions.
A survey indicated on Wednesday that domestic demand remains strong, with activity in the service sector growing at the fastest pace on record in July.

LONDON (Reuters) - Activity in Britain's construction industry grew last month at its weakest pace since February due to shortages of building materials and contractors, adding to signs of post-COVID bottlenecks in the economy.
The IHS Markit/CIPS construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell from June's 24-year high of 66.3 to 58.7 in July. This was the PMI's lowest reading since February and the sharpest single-month drop since April 2020, Britain's first full month of COVID lockdown.
While the PMI still points to solid growth in the sector, economists polled by Reuters had expected a much smaller slowdown to a reading of 64.0.
""Long lead times for materials and shrinking sub-contractor availability were cited as factors holding back work on site,"" IHS Markit's economics director, Tim Moore, said.
Some construction firms also reported that a spike in demand when lockdown restrictions first eased earlier in 2021 was now beginning to wane.
Separate data released overnight by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors painted a similar picture of supply constraints, including growing shortages of bricklayers, carpenters and quantity surveyors.
Britain's economy is bouncing back rapidly this year after suffering its biggest fall in output in more than three centuries in 2020.
But there has been a sharp rise in inflation pressures due to a mix of higher oil prices and supply-chain bottlenecks as the world economy emerges from months of lockdowns.
The Bank of England is expected to revise up its forecasts for inflation later on Thursday, and some economists see British inflation - currently 2.5% - hitting a 10-year high of about 4% around the turn of the year.
The BoE, like most other central banks, expects this spike in inflation to ease next year once the initial effects of lifting lockdowns have passed.

The construction PMI pointed to big inflation pressures in the pipeline, as construction firms' costs grew only slightly less fast than the 24-year high recorded in June.
""Supply imbalances were amplified by a lack of transport availability, port congestion, and Brexit trade frictions,"" IHS Markit said.

800,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 04:26AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - British new car sales fell by 29.5% to their lowest July level since 1998 as the 'pingdemic' of people self-isolating alongside supply shortages hit demand, according to an industry body.
Whilst July 2020 was boosted by being the first full month dealerships were open across Britain after the initial lockdown, this year has been hit by a semiconductor shortage in the industry and people having to self-isolate due to catching COVID-19 or being in contact with someone who had. 
As cases rose last month, hundreds of thousands of people were being ""pinged"" by the National Health Service's contact-tracing app to isolate for 10 days, although it has now been tweaked to reduce the numbers contacted. 

A total of 123,296 vehicles were registered in July, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which said it is marginally downgrading its full-year forecast to around 1.82 million cars. 
""The next few weeks will see changes to self-isolation policies which will hopefully help those companies across the industry dealing with staff absences, but the semiconductor shortage is likely to remain an issue until at least the rest of the year,"" SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. services industry activity jumped to a record high in July, boosted by the shift in spending to services from goods, but businesses continued to pay higher prices for inputs because of supply constraints.
The Institute for Supply Management survey on Wednesday also showed a rebound in a gauge of services industry employment last month. That eased worries of a sharp slowdown in job growth, which had been stoked by the ADP Employment Report showing the smallest gain in private payrolls in five months in July.
The bounce back in the ISM services employment index followed a similar reading for the manufacturing sector. The economy is pushing ahead after fully recovering in the second quarter the sharp loss in output suffered during the very brief COVID-19 pandemic recession.
""For months, employers have struggled to find labor and employment numbers have been held down from the worker side rather than a lack of demand from companies,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""These increases bode well for Friday's employment report. ADP has not been very useful this year.""
The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing activity index raced to 64.1 last month, the highest reading since the series started in 2008, from 60.1 in June. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index climbing to 60.5.
All services industries reported growth, with anecdotes of pent-up demand as ""companies begin to fully reopen and remote workers return to offices."" 
Demand is rotating back to services as nearly half of the population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing people to travel, frequent restaurants, visit casinos and attend sporting events among services-related activities that were curbed early in the pandemic in favor of goods.
Government data last week showed spending on services accelerated sharply in the second quarter, helping to lift the level of gross domestic product above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders received by services businesses increased to a reading of 63.7 from 62.1 in June. Further gains are likely in the months ahead, with inventories lean and inventory sentiment among customers poor. Businesses depleted inventories at a rapid clip in the second quarter. Stocks at retailers are well below normal levels.
U.S. stocks were trading lower after a record close for the S&P 500 index. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
PORTS CONGESTION
The strong demand is continuing to strain supply chains. The survey's measure of supplier deliveries rose to 72.0 from a reading of 68.5 in June. A reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. Some businesses complained about the scarcity of appliances, laptops as well as rental cars. Others said heating, ventilation and air conditioning repairs also were impacted by longer than normal lead times for replacement units.
Wholesalers said congestion at the ports of Long Beach/Los Angeles and Seattle had increased lead time by 15 days. They were also facing additional delays at the Chicago rail yard. 
With bottlenecks in the supply chain persisting, a measure of prices paid by services industries surged to 82.3, the highest reading in nearly 16 years, from 79.5 in June. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that inflation will moderate as supply constraints abate.
Services industries hired more workers in July, though labor shortages lingered, especially in the accommodation and food services sector. A measure of services industry employment rebounded to a reading of 53.8 from 49.3 in June. 
That offset the ADP report showing private payrolls rose by 330,000 jobs last month, less than half of the 695,000 that had been anticipated by a Reuters survey of economists. 
The slowdown in hiring last month was across all business sizes and industries. Leisure and hospitality payrolls increased by 139,000 jobs, below the 330,000 average in the second quarter. Economists said this suggested the early terminations of benefits in at least 20 states led by Republican governors was not forcing low-wage earners to return to work.
Factories added only 8,000 jobs in July. A global shortage of semiconductors is hampering production in the automobile sector. Hiring at construction sites stalled as expensive lumber and scarce building materials constrain homebuilding.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive, and closely watched employment report for July on Friday. It, however, has a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employment report because of methodology differences.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls likely increased by 750,000 jobs in July after rising 662,000 in June. With government employment expected to have increased by about 130,000, thanks to education-related hiring, that would lead to overall payrolls advancing by 880,000 jobs in July. The economy created 850,000 jobs in June. 
July's nonfarm payrolls estimate is highly uncertain, with labor market indicators mixed. Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed its employees working index rising moderately in July compared to June. 
The Conference Board's labor market differential, derived from data on consumers' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, in July hit its highest level since 2000.
Education payrolls typically fall by at least 1 million in July, before adjusting for seasonal fluctuations, as schools and universities close for summer. 

This year, however, many students are in summer school catching up after disruptions caused by the pandemic. Economists anticipate a small decline in education employment, which would boost the seasonally adjusted payrolls for the sector.
""We are maintaining our forecast for the BLS report to show 900,000 jobs added in July, with 550,000 coming from the private sector,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

That contrasts with signs of an easing in supply and price pressures reported in the ISM's manufacturing survey on Monday. 
RISING PRICES
Last month, a measure of prices paid by services industries surged to 82.3, the highest reading in nearly 16 years, from 79.5 in June. 
Some economists worry that higher inflation could be more persistent than currently envisioned by the Federal Reserve.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that inflation will moderate as supply constraints abate. The U.S. central bank's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, shot up 3.5% year-on-year in June, the largest gain since December 1991.
Services industries hired more workers in July. A measure of services industry employment rebounded to a reading of 53.8 from 49.3 in June. 
That together with a pick-up in hiring at factories bodes well for July's employment report, due to be released on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 880,000 jobs last month after rising by 850,000 in June. Employers are struggling to find willing workers to fill a record 9.2 million job openings even as 9.5 million people are officially unemployed. 
Lack of affordable child care and fears of contracting the coronavirus have been blamed for keeping workers, mostly women, at home. There have also been pandemic-related retirements as well as career changes. Republicans and business groups have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly check from the federal government, for the labor crunch.

While more than 20 states led by Republican governors have ended these federal benefits before they were scheduled to run out in early September, there has been little evidence that the terminations boosted hiring. 
The labor shortage is expected to ease in the fall when schools reopen for in-person learning, but a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, could see some people reluctant to return to the labor force.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity roared in July, expanding at its fastest pace in 15 years, as the lifting of more coronavirus restrictions and an accelerated vaccine drive injected life into the bloc's dominant service industry, a survey showed.
But supply chain disruptions and labour shortages meant input prices surged at the fastest rate in over two decades and fears of further curbs to contain the more infectious Delta variant of COVID-19 dented optimism.
IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, climbed to 60.2 last month from June's 59.5, its highest level since June 2006, well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, though slightly below a 60.6 ""flash"" estimate.
With more of the services industry reopening, the sector's PMI index rose to its highest final reading since June 2006.
""Across the bloc, the services PMIs remain comfortably in expansionary territory as the services sector benefits from easing restrictions,"" said Katharina Koenz at Oxford Economics.
Services activity in Germany, Europe's largest economy, expanded at a record pace. In France, the bloc's second biggest economy, growth remained elevated but dipped slightly more than originally thought.
Italy's services sector grew in July at its fastest rate for 14 years and although Spain's growth was off June's highs it remained strong.
In Britain, outside the euro zone and the European Union, private-sector growth slowed sharply due to supply-chain bottlenecks and high worker absences prompted by COVID-19 isolation requirements. [GB/PMIS]
DELTA RISK
Manufacturing activity continued to expand at a blistering pace last month, a sister survey showed on Monday, but widespread shortages of materials and poor transport availability pushed the factory input prices index to its highest reading since the survey began in June 1997. [EUR/PMIM]
Inflationary pressures were also felt by services firms and the composite input price index nudged up to its highest in nearly 21 years.

Meanwhile, a Reuters poll last month indicated that the biggest risk to the bloc's economic outlook was new COVID-19 variants and, with the Delta strain sweeping across Europe, the services business expectations index slipped to a three-month low. [ECILT/EU]
""Looking ahead, downside risks to the 2021 outlook remain. For the services sector it will be pivotal to maintain the high vaccination speed to limit the spread of the already prevalent Delta variant,"" Koenz said.

(Reuters) - The 30-year U.S. mortgage rate fell below 3% last week for the first time since February as interest rates globally drifted lower.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages decreased to 2.97% from 3.01% in the week ending July 30.
After hitting record lows late last year below 2.9%, mortgage rates climbed in the first part of this year and peaked in the spring. Rates have been drifting lower since, held down in large part by the U.S. Federal Reserve's extraordinary stimulus measures aimed at helping the economy rebound from the coronavirus pandemic.

The seasonally adjusted market index fell 1.7% from a week earlier, the MBA said. That reflected a 1.7% decrease in applications to refinance existing loans, while purchase applications also declined 1.7%.
""Purchase application volume decreased again, reflecting the ongoing lack of inventory that continues to drive rapid home-price appreciation across the country,"" Mike Fratantoni, MBA's senior vice president and chief economist, said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - British private-sector growth slowed sharply last month due to supply-chain bottlenecks and high worker absences prompted by COVID-19 isolation requirements, a closely watched survey indicated on Wednesday.
Price pressures rose by the most since the survey began 25 years ago - a concern for the Bank of England as it finalises new inflation forecasts due on Thursday. To date, the BoE has said higher inflation will be temporary.
The IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) sank to 59.6 in July, its lowest reading since March, from 62.4 in June. The broader composite PMI, which includes Tuesday's manufacturing PMI data, showed a similar drop, to 59.2 from 62.2.
""More businesses are experiencing growth constraints from supply shortages of labour and materials, while on the demand side we've already seen the peak phase of pent-up consumer spending,"" said IHS Markit's economics director, Tim Moore.
July's final PMI readings were well above preliminary ""flash"" data, however. IHS Markit said this reflected a boost to services businesses from the lifting of most remaining COVID-19 restrictions in England on July 19. 
Britain's economy is rebounding fast after suffering its biggest fall in output in more than 300 years in 2020, but most economists think the fastest growth probably came in the three months to June, when COVID rules eased most. 
Service businesses were hit last month by a ""pingdemic"" of hundreds of thousands of workers having to self-isolate for up to 10 days after being identified by a government smartphone app as a close contact of someone who had tested positive for coronavirus.
The daily number of new COVID-19 cases has now fallen by more than half since a peak on July 17 - just before social-distancing rules eased in England - and the government will relax self-isolation requirements from Aug. 16.

Even so, many businesses are finding it hard to recruit staff. Employment growth in the survey slowed to its weakest in three months, while service exports continue to be hampered by COVID-related travel restrictions.
Wage costs, higher fuel prices and transport were the biggest factors pushing up costs in the service sector, where managers reported raising prices by the most since July 1996.

IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)measuring activity in the sector rose to 61.8 in July from 57.5 in June. The July reading was the strongest since the survey began more than 24 years ago.
The composite PMI index, which comprises both the service and manufacturing sectors, rose to 62.4 in July from 60.1 in June, surpassing a previous record set in June 2006.
""The ramping up of activity is ... proving to be good news for workers, with companies taking on extra staff at an unprecedented rate,"" said Andrew Harker, Economics Director at IHS Markit.

""Inflationary pressures remain elevated, however, and companies will take little solace from the fact that costs rose at a slightly weaker pace than in June. With the sector running hot and severe pressure on capacity signalled, rising costs look set to remain a feature in the near term at least,"" he added.
German retail sales rose much more than expected in June following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, data showed on Monday, supporting hopes of a consumer-driven recovery in Europe's largest economy over the summer months.

BANGKOK/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Fresh outbreaks of the Delta coronavirus variant in Southeast Asia have crippled its factory sector, disrupting global supplies of goods such as rubber gloves, semiconductors and SUVs and threatening the $3 trillion region's recovery.
A series of factory surveys this week showed business activity across most Southeast Asian economies fell sharply in July, a contrast to more resilient manufacturing economies in Northeast Asia and the West, where business growth has slowed but remained in expansion.
The economic disruptions in Southeast Asia caused by the virus have been made worse by slow progress in vaccinations in the region of 600 million people. Governments have struggled to secure doses and have imposed costly lockdowns that have left many factories without workers.
The setbacks threaten the growth of one of the world's more resilient emerging market blocs, which has withstood various global crises in recent decades thanks to broad robust economic reforms and its proximity to China.
HSBC economists warn the low inoculation rates in Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand, as well as the uncertain efficacy of their vaccines, put their economies at risk.
""This means that populations in these countries could remain vulnerable not only to the current outbreak, but any future mutations that may develop,"" HSBC said. ""Touch-and-go restrictions are likely to continue, weighing on the near-term growth outlook.""
For Southeast Asia's manufacturers, which are competitive largely because of low-cost labour and access to raw materials, the impact of new outbreaks on labour supply has been a major production bottleneck.
In Thailand, Asia's fourth-largest auto exporter and a production base for major global car brands,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp suspended production at three of its plants in July in July due to parts shortages caused by the pandemic.
HIGH DEMAND, LOW PRODUCTION
Siam Agro-Food Industry, a Thai processed fruit exporter, is heavily reliant on migrant labour and has only been able to fill 400 of the 550 roles as workers return to their countries and are unable to return due to closed borders.
""There are 350 tonnes of fruit per day but now we can take only 250 tonnes because of not enough workers to process,"" said Ghanyapad Tantipipatpong, president of Siam Agro-Food Industry.
""There is strong demand from export markets, such as the United States, our main market. The problem now is with the production.""
In Vietnam, which hosts facilities belonging to global companies such as Samsung (KS:005930), Foxconn and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), companies in the country's south have been forced to keep workers isolated at their production sites at night.
Industrial output in several southern cities and provinces where strict movement curbs were imposed from July, has fallen sharply, the government's statistics office said last week.
In Malaysia, which supplies about 67% of the global rubber glove market, lockdown restrictions forced many glove makers to suspend operations in June and July.
Eased restrictions since then have allowed 60% of the work force to return after the country's glove-making association pleaded with the government for the industry to resume, citing concerns from global buyers. The association is now calling for a full return.
Already, disruptions in Southeast Asia are causing pain elsewhere with German chipmaker Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) Technologies expecting a hit in the tens of millions of dollars from shutdowns at its Malaysia plant. The slowdown will in turn affect Infineon's automotive clients.
Daniel Bernbeck, CEO of the Malaysian-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Malaysia's strict quarantine rules have also made it difficult for higher-end manufacturers such as chipmakers to bring it the technical expertise needed.
Analysts warn the risks go beyond just the hit to production.

Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service said Asia-Pacific economies with ""concentrated economic structures"" and weak institutions would be hit hardest.
""These are economies with lower-middle incomes, with deep scarring likely to increase social risks,"" Moody's said. ""In some of these economies, high debt burdens are limiting governments' fiscal space to withstand the pandemic.""

Restrictions imposed by local governments to curb the devastating second wave of COVID-19 were relaxed over the past few months following a drop in infection rates, but the threat of a third wave has cast a shadow over the already weak economic outlook. [ECILT/IN]
Although the Services Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by IHS Markit, rose to 45.4 in July from 41.2 in June it stayed firmly below the 50-level separating growth from contraction for a third month.
Overall demand in the sector shrank again last month, albeit at a slower pace, and overseas demand declined for a 17th month - the longest streak since the sub-index started in September 2014.
""The current COVID-19 environment continued to weigh on the performance of the service sector that is so crucial to the Indian economy,"" noted Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. 
""July data was somewhat disappointing, with incoming new business and output falling solidly over the month, but there was at least a slowdown in rates of contraction.""
That weak demand and a dour outlook pushed services firms to cut headcounts for an eighth month, indicating it may take a long time for the labour market to reach pre-pandemic levels.
Meanwhile, business expectations turned negative for the first time since July last year.
""Uncertainty over when the pandemic will end, as well as concerns about inflationary pressures and financial troubles, dampened business confidence in July,"" added De Lima.
Both input costs and prices charged increased at a faster pace last month, with the latter surging at the quickest rate in eight months.

Still, the Reserve Bank of India is expected to keep key interest rates untouched until the next fiscal year to help the economy through the pandemic.
An overall composite index rose to 49.2 last month from June's 43.1, staying below the 50-mark for a third month as the contraction in services offset a rebound in manufacturing.

Investing.com – China’s services sector recorded accelerating growth in July, even as the country’s latest outbreak of COVID-19 threatens to hamper the country’s economic recovery from COVID-19.
The Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was 54.9 in July, higher than the 50.3 figure from the previous month and was at its highest point since May 2021. The figure was above the 50-mark indicating growth.
The Caixin manufacturing PMI, released on Monday, was a lower-than-expected 50.3 in July.
The better reading from the private survey, whose focus is more on smaller firms in coastal regions, contrasted with those from the official survey released during the previous week. The non-manufacturing PMI was 53.3, and the manufacturing PMI was 50.4, both lower than expected.
The service sector has trailed its manufacturing counterpart in recovering from COVID-19 but had slowly been closing that gap as consumption increased. However, China’s latest outbreak of COVID-19 cases, which has spread to nearly half of the country's 32 provinces within just two weeks, threatens to put a big dent into the country’s economic recovery.
The July readings were buoyed by the successful containment of COVID-19 cases in southern China, although the impact from the latest round of outbreaks since late July was likely to hurt PMI readings in the next month, according to Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe.
""The economy still faces enormous downward pressure, and we need to ensure business owners remain confident,"" Wang added.
China's latest COVID-19 outbreak started with the city of Nanjing confirming its first cases involving the Delta variant of the virus. It has since to numerous cities in southern China and a few northern ones, including Beijing. One sector already feeling the impact is tourism, as the reimplementation of restrictive measures to curb the outbreak’s spread will dampen the peak summer travel demand.
The survey also said new export orders fell again as other countries struggle with their own COVID-19 outbreaks. However, business confidence picked up, even though it was slightly lower than its long-term average. On the jobs front, service sector employment returned to slight growth in July as companies aimed to control costs."

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)rose to 54.9 in July, the highest since May and up from 50.3 the previous month. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The better readings in the private survey, which focuses more on smaller firms in coastal regions, stood in contrast with findings in an official survey on Saturday which showed growth in the services sector retreat slightly in July. 
China's services sector has been slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, but has been helped by a gradual improvement in consumption in recent months. A rise in domestic coronavirus infections, however, is threatening to hurt the economy's steady recovery.
The July readings were buoyed by the successful containment of COVID-19 cases in southern China, said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, although he warned that the impact from the latest round of outbreaks since late July was likely to hurt August's PMI readings. 
""The economy still faces enormous downward pressure, and we need to ensure business owners remain confident,"" Wang said. 
Since the eastern city of Nanjing confirmed its first Delta cases on July 20, numerous cities in southern China and a few in the north including Beijing, have reported infections. The tally of locally transmitted cases stood at 414 as of Monday.
Tourism is already taking a hit, as local authorities encourage people to stay put to avoid infection, which will be a blow for industries looking forward to peak summer travel demand.
A sub-index of new business in the Caixin survey stood at 54.5 in July, up from 50.5 the previous month. New export orders contracted again due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases overseas. 

Business confidence picked up, although it was still slightly lower than its long-term average. Service sector employment returned to growth in July but the rate of job creation was only slight as firms looked to control costs.
Caixin's July composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, rose to 53.1 from June's 50.6.

811,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 07:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand’s unemployment rate fell more than forecast in the second quarter as the economy’s recovery boosted hiring and began to stoke wage inflation. The kiwi dollar rose as traders increased bets on higher interest rates.
The jobless rate fell to 4% from a revised 4.6% in the first quarter, Statistics New Zealand said Wednesday in Wellington. Economists expected 4.4%. Employment rose 1% from the previous three months. Private sector, ordinary time wages increased the most in 13 years.
The labor market report is the latest sign that the economy may be overheating, and that the Reserve Bank could start to raise interest rates as soon as this month to keep a lid on price pressures. Annual inflation surged to 3.3% in the second quarter, breaching the central bank’s 1-3% target range.
The kiwi dollar climbed after the report. It bought 70.43 U.S. cents at 10:54 a.m. in Wellington from 70.24 cents immediately before the release.
Investors lifted bets on rate increases, with a quarter-point hike now fully priced in for the RBNZ’s next review on Aug. 18 and at least one more expected by the end of the year.
The RBNZ, which is required to support maximum employment as well as stable inflation, began reducing monetary stimulus last month by ceasing quantitative easing, saying economic conditions since late 2020 had been consistently stronger than anticipated.
Yesterday, Governor Adrian Orr said economic spending has recovered to above pre-Covid levels and the monetary policy committee “needs to think about when and how we would return interest rates to more normal levels.”
Policy Normalization
New Zealand is in the vanguard of developed-world central banks that are beginning to normalize policy and is set to become one of the first to raise rates in the wake of the pandemic. South Korea has also signaled it could lift borrowing costs this year. Still, the Federal Reserve last week indicated there is some way to go before it starts to scale back bond buying, while Australia yesterday said it doesn’t expect to raise rates before 2024.
New Zealand business confidence rebounded in late 2020 after a V-shaped economic recovery boosted by the nation’s success in eliminating community transmission of the virus. The jobless rate never hit the highs feared when the pandemic first hit.
New Zealand employment rose for a third straight quarter after slumping in mid-2020, and also gained 1.7% from a year earlier. Economists had forecast 1.2% annual growth. The participation rate increased to 70.5% from 70.4% in the three months through March. Economists projected 70.5%.
Statistics New Zealand said the underutilization rate, which is a broader gauge that includes employed persons seeking additional hours, fell to 10.5% from 12.1% in the first quarter.
Ordinary time wages for non-government workers rose 0.9% in the quarter, the most since 2008, the statistics agency said. From a year earlier, wage growth picked up to 2.2% from 1.6% in the 12 months through March.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods increased more than expected in June, while business spending on equipment was solid, pointing to sustained strength in manufacturing even as spending is shifting away from goods to services.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that factory orders rose 1.5% in June after advancing 2.3% in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders increasing 1.0%. 
Orders soared 18.4% on a year-on-year basis. Demand pivoted towards goods during the COVID-19 pandemic as millions of Americans were cooped up at home, boosting manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. But the surge in demand is straining the supply chain.
""We expect a solid growth path for the factory data through 2021, capped by capacity constraints and supply chain problems,"" said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado. 
The Institute for Supply Management reported on Monday that manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in July for the second straight month as raw material shortages persisted. The survey, however, suggested that supply chain bottlenecks were starting to ease.
Spending is rotating back to services as nearly half of the population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing people to travel, frequent restaurants, visit casinos and attend sporting events among services-related activities that were curbed early in the pandemic. 
(GRAPHIC: Factory orders - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/zjpqkqmeepx/factoryorders.png) 
BROAD GAINS
The increase in factory goods orders in June was broad, with notable gains in machinery, computers and electronic products, as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components.
Orders for transportation equipment increased 2.0%, boosted by a surge in bookings at Boeing (NYSE:BA). But motor vehicle orders fell 0.3%. Auto production is being hampered by a global shortage of semiconductors. 
Though momentum is slowing, manufacturing will likely continue to expand. Unfilled orders at factories increased 1.0% in June. Shipments advanced 1.6%. The unfilled orders-to-shipments ratio fell to 6.94 from 6.96 in May. Inventories climbed 1.0% after increasing 1.1% in May. The inventories-to-shipments ratio slipped to 1.48 from 1.49 in May. 
The increase in factory inventories in June was bigger than what the government assumed in its advance estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product published last week. 
The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that GDP grew at a 6.5% annualized rate last quarter, picking up from the first quarter's 6.3% pace. That hoisted the level of GDP well above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Economists anticipated that GDP growth could be raised to as high as a 6.7% rate when the government publishes its revision later this month.
""It now looks like the BEA data will need to be revised up,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We continue to expect inventories to boost GDP growth significantly in third quarter following the big pullback reported through the second quarter. We also think equipment spending will continue to increase at a solid rate in the third quarter.""
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, rose a solid 0.7% in June instead of 0.5% as reported last month. 

(GRAPHIC: Core capital goods - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/klpykelzkpg/corecap.png) 
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, advanced 0.6% as estimated last month. Business spending on equipment was robust in the second quarter, notching the fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth.

(Reuters) -U.S. consumers' demand for new debt grew in the second quarter and credit card use rebounded, reversing the trend of declining card use seen earlier in the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report released on Tuesday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
Total household debt increased by $313 billion in the second quarter to $14.96 trillion, the New York Fed said in its quarterly report on household debt and credit. Mortgage debt continued to be the biggest driver of that growth, rising by $282 billion to $10.44 trillion by the end of June. 
""We have seen a very robust pace of originations over the last four quarters with new extensions of credit for mortgages and auto loans combined with rebounding demand for credit card borrowing,"" Joelle Scally, administrator of the Center for Microeconomic Data at the New York Fed, said in a statement. 
Credit card balances ticked up in the second quarter as consumers boosted spending, increasing by $17 billion after mostly declining since the start of 2020. Despite the increase, credit card balances were still $140 billion below where they were at the end of 2019. 
In another sign that consumers' demand for credit is growing, the number of credit inquiries made within the past six months increased by 3.7% to $121 million, reversing the decline that started in the second quarter of 2020.
New extensions of credit for mortgages and auto loans reached record highs in the second quarter, the study found. Auto loan originations, which include both loans and leases, reached $202 billion.
A total of $1.22 trillion in new mortgage debt was originated in the second quarter, including mortgage refinances. Some 71% of those loans went to borrowers with high credit scores, the report found. 

A total of $4.58 trillion in mortgage loans were originated over the past four quarters - the equivalent of 44% of total mortgage debt outstanding. Roughly 40% of originations were for home purchases and 60% were for refinances, New York Fed researchers said. 
Still, some homeowners continued to struggle with their loans. Just under 2 million mortgages remained in forbearance programs at the end of June, down from 9.3 million earlier in the pandemic, New York Fed researchers said in a blog post https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2021/08/forbearance-participation-declines-as-programs-end-nears published on Tuesday.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 56.2 in July from 56.5 in June. It was the lowest reading since February but still well above the 50 threshold which shows growth in the sector.
""Another robust improvement in operating conditions was seen across Canada's manufacturing sector in July,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. ""A further easing of virus-related restrictions and greater consumer confidence encouraged domestic demand.""
The measure of output rose to 54.4 from 53.8 in June, while the new orders index was at 55.3, edging up from 55.1.
Delivery delays and material scarcity made it difficult for firms to keep up with demand. The backlogs of work index climbed to the second highest in the series history at 56.0 from 53.6 in June and cost pressures continued to rise.
Still, strong demand allowed some costs to be passed on, with the measure of output prices rising to 65.2 from 64.9 in June, and firms remained upbeat about prospects for growth.

""With the vaccine rollout gaining momentum, and case numbers declining, a busy second half of the year is sure to follow,"" Patel said.
More than 81% of Canadians eligible for COVID-19 vaccines have had one shot, and more than 66% are fully inoculated.

LONDON (Reuters) -The British public's expectations for inflation over the coming year jumped in July in response to recent rising prices,although longer-term expectations remained stable, a monthly survey showed on Tuesday.
The Citi/YouGov survey showed public inflation expectations for the next 12 months rose to 3.1% in July from 2.8% in June, taking this measure further above its long-run average though below December's peak of 3.8%.
British consumer price inflation hit a three-year high of 2.5% in June and the Bank of England looks set to raise its near-term inflation forecasts on Thursday, though it is likely to stress that the increase will be temporary.
Longer-term inflation expectations for the next five to 10 years held steady at 3.4%.
Citi said the rise in short-run price expectations probably reflected fears of higher household energy bills later this year as well as the recent faster-than-expected rise in CPI due to higher oil prices and post-COVID supply-chain bottlenecks.
The BoE could draw some comfort from the fact that this had not yet fed into longer-run inflation expectations, but would need to be watchful that higher headline inflation later in 2021 did not push long-term price expectations higher.
""A marked increase here could yet force the Bank to tighten policy even if the recovery is incomplete,"" Citi said.

The BoE looks at public inflation expectations as a guide to how businesses will set prices and the extent to which workers will push for bigger pay rises.
The survey also showed that an above-average percentage of people surveyed said they did not know how inflation would change in future, creating a greater chance of a shift in long-term expectations, Citi added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - High-frequency data indicate U.S. hiring slowed in July - not held steady as widely expected - with particular softness among states that ended federal unemployment benefits and areas where the COVID-19 Delta variant is raging.
Payroll firm UKG said growth in employees across a wide set of industries grew 1.1% from mid-June to mid-July, coinciding with the period when the federal government employment survey is conducted. That was about half the 2% rate of growth seen between May and June, ahead of a blockbuster June national jobs report showing 850,000 additional positions added to payrolls.
Data on small business hiring from time management company Homebase also fell from mid-June to mid-July.
Notably, a UKG analysis of data spanning the period when 26 states began halting federal unemployment benefits showed that growth in work shifts in those states was half of what it was elsewhere - 2.2% from May through July versus 4.1%.
That adds to an accumulating body of evidence that the gamble a largely Republican group of governors made in halting the $300 weekly stipends didn't parlay into more jobs. 
""People are returning to work on their own. We just haven't seen the surge of people returning that businesses were hoping for,"" said UKG vice president Dave Gilbertson. He anticipates a smaller number of jobs added in July than in June. 
National jobs and unemployment data will be updated Friday in a Labor Department report closely watched for evidence about the path of a U.S. economy that has already returned to pre-pandemic levels in terms of output but remains roughly 7 million jobs shy of where it was in early 2020.
In contrast with Gilbertston's view, the median estimate of economists polled by Reuters is that hiring continued apace in July, with companies forecast to have added 880,000 payroll jobs.
DELTA HEADWINDS
Gilbertson said he still anticipated strong hiring in the fall as schools presumably reopen and daily life continues to notch back toward normal.
That may well depend, however, on how the economy responds to the resurgence of coronavirus infections led by the highly contagious Delta variant. Evidence may be emerging that the renewed outbreak is taking a toll, particularly in some of those Republican-led states where hiring has proved stodgy despite the early cutoff of the unemployment benefits.
A state-level recovery index from Oxford Economics, for example, points to a drop in economic activity and employment among high-infection states like Florida, Missouri and Arkansas. 
Graphic: High-infection states may be sliding, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/JOBS/zgvomwyrmvd/chart.png 
""Recoveries were either flat or weaker in the high breakout states,"" said Oxford lead U.S. economist Oren Klachkin, leading the firm's national recovery index to decline for the first time since April. Worsening health data nationally may ""show the recovery slipping.""
So far that has not been evident in other data series. 
The Transportation Security Administration showed 4.2 million travelers checked onto flights last weekend, about 85% of the comparable weekend in 2019 and in line with recent weeks. OpenTable showed diners continued turning up at restaurants at levels comparable to 2019. 
During the pandemic economists have paid particular attention to ""mobility,"" the movement of people outside their homes, as a general sign of recovery. As of now, Klachkin said, it ""hasn't slowed.""
MINIMAL IMPACT FROM CUTTING BENEFITS
But neither does the U.S. economy seem to be kicking into a higher gear when it comes to hiring. 
With roughly one job available for every person estimated to be unemployed, economists have puzzled over why positions aren't filling faster, and offered a list of reasons from the ongoing fear of infection to the lack of available child care.
Recent analysis has consistently minimized one of those explanations: the impact of the extra unemployment benefits. 
Graphic: A (mostly) red state roll off A (mostly) red state roll off, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/EMPLOYMENT/oakpedgnkvr/chart.png 
Researchers at the University of Chicago and the JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Institute, using JPMorgan data on account holders who lost jobs and received enhanced unemployment benefits, found that through April the payments diminished the reemployment rate by no more than 1 percentage point. The payments, offered with few conditions to a broadened group of individuals, were $600 per week early in the pandemic and reduced to $300 late in 2020. They were a key reason personal income rose during the pandemic despite massive unemployment.
Arindrajit Dube, a University of Massachusetts Amherst economics professor, used data from the Census Household Pulse Survey to conclude that the suspension of the benefits in a group of states did nothing to boost hiring but instead ""increased self-reported hardship in paying for regular expenses."" 

UKG's Gilbertson said he attributed the slower rate of shift growth in the one group of states to the fact that they generally were among those that imposed fewer restrictions early in the pandemic and ""didn't have as far to cover."" It was also possible that the surge in cases is leading to ""some early signs of a slowdown.""
Either way, he said the data seemed clear on one point: ""The extra benefits were likely not the thing holding (individuals) back from accepting a new job.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's consumer inflation accelerated in July, staying at a nine-year peak marked in May, as hot weather conditions lifted prices of fresh food, while oil products and housing rental and other services costs continued rising.
The consumer price index (CPI) last month rose 2.6% year-on-year, Statistics Korea data showed on Tuesday, accelerating from a 2.4% increase in June and beating a 2.4% increase tipped in a Reuters survey.
That was also same as a 2.6% rise in May when it marked the fastest pace since April 2012, and continued to stay above the central bank's 2% target for a fourth straight month.
Breakdown of data showed continued rise in prices of agricultural and oil products further boosted inflation, while housing rental costs and dining and other services costs also added to the boost.
The cost of agricultural, livestock and fisheries and petroleum products jumped 9.6% and 2.8%, respectively, while that of housing rentals and dining rose 1.4% and 2.5% each.
Inflation will likely slow going forward, economists say, due to an impact from toughened COVID-19 distancing measures and the fading base effect of oil and commodity prices.
""Korea's social-distancing measures due to the new wave of the virus pose downside risks to CPI ... which will likely affect services sector CPI,"" said Park Chong-hoon, economist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank Korea, adding that he sees inflation easing below 2% in September.
The country struggles to contain the highly contagious Delta variant, even as it stepped up social distancing measures to the toughest level for the Seoul metropolitan and neighbouring areas.
Core CPI, which excluded volatile energy and food prices, came at 1.2% year-on year, unchanged from June.

Month-on-month inflation rose 0.2%, rebounding from June's minus 0.1%, when it fell into negative territory for the first time in seven months. Economists had forecast no change.
The BOK currently sees inflation standing at 1.8% for the whole of 2021. Its next revision of forecasts will be released at its Aug. 26 policy rate decision meeting.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in July for the second straight month as raw material shortages persisted, though there are signs of some easing in supply-chain bottlenecks.
The survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday showed a measure of prices paid by manufactures fell by the most in 16 months, while the supplier deliveries index retreated further from a 47-year high touched in May. 
Timothy Fiore, chair of ISM's manufacturing business survey committee, noted that ""supply and demand dynamics appear to be moving closer to equilibrium for the first time in many months."" Part of that could be because spending is rotating back to services from goods.
""Manufacturing is slowing from unsustainable boom to sustainable strength,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
""Moderation in supplier deliveries and prices paid indicate bottlenecks are alleviating, but both remain high enough to indicate supply-side problems persist. Still, from a markets and policy perspective, progress is important.""
The ISM's index of national factory activity fell to 59.5 last month, the lowest reading since January, from 60.6 in June. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would be little changed at 60.9.
Seventeen out of 18 manufacturing industries reported growth in July, including machinery as well as computer and electronic products. Only textile mills reported a decline.
The ISM survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers fell to a reading of 85.7 last month from a record 92.1 in June, reflecting an easing in commodity prices. The drop - the largest pullback in the index since March 2020 - supports Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's contention that inflation will moderate as supply constraints abate.
The survey's measure of supplier deliveries fell to 72.5 from a reading of 75.1 in June. The index vaulted to 78.8 in May, which was the highest reading since April 1974. A reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. 
ISM PMI https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/klpykejdmpg/ism.png 
Demand shifted to goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic as millions of Americans were cooped up at home, straining the supply chain. Roughly half of the population has been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, allowing people to travel, frequent restaurants, visit casinos and attend sporting events among services-related activities that were curbed early in the pandemic. 
Government data last week showed spending on services accelerated sharply in the second quarter, helping to lift the level of gross domestic product above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
U.S. stocks were trading higher, with the S&P 500 index near a record high as the U.S. Congress pushed ahead with a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
LEAN INVENTORIES
Still, anecdotes in the ISM survey suggested the supply chain was still a long way from normalizing. Machinery manufacturers said they are ""having to place orders months ahead of time just to get a place in line."" 
In the computer and electronics industry, manufacturers reported that ""purchases continue to have long lead times due to shortages of raw materials.""
The scarcity of inputs has been well documented in the automobile industry, where a global semiconductor shortage has forced some car makers to idle assembly plants to manage their chips supply.
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index fell for a second straight month. But with inventories at factories very lean and business warehouses almost empty, the moderation in new orders growth is likely to reverse or remain minimal. 
Businesses depleted inventories at a rapid clip in the second quarter. Stocks at retailers are well below normal levels. Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expect retail and auto inventories will return to normal levels in mid-2022.
Factories also hired more workers in July. A measure of factory employment rebounded after contracting modestly in June for the first time since November, though manufacturers continued to complain about the scarcity of workers. 
Still, the rebound bodes well for July's employment report, due to be released on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 880,000 jobs last month after rising by 850,000 in June.
The economy is facing a shortage of workers, with a record 9.2 million job openings. About 9.5 million people are officially unemployed. 
Lack of affordable child care and fears of contracting the coronavirus have been blamed for keeping workers, mostly women, at home. There have also been pandemic-related retirements and career changes. Republicans and business groups have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly payment from the federal government, for the labor crunch.

While more than 20 states led by Republican governors have ended these federal benefits before they were scheduled to run out in early September, there has been little evidence that the terminations boosted hiring. 
The labor shortage is expected to ease in the fall when schools reopen for in-person learning, but a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, could make some people reluctant to return to the labor force.

Construction spending, which accounts for less than 4% of U.S. gross domestic product, increased by 8.2% on a year-on-year basis in June after falling 0.2% in May, data showed. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising by 0.4% in June.
Spending on private construction projects climbed 0.4%, with outlays on residential projects increasing 1.1%. Single-family homebuilding spending surged 1.8%, after outlays on residential projects rose 0.3% in May. 
The government reported last week that residential spending contracted in the second quarter, weighed down by lower broker commissions and other ownership transfer costs because of a decline in home sales. 
Although demand for housing remains robust, a rise in the cost of building materials, especially framing lumber, are constraining builders' ability to ramp up construction and close an inventory gap, driving up home prices and crimping sales.

Investment in private non-residential construction like gas and oil well drilling fell 0.7% in June. Business spending on non-residential structures fell in the second quarter led by declines in commercial and healthcare structures. Private construction outlays was unchanged in May.
Spending on public construction projects dropped 1.2% in June, after declining 0.8% in May.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 49.6 in July from 48.8 in June, the highest reading since February 2020 and marginally below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
The index has been clawing its way higher gradually after plummeting to 35.0 in April 2020 amid the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, in what was by far the lowest reading in the survey's 10-year history.
""It is encouraging to see the headline PMI stir closer to the critical 50.0 threshold and some reports of rising sales among Mexican manufacturers,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit.
Some firms indicated that production fell due to raw material shortages, the pandemic and low sales, but the drop was curbed by rising output at companies that noted increases in new projects.
""The sector was again impacted by bottlenecks at global logistic firms, with raw material shortages and delivery delays leading to rising backlogs of work, declines in stocks and a substantial increase in overall input costs,"" De Lima said.
According to the survey, businesses turned more optimistic regarding the 12-month outlook for production, with the overall degree of confidence at the strongest level in 1-1/2 years and firms anticipated a pick-up in sales and improved raw material availability.

Job losses were also the slowest in 1-1/2 years.

The Federal Statistics Office said on Monday retail sales rose 4.2% on the month in real terms after an upwardly revised increase of 4.6% in May. The June reading was more than double a Reuters forecast for a rise of 2.0%.
Department stores and specialist suppliers benefited from lifted restrictions, with sales soaring 34% on the month, while a drop in online sales provided early evidence that consumer habits are rotating back to services and away from online shopping.
On the year, retail sales - a volatile indicator often subject to revisions - jumped 6.2% in real terms following an upwardly revised drop of 1.8% in the previous month.
The German economy returned to growth in the second quarter but bounced back less strongly than expected from the impact of supply chain bottlenecks.
Almost two out of three industrial companies are having difficulties in getting enough intermediate goods in time and keeping supply chains intact, the Ifo institute said on Monday.
""This could undermine the recovery,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
Together with rising coronavirus infections driven by the more contagious Delta variant, the supply issues have dampened the outlook for the economy. Nonetheless, the central bank expects growth of 3.7% for this year and 5.2% next year.

The manufacturing sector was boosted in July by faster growth in new orders and employment, a survey showed on Monday, but supply shortages for semiconductors and other intermediate goods continued to hold back production.
Another survey showed last week that consumer sentiment held steady heading into August as shoppers grew more ready to spend, but the rise in coronavirus cases made them less upbeat about the economic outlook.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) -Factories across the world are suffering from supply bottlenecks which sent prices skyrocketing in July, while a new wave of coronavirus infections in Asia demonstrated the fragile nature of the global recovery.
Business surveys on Monday highlighted the divergence in the global economy on the pace of recovery from the pandemic, which led the International Monetary Fund to downgrade this year's growth forecast for emerging Asia.
Although manufacturers largely remained open throughout lockdowns, the loosening of some restrictions designed to limit infections has driven a flurry of demand - but factories are suffering from staff shortages and supply chain problems.

""The global economic recovery is still on track. The level of activity has been really strong but there have been delays in deliveries,"" said Marchel Alexandrovich at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). 
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone dipped from June's record high but was still firmly in growth territory.
The upbeat survey follows official data on Friday which showed the bloc's economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter, pulling out of a recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as curbs to stop the virus were eased.

In China, however, demand contracted for the first time in over a year, a private survey showed. This broadly aligned with an official survey released on Saturday showing a slowdown in activity. 
""Supply bottlenecks remain a constraint. But the PMIs suggest demand is cooling too, taking the heat out of price gains and weighing on activity in industry and construction,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia saw factory activity shrink in July due to a resurgence in infections and stricter COVID-19 restrictions, according to private surveys.
Once seen as a driver of global growth, Asia's emerging economies are lagging their advanced peers in recovering from the pandemic's pain as delays in vaccine rollouts hurt domestic demand and countries reliant on tourism.
""The risk is that growth scars linger for longer even if activity recovers in the coming months,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC.
""Plus, cooling export momentum, far from a temporary blip, provides a hint of what to expect in quarters to come,"" he said, adding that such uncertainty over the outlook would prod Asian central banks to maintain loose monetary policy.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan PMI rose to 53.0 in July from 52.4 in the previous month, though manufacturers saw input prices rise at the fastest pace since 2008.
Japan also faces a surge in Delta variant cases that has forced the government to expand state of emergency curbs to wider areas through Aug. 31, casting a shadow over the Olympic Games and dashing hopes for a sharp rebound in July-September growth.

South Korea's PMI held above breakeven for the 10th straight month. But a sub-index on input prices rose at the second highest on record.
While still grappling with infections, easing restrictions helped India's factory activity to bounce back in July as demand surged both at home and abroad.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 60.4 from June's 63.9. The July reading was unchanged from a preliminary ""flash"" figure.
The index peaked at an all-time high of 65.6 in May as the sector - which accounts for about 10% of British economic output - rode a wave of demand the coronavirus lockdowns were lifted. 
Growth in output and new work eased to four-month lows in July and some firms reported clients brought forward purchases to guard against supply-chain issues.
Seventy-two percent of manufacturers reported higher costs for a wide range of inputs such as chemicals, commodities, cardboard, electronics, foodstuffs, metals, packaging and timber, with Brexit causing problems alongside the pandemic.
In response, factories increased their prices by almost as much as June's record jump.
""Amid growing indications that many supply chain disruptions and raw material shortages are unlikely to be fully resolved until 2022, the outlook remains one of constrained growth combined with high inflation for the foreseeable future,"" Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said.
The Bank of England looks set to raise its forecasts for inflation on Thursday, at the end of its August meeting.
But most of its policymakers are expected to stick to their view that the rise in prices is largely transitory, meaning no curtailment of the BoE's pandemic emergency stimulus programme.
The PMI survey showed British manufacturing firms in July remained optimistic about the outlook with 63% forecasting output would rise over the coming year.

IHS Markit's final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose to 65.9 in July from 65.1 in June. The July reading was the third highest since the survey began in 1996.
The industrial sector in Europe's largest economy has been humming along during the pandemic almost undisturbed by COVID-19 restrictions and helped by generous state support measures.
High demand from abroad has led to filled order books, but supply shortages for semiconductors and other intermediate goods have been holding back production.
Trevor Balchin, Economics Director at IHS Markit, said ""the latest survey results provided further evidence that output growth is being constrained by supply shortages.""
""Suppliers' delivery times continued to lengthen substantially in July, though there were signs that supply pressures had peaked as the incidence of delays was the lowest in five months,"" he added.
Indices on input and output prices both rose faster, with input price inflation accelerating to a new survey record high.
""Consequently, the rate of output price inflation hit a new peak for the fifth month running,"" Balchin said.

The cost pressures are feeding through to consumer prices.
Germany's annual consumer price inflation accelerated by more than expected to hit a 13-year high in July, leading services sector trade union Verdi to immediately demand ""strong wage increases"".

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Crippled by its tightest lockdown since the pandemic began, Sydney's construction industry has slowed to a crawl, throwing many builders out of work, while shopping malls have shut - but the housing market has never been hotter.
That exuberance has stunned many as prices crack new records, with national home loan growth at its strongest in 2-1/2 years, compared to the gloom over Australia's economic outlook cast by Sydney's strict stay-home orders since June-end.
""The confidence in the market is very strong,"" said Alex Pattaro, chief auctioneer for real estate agency Ray White Australia, who conducted seven auctions on Saturday and has more lined up.
""I have five auctions this coming weekend and we're excited about them.""
Among his sales last weekend was a A$3.6 million ($2.6 million) house in the city's northwest suburb of Ryde that sold at about 30% above the price guide.
Even though the coronavirus stay-home orders have forced all auctions online, 580 homes went under the hammer across Australia's largest city on Saturday, with clearance rates of about 75%.
Market players say the pandemic curbs are feeding the frenzy.
""The question is…is this possibly the best market a seller could ever take advantage of?"" David Murphy, principal of his eponymous property firm, asked clients in a newsletter. ""Frustrated, and greying, locked-down buyers fuelled by rosé (wine) and desperation.""
In the beach suburb of Fairlight, where median home prices have jumped 21.7% to A$2.8 million, a three-bedroom home sold for A$4 million over the weekend, as more than 20 bidders in the inner west drove up the price of a four-bedroom home to A$2.5 million.
Buyer demand has remained strong while the number of properties on sale fell 40% in the first three weeks of July versus the corresponding June period, says Nerida Conisbee, chief economist at the Ray White agency. 
That has kept auction clearance rates high, at above 70%, in recent weeks.
The pick-up in auctions and credit growth comes as median home prices in Sydney swelled 8.2% in the June quarter to an all-time high of A$1.4 million, or a rise of more than A$1,200 a day.
The gains extended into July, when Australian home prices jumped 1.6%, CoreLogic's national home value index showed on Monday, with Sydney prices racing at 2% over the previous month to stand a startling 18.2% up from a year ago. 
A prolonged lockdown, could prove a damper, however, amid forecasts of a third-quarter contraction in Australia's $1.5 trillion economy. Already, the hit is evident in mobility and credit and debit card spending data from banks.
""With dwelling values rising more in a month than incomes are rising in a year, housing is moving out of reach for many members of the community,"" said CoreLogic's research director, Tim Lawless. 

""It’s possible market activity could reduce through the second half of the year, helping to rebalance the market and take some heat out of the rate of house price growth.""

The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by IHS Markit, jumped to 55.3 last month from 48.1 in June, well above 50-level separating growth from contraction.
""Output rose at a robust pace, with over one-third of companies noting a monthly expansion in production, amid a rebound in new business and the easing of some local COVID-19 restrictions,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit.
India grappled with a devastating second wave of coronavirus infections in April and May but falling case numbers have allowed many restrictions to be eased.
The country is still reporting more than 40,000 cases per day, taking the total number of infections to around 31.6 million, but the economic re-opening induced higher demand and sales, leading to a sharp expansion in output.
New export orders grew at the fastest rate since April.
Employment rose for the first time since March 2020, breaking a 15-month chain of job shedding. However, the pace of hiring was mild, indicating a job crisis is still evident.
Growth in Asia's third-largest economy could lose momentum, with new coronavirus variants posing the biggest risk to already weakened forecasts, while inflation was expected to rise, a recent Reuters poll showed.
A lack of raw material availability and higher freight fees drove input costs higher, though the pace was at a seven-month low.
Despite higher input costs, output charges rose only slightly, suggesting companies absorbed the extra cost burden to boost sales and stay competitive.

""With firms' cost burdens continuing to rise, however, and signs of spare capacity still evident, it's too early to say that such a trend will be sustained in coming months,"" added De Lima.
The Reserve Bank of India is not expected to raise interest rates until next fiscal year on predictions inflation remains within its target band of 2%-6% this year.

Investing.com – China’s factory activity growth dropped sharply in July, as high product prices led to demand contracting for the first in over a year. Data from the business survey, released on Monday, indicated that challenges remain for the world’s second-largest economy as it continues its recovery from COVID-19.
The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was 50.3, its lowest level since April 2020. The reading was also lower than the 51 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 51.3 reading but remained above the 50-mark indicating economic growth.
While continuing its economic recovery from COVID-19, the biggest challenge that China has faced recently is higher raw material costs that dragged on profit growth at industrial firms in June 2021.
Policymakers have stepped up efforts to curb surging commodity prices that have squeezed manufacturers' margins. The country continues to deal with its latest COVID-19 outbreak involving the virus’ Delta variant, the worst since the initial Wuhan outbreak in December 2019.
The Caixin PMI follows the release of July’s manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs on Saturday that showed activity grew at the slowest pace in 17 months. The manufacturing PMI was 50.4, lower than the 50.8 predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and June’s 50.9 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 53.3, lower than the previous month’s reading of 53.5.
""The economy is still facing huge downward pressure,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in comments released alongside the data. High product prices also brought down demand, especially for consumer goods and intermediate goods.
Input prices continue to rise faster than output prices, although the pace slowed down from the previous month, putting pressure on margins. The private sector enterprises surveyed by Caixin said raw material prices, especially for industrial metals, remained high.
""Market demand was sensitive to product prices, which limited enterprises' pricing power,"" said Wang.
Slower growth was also visible in export orders, which also grew at a slower pace than the month before as global outbreaks of COVID-19 dampened demand. Factories also hired more workers for a fourth consecutive month, but slowed the pace."

The Chinese economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but it has faced new challenges in recent months such as higher raw material costs, which dragged on profit growth at industrial firms in June.
Policymakers have stepped up efforts to curb surging commodity prices that have squeezed manufacturers' margins.
The weaker results in the private survey, mostly covering export-oriented and small manufacturers, broadly aligned with those in an official survey released on Saturday that showed activity growing at the slowest pace in 17 months.
""The economy is still facing huge downward pressure,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in comments released alongside the data. High product prices brought down demand, especially for consumer goods and intermediate goods, said Wang.
A sub-index for new orders slipped sharply into contraction for the first time since May 2020, while another sub-index for production fell to the slowest pace of expansion since March last year.

The sub-index for output stood at 53.5, marking the 11thconsecutive month of expansion, and up from 53.3 amonth earlier.
To meet the increased production, firms continued to raise staffing levels for another month, though the rate was the softest in five months.
Total new orders and export orders both expanded for a 10th month but the pace of growth slightly eased from June as highly contagious Delta variant and related curbs weakened global demand.
""Anecdotal evidence suggested a resurgence in COVID-19 cases across Asia and ongoing supply chain disruption had led to demand easing in domestic and external markets,"" Bhatti said.
Monday's survey showed that raw material shortages and delivery delays continued, leading to a further increase in input prices. That also put firms under pressure to pass higher costs on to their clients.
The sub-index for input prices stood at the second-highest on record, extending the rise to a 13th straight month, while the pace for output prices hit an all-time high.

Looking ahead, firms remained positive over the coming 12 months on expectations that output and demand would rise and the launches of new products would further boost the sector, but the gauge of optimism eased to a seven-month low.

Data from property consultant CoreLogic out on Monday showed national home prices climbed 1.6% in July from June, when they rose 1.9%. Prices were up 16.1% on last year, the fastest annual pace since 2004, with houses surging 18.4% amid a pandemic-driven shift to working from home.
A lockdown did nothing to stop Sydney gaining another 2.0% in the month, to be up 18.2% on a year ago. Melbourne added 1.3%, Brisbane 2.0% and Adelaide 1.7%. Prices across the major cities grew 1.6% in July, while the regions rose 1.7%.
""Dwelling sales are tracking approximately 40% above the five-year average while active listings remain about 26% below the five-year average,"" said CoreLogic's research director, Tim Lawless.
""The mismatch between demand and advertised supply remains a key factor placing upwards pressure on housing prices.""
The red-hot market has provided a huge windfall to consumer wealth and confidence. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the value of homes rose a record A$450 billion in the March quarter alone to reach A$8.3 trillion ($6.09 trillion).
However, with the average home in Sydney now above A$1 million prices were looking stretched.
""With dwelling values rising more in a month than incomes are rising in a year, housing is moving out of reach for many members of the community,"" said Lawless.
Buyers have still been encouraged by the outlook for super-low borrowing costs, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) saying rates were likely to remain at just 0.1% until 2024.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) eased to 50.4 in July from 50.9 in June, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Saturday, but remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.
Analysts had expected it to slip to 50.8. It was the lowest figure since the index slumped to 35.7 in February 2020, after China began lockdowns to control the coronavirus pandemic.
An NBS official said in a statement the PMI's sub-index for production slipped to 51.0 from 51.9 in June, pointing to equipment maintenance and extreme weather. The new order sub-index fell to 50.9, from 51.5, reflecting a slowdown in demand.
""The most alarming signal is the new export order index, which is at lowest level since July last year,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist of Pinpoint Asset Management.
The sub-index for new export orders has dropped for three straight months starting in May. It stood at 47.7 in July.
A sub-index for raw material costs stood at 62.9 in July, compared with June's 61.2, pointing to an increase in costs. High raw material prices have eaten into the profitability of industrial firms and deterred some Chinese exporters from taking on orders.
Authorities are eager to prevent high factory-gate prices being passed on to consumers, which would only add to current economic headaches as underlying demand remains weak.
Hit by extreme weather, the construction index dropped to 57.5, from June's 60.1, and analysts expect the sector to face headwinds amid Beijing's clampdown on the property market.
To bolster a slowing economy, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) in mid-July surprised the market by lowering the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks, releasing around 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) in long-term liquidity.
China's economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by the pandemic, with the consumption and service sectors gradually catching up to the improvements in exports and manufacturing.
However, manufacturers are grappling with new challenges including higher raw material prices, surging logistics costs and global supply chain bottlenecks, and the pace of gross domestic product growth is expected to moderate.
The country is also racing to contain a fresh COVID-19 outbreak of the more infectious Delta variant in the eastern city of Nanjing. China's zero-tolerance approach could present significant downside risks to the current economic recovery, analysts say. 

Record flooding in central China may have also weighed on business activity in July, along with government moves to curb steel production in line with a drive to reduce emissions.

New home prices in 100 cities rose 0.35% in July from a month earlier, versus 0.36% growth in June, according to data from China Index Academy, one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms.
This year Chinese authorities have implemented measures to rein in the red-hot real estate market, including caps on developers' borrowing and strict bans on illegal flows of funds into the sector.
""New home growth softened in July against the backdrop of stringent measures and tighter credit"", said the group's director, Cao Jingjing.
Growth in home sales is expected to remain mild as the curbs are unlikely to be eased, the survey said.
In July, China's housing ministry urged five cities including the eastern city of Jinhua and the southeastern city of Quanzhou to stabilise their property markets, while the central bank ordered lenders in Shanghai to raise interest rates on mortgage loans.
Prices in China's smaller tier-three and tier-four cities rose 0.21% on-month, versus 0.29% in June. Tier-two cities, which include some provincial capitals, gained 0.29%, slowing from June's 0.31% rise.
Price growth in China's biggest cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, however, continued to accelerate, up 0.54% versus June's 0.48% growth, suggesting persistent demand for properties in the country's economically most vibrant cities.
But new home prices in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen declined 0.26%, the first drop since February. Local media had warned in May that Shenzhen could be a testing ground for China's plans to impose a nationwide property tax, due to elevated home prices.
On an annual basis, China's new home prices grew 3.81% in July, slowing from June's 3.89% gain.
Resale homes also showed slower month-on-month price growth in July, while existing home prices in Shenzhen were down 0.43% on-month.
Local governments in some hot property markets may implement pricing references for resale homes to stabilise prices, the survey said.

Land sales by floor space in 300 cities fell 25% in July from a month earlier, and declined 38% on an annual basis, separate survey data showed.
The National Bureau of Statistics will release official July data for China's home prices in mid-August.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean exports jumped to a record high in July as overseas demand for chips and biohealth products extended export growth to a ninth consecutive month, supporting an economic recovery facing headwind from the country's worst COVID-19 outbreak yet. 
Exports rose 29.6% in July from the same month a year earlier to $55.43 billion, the largest amount since South Korea began compiling relevant data in 1956, the trade ministry said on Sunday. 
The pace of growth, however, slowed from 39.8% in June on a fading base effect from a pandemic-induced slump last year. The figure was also short of the 30.2% median of 16 analyst estimates in a Reuters survey.
Imports soared 38.2% from a year earlier and compared to a 40.7% rise in June. 
With consumer sentiment weakening at home due to tightened social distancing measures since mid-July, the Bank of Korea is counting on global demand to lead economic growth which it forecasts at 4% for this year.
While growth in exports was widely expected to slow, July exports of chips and biohealth products were brisk, gaining 39.6% and 27.2%, respectively.
Exports of petrochemical products also surged 59.5%, while those of cars and computers increased 12.3% and 26.4% respectively.
""Demand for main exports items across chips, cars and petrochemical products remains strong, as economic recovery is being led by advanced nations,"" said analyst Chun Kyu-yeon at Hana Financial Investment.
""Having said that, the pace of growth will weaken on fading base effects, and some hiccups in supply chains are raising logistical costs also.""

By destination, exports to China - South Korea's biggest trading partner - gained 15.7% on year. Overseas sales to the United States and the European Union also increased 32.1% and 43.9%, respectively.
South Korea is currently battling its worst COVID-19 outbreak with record numbers of cases per day in the past week. Tighter curbs on movement and activity have been enacted to prevent spread of the coronavirus during South Korea's peak summer holiday season.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) eased to 50.4 in July from 50.9 in June, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Saturday, but remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.
Analysts had expected it to slip to 50.8. It was the lowest figure since the index slumped to 35.7 in February 2020, after China began lockdowns to control the coronavirus pandemic.
An NBS official said in a statement the PMI's sub-index for production slipped to 51.0 from 51.9 in June, pointing to equipment maintenance and extreme weather. The new order sub-index fell to 50.9, from 51.5, reflecting a slowdown in demand.
""The most alarming signal is the new export order index, which is at lowest level since July last year,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist of Pinpoint Asset Management.
The sub-index for new export orders has dropped for three straight months starting in May. It stood at 47.7 in July.
A sub-index for raw material costs stood at 62.9 in July, compared with June's 61.2, pointing to an increase in costs. High raw material prices have eaten into the profitability of industrial firms and deterred some Chinese exporters from taking on orders.
Authorities are eager to prevent high factory-gate prices being passed on to consumers, which would only add to current economic headaches as underlying demand remains weak.
Hit by extreme weather, the construction index dropped to 57.5, from June's 60.1, and analysts expect the sector to face headwinds amid Beijing's clampdown on the property market.
To bolster a slowing economy, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) in mid-July surprised the market by lowering the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks, releasing around 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) in long-term liquidity.
China's economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by the pandemic, with the consumption and service sectors gradually catching up to the improvements in exports and manufacturing.
However, manufacturers are grappling with new challenges including higher raw material prices, surging logistics costs and global supply chain bottlenecks, and the pace of gross domestic product growth is expected to moderate.
The country is also racing to contain a fresh COVID-19 outbreak of the more infectious Delta variant in the eastern city of Nanjing. China's zero-tolerance approach could present significant downside risks to the current economic recovery, analysts say. 

Record flooding in central China may have also weighed on business activity in July, along with government moves to curb steel production in line with a drive to reduce emissions.
The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) eased to 53.3 in July, from 53.5 in June, a separate survey from the NBS showed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending surged in June as vaccinations against COVID-19 boosted demand for travel-related services, but part of the increase reflected higher prices, with annual inflation accelerating further above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
Though personal income barely rose last month, other data on Friday showed wage growth in the second quarter was the fastest in 13 years on an annual basis. That, together with rising household wealth and ample savings should keep consumer spending strong, though rising COVID-19 infections pose a risk. 
""The overall trend of healthy-to-strong growth will continue into next year,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Downside risks remain large. The return of shutdowns from increased infections is unlikely, but cannot be ruled out. There are also upside risks, especially given all the extra saving since the spring of 2020.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rebounded 1.0% last month after dipping 0.1% in May, the Commerce Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending rising 0.7%. 
(Graphic: Personal consumption: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/lbvgnrzoypq/perscons.png)
Nearly half of the population has been vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing Americans to travel, frequent restaurants, visit casinos and attend sporting events among services-related activities that were curbed early in the pandemic. 
Spending on services advanced 1.2% last month. The broad increase was led by spending at restaurants and hotels. 
While spending on goods remains strong, the pace has slowed amid shortages of motor vehicles and some household appliances, whose production has been hampered by tight supplies of semiconductors across the globe. Demand is also shifting to services from goods. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday said sales growth would slow in the next few quarters as customers venture more outside the home.
Spending on goods rose 0.5%. Spending on long-lasting goods decreased 1.5%, reflecting a decline in motor vehicle purchases. Outlays on nondurable goods rose 1.8%.
The data was included in the second-quarter gross domestic product report published on Thursday. Consumer spending grew at a robust 11.8% annualized rate last quarter, accounting for much of the economy's 6.5% growth pace, which lifted the level of GDP above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
With demand outpacing supply, inflation is rising. 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.4% in June after advancing 0.5% in May. The so-called core PCE price index was lifted by increases in prices of airline tickets, used cars as well as hotel and motel accommodation.
In the 12 months through June, the core PCE price index shot up 3.5%, the largest gain since December 1991, after rising 3.4% in May. The core PCE price index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target.
""Price pressures are centered on areas that are having struggles during reopening. Some of those areas are simply reflating to pre-pandemic prices; others should see prices come down as they adjust capacity and work out supply chain issues,"" said Will Compernolle, senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Even with modest monthly increases in PCE prices for the next year, year-over-year readings will be high for a while.""
Consumers are taking note of higher inflation, which is eroding sentiment.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.

WAGES RISING
The U.S. central bank on Wednesday kept its overnight benchmark interest rate near zero and left its bond-buying program unchanged.
Excluding inflation, consumer spending rebounded 0.5% in June after dropping 0.6% in May. The bounce back in the so-called real consumer spending last month puts it on a higher growth trajectory heading into the third quarter.
Personal income gained 0.1% in June after dropping 2.2% in May as transfers from the government declined. The saving rate fell to a still-high 9.4% from 10.3% in May, which should underpin spending as the flow of government money dries up.
Households accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic. Record-high stock market prices and accelerating home prices are boosting household wealth. Wages are also rising as companies compete for scarce workers.
In a separate report on Friday, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.7% last quarter after gaining 0.9% in the January-March period. That raised the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.9%, the largest gain since the fourth quarter of 2018, from 2.6% in the first quarter.
Wages and salaries rose 0.9% after shooting up 1.0% in the first quarter. They were up 3.2% year-on-year, the largest rise since the second quarter of 2008, after increasing 2.7% in the first quarter. Wage gains were led by the leisure and hospitality sector.

The economy is facing a shortage of workers, with a record 9.2 million job openings at the end of May. About 9.5 million people are officially unemployed. Lack of affordable child care and fears of contracting the coronavirus have been blamed for keeping workers, mostly women, at home. There have also been pandemic-related retirements as well as career changes.

Republicans and business groups have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly check from the federal government, for the labor crunch. 
""We should be prepared for labor supply constraints that keep solid upward pressure on compensation costs in the second half of 2021,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Better health conditions and reopenings will only gradually equalize the imbalance between strong labor demand and the limited supply of workers.""

(Reuters) -U.S. consumer sentiment fell to a five-month low in July amid lingering concerns about inflation, a survey released on Friday showed.
The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index fell to a final reading of 81.2, the lowest level since February, from June's final level of 85.5. The final reading for July, however, was above the July preliminary reading of 80.8 and above the median forecast of 80.8 among economists polled by Reuters.
""While most consumers still expect inflation to be transitory, there is growing evidence that an inflation storm is likely to develop on the not-too-distant horizon,"" Richard Curtin, the survey director, said in a statement. ""The improved finances of consumers have greatly reduced consumers' resistance to price increases.""
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions fell to 84.5, the lowest since August 2020, from June's 88.6 reading. This was also in line with July's preliminary reading of 84.5. 

The survey's gauge of consumer expectations declined to 79.0 in July from June's 83.5, but up from the mid-month reading of 78.4. 
The survey's one-year inflation expectation rose to 4.7%, the highest level since August 2008, from 4.2% in June, while the survey's five-year inflation outlook was unchanged at 2.8%.

The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.7% last quarter after gaining 0.9% in the January-March period, the Labor Department said on Friday. 
That raised the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.9%, the largest gain since the fourth quarter of 2018, from 2.6% in the first quarter.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI advancing 0.9% in the second quarter.

Republicans and business groups have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly check from the federal government, for the labor crunch.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico's economy bounced back to annual growth in the second quarter, boosted by services and manufacturing for export to the United States, its top trade partner, a preliminary estimate from the national statistics agency showed on Friday.
Compared with the same quarter a year earlier, when the formal and informal economy was largely shut down by coronavirus pandemic restrictions, growth was 19.7%, the statistics agency said. 
That was the first year-on-year quarterly growth since before the pandemic, and close to the number forecast in a Reuters survey of 14 analysts. [L1N2P21IX]
Hammered by restrictions brought about by the pandemic, Latin America's second-largest economy shrank 8.5% in 2020, its worst performance since 1932.
The current recovery has been led by demand from the United States for the cars and electronics made in Mexican factories, while remittances sent by migrants north of the border have helped domestic consumers. 
However, Mexico's economy is still 3.6 percentage points below its peak in the July-September period of 2019, noted Gabriel Casillas, an economist at Mexican bank Banorte. The economy had contracted for half a year even before the coronavirus appeared in Mexico. 
Quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted growth was 1.5%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of economic expansion. It was lower than the 1.7% forecast by analysts.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said the quarterly expansion was crimped by supply chain disruptions and shortages of parts for key industries. A global crunch for computer chips has slowed factory output in Mexico. Ramos flagged risks ahead.
""We expect real GDP growth to reach 6.0% in 2021, but the recent deterioration of the COVID backdrop, high inflation and rising rates could slow down the envisaged recovery,"" Ramos said in a client note. 

Secondary activities, which include factories, rebounded by 28.2% in the April-June period, while tertiary activities, including trade and financial services, were up 17.1%, the data showed. 
Quarter-on-quarter, secondary activities rose a modest 0.4%, reflecting the supply problems, while tertiary activities were up 2.1%.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Canadian economy most likely expanded by 0.7% in June as businesses reopened after shutdowns imposed to help fight the coronavirus pandemic, Statistics Canada said on Friday.
Statscan also said second-quarter annualized growth was set to be 2.5%, better than the Bank of Canada's July 14 forecast of 2.0%. Analysts predicted the third quarter would be stronger.
""With virus cases generally low across the country, the economy has some open road to recover even more ground this summer,"" Royce Mendes, senior economist with CIBC, said in a note.
Statscan said growth in retail trade and accommodation and food services was boosted by the easing of public health measures in many of Canada's 10 provinces in June. 
There were also gains in manufacturing and mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction.
""The strong handover from June means that GDP should accelerate in the third quarter to around 6% annualized,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics.
The Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1.2441 to the greenback, or 80.38 U.S. cents. 
The Bank of Canada, which says third-quarter annualized growth should be 7.3%, has identified possible new variants of COVID-19 as a potential threat.
""There remain challenges on the horizon, most notably in the form of variants of the virus which have slowed progress towards healing in other developed economies,"" Mendes said.

The economy shrank by 0.3% in May, matching a forecast from analysts polled by Reuters. Statscan revised April's decline to 0.5% from an initial 0.3% drop.
In May, 12 of 20 industrial sectors posted decreases, with services-producing industries down by 0.2% and goods-producing industries contracting by 0.4%.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The euro zone economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter, pulling out of a pandemic-induced recession, while the easing of coronavirus curbs also helped inflation shoot past the European Central Bank's 2% target in July.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said on Friday that its initial estimate showed gross domestic product (GDP) in the 19 countries that use the euro had expanded 2.0% in April-June from the previous quarter. 
Compared to the same period a year earlier, when lockdowns to slow the spread of the coronavirus brought economic activity close to a standstill, GDP jumped 13.7%. 
But unlike the U.S. and Chinese economies, which have pulled above their pre-pandemic peaks, the euro zone economy remains some 3% smaller than it was at the end of 2019.
Eurostat also said euro zone inflation accelerated to 2.2% in July from 1.9% in June - the highest rate since October 2018 and above the 2.0% mean expectation of economists.
Economic growth also surpassed a Reuters poll forecast of 1.5% for the April-June quarter and a 13.2% annual increase. 
Among the outperformers were the euro zone's third and fourth largest economies, Italy and Spain, with quarterly growth respectively of 2.7% and 2.8%. Portugal's tourism-heavy economy expanded by 4.9%.
Since the start of 2020 the euro zone has twice suffered two consecutive quarters of contraction - defining a technical recession - with coronavirus curbs hitting most recently in the period spanning the end of 2020 and the start of 2021.
Activity was dragged down in the first three months of this year largely by weakness in Germany, where a lockdown from November had curbed private consumption.
Europe's biggest economy returned to growth in the second quarter, but the expansion of 1.5% compared to Q1 showed a weaker rebound than expected.
The French economy, the euro zone's second largest, grew by 0.9%, just ahead of forecasts, with its third lockdown gradually being eased from May.
The strong growth could add to arguments for the ECB to start scaling back its crisis fighting measures.
The central bank's 1.85 trillion euro ($2.20 trillion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme is due to expire in March at the earliest, and policy hawks are already arguing that it is time to start tapering purchases given the bloc's rebound. 
Policy doves are warning that the more transmissible Delta variant poses a threat to the recovery, however, so the ECB's Sept. 9 meeting is too early for a firm call on winding down the scheme early next year. 
SIMILAR Q3 GROWTH SEEN
Bert Colijn, senior economist at ING, said supply chain problems were likely to have hampered growth in Germany, with its large auto industry, while Italy and Spain saw impressive growth because they were further behind pre-pandemic levels.
Even with the Delta variant and continued supply chain issues, ING expects growth across the bloc to be 2% again in the third quarter.
""Despite all the greening efforts, the euro zone economy continues to perform like a diesel engine: it takes a while to get going but don't underestimate it once it's picked up steam,"" Colijn said.
Capital Economics saw third-quarter growth of a little over 2%, which would still leave the euro zone economy smaller than before the pandemic.
""Germany should reach that (pre-pandemic) benchmark in the second half of the year, but we don't expect the southern economies to do so until well into 2022,"" its chief Europe economist Andrew Kenningham wrote in a note.
Figures on Thursday showed the U.S. economy grew at a slower than expected 6.5% annualised rate in the second quarter, pulling GDP above its pre-pandemic peak, as massive government aid and vaccinations fuelled spending on goods and services.
The equivalent euro zone rate was 8.3%.
For inflation, energy prices were again the driving factor, rising 14.1% in July compared to a year before.
Without the volatile energy and unprocessed food components, or what the European Central Bank calls core inflation, prices rose 0.9% year-on-year, the same as in June. Economists had expected a dip to 0.7%.
ECB policymakers have already warned of a temporary spike in inflation and made clear they will not adjust policy as the one-off factors behind the rise, such as higher oil prices, are likely to fade next year.
Inflation could even reach 3% by year-end before falling back, with core inflation more subdued.
The ECB promised a longer period of easy policy when it unveiled a new strategy earlier this month, as beyond this spike, inflation is likely to languish below its target for years to come. 

Eurostat also said euro zone unemployment fell in June to 7.7% of the workforce, or 12.517 million people, from an upwardly revised 8.0% in May, or 12.940 million people. Economists had expected a jobless rate of 7.9%.

Despite some slowdown in robust export growth, the government said the city's economic recovery remains on track as global demand picks up and local coronavirus fears ease. 
The preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) estimate released on Friday compares with a revised growth rate of 8% in the first quarter and forecasts of 8.4% by DBS and 8.5% by ING. 
On a quarterly basis, the economy contracted by a seasonally adjusted 1% in April-June, its first decline since the second quarter of 2020. That compared with a revised 5.5% growth in the previous quarter.
""The global economic recovery should continue to support Hong Kong's exports of goods in the near term, though there may be some moderation from the exceptionally strong performance in the first half of 2021,"" a government spokesman said in a statement along with the GDP figures.
""Exports of services should likewise sustain growth,"" the spokesman said, adding that a stabilised pandemic situation locally and a consumption voucher scheme will help stimulate consumer demand.
For the first half of 2021, economy grew by 7.8% over a year earlier.
The government maintained its full-year growth forecast at 3.5%-5.5%. 
Analysts caution, however, that the recovery will be uneven. While consumer spending is improving as coronavirus worries ebb, international travel restrictions will continue to weigh on tourism and related retail and services sectors. 
The trade-reliant city is also benefiting from mainland China's swift recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, though China's growth rates are slowly returning to more normal levels.
Hong Kong's economy fell into its longest recession on record in early 2019, weighed down by huge anti-government protests followed by the pandemic in 2020.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment slipped to 5.5% in April-June, from 6% in March-May and 6.4% in February-April. Exports jumped 33% in June, their eighth straight month of growth. 
Retail sales rose 10.5% in May from a year earlier, the fourth consecutive monthly gain, but growth lagged pre-pandemic levels as inbound tourism is virtually non-existent.

Hong Kong reported two new imported COVID-19 cases on Friday, with no local community infections recorded in over 50 consecutive days.
The government has urged more people to get vaccinated to pave the way for a reopening and broader based economic recovery. About 35% of the population has received the recommended two doses and 47% have had their first dose.

Supply chain worries and rising coronavirus infections have dampened the outlook for the economy. A survey showed on Monday that German business morale fell unexpectedly in July, the first decline since January.

After more than two months of steady decline, COVID-19 cases have been rising since early July, due mainly to the spread of the more infectious Delta variant.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending likely rebounded in June from last month's slump, according to a Reuters poll, as a temporary fall in coronavirus infections during the month underpinned service consumption.
But fresh state of emergency curbs declared in July will drag on consumption by hitting retailers during the Olympic Games and the country's summer holiday season, analysts say. The anti-virus measures are set to be expanded on Friday to a larger part of Japan through Aug. 31 as new COVID-19 cases surge.
""People are encouraged to watch the Olympics at home, so we can't count on the Games boosting consumption,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""A spike in infections may also discourage people from going out. We're pretty cautious on the outlook for consumption,"" he said.
Household spending likely rose 2.0% in June from the previous month on a seasonally-adjusted basis, according to analysts polled by Reuters. That would follow a 2.1% drop in May.
On a year-on-year basis, household spending is expected to have risen 0.1% in June after a 11.6% rise in May, the poll showed. The slowdown reflects a jump in spending in June last year caused by a lifting of the first state of emergency curbs.
The government will release the household spending data at 8:30 a.m. on Aug. 6. (2330GMT, Aug. 5).

Japan's economy shrank an annualised 3.9% in January-March and likely barely grew in the second quarter, as the pandemic took a toll on service spending.
A spike in domestic infections to new records has dashed policymakers' hopes for a strong rebound in July-September economic growth.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is likely to edge lower to 50.8 in July from 50.9 in June, according to the median forecast of 25 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates expansion from the previous month.
Reasons why economists at Nomura expected major activity indicators to show broadly weaker growth in July included heavy rainfall and floods in Henan and the Yangtze River Delta, outbreaks of the coronavirus Delta variant in Jiangsu and some other provinces, local government efforts to curb crude steel output, and Beijing's latest steps to cool the property market.
""We continue to believe a more notable growth slowdown will materialize in the second half (especially in Q4) and Beijing's existing policy easing measures, including the RRR cut, will be unable to reverse the growth downtrend,"" Nomura said in a note on Thursday.
However, analysts from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) say that the current economic headwinds could be partly offset by the likely improvement in the mid- to downstream production as global demand stays buoyant and the impact of power shortage fades.
To bolster a slowing economy, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) in mid-July lowered the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks to the surprise of market, releasing around 1 trillion yuan ($154.19 billion) in long-term liquidity.
China will base the pace and intensity of monetary policy on the domestic economy and inflation trends in the second half of the year, the PBOC has said.
Higher raw material prices, especially of metals and semiconductors, have eaten into the profitability of industrial firms and deterred some Chinese exporters from taking on orders.
Authorities are mindful to prevent the pass-through from high factory-gate prices to consumers, which would only add to the current economic headaches as the underlying demand remains weak.

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector, will both be released on Saturday.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Monday. Analysts expect the headline reading will slip to 51.1 from June's 51.3.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's factory output jumped in June and job availability rose to the highest level in nearly a year, data showed, a sign robust overseas demand was offsetting the drag to consumption from the coronavirus pandemic.
But a spike in domestic infections to new records and a lingering global chip shortage add to woes for the world's third largest-economy, dashing policymakers' hopes for a strong rebound in July-September growth, analysts say.
The government is set to expand state of emergency curbs to more parts of the country through Aug. 31, overshadowing the Olympic Games held in capital city Tokyo.
""With the resurgence in infections, initial hopes of a clear economic rebound in July-September have faded,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""The economy will probably stagnate in the current quarter with any recovery pushed back until October-December onward.""
Industrial output rose 6.2% in June after a sharp 6.5% drop in May, data showed on Friday, marking the highest growth since July last year and recovering to pre-pandemic levels.
The increase, which exceeded a median market forecast for a 5.0% gain, was driven mainly by a 22.6% surge in auto production as manufacturers sought to make up for the slump in May.
Manufacturers surveyed by the government expect output to fall 1.1% in July but rise 1.7% in August, a sign robust global demand for machinery and cars will underpin Japan's recovery.
Japan's job market remains tight. An index gauging job availability rose to 1.13 from 1.09 in May, exceeding market estimates for a 1.10 reading and marking the highest level since May last year. The jobless rate fell to 2.9% from 3.0% in May.
Underscoring the fragile state of consumption, however, retail sales were up just 0.1% in June from a year earlier, compared with a median market forecast for a 0.2% gain.
Some analysts are marking down their growth estimates for the current quarter, reflecting the planned expanded state of emergency curbs.
SMBC Nikko Securities said it now expects Japan's economy to grow an annualised 1.5% in July-September, well below its previous forecast of a 7.8% expansion.
Former Bank of Japan policymaker Takahide Kiuchi also expects the economy to grow around 2-3% in the current quarter instead of the initially projected double-digit expansion.
With the expected expansion, the state of emergency curbs could lead to a total loss of 2.19 trillion yen ($20 billion) for Japan's economy, offsetting an estimated 1.67 trillion yen benefit from the Olympic Games, said Kiuchi, who is currently executive economist at Nomura Research Institute.
""The economic boost from the Games will be completely wiped out from the expanded curbs,"" he said in a research note.

Japan's economy shrank an annualised 3.9% in January-March and likely barely grew in the second quarter, as the pandemic took a toll on service spending.

849,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 05:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory conditions likely stabilized in July, implying a more steady recovery in the economy in the second half of the year as growth risks mount.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, due to be published Saturday, is forecast to slip slightly to 50.8 in July from 50.9 in June, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists, remaining above the 50 line that separates expansion from contraction.
The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, is expected to have softened to 53.3 from 53.5 in the previous month.
A shortage of computer chips and electricity in July likely weighed on factory output, although export demand continues to be a strong support for the sector. Recent Covid-19 outbreaks, like in Jiangsu province, a major manufacturing hub, are also a worry, threatening to hamper some production and weigh on consumer spending.
The data come as top Communist Party officials meet at a key Politburo meeting this week to review the economy’s performance in the first half and set policy priorities for the rest of the year. Economists expect the leadership to signal a shift toward more monetary and fiscal support as growth gradually slows.
Government Spending
Construction activities likely stayed stable or contracted slightly in July as local governments slowed the pace of special bond sales used to finance spending on infrastructure like highways and houses.
“It’s possible that provincial decision makers are having difficulty identifying projects that meet the investment criteria, as scrutiny over big projects increases,” Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics Ltd. wrote in a note.
The PMI forecasts are largely in line with a set of early indicators tracked by Bloomberg, which showed China’s economy continuing to recover at a stable pace in July, though with some signs of weakness. Property sales slumped, small business confidence slipped and the stock market fell, the latest gauge showed.
Officials expect the recovery to remain stable in the second half of the year but have warned of some downward pressure on growth, including a likely slowdown in trade.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew solidly in the second quarter, pulling the level of gross domestic product above its pre-pandemic peak, as massive government aid and vaccinations against COVID-19 fueled spending on goods and services.
The pace of GDP growth reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday was, however, slower than economists had expected. That was because businesses ran down inventories further to meet the robust demand. Supply constraints, which have caused shortages of goods such as motor vehicles and household appliances, are making it harder for business to replenish stocks.
""The U.S. economy is off and running,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Real GDP has fully recovered what it lost in the downturn. The economy is well ahead of much of the rest of the world, save China and some parts of southeast Asia, in its recovery from the pandemic recession""
Gross domestic product increased at a 6.5% annualized rate last quarter, the government said in its advance estimate of second-quarter GDP. The economy grew at a 6.3% rate in the first quarter, revised down from the previously reported 6.4% pace.
The level of GDP is now 0.8% higher than it was at its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019, marking the shortest recession and fastest recovery in the nation's history. After the 2007-09 downturn, it took the economy 3-1/2 years to return to its pre-recession peak. 
""The economy has achieved escape velocity from which there is no going back,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at an 8.5% rate last quarter. Inventories contracted at a rate of $165.9 billion, slicing 1.13 percentage points from GDP growth.
Trade, housing and government spending were also drags on GDP growth last quarter. Excluding inventories, trade and government spending, the economy grew at a 9.9% pace. This measure of domestic demand rose at an 11.8% pace in the first quarter. 
Annual revisions to GDP data showed the economy shrinking 3.4% in 2020, instead of 3.5% as previously estimated. That was still the biggest drop in GDP since 1946. The revisions to growth in other years and quarters were minor. 
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of U.S. recessions, declared last week that the pandemic downturn, which started in February 2020, ended in April 2020.
Even with the second quarter marking the peak in growth this cycle, the economic expansion is expected to remain solid for the rest of the year. Economists expect growth of around 7% this year, which would be the strongest performance since 1984. 
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday boosted its growth forecasts for the United States to 7.0% in 2021 and 4.9% in 2022, up 0.6 and 1.4 percentage points respectively, from the forecasts in April.
A resurgence in COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, however, poses a risk to the outlook. Higher inflation, if sustained, as well as ongoing supply chain disruptions could also slow the economy. 
Inflation soared in the second quarter, with the Federal Reserve's preferred measure - the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components - surging at a 6.1 % rate after increasing at a 2.7% pace in the January-March quarter. 
The Fed on Wednesday kept its overnight benchmark interest rate near zero and left its bond-buying program unchanged. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that the pandemic's economic effects continued to diminish, but risks to the outlook remain.
Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the S&P 500 and the Dow indexes scaling record highs on the GDP data and a slate of strong corporate earnings reports. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.

ROBUST CONSUMER SPENDING
President Joe Biden's administration provided $1.9 trillion in pandemic relief in March, including sending one-time $1,400 checks to qualified households, bringing the amount of government aid to nearly $6 trillion since the pandemic started in the United States in March 2020.
Nearly half of the population has been vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing Americans to engage in services-related activities that were curbed early in the pandemic.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, grew at an 11.8% rate in the second quarter after rising at an 11.4% pace in the prior period.
Americans frequented restaurants, stayed at hotels and visited casinos. They also bought motor vehicles and clothing. 
Though the fiscal boost is fading and COVID-19 cases are rising in states with lower vaccination rates, consumer spending will likely continue to grow. Households accumulated at least $2 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic. Record-high stock market prices and accelerating home prices are boosting household wealth. Wages are also rising as companies compete for scarce workers amid a strengthening labor market.
A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 24,000 to a seasonally adjusted 400,000 for the week ended July 24. Claims hit a two-month high in the prior week, but that was likely due to difficulties stripping out seasonal fluctuations from the data. 
Businesses maintained a robust pace of investment, buying light trucks, aircraft and machinery. They invested in research and development as well as software, but cut back on spending on commercial and health care structures.

Government spending was weighed down by weakness in nondefense services as the processing and administration of Paycheck Protection Program loan applications by banks on behalf of the federal government declined.
""Supply chains allowing, the need to rebuild off of the currently very low level of inventories should set up for inventory investment to boost GDP in coming quarters, but the availability of certain goods will be the key constraint determining the timing of that recovery,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.

(Reuters) -Contracts to purchase previously owned U.S. homes declined in June in step with a spike in home prices after rebounding strongly in the prior month.
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Thursday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, fell 1.9% to 112.8. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales would increase 0.3%.
Pending home sales for May were revised to show an increase of 8.3% instead of the 8.0% gain previously reported.
Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.
""Pending sales have seesawed since January, indicating a turning point for the market,"" Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said in a statement. ""Buyers are still interested and want to own a home, but record-high home prices are causing some to retreat.""
House prices have soared in the past year, with the median price for both new and existing homes now topping $360,000.
Compared with one year ago, pending home sales were down 1.9%.
Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) drops in pending home sales in the South and West in June outweighed modest increases in the Northeast and Midwest.
""The Midwest region offers the most affordable costs for a home and hence that region has seen better sales activity compared to other areas in recent months,"" Yun said. 
Home prices have surged nationwide in large part due to limited supply. Contrary to the run-up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the current boom does not feature a frenzy of speculators and buyers with low credit scores trying to flip homes.
Sales of new single-family homes fell for the third consecutive month in June, hitting a 14-month low. However, existing home sales rebounded moderately last month. 

""With prices at record highs and mortgage rates still hovering near record lows, sellers are recognizing the favorable conditions,"" said George Ratiu, senior economist at Realtor.com. 
The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages declined to 3.01% - its lowest level since February - in the week ended July 23.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Employment growth in Brazil picked up in June, official figures showed on Thursday, the sixth month of gains and bringing the number of formal jobs created in the first half of the year to its highest since 2010.
The increase was widespread, with all five sectors covered by the Economy Ministry figures showing net job growth in June, meaning more than 1.5 million new positions have been opened up in the first six months of the year.
Some 1.6 million positions were created in June and 1.29 million were cut, resulting in 309,114 net new positions. That was up from the previous month and the most for any June since at least 2010, ministry figures showed.
The gains were led by the dominant services sector, which created a net 125,713 new positions. Commerce accounted for 72,887 net new positions, industry 50,145 and agriculture 38,005, the ministry said.
This means Brazil created a net 1.54 million new formal jobs in the first half of the year. These figures do not include the nearly 40 million undocumented workers in Brazil who do not have formal employment registration.
The total number of formally registered workers in Brazil rose to 40.9 million, the highest June reading since 2014, according to ministry figures.

Earnings fell slightly, however, with the average monthly salary of new jobs created in June down 0.1% in real terms from the prior month to an unadjusted 1,806.29 reais ($355.50).

BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany's annual consumer price inflation accelerated by more than expected to hit a 13-year high in July, leading services sector trade union Verdi to immediately demand ""strong wage increases"".
Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose by 3.1% in July compared with 2.1% in June, the Federal Statistics Office said. A Reuters poll had pointed to a reading of 2.9%.
July's reading was the highest since August 2008, when the harmonised inflation rate hit 3.3%, an official at the Statistics Office said.
The rise pushed the inflation rate further above the European Central Bank's 2% target, and fuelled a debate about whether the increase in the cost of living will persist.
""From today's perspective, a sustained increase in inflation is not to be expected,"" an Economy Ministry spokesperson said, citing base effects from a temporary reduction in VAT rates in the second half of 2020 that affected comparisons.
However, German central bank chief Jens Weidmann has said he is worried about the prospect of the ECB's low-interest-rate environment being extended for too long. Weidmann said his advisers anticipated inflation nearing 5% in Germany later this year.
Weidmann made his comments after the ECB pledged to keep interest rates at record lows for even longer to boost sluggish inflation and warned that the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus poses a risk to recovery.
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said supply chain disruptions and higher commodity costs could put more pressure on prices, adding: ""Don't rule out that headline inflation north of 4% at the end of the year will affect wage negotiations in 2022.""
Services sector trade union Verdi jumped on the acceleration in inflation to call for robust wage rises.
""We need strong wage increases for employees precisely because of rising prices,"" Verdi deputy chair Andrea Kocsis told Reuters.
Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg Bank, said some service sector businesses had taken advantage of the reopening of the economy after COVID-19 lockdowns to raise their prices.
""In the coming months, the inflation rate will remain high and even tend to increase somewhat,"" he added.

Euro zone inflation figures for July are due on Friday. In June, the rate ran at 1.9%.
The ECB said last week it would not hike borrowing costs until it sees inflation reach its 2% target ""well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably"".

854,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Applications for U.S. state unemployment fell last week, signaling that the labor market continues to improve even as the delta variant of Covid-19 rages amid sustained vaccine hesitancy.
Initial jobless claims in regular state programs totaled 400,000 in the week ended July 24, down 24,000 from the prior week, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 385,000 new applications.
Weekly unemployment claims have fallen considerably since the beginning of the year against a backdrop of elevated labor demand. At the same time, the delta variant that’s fueled a recent surge in new infections across the country poses a risk.
As the threat of renewed restrictions looms and large swaths of the country remain unvaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance on indoor masking to include K-12 classrooms and inoculated people who live in Covid-19 “hot spots.”
To prevent a so-called fourth wave of infections, local governments are becoming more aggressive in getting city employees vaccinated. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is mandating that all public workers get inoculated by Sept. 13 while San Francisco considers a similar move pending full Food and Drug Administration authorization for the jabs.
At the federal level, President Joe Biden says he is assessing a vaccine mandate for government employees.
About half of U.S. governors have ended all three of the federal unemployment benefit programs created during the pandemic before their expiry in September, arguing the supplemental aid is preventing businesses from filling a record number of job openings.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy contracted at a record average annualized rate of 19.2% from its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020, government data showed on Thursday, confirming that the COVID-19 recession was the worst ever.
The pace of recovery from the pandemic downturn, the deepest going back to 1947, was equally stunning. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said gross domestic product rebounded at a historic average rate of 18.3% between the second and fourth quarter of 2020. 
Mandatory shutdowns of nonessential businesses in March last year to slow the first wave of coronavirus infections left the economy reeling, throwing a record 22.362 million people out of work. The government provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief, while the Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero and is pumping money into the economy through monthly bond purchases. 
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of U.S. recessions, declared last week that the pandemic downturn, which started in February 2020, ended in April 2020. 
Massive fiscal stimulus, the Fed's ultra-easy monetary policy and vaccinations against COVID-19 have allowed economic activity to resume, with GDP pulling above its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter. The government also said the economy shrank 3.4% in 2020, instead of 3.5% as previously estimated. That was still the biggest drop in GDP since 1946. 
Revisions to growth in other years and quarters were minor. From 2015 to 2020, GDP increased at an average annual rate of 1.1%, unrevised from previously published estimates. 
The BEA said in 2018 it had fully addressed a methodology problem, or residual seasonality, which analysts had argued tended to understate economic growth in the first quarter.

While growth likely peaked in the second quarter, economists see GDP increasing around 7% this year, which would be the strongest performance since 1984. 
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday significantly raised its growth forecasts for the United States to 7.0% in 2021 and 4.9% in 2022, up 0.6 and 1.4 percentage points respectively, from its forecasts in April.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy didn't grow as fast as analysts expected in the second quarter, as labor and product shortages across various industries offset a rebound in service activity.
Much of the all important service-sector had reopened for business between April and June as the nation's vaccination program and seasonal factors allowed a relaxation of public health measures to stop the spread of Covid-19.
All the same, gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of only 6.5%, well below the 8.5% rate forecast and only a marginal acceleration from the 6.4% registered in the first quarter.
The figures are the first reading for the quarter, and are likely to be revised in the coming weeks. While subject to revision, they stand in contrast to widespread reports of a broad and rapid rebound.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis said that the figures reflected ""increases in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), non-residential fixed investment, exports, and state and local government spending.""
These ""were partly offset by decreases in private inventory investment, residential fixed investment, and federal government spending"", the BEA said. The decline in federal spending happened despite the latest round of stimulus checks approved by the Biden administration and Congress. Anecdotal reports suggest much of the stimulus was spent on imported goods, which are subtracted from the calculation of GDP.  Imports started the quarter at a blistering pace: having hit a record $277 billion in March before falling to $273 billion in April.
Elsewhere, there was fresh evidence that the labor market is struggling to sustain the improvement it showed earlier in the year. Initial jobless claims topped 400,000 for the second week in a row, rather than falling to 380,000 expected. 
In the week through July 10, the overall number of people claiming any kind of unemployment benefit actually rose by over 500,000 to 13.16 million."

LONDON (Reuters) -British mortgage lending showed a record surge in June as home-buyers rushed to qualify for a tax break before it was scaled back, but other data added to signs that a rise in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks slowed the broader economic recovery from lockdown.
Mortgage borrowing leapt by a net 17.9 billion pounds ($25.0 billion) from May, the biggest monthly increase in Bank of England records which date back to 1993.
The scale of the increase underscored how the tax incentive fired up Britain's housing market, which was already being boosted by rising demand for bigger properties as more people worked from home because of the pandemic.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a much smaller net increase of 7.9 billion pounds.
The data also showed the end of the full tax break was having an effect on new activity in the housing market.
Approvals of new mortgages by lenders - which in June would have been made too late for buyers to complete their purchase in time to get the tax break - fell to 81,300, the lowest figure since July 2020, the month when the incentive first took effect. 
Under the scheme - part of finance minister Rishi Sunak's support for the pandemic-hit economy - the first 500,000 pounds of any property purchase in England or Northern Ireland were exempt from stamp duty until the end of June. 
A 250,000 pound tax-free allowance is now running until the end of September.
In contrast to the surge in mortgage lending, borrowing by British consumers rose only slightly last month. 
Unsecured lending increased by a net 300 million pounds, well below the 1.2 billion-pound monthly average in the two years before the pandemic. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a rise of 600 million pounds in June.
""These figures chime with other early indicators such as spending on electronic cards that the resurgence of COVID-19 cases has increased consumer caution,"" Kieran Tompkins (NYSE:TMP), an economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said.
The BoE is expected to keep its stimulus programme running at full speed on Aug. 5, after its latest policy meeting, as it waits to see the impact of reduced emergency government help for workers and companies in the months ahead as well as progress in tackling the virus.
Sunak is phasing out a wage subsidy furlough scheme by the end of September.
Figures published on Thursday showed 4.9% of the workforce remained on the scheme in early July, though most were only furloughed on a part-time basis and were working some of their normal hours for their employer. This was down from 19.9% in January when the government ordered a new lockdown, but was little changed from late May.

Data from the Office for National Statistics also showed spending using payment cards edged up last week but was 6% below its pre-pandemic level, while online job advertisements rose by 1% to 31% above their February 2020 average.

The EU executive said its monthly survey that sentiment in the 19-country single-currency bloc rose to 119.0 points in July, a record since data began to be collected in 1985, from 117.9 in June, which was already a 21-year high.
However, as the positive impact of the reopening of economic activities begins to wane and fears grow around the Delta coronavirus variant, sentiment grew at a slower pace.
""Compared to the last months, the latest improvement was much weaker, suggesting that the indicator is approaching its peak,"" the European Commission said in a statement.
The rise in sentiment in July was supported by a new surge of optimism in the manufacturing sector which reached another all-time-high after repeated increase this year as factory managers remain largely upbeat.
Confidence also rose to its highest level since August 2007 in the services sector, which has been hit hardest during the pandemic and is the chief beneficiary of the current reopenings.
But the rise in the overall sentiment was checked by a decline in consumers' confidence, after a five month rally, partly caused by households' worse assessment of the future economic situation and plans to make major purchases.
That contributed to a slight fall of optimism in the retail sector.
Selling prices expectations continued to increase across the board in line with forecasts of higher inflation towards the end of the year in the euro zone.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit in goods increased in June as imports continued to rise amid strong economic activity, suggesting trade likely remained a drag on growth in the second quarter.
The U.S. economy has rebounded more quickly from the pandemic compared to its global rivals, thanks to massive fiscal stimulus, low interest rates and vaccinations against COVID-19. But bottlenecks in the supply chain have hampered manufacturers' ability to boost production, drawing in more imports.
""The widening in the advance nominal goods deficit in June is further evidence that net exports will be a drag on second- quarter GDP,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The goods trade deficit increased 3.5% to $91.2 billion last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Imports of goods advanced 1.5% to $236.7 billion. There were increases in imports of food, industrial supplies and capital goods. 
But imports of motor vehicles and consumer goods fell. While that could hint at a possible moderation in consumer spending in the months ahead, the drop could reflect a global shortage of semiconductors, which has weighed on the production of motor vehicles and some household appliances.
Spending during the pandemic shifted to goods from services, with Americans cooped up at home. With nearly half of the United States population fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, demand for services is picking up. 
That has raised optimism among some economists that fewer goods will be imported in the coming months and allow the trade gap to shrink. But the Delta variant of the virus is driving a resurgence in new infections across the country, which could limit demand for services.
""We expect the overall trade deficit to narrow in the coming months as consumers rotate their spending towards services and greater vaccine diffusion abroad encourages stronger export growth,"" said Mahir Rasheed, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""However, risks from sticky supply chain disruptions and the rapid spread of the Delta variant could slow trade flows.""
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
EXPORTS RISE 
Goods exports rose 0.3% to $145.5 billion, amid a sharp decline in food shipments. Capital goods exports also slipped. But the nation exported more motor vehicles and consumer goods.
The report was published ahead of Thursday's advance second-quarter gross domestic product data. Trade has been a drag on GDP growth for three straight quarters.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the economy likely grew at a robust 8.5% annualized rate last quarter, an acceleration from the first quarter's 6.4% pace. The anticipated growth pace in the second quarter would be the fastest since 1983 and could mark a peak in the current cycle. 
Some of the imports last month were used to replenish inventories at wholesalers and retailers, which could soften the drag on GDP growth from trade. 
The Commerce Department reported wholesale inventories increased 0.8% last month after rising 1.3% in May. Stocks at retailers gained 0.3% after dropping 0.8% in May. Motor vehicle inventories slipped 0.3% after declining 5.5% in May. Auto production has been undercut by the global chip shortage.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, climbed 0.6% after advancing 0.9% in May. 

Business inventories were drawn down in the first quarter.
""Overall, it looks like real inventories fell sharply in the second quarter on net, but the weakness was most severe early in the quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

(Reuters) - The number of applications for U.S. home mortgages increased last week, driven by an uptick in refinancing activity and a decline in purchase activity as mortgage rates fell.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted market index rose 5.7% in the week ended July 23 from a week earlier. That reflected a 9.3% increase in applications to refinance existing loans, while purchase applications declined 1.6%.

The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages decreased to 3.01% from 3.11% the prior week, its lowest level since February.
""The purchase index decreased for the second week in a row to its lowest level since May 2020, and has now declined on an annual basis for the past three months,"" Joel Kan, MBA's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement. ""Potential buyers continue to be put off by extremely high home prices and increased competition.""

In monthly terms, house prices fell by 0.5% from June, their first fall since March, slowing the annual increase to 10.5% from June's leap of 13.4% which was the steepest rise in 17 years.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a less marked cooling of the market, predicting prices would rise by 0.6% from June and by 12.1% in annual terms.
Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said the rush to qualify for the full tax break - housing transactions hit a record in June, according to official data - meant savings from the incentive had been dwarfed by the surge in house prices.
Under the incentive scheme, the first 500,000 pounds ($693,850.00) of any property purchase in England or Northern Ireland were exempt from the stamp duty tax until the end of June. A 250,000 pound tax-free allowance is now running until the end of September
Gardner said July's slowdown had been expected after the run-up in prices which rose by an average of 1.6% a month over the April-to-June period, more than six times the average monthly gain during the five years before the pandemic.
""Underlying demand is likely to remain solid in the near term,"" he said.
Improved consumer confidence, low borrowing costs and a shortage of homes on the market would provide support for house prices despite an expected rise in unemployment as the government scales back its pandemic jobs support programme. 

""Even if the labour market does weaken, there is also scope for shifts in housing preferences as a result of the pandemic to continue to support activity for some time yet,"" Gardner said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's consumer prices rose at the fastest annual pace in almost 13 years last quarter as petrol jumped and government subsidies unwound, but a far tamer reading for core inflation suggested the spike would be fleeting.
Indeed, the run-up has already been overtaken by events as coronavirus lockdowns in major population centers will almost certainly send the economy backwards this quarter, a powerful argument for extended monetary and fiscal stimulus.
""The heightened risk posed by the delta variant will result in the economy contracting sharply in the September quarter,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief Australia economist for BIS Oxford Economics. ""Against this backdrop core inflation is likely to remain subdued.""
Wednesday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the headline consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.8% in the June quarter, from the previous quarter, just topping market forecasts of a 0.7% increase.
Petrol was the biggest contributor, followed by health care, fresh food and motor vehicles, where strong demand and supply bottlenecks have pushed up prices.
The CPI climbed a sharp 3.8% on a year ago, but largely because the index had been artificially depressed last year by lockdown relief measures notably on child care payments.
The more benign underlying trend was evident in the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) trimmed mean measure of inflation which rose just 0.5% in the quarter and 1.6% for the year.
Core inflation has run stubbornly short of the RBA's 2-3% target band for more than five years, and the bank itself fears it will not reach 2% until the middle of 2023 even with interest rates at record lows.
Crucially there has been scant sign of the kind of broad wage pressures seen in the United States, with Australian firms focused on controlling costs above all else.
The outlook has been further clouded by the spread of the Delta variant, which forced New South Wales on Wednesday to extend a lockdown of Sydney for another four weeks.
Restrictions in the country's most populous city are set to blow a hole in consumer spending and employment this quarter, puncturing what had been a remarkably rapid national recovery.

Gareth Aird, head of Australian economics at CBA, now expects the economy to shrink by a gut wrenching 2.7% this quarter, with a revival unlikely until November.
""A deep contraction in GDP over Q3 21 is now a fait accompli,"" he warned. ""Substantial policy support will once again be needed to ensure that the economic rebound is swift when restrictions are eased.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased solidly in June despite supply constraints hampering production at some factories, suggesting business spending on equipment could remain strong beyond the second quarter.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.5% last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. These so-called core capital goods orders had gained 0.5% in May.
Economists polled by Reuters had on average forecast core capital goods orders advancing 0.7%. 
U.S. stock index futures moved lower after the data. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
Business investment on equipment has boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic, underpinning manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile consumer spending shifted to goods from services, with millions of Americans cooped up at home. 
Record low interest rates and massive fiscal stimulus measures offered a further boost, causing supply constraints.
Though demand is reverting to services, with just under half of the population fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, spending on goods is likely to remain strong. 
Households accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic and inventories are low, which will likely see businesses continuing to invest in equipment to boost output.
Core capital goods orders were lifted last month by machinery and primary metal products, as well as computers and electronic products. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components were unchanged.
BUSINESS SPENDING 
Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.6% after accelerating 0.9% in May. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
Business spending on equipment has recorded three straight quarters of double-digit growth. Another solid quarter of growth is expected when the government publishes its advance estimate of GDP growth for the second quarter on Thursday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP growth likely increased at an 8.6% annualized rate last quarter, an acceleration from the first quarter's 6.4% pace. The anticipated growth in the second quarter would be the fastest since 1983 and could mark a peak in the current cycle.
Orders for durable goods, or items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, advanced 0.8% in June after rebounding 3.2% in May. They were supported by a 2.1% increase in orders for transportation equipment.
Orders for civilian aircraft climbed 17.0%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website it had received 219 aircraft orders last month, including 200 for the 737 MAX jet from United Airlines. That compared with 73 aircraft orders in May.

Orders for motor vehicles and parts slipped 0.3% after rising 2.0% in May. Motor vehicle production has been hit by a global semiconductor chip shortage. Output of computers and electronic products has also been impacted. 
Unfilled durable goods orders increased 0.9% in June after rising 1.0% in May.

The Confederation of British Industry's measure of the volume of sales compared with a year earlier dipped to +23 from June's +25, which was the highest since August 2018.
Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected a bigger fall to +21.
The CBI said the growth in orders was the fastest since December 2010 and the pace of sales was expected to pick up again in August.
However, sales were reported as in line with usual levels for the time of year, excluding the effect of Britain's coronavirus lockdown. 
CBI economist Ben Jones said consumer demand was supporting Britain's economic recovery, although clothing and footwear stores in particular had yet to see demand recover.
""While demand may be more stable, operational issues worsen,"" he said. 
""Relative stock levels are at a record low and expected to fall further still, while the number one worry for many firms at the minute is labour shortages throughout the supply chain as staff self-isolate.""

The Bank of England is keeping a close eye on how much Britons spend from savings Britons build up during the lockdown, which could prove a key driver of the country's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is also looking at whether bottlenecks in supply caused by the pandemic - such as dwindling stocks in the retail sector - will lead to longer-term inflation pressures.

Gross domestic product (GDP) likely expanded 6.05% in the April-June period versus a year ago, the poll of 12 economists shows, after it grew 8.92% year-on-year in the first quarter, the strongest quarterly growth in over a decade.
As a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan's economy has outperformed many of its regional peers during the pandemic as it benefited from robust demand for its tech exports.
But domestic consumption was hit by a rare spike in community COVID-19 transmissions in mid-May. The outbreak has now been brought well under control, with the alert level lowered and restrictions on gatherings and restaurant dining eased this week. 
Economists' forecasts for preliminary GDP data due on Friday varied widely from growth of 2.6% to as high as 7.2%.
""We do not think this epidemic outbreak will impact the recovery of domestic consumption,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a note. ""Strong global demand and domestic capital expenditure will be able to support Taiwan's economic growth.""
Taiwan's key semiconductor industry has been largely unaffected by the pandemic at home, and exports have remained strong. June exports rose 35.1% from a year earlier to $36.65 billion, the second highest monthly figure on record.
Last week, the Asian Development Bank raised its full-year GDP outlook for Taiwan to 5.6% from an earlier 4.6%, citing among other things ""robust external demand"".
Taiwan has benefited from the work-and-study from home trend around the world, which has buoyed demand for laptops, tablets and other electronics made with components supplied by firms like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC).

The economy in China, Taiwan's top trading partner, expanded more slowly than expected in the second quarter, as slowing manufacturing activity, higher raw material costs and new COVID-19 outbreaks weighed on the recovery momentum.
Taiwan's preliminary figures will be released in a statement with minimal commentary. Revised figures will be released about two to three weeks later, with more details and forward-looking forecasts.

Industrial firms' profits rose 20% year-on-year in June to 791.8 billion yuan ($122.27 billion), data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Tuesday, after a 36.4% increase in May.
The Chinese economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but it has faced new challenges in recent months such as higher raw material costs and global supply chain crunches.
""The unevenness in the recovery of corporate profitability still exists, with private firms and small businesses facing a slow rebound,"" said Zhu Hong, a senior statistician at the NBS.
""Commodity prices continue to stay at high levels, squeezing the profitability of enterprises, and there are still weak points in supply chains and industrial chains.""
In the first half of 2021, industrial firms' profits grew a hefty 66.9% from a pandemic-induced slump in the same period a year earlier. Profits in January-June increased 45.5% from the same period in 2019, before the global pandemic started.
""The profit margin of upstream industrial enterprises improved further while downstream profit margin edged down slightly,"" said analysts from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a note.
China's factory activity slowed in June on a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the export province of Guangdong, with epidemic prevention and control efforts curbing port processing capacity.
Metals processing, as well as chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, drove profit growth in June, according to NBS data. 
Chinese policymakers have stepped up efforts to curb surging commodity prices that have squeezed manufacturers' margins to prevent the price increases from being passed on to consumers.
While China's producer price inflation eased in June after the government crackdown on runaway commodity prices, the annual rate continued to hover at an uncomfortably high level. Some analysts expect the factory gate inflation to stay elevated in the second half of this year.
China's economy grew slightly more slowly than expected in the second quarter. Officials have warned that the recovery remains uneven.

Liabilities at industrial firms were up 8.5% year-on-year at the end of June, versus the 8.2% growth seen at the end of May.
The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenues of over 20 million yuan from their main operations.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economy expanded at the fastest annual pace in a decade in the second quarter, thanks to a pick up in private consumption, though a resurgence of COVID-19 casts doubt over the outlook for growth for the rest of the year.
Data from the Bank of Korea on Tuesday showed gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.7% in the second quarter, after rising 1.7% three months earlier and matching 0.7% growth tipped in a Reuters survey.
The economy surged 5.9% year-on-year, the fastest growth in a decade and up sharply from 1.9% in the first quarter, in part because of the low base effect of last year but also driven by strong exports and imports as major trading partners continued to reopen.
That, however, missed market forecast growth of 6.0% for the annual reading.
The result would be no surprise for the BOK, which is expected to be the first Asian central bank to raise interest rates from pandemic-era lows, as growth and inflation return.
But economists see the pace of growth slowing in the third quarter as the government brought in its toughest coronavirus restrictions yet to contain the worst outbreak in the country.
While exports surged 22.4% on-year, they declined 2.0% from the previous quarter and became a net drag on economic output in the second quarter, suggesting growth may plateau in the months ahead.
""We record exports in volume terms, not in terms of value, which should help explain the slight decline in exports, as export prices have been increasing quite a lot. Also, a shortage of chips for cars also dragged production,"" said Park Yang-su, head of statistics department at the BOK. 
SK Hynix, the world's second-biggest memory chipmaker, on Tuesday reported the highest quarterly profit since the end of 2018, while Korean steelmaker  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX) posted its highest ever quarterly profit last week.
The main driver of growth in the second quarter was private consumption and government expenditure, which rose 3.5% and 3.9%, respectively, on-quarter.
Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Tuesday the government will soon release measures to boost consumption to help those hit by the latest virus curbs, using the 34.9 trillion won ($30.36 billion) extra budget spending earmarked for pandemic relief packages.
Still, some economists are lowering their growth projection for the country.
""Given that growth was not as strong as we had expected, we are lowering our forecast for the year as a whole to 4.3%, from 5% previously,"" said Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics.

""We don’t think there was anything in the figures that would persuade the BOK to delay the timing of its first rate hike. We are sticking with our non-consensus view of a move in late-August.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes tumbled to a 14-month low in June and sales in the prior month were weaker than initially estimated, suggesting that expensive building materials and the resulting surge in prices for properties were restraining the housing market.
New home sales fell 6.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000 units last month, the lowest level since April 2020, the Commerce Department said on Monday. May's sales pace was revised down to 724,000 units from the previously reported 769,000 units. Sales have now dropped for three straight months.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for a small share of U.S. home sales, increasing 3% to rate of 800,000 units in June.
""Until builder costs and supply-chain problems become less of an impediment, it is hard to see new sales picking up significantly in the near term,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
The report followed in the wake of news last week that building permits fell to a nine-month low in June, while sales of previously owned homes rebounded moderately. The COVID-19 pandemic, which forced millions of Americans to work from home and take online classes, led to a boom in housing demand.
But supply has lagged behind, with builders constrained by expensive lumber as well as shortages of other building materials, household appliances, land and labor. The backlog of single-family homes approved for construction but yet to be started surged in June to the highest level since October 2006.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.

The housing market was one of the economy's star performers during the pandemic, posting double-digit growth for three straight quarters. That streak likely came to an end in the second quarter, with residential investment believed to have had a neutral impact on gross domestic product.
The government is scheduled to publish its snapshot of second-quarter GDP on Thursday.
Last month, new home sales dropped in the populous South, the Northeast and West. They rose in the Midwest. New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from building permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis.
Sales declined 19.4% on a year-on-year basis in June. That was the first annual decrease since the pandemic.
The median new house price increased 6.1% from a year earlier to $361,800 in June. Sales were concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. Sales below the $200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for only 2% of transactions last month.

There were 353,000 new homes on the market, up from 330,000 in May. At June's sales pace it would take 6.3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.5 months in May. 
About 77% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German business morale fell unexpectedly in July on continuing supply chain worries and amid rising coronavirus infections, a survey showed on Monday, the first decline since January. 
The Ifo institute said its business climate index fell to 100.8 from a revised figure of 101.7 in June and versus a Reuters poll forecast of 102.1.
""Supply bottlenecks for preliminary materials and concerns regarding a renewed rise in (coronavirus) infection numbers are weighing on the German economy,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement. 
Companies gave a slightly better assessment of their current situation but optimism with regard to the coming months waned.
The Ifo expectations index fell to 101.2 from 103.7 in June, while the current conditions index rose to 100.4 from 99.7. 
Almost 64% of industrial firms in Europe's biggest economy complained about bottlenecks in supply chains, while 60% of wholesalers and 42.5% of retailers also reported shortages, according to the institute. 
""Nerves are on edge again,"" said Andreas Scheuerle, economist at Dekabank. ""The first drop in the Ifo business climate came faster than feared.""
Events including the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters in China and Germany and cyber attacks have conspired to drive global supply chains towards a breaking point, threatening the flow of raw materials, parts and consumer goods.
""The expected straight-line economic recovery in the second half of 2021 is not a foregone conclusion,"" Bankhaus Lampe chief economist Alexander Krueger said.
Supply chain disruptions are likely to persist and economic recovery will continue to depend on the pandemic, Krueger added. 
Germany's car industry - featuring powerful brands like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and BMW and accounting for an estimated 5% of the economic output and more than 800,000 jobs - this month slashed its forecast for 2021 production growth in response to the insecurities.
The flooding in western Germany two weeks ago is likely to add to the problems, and road transportation of goods has slowed significantly. In the week of July 11, as the disaster unfolded, the volume of late shipments rose by 15% from the week before, according to data from supply-chain tracking platform FourKites. 
In Germany's tourism and hospitality sectors, among the worst hit by lockdowns, euphoria has also ebbed, with many fearing a fourth wave of the coronavirus, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
After more than two months of steady decline, COVID-19 cases have been rising since early July, due mainly to the spread of the more infectious Delta variant.

Roughly 60% of Germany's 83 million people have had a first shot of a COVID-19 vaccine and about half are fully vaccinated.

The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to a seasonally adjusted 52.2 in July from a final 52.4 in the previous month, in a sign of a softer improvement in operating conditions.
Among key economic elements, output and new orders growth eased to six-month lows amid rising COVID-19 infections and delays in getting raw materials, said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The survey also showed the services sector continued to face severe conditions, with activity contracting at the fastest pace in five months and marking the 18th straight month of decline.

""Short-term disruption to activity is likely to continue until the latest wave of COVID-19 infections passes and restrictions enacted under state of emergency laws are lifted,"" Bhatti said.
""Employment levels in the Japanese private sector continued to expand, however the rate of job creation eased,"" he added. ""At the same time, input costs across the private sector rose at the fastest pace since September 2008.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business activity grew at a moderate pace for a second straight month in July amid supply constraints, suggesting a cooling in economic activity after what was expected to have been a robust second quarter.
Data firm IHS Markit said on Friday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to a four-month low of 59.7 from 63.7 in June. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector.
Businesses are battling shortages of raw materials and labor, which are fanning inflation, in the aftermath of the economy's reopening after severe disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey's findings fit in with economists' views that growth will slow after accelerating in the second quarter, thanks to massive fiscal stimulus.
Even with the boost from government money fading, the economy remains supported by strong demand, with households having accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic. The labor market recovery is also gaining traction and wages are rising as companies compete for workers.
But the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which is behind a resurgence in new COVID-19 infections in parts of the country with low vaccination rates, could result in consumers being more cautious.
""While the second quarter may therefore represent a peaking in the pace of economic growth according to the PMI, the third quarter is still looking encouragingly strong,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. ""Short-term capacity issues remain a concern, constraining output in many manufacturing and service sector companies while simultaneously pushing prices higher as demand exceeds supply.""
The government is due to publish its snapshot of second-quarter gross domestic product next Thursday. Growth estimates are converging around a 9.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.4% pace in the first quarter.
The IHS Markit survey's flash services sector PMI fell to a reading of 59.8 from 64.6 in June, slowing further from May's record high. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 64.8 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Firms reporting a slowdown in activity cited labor shortages and difficulties acquiring stock. According to the survey, some firms reported customer hesitancy because of significant hikes in selling prices. Companies are passing on to consumers the higher production costs brought about by scarce raw materials and workers.
The government reported last week that consumer prices increased by the most in 13 years in June, while producer prices accelerated.
There are, however, signs that inflation is close to peaking. The survey's measure of prices paid by services businesses slipped to 72.1 from a reading of 74.2 in June.

While services sector activity is cooling, manufacturing continues to power ahead. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI rose to an all-time high reading of 63.1 from 62.1 in June. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, would dip to 62.
A measure of new orders received by factories increased and manufacturers reported unfinished work continued to pile up even as hiring picked up. Suppliers continued to struggle to deliver inputs on time.

Supermarkets and hauliers say staff shortages are making it hard to restock shelves and deliver goods, and Friday's monthly purchasing managers' index (PMI) data gave the first clear evidence of the scale of the impact.
The IHS Markit/CIPS flash composite PMI dropped to 57.7 in July from 62.2 in June. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the economy but the reading was the lowest since March and a sharper fall than most economists had forecast in a Reuters poll.
""July saw the UK economy's recent growth spurt stifled by the rising wave of virus infections, which subdued customer demand, disrupted supply chains and caused widespread staff shortages, and also cast a darkening shadow over the outlook,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.
The economy was still on course to expand in the third quarter, but at a slower pace than before, he added.
The British PMI contrasted with the one for the euro zone, which struck its highest since July 2000, and sterling extended losses after the data.
Britain's economy has rebounded after its nearly 10% slump in 2020 when the country suffered one of the world's heaviest coronavirus death tolls and locked down for longer than many other European nations.
But reopening has created bottlenecks and inflation pressures. Two Bank of England policymakers have suggested an early end to the BoE's bond-buying stimulus.
Friday's PMI data showed a record rise in businesses' costs and a near-record increase in the prices they charged.
However, the weaker-than-expected activity figures are likely to make other policymakers wary of scaling back support next month. The BoE is due to announce its next policy decision on Aug. 5.
""Given today's numbers, the uncertainty around the Delta variant and the impact of the end of the Job Retention Scheme from September, we expect the Bank to stick to its current course,"" Willem Sels, chief investment officer at HSBC's wealth management division, said. 
CONSUMERS SEE CLOUDS AHEAD
The slower growth in business activity seen in the PMI survey - conducted July 12-21 - contrasted with a return to pre-pandemic consumer confidence levels in a survey by market researchers GfK published earlier on Friday.
However, households did express greater concern about the economic outlook than a month earlier due to worries about COVID-19 variants, rising inflation and reduced furlough support.
Other figures showed retail sales volumes rose 0.5% in June to stand 9.5% above pre-pandemic levels, bolstered by a jump in food and drink during the Euro 2020 soccer tournament.
Monday marked the end of most COVID restrictions on businesses in England, with nightclubs allowed to reopen, mask-wearing requirements largely scrapped and capacity restrictions lifted for pubs, restaurants and shops.
But the reopening has been questioned by critics of the government, coming just as COVID cases are rising again.
The latest wave of infections led to more than 600,000 people in England and Wales being told to self-isolate last week because they were close contacts of people who tested positive and were ""pinged"" by a government app.
Businesses want the government to bring forward the scheduled Aug. 16 lifting of that requirement for workers who are fully vaccinated or test negative for COVID. The government said it would exempt up to 10,000 workers in food supply chains.

The fall in the PMI was greatest in the services sector, especially among transport and hospitality firms.
Orders growth was the weakest since February and business optimism fell to its lowest since October 2020, before news of effective COVID vaccines. Brexit-related trade frictions also hurt business morale and new orders.

LONDON (Reuters) -Euro zone business activity expanded at its fastest monthly pace in over two decades in July as the loosening of more COVID-19 restrictions gave a boost to services but fears of another wave of infections hit business confidence, a survey showed.
With vaccination rates accelerating and the burden on health care easing governments have lifted some of the curbs they imposed to try and contain the virus' spread, unleashing pent-up demand.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good guide to economic health, climbed to 60.6 in July from 59.5, its highest reading since July 2000. It was ahead of the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and a Reuters poll estimate for 60.0.
""Better than expected PMIs confirm the strong rebound expected for 3Q, as reopening services make up for the slight decline in manufacturing output due to supply chain problems,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
""Easing restriction measures are boosting service sector activity at the moment, but concerns about the spread of the Delta variant resulted in a somewhat weaker business outlook for the year ahead,"" Colijn said.
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry jumped to 60.4 from 58.3, its highest since June 2006 and ahead of the Reuters poll forecast for 59.5.
Indicating that pace won't slow anytime soon, demand was racing. The new business index rose to 59.7 from 58.7, one of the highest readings in the survey's 23 year history.
The strong recovery in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, continued with its PMI hitting the highest level in nearly a quarter of a century, fueled by strong demand partly resulting from an easing of virus containment measures.
But French activity weakened more than forecast and fell to a three-month low as shortages of materials and transportation delays impacted firms.
And in Britain, outside the euro zone, the rapid economic bounce-back from the pandemic slowed sharply as a new wave of cases forced hundreds of thousands of workers to self-isolate under government rules to limit the spread of the disease. [L8N2OY58T]
DELTA WAVE
Factories had another blistering month. The manufacturing PMI only dipped from June's record high of 63.4 to 62.6. An index measuring output that feeds into the composite PMI fell to 60.9 from 62.6.
But the spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus has further impacted already disrupted global supply chains and pushed prices for raw materials factories need soaring.
The input prices index held steady at June's survey high of 88.5.
On Thursday the European Central Bank pledged to keep interest rates at record lows for even longer to boost sluggish inflation.
It expects inflation in the euro zone as a whole to hit 1.9% this year before falling back to 1.5% in 2022 and 1.4% the year after, well below its 2% target.
The ECB also warned the rapidly spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus posed a risk to the bloc's recovery and rising infections and fears of another wave of the coronavirus put a dent in overall confidence. The composite future output index slumped to 67.8 from 71.9, its lowest February.

That chimes with European Commission data released on Thursday which showed consumer confidence fell this month.
""While actual and prospective activity trends remain very solid, it is clear that the recent increase in new coronavirus trends and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant are leaving a mark on euro zone confidence,"" said Ricardo Amaro at Oxford Economics.

That was fueled by strong demand, partly resulting from an easing of virus containment measures in Europe's largest economy. Firms, facing capacity constraints, took on staff at an unprecedented rate, Markit said.
The flash composite PMI clocked a reading of 62.5 from 60.1 in June. 
Rising input costs and output charges were feeding strong inflation, even though the actual rate of price increases was down slightly from May's record level.
Activity in the service sector was expanding very strongly, with the services index standing at 62.2, up from 57.5, its highest level since 1997. Manufacturing growth was also robust, with the index standing at 65.6, although this was only a three-month high.

""Germany's private sector economy remains in the fast lane to recovery,"" wrote IHS Markit Associate Director Phil Smith.
He added: ""Across the manufacturing sector, the picture on the demand side remains highly positive, but July's survey suggests that output has fallen further behind new orders as supply shortages continue to constrain production growth.""

Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 56.8 points in July from 57.4 in June - its lowest figure in three months.
The July figure also came in below a forecast for 58.5 points, although it remained well above the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction.
The preliminary July PMI reading for France's dominant services sector fell to 57.0 points from 57.8 in June, missing a forecast for a reading of 58.7 points.
The flash PMI for France's manufacturing sector fell to 58.1 points in July from 59.0 in June - also below a forecast for 58.4.

""Given the sharp increases in new orders that PMI data are signalling, the only hindrance to sustaining strong rates of output growth will be on the supply-side. Backlogs of work were accumulated once again in July as firms struggled to meet unrelenting demand pressures amid looser lockdown measures and subsequent economic recovery efforts both domestically and overseas,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""This was compounded by continued shortages of inputs and poor freight availability, leading to the fastest rate in cost inflation since May 2011,"" added Hayes.

LONDON (Reuters) -British retail sales resumed their post-lockdown recovery in June after a surprise fall in May, as soccer fans watching the Euro 2020 tournament loaded up on food and drink to enjoy at home, Britain's statistics agency said.
Retail sales volumes rose by 0.5% in June from May, the Office for National Statistics said, slightly stronger than a 0.4% increase expected by economists polled by Reuters.
Sales were up by 9.5% compared with their pre-coronavirus pandemic February 2020 levels, the ONS said.
Food stores, which suffered the biggest hit in spending in May as consumers returned to restaurants and bars, drove the increase in June with volumes rising by 4.2%, helped by the start of Euro 2020, the ONS said.
This was the biggest monthly rise since March 2020, when households stocked up on food at the start of the pandemic.
The ONS figures showed a 4.7% fall in clothing sales and a 10.9% drop at household good stores.
Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Euro 2020 provided only a temporary boost to retailers and shoppers were likely to rein in spending in the face of rising inflation and the end of COVID crisis aid from the government.
""Retail sales probably will fall back over the coming months,"" he said.
Face-to-face retailers also got a boost from the lifting of restrictions that shut non-essential shops until mid-May.
The ONS said online sales made up the lowest share of retail spending since March 2020 at the start of the pandemic, dropping to 26.7% in June from 28.4% in May.
Britain's economy has bounced back sharply from its nearly 10% slump in 2020 when the country locked down for longer than many other European nations in a bid to counter one of the world's heaviest coronavirus death tolls.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week lifted almost all the remaining restrictions in England.
An opinion poll published earlier on Friday showed consumers in the first half of July were their most confident since before the coronavirus pandemic despite a fresh pick-up in COVID-19 cases.
But a fall in confidence in the economy for the year ahead showed consumers were aware of the risks still posed by COVID, as well as from higher inflation and the end of the government's huge wage subsidy scheme which sheltered many workers from the crisis.

Retailers, like other companies, are facing new problems in July after an official health app told hundreds of thousands of workers to isolate following contact with someone with COVID-19.
British supermarkets warned this week that some products were in short supply as a result of staff shortages caused by the surge in self-isolating workers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. housing market appears to be straining under the weight of its own pandemic-driven success. Recent data shows the sector is returning from the stratosphere and coming back to pre-COVID levels, as evidenced by a slew of data released this week.
While for much of the pandemic a rush to suburbia made the home and real estate stars of the recovery, the resulting plunge in inventory and dearth of building supplies have launched home prices beyond the grasp of many potential buyers, particularly at the lower end of the market.
""The housing market isn't caving just yet,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. ""Have we reached a peak? That’s a possibility, but worst case scenario, I see a leveling off.""
The best news of the week for investors was delivered on Thursday by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), which reported that sales of previously owned homes rose 1.4% to 5.86 million units in June at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate, although the rebound was weaker than expected.
The number undershot consensus by 40,000 units, and followed May's downwardly-revised 1.2% decline. 
Graphic: Existing home sales: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/movanmkqkpa/ehs.png 
The inventory drought has provided sturdy support for homebuilding, but that support appears to be on the wane.
While groundbreaking on new residential homes increased by 6.3% in June, building permits, a more forward-looking indicator, dropped 5.1% to an eight-month low.
With these moves, starts and permits returned to pre-pandemic levels. 
On Monday, the National Association of Homebuilders reported builder sentiment softening, as higher input costs and rising home prices appear to be denting the traffic of potential homebuyers. 
Graphic: NAHB: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/yxmvjzzwdvr/nahb.png 
The most recent data shows an annual increase of 14.9% in the Case-Shiller's 20-city composite home price index, and NAHB's traffic of potential buyers - while still well above pre-pandemic levels - off 15.6% from November's apex. 
Graphic: Home prices and potential buyer traffic: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gkvlgmgblpb/pricesbuyers.png 
Indeed, mortgage demand dropped by 4% last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). Applications for loans to purchase homes are down 18% from the same week last year.

The equities market, the most forward-looking indicator of them all, also reflects a bit of fading luster for housing stocks.
Through much of the pandemic the group outperformed the broader market, even as much of the economy struggled with the effects of social distancing mandates that spawned an exodus from the cites to more spacious properties in the suburbs and beyond. 

Over the last 12 months, the S&P 1500 Homebuilding index and the Philadelphia SE Housing index are up 36.2% and 31.2%, respectively, more or less in line with the S&P 500's 33.0% advance over the same time period.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose to a two-month high last week, a reminder that the labor market was far from being out of the woods as the nation confronts a resurgence in new COVID-19 infections. 
Still, the weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, showed more people are returning to work, a trend that bodes well for July's employment report. The Delta variant of the coronavirus is behind the latest outbreak, with states that have low vaccination rates worst affected.
""The rise in jobless claims this week tells us that the labor market's troubles are not completely behind us and the Delta variant may yet throw a monkey wrench into the economic recovery from the shortest recession in American history,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 51,000 to a seasonally adjusted 419,000 for the week ended July 17, the highest level since mid-May. Data for the prior week was revised to show 8,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 350,000 applications for the latest week.
There were large increases in filings in Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri and Texas. Some of these states have experienced a surge in new coronavirus cases. 
Though economists do not expect large-scale business shutdowns similar to 2020, the latest wave of infections poses a risk to the economy. The National Bureau of Economic Research's business cycle dating committee declared on Monday that the pandemic recession, which started in February 2020, ended in April 2020.
Some of the rise in claims likely reflects difficulties smoothing the data for seasonal fluctuations following the upheaval from the pandemic. In normal years, layoffs are usually expected to decline in the second half of July. Before the pandemic, summer factory closures were the norm in early July, especially in the automobile industry.
The four-week average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out weekly volatility from the data, rose only 750 to 385,250.
""We need to filter the noise in the data points and not lose sight of the big picture, which is that the trend line continues to head lower, said Anu Gaggar, senior global investment analyst at Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts. ""There has been some distortion in data and in consensus expectations around automakers' annual retooling shutdowns that will work its way through the system in the upcoming weeks.""
(Graphic: Jobless claims: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/znpnedbxkvl/joblessclaims.png)
Claims have declined from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020, though they remain above the 200,000-250,000 range that is seen as consistent with healthy labor market conditions.
While other data on Thursday showed a rebound in sales of previously owned homes in June after four straight monthly declines, the pace was moderate as higher prices and low inventory remained constraints.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasuries were higher.

JOBLESS ROLLS SHRINKING
Last week's claims data covered the period in which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of July's employment report. Claims were little changed between the June and July survey periods.
The economy created 850,000 jobs in June after adding 583,000 in May. Employment is 6.8 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. Claims data have been muddied by the federal government's expansion of benefits to people who do not qualify for the regular state programs. People have to apply for state programs to determine eligibility for federal benefits.
But the unemployed are returning to work. The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 29,000 to 3.236 million during the week ended July 10, the lowest level since the pandemic started. 
The so-called continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, have been falling since late June, and data next week will offer more clues on how hiring fared in July. 
At least 20 states led by Republican governors have pulled out of federal government-funded unemployment programs, including a $300 weekly payment, which businesses claimed were encouraging unemployed Americans to stay at home. 
There were a record 9.2 million job openings at the end of May. About 9.5 million people are officially unemployed. 
Evidence is mixed on whether the early termination of federal benefits, which started on June 12 and will run through July 31, is encouraging job searches. The expanded benefits will lapse on Sept. 6 for the rest of the country.
Continuing claims have decreased in some states that have terminated federal benefits as well as in those that remain on the programs. They have also risen in some states that have prematurely ended expanded benefits. Texas reported a sharp rise in the week ended June 10.
""We expect the downward trend in continuing claims will gather momentum as top-off benefits end in all states in early September and other constraints on labor supply including lack of childcare recede,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""The latest surge in coronavirus cases may make some individuals more reluctant to return to work, however.""

At least 12.6 million people were receiving benefits under all programs in early July, down 1.263 million from late June. The latest resurgence in coronavirus infections could sharpen criticism of the states that have terminated federal benefits.
""Businesses in hard-hit areas could be forced to curtail operations and shed positions if new restrictions are needed,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation. ""What will happen to the nearly four million workers whose unemployment benefits have been cut off early?""

(Reuters) - A gauge of future U.S. economic activity increased in June, suggesting the economy continued to recover from the recession caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The Conference Board on Thursday said its index of leading economic indicators (LEI) rose 0.7% last month to 115.1, topping its previous peak reached in May.
That was shy of economists' expectations of a 0.9% increase, according to a Reuters poll.
""June’s gain in the U.S. LEI was broad-based and, despite negative contributions from housing permits and average workweek, suggests that strong economic growth will continue in the near term,"" said Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director of economic research at The Conference Board in Washington.

The LEI's coincident index, a measure of current economic conditions, rose by 0.4% in June after increasing 0.5% in May. 
But the lagging index was unchanged last month after increasing 0.6% in May.

882,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 10:07AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales rebounded in June after four straight monthly declines, but the pace was moderate as higher prices and low inventory remained constraints.
Existing home sales increased 1.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.86 million units last month, the National Association of Realtors said on Thursday. Sales rose in the Northeast, West and Midwest. They were unchanged in the densely populated South.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would rise to a rate of 5.90 million units in June.
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, increased 22.9% on a year-on-year basis. 
The COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand for houses as millions of Americans switched to remote work and schooling. 
Supply was already tight before the pandemic and is unlikely to improve as builders battle higher costs for raw materials, including lumber and concrete. Labor and building lots are also in short supply. The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that permits for future homebuilding dropped to an eight-month low in June. 
Realtors, homebuilders and a group of other stakeholders met last Friday with White House officials, including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, to discuss strategies to address the short-term supply chain disruptions in the homebuilding sector.
The median existing house price increased 23.4% from a year ago to $363,300 in June. Higher prices are in part due to sales being concentrated in the upper end of the market. Bidding wars have become the norm across the country, though the NAR said the number of multiple offers was declining. 
There were 1.25 million previously owned homes on the market last month, down 18.8% from a year ago. At June's sales pace, it would take 2.6 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.9 months a year ago. 
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. Economists do not believe another housing bubble is developing, noting that the surge is being mostly driven by a mismatch between supply and demand, rather than poor lending practices, which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis. 
But higher home prices could dampen demand. The University of Michigan's survey of consumers published last week showed consumers' complaints about rising home prices holding at an all-time high in early July. 

In June, properties typically remained on the market for 17 days, matching May's all-time low. Eighty-nine percent of the homes sold last month were on the market for less than a month. 
First-time buyers accounted for 31% of sales in June, down from 35% a year ago.

Initial jobless claims in regular state programs totaled 419,000 in the week ended July 17, up 51,000 from the prior week, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 350,000 new applications.
Continuing claims for state benefits fell to 3.24 million in the week ended July 10.
The unexpected jump in initial jobless claims reflected outsize increases in four states -- Michigan, Texas, Kentucky and Missouri. While a number of factors make seasonal adjustment of the weekly data difficult, the rapidly spreading delta variant of Covid-19 could inject further volatility into the figures in the coming months.
The initial claims figures coincide with the survey period for the Labor Department’s monthly jobs report. A majority of states reported declines on an unadjusted basis from the prior week, including New York, Oklahoma and Tennessee.
Nearly half of U.S. governors have ended all three of the federal unemployment benefit programs created during the pandemic before their expiry in September, arguing the supplemental aid is holding back job growth and preventing businesses from filling a record number of job openings.

LONDON (Reuters) -British manufacturers' expectations for output growth over the next three months are the strongest on record as the economy bounces back from its coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, the Confederation of British Industry said on Thursday.
The CBI's quarterly survey showed surging levels of employment and investment in factories but also acute inflation pressures. Average cost growth in the three months to July hit its fastest pace since 1980.
The growth in costs was expected to ease next quarter but still remain high.
""UK industry is reawakening following the economic ravages of the pandemic,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said, while pointing to challenges ahead. 
""Acute staff shortages evident across the economy are biting deeply within manufacturing, with skills in short supply and the number of people isolating climbing steeply.""
More than 600,000 people in England and Wales were advised to isolate in the week to July 14 by a government mobile app which detects if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.
New orders were driven mostly by surging domestic demand, although export orders rose for the first time since January 2019.
Investment intentions for plant and machinery over the next 12 months were the strongest since April 1988.

British finance minister Rishi Sunak announced in March a costly two-year tax incentive for companies to invest in plant and machinery to help the manufacturing sector modernise as it emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. 
A monthly version of the CBI showed total orders slipped slightly in July but remained far about their average levels and expectations for prices over the next three months similarly dipped but stayed high.

886,"<span>Jul 21, 2021 11:47AM ET</span>",,,,,,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's national statistics agency on Wednesday revealed new weights for the basket of goods and services in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), with shifts including a higher weighting for the shelter component as housing prices soar.
The updated basket weights represent consumer spending patterns in 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, and will be incorporated into June 2021 CPI, Statistics Canada said. The June data is due for release on July 28.
The CPI provides insight on inflation and is sometimes used to help determine wage increases. It also has implications for real return bonds, which compensate investors for changes in the index.
Statscan created an alternate index to better reflect the impact of spending shifts due to the pandemic, and it has consistently tracked above official inflation.
The previous basket update was based on 2017 purchasing patterns.
Three of the eight major components saw unprecedented growth in their basket weights, the statistics agency said, led by shelter, already the highest-weighted major component, which grew to 29.78% as a share of the basket, from 26.92% in 2017.
Canadian home prices have surged during the pandemic.
The share of the household operations, furnishings and equipment component grew to 15.21% and alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and recreational cannabis was up at 4.86%.
Four of the major components declined in basket share, with the transportation component shrinking the most. It fell to 15.34% from 19.72%.
The updated weightings utilize alternative data sources, to help account for pandemic-related shifts in consumer spending.

Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated to 3.6% in May, its fastest pace in a decade, due in part to the statistical comparison to tanking prices last year.
The Bank of Canada targets inflation at 2%, with a 1%-3% control range. It expects inflation to ease back to the 2% target by 2022.

(Reuters) - The number of applications for U.S. home mortgages declined last week, driven by a decrease in both refinancing and purchase activity as mortgage rates rose. 
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted market index fell 4.0% in the week ended July 16 from a week earlier. That reflected a 2.8% decrease in applications to refinance existing loans, while purchase applications declined 6.4% to their lowest level since May 2020.
The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages increased to 3.11% from 3.09% the prior week. Last week, the average contract interest rate dropped to its lowest level since February.
""Limited inventory and higher prices are keeping some prospective homebuyers out of the market,"" Joel Kan, MBA's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.
""Refinance activity fell over the week, but because rates have stayed relatively low, the pace of applications was close to its highest level since early May 2021,"" the statement added.
This week's data comes just one day after the Commerce Department reported housing starts accelerated in June, while building permits dropped to an eight-month low. 
Also, U.S. homebuilder confidence fell to an 11-month low in July, driven by shortages in both supply and labor.

""While construction companies work to balance lumber costs returning to earth with increases in labor and development costs, the market shortage of about 4.0 million homes remains an obstacle yet to overcome,"" said George Ratiu, senior economist at Realtor.com.
""Millions of buyers are eager and able to buy, if only they can find the right home at an affordable price.""

LONDON (Reuters) -British public borrowing last month was almost a fifth lower than a year earlier, when the economy was feeling the full force of the coronavirus pandemic, but rising inflation put upward pressure on debt costs.
Public sector net borrowing, excluding public sector banks, fell to 22.8 billion pounds ($31.0 billion) in June, still the second-highest June figure on record. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a drop to 21.6 billion pounds.
Reflecting the surge in borrowing by British finance minister Rishi Sunak to soften the hit from the pandemic, the data showed Britain's budget deficit leapt to 14.2% of gross domestic product during the financial year to the end of March 2021, its highest share of GDP since World War Two.
""We still expect borrowing to undershoot the OBR's latest forecast for this year. But we are not out of the woods yet, with the recent surge in COVID-19 cases putting some parts of the economy at risk of further restrictions later in the year,"" KPMG economist Michal Stelmach said.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think tank, said in a report with economists from Citi that borrowing in the 2021/22 financial year would drop to 9.3% of GDP. This is 30 billion pounds less than the government's forecasters expected in March but would still be the third-highest on record. 
The Office for National Statistics said June's debt servicing costs - which include an inflation uplift to index-linked gilts' future redemption values as well as actual interest payments - rose to a record 8.7 billion pounds.
A rise in the rate of retail price inflation was largely to blame, it added.
However, debt servicing costs as a share of GDP remain low by historic standards, and most economists say the pace of economic recovery will be the key factor in improving the public finances.
""The economy can do more of the job in 'fixing' the public finances than a fiscal tightening,"" Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics said.
Public borrowing for the first three months of the financial year totalled 69.5 billion pounds, down more than 40% from the three months to June 2020, when Britain recorded its heaviest-ever borrowing in cash terms due to its COVID spending surge.
But public debt as a share of GDP, excluding public sector banks, was 2.218 trillion pounds or 99.7% of GDP in June, its highest since March 1961.
""It's ... right that we ensure debt remains under control in the medium term, and that's why I made some tough choices at the last budget to put the public finances on a sustainable path,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
Sunak's support for furloughed workers and a tax break on property purchases are being phased out, while a temporary increase in the main benefit for the unemployed and low-earners will stop on Oct. 1. Overseas aid spending has also been cut.
Sunak is due to hold a review of government spending before the end of the year.

The IFS think tank said that although the short-run outlook for the public finances was better than in March - giving scope for one-off giveaways - the long-term prospects pointed to spending cuts for some government ministries unless taxes rise.

The mixed data forecast comes as Tokyo prepares to host the 2020 Olympic Games opening ceremony on Friday amid widespread doubt among the public about the ability of Olympic organisers to control COVID-19 infections.
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) data out at 8:50 a.m. July 30 (2350 GMT July 29) is expected to show industrial production grew 5.0% month-on-month in June, bouncing from a sharp 6.5% drop in May, according to a Reuters poll of 15 economists.
Robust overseas demand has underpinned exports and factory output, which have been a bright spot for the world's third-largest economy over the past months, despite May's slump which was due to a sharp fall in car production.
""As production adjustments at some factories of carmakers are expected to continue from July onward due to the prolonged impact of the chip shortage, there remains a downside risk to car output,"" said Junpei Fujita, an economists at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting.
Japan's economy likely avoided falling into recession in the second quarter but a fresh state of emergency in Tokyo to halt a rise in coronavirus infections is hurting the growth outlook, a separate Reuters poll showed this month.
Separate trade ministry data due at 8:50 a.m. July 30 (2350 GMT July 29) is expected to show retail sales edged up 0.2% year-on-year in June, slowing substantially from the previous month's sharp 8.3% gain.

Job availability and the jobless rate were projected to come in little changed in June, at 1.10 and 3.0% respectively, while housing starts were expected to see a 7.2% jump in June, slowing from a 9.9% rise in the prior month, the poll showed.
Job data will be released by the labour ministry at 8:30 a.m. July 30 (2330 GMT July 29) and housing starts data will be issued at 2 p.m. July 30 (0500 GMT).

Preliminary retail sales dropped 1.8% in June from a month earlier, compared with economists’ median estimate of a 0.7% decline, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said in a report released in Sydney Wednesday.
“June’s fall in turnover was due to the impact of coronavirus restrictions across multiple states,” Ben James, an official at the ABS, said in a statement. “Other states and territories saw interrupted trade due to mini-lockdowns, as well as reduced mobility between states with the tightening of border restrictions.”

Australia has been hit hard by renewed infections from the delta strain of coronavirus that has now pushed half of the country into lockdown, including its two largest cities. The economy had been growing strongly prior to the outbreak, with unemployment in June falling to 4.9%, the lowest reading in 10 years.
Victoria led the falls in June retail sales, slumping 3.5%, with the impact of the state’s fourth lockdown more pronounced. New South Wales dropped 2% and Queensland fell 1.5%.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales slumped in June as coronavirus lockdowns and mobility restrictions in much of the country hit demand, casting a shadow over the outlook for growth in the third quarter as COVID-19 cases continue to rise.
Retail turnover in June fell 1.8% from a month earlier, the biggest drop this year, preliminary figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed on Wednesday. That compared with a larger-than-expected 0.4% gain in May and a median forecast for a 0.5% drop.
""We expect retail sales to fall again in July as the Sydney lockdown intensifies, another Melbourne lockdown starts and South Australia also falls into lockdown,"" ANZ economists wrote in a note.
""As the risks of a long Sydney lockdown increase, so do the risks of a muted recovery.""
Electronics giant JB Hi-Fi this week warned its sales have suffered through July while a ban on construction activity in Sydney will likely hit hardware store sales. 
Reduced government income support and job insecurities amid extended lockdowns could further hit demand, economists warned. 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday assured Australians that the government was providing ""timely, proportionate and targeted"" support, adding the lockdowns would have a ""significant"" impact on economic growth in the current quarter. 
The remarks come as the virus situation worsened on Wednesday with both Victoria state and Sydney reporting sharp increases in new COVID-19 cases.
""With around half of Australia's population and economy now subject to hard lockdowns, the country's 'V'-shaped economic recovery could quickly become 'W'-shaped if persistent COVID-19 outbreaks aren't brought under control,"" CommSec economist Ryan Felsman said.
Fears that current lockdowns across three of Australia's six states would extend sent the local dollar in a tailspin as it slipped for a fifth straight session to the lowest since November 2020. [AUD/]
Already, a majority of economists are predicting Australia's A$2 trillion ($1.5 trillion) economy will shrink in the third quarter, its first contraction since June 2020, while the country's central bank is seen reversing its taper decision in response to the current virus outbreak.
The slowdown in demand is already evidenced by weekly consumer confidence readings, with the latest report showing a 5.2% slump last week, the biggest fall since March 2020 when the pandemic first hit.

Credit and debit card spending data from the Commonwealth Bank showed a 0.6% drop in New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital city, over the week ending July 16 versus 2019 levels. That compares with a 2.1% lift in the prior week.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports jumped in June led by U.S. demand for cars and China-bound shipments of chip-making equipment, supporting hopes for an export-led recovery in the world's third-largest economy.
Exports rose 48.6% in June from a year earlier, the fourth straight month of double-digit gains, although growth was largely exaggerated by a COVID-led plunge last year. Export growth has remained strong even as a global chip shortage weighs on Japan's car output and shipments.
With consumer spending weakening due to renewed coronavirus curbs in Tokyo, policymakers are counting on external demand to pick up the slack.
In an encouraging sign for a trade-dependent economy, exports grew 23.2% in the first half of this year, up for the first time in five periods and exceeding pre-pandemic levels seen in the first half of 2019. It was the fastest growth since the first half of 2010.
The 48.6% year-on-year export growth beat a 46.2% increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll and followed a 49.6% expansion in May, which was the sharpest monthly increase since April 1980.
""China's economy may be pausing but stimulus measures are being taken. With the help of recovery in Europe and America, it is expected to pick up again,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""That will help Japanese exports remain in an uptrend, backed by car exports as well as capital goods and information-related items.""
By destination, exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, rose 27.7% in the year to June, led by demand for chip-making equipment, raw materials and plastic.
U.S.-bound exports grew 85.5% in June, driven by shipments of cars, auto parts and motors.
Imports rose 32.7% in the year to June, more than the median estimate for a 29.0% increase.
The trade balance came to a surplus of 383.2 billion yen ($3.49 billion), versus the median estimate for a 460.0 billion yen surplus.

Japan's economy shrank an annualised 3.9% in January-March and likely barely grew in the second quarter, as the pandemic took a toll on service spending.

Five of 14 sectors monitored by Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank reported faster growth last month. Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality firms reported their strongest performance in nine years for as restrictions on indoor service were lifted. 
But the overall expansion slowed from May, when 11 out of 14 sectors reported accelerating growth.
""The slowdown of output growth across the majority of sectors shows we are entering a new phase of the UK's recovery,"" Jeavon Lolay, head of economics and market insight at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said.
""We are less likely to experience the rapid month-on-month output growth we've typically seen when businesses have been able restart operations after successive lockdowns.""
Eleven of the 14 sectors monitored in June were less optimistic about achieving stronger output volumes over the next 12 months, driven by concerns over inflation, capacity constraints and staff shortages, Lloyds said.

Purchasing managers' indices for firms in Britain's dominant services sector and manufacturing showed a slowdown in the pace of recovery in June.
The Bank of England is due to announce its latest forecasts for the economy on Aug. 5. Some of its policymakers have said that risks to the recovery mean they should maintain their huge stimulus, while others have said the time for easing off on the programme is approaching.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in June, but permits for future home construction fell to an eight-month low, likely reflecting hesitancy caused by expensive building materials as well as shortages of labor and land.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday suggested a severe shortage of houses, which has boosted prices and sparked bidding wars across the country, could persist for a while. Demand for houses is being driven by low mortgage rates and a desire for more spacious accommodations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Though lumber prices are coming down from record highs, builders are paying more for steel, concrete and lighting, and are grappling with shortages of appliances like refrigerators.
""Reports of multi-month delays in the delivery of windows, heating units, refrigerators and other items have popped up across the country, delaying delivery of homes and forcing builders to cap activity, and many builders continue to point to a shortage of available workers as a separate challenge,"" said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow.
Housing starts rose 6.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.643 million units last month. Data for May was revised down to a rate of 1.546 million units from the previously reported 1.572 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would rise to a rate of 1.590 million units.
Despite last month's increase, starts remained below March's rate of 1.737 million units, which was the highest level since July 2006. Homebuilding increased in the West and the populous South, but fell in the Northeast and Midwest.
Single-family starts rose 6.3% to a rate of 1.160 million units. The volatile multi-family homebuilding category advanced 6.2% to a pace of 483,000 units.
Starts increased 29.1% on a year-on-year basis in June.
Permits for future homebuilding fell 5.1% to a rate of 1.598 million units in June, the lowest level since October 2020. Permits are now lagging starts, suggesting that homebuilding will slow in the coming months.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher after a sharp selloff on Monday. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.

BUILDERS CAUTIOUS
While lumber futures have dropped nearly 70% from a record high in early May, economists caution that higher prices are likely to prevail because of wildfires in the Western United States.
Dustin Jalbert, head of Fastmarkets RISI's lumber team, also noted that log prices are soaring in the interior of the Canadian province of British Columbia and duties are potentially set to increase on Canadian producers later this year.
There are also signs that the exodus to suburbs and other low-density areas in search of larger homes for home offices and schooling is gradually fading as COVID-19 vaccinations allow companies to recall workers back to offices in city centers.
A rise in COVID-19 infections among unvaccinated Americans also poses a risk to the housing market outlook.
Economists expect the housing market, one of the economy's star performers during the coronavirus pandemic, was a mild drag on gross domestic product in the second quarter.
Still, homebuilding remains underpinned by the dearth of homes available for sale. The inventory of previously-owned homes is near record lows, leading to double-digit growth in the median house price.   
A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Monday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders fell to an 11-month low in July.
Shortages and higher input prices likely weighed on new home sales in June. The Mortgage Bankers Association Builder Application Survey, which was published on Tuesday, showed mortgage applications for new home purchases fell 23.8% in June from a year ago. Applications decreased 3% compared to May. The data has not been adjusted for typical seasonal patterns. The Commerce Department is due to publish new home sales data for June next Monday.
Homebuilders and a group of other stakeholders met last Friday with White House officials, including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, to discuss strategies to address the short-term supply chain disruptions in the homebuilding sector.
Building permits fell in all four regions in June. Single-family permits dropped 6.3% to a rate of 1.063 million units, the lowest since August 2020. Permits for multifamily housing slipped 2.6% to a rate of 535,000 units.
The backlog of single-family homes yet to be started grew in June to the highest level since October 2006.
""Widespread anecdotal reports point to builders delaying or turning down orders to allow shortages to ease and to catch up to a growing construction backlog,"" said Mark Palim, deputy chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington.
Housing completions fell 1.4% to a rate of 1.324 million units last month. Single-family home completions declined 6.1% to a rate of 902,000 units, the lowest level since October.

Realtors estimate that single-family housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap.
The stock of housing under construction rose 1.8% to a rate of 1.359 million units last month.

The Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which tracks repeat sales of single-family homes in 11 major Canadian markets, rose 2.7% in June from May. It follows a 2.8% gain in May, which was the largest monthly rise in the history of the index.
All 11 markets were up for a fourth straight month, including a 4% gain for Ottawa-Gatineau. Hamilton, Ontario, and Victoria, British Columbia, also had strong month-over-month advances.

On an annual basis, the Composite index rose 16%, its strongest gain on record. It was led by a 30.8% advance for Halifax, Nova Scotia, followed by Hamilton at 28% and Ottawa-Gatineau at 25.8%.

Taiwan's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, jumped 31.1% from a year earlier to $53.73 billion in June, data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed on Tuesday. 
That was the 16th month of expansion and the pace was faster than the median forecast of a rise of 29.45% in a Reuters poll. 
The ministry attributed the strong performance to demand for 5G and semiconductors, especially from auto makers, as the world grapples with chip shortages.
Demand for home electronics like laptops to support the ""home economy"", with the COVID-19 pandemic still restricting the movement of millions around the world, also remained strong, the ministry added. 
In May, export orders surged 34.5% from a year earlier to$52.29 billion. 
Taiwan companies such as Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other global tech firms. 
Looking ahead, the ministry warned of uncertainly over the spread of COVID-10 variants around the world, but saw an upside in climbing vaccination rates and the recovery of the global economy.
The start of the second half of the year is when companies start preparing new products for the year-end holiday season, while demand for 5G and other high end applications, as well as auto electronics, will also help Taiwan's orders, the ministry added. 
It expects export orders in July to rise between 15.7% and 18.9% from a year earlier.

Orders from the United States jumped 24% in June from a year earlier, a slower rate of expansion compared with the 28.1% logged in May, while orders from China were up 36.7%, versus a gain of 40% the previous month. 
Orders from Europe rose 24.3%, while those from Japan were up 28.4%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. recession touched off by the coronavirus lasted only two months, ending with a low point reached in April 2020 after the start of a sharp drop in economic activity in March of that year, the U.S. Business Cycle Dating Committee announced Monday.
The committee, a group of macroeconomists who assign the start and end dates of U.S. business cycles, said that while the country had by no means gotten back to normal operating capacity at that point, indicators of both jobs and production ""point clearly to April 2020 as the month of the trough,"" with a rebound beginning in May.
Indeed, the resumption of growth was so rapid the committee said it was only ""the unprecedented magnitude of the decline"" that led members to consider what happened to be a recession in the first place, with a downturn typically requiring ""depth, duration and diffusion"" to qualify for the label.
Around 22 million jobs disappeared from company payrolls in March and April of that year, an event that sparked concern about a new Depression and led Congress and the White House to approve the first of several massive relief packages to keep firms and households afloat.
The designation of the recession's end date is of historical note, but also relevant to research on the dynamics of business cycles and, in this case, into how that historic policy response played out.
The announcement makes the pandemic recession by far the shortest on record, at two months only a third as long as the six-month downturn at the start of 1980, and a fourth as long as the recession that followed the collapse of the tech bubble in 2001. 
That alone may feed arguments in favor of the ""cash-first"" approach fiscal policymakers have taken to fighting this pandemic through repeated household support payments, expanded unemployment benefits, and liberal financing for small businesses.
It also highlights the still open debate over how fast the U.S. economy will get back to normal, and what that will mean. Measured by output, the country may already have recovered; measured by employment, it is still far short, with the biggest economic scars threatening lower wage and less educated workers.
Amid what became a divisive national conversation over masks and lockdowns, some 2.8 million people were brought back to work in May of 2020, and over the next year about 15 million jobs were recovered. More than 7 million jobs remain lost.
Employment ""reached a clear trough in April before rebounding strongly the next few months and then settling into a more gradual rise,"" with incomes rising as well, the committee said in a statement released through the National Bureau of Economic Research. 

With coronavirus infections again increasing and a national immunization drive stalled with less than 60% of the eligible population vaccinated, fears of a new slowdown have increased. 
The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were both down more than 2% by midday, and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell to a 5-month low.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.2% in June from a year earlier to mark the fastest annual pace in over a year, data showed on Tuesday, a sign the impact of global commodity inflation was gradually broadening.
But the increase, driven largely by higher energy costs, was much smaller than that of other major economies due to weak consumption, reinforcing expectations the Bank of Japan will be forced to maintain its massive stimulus for the time being.
The rise in the core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, matched a median market forecast for a 0.2% gain and followed a 0.1% increase in May.
The increase, which was the fastest since March 2020, was due mostly to a 4.6% rise in energy costs with gasoline prices up 17.9% in a sign households were facing higher cost of living.
""It's cost-push type inflation that likely won't have legs, with items propping up prices mostly energy-related,"" said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.
Some countries, including the United States and Britain, have seen inflation rise faster than expected as demand recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, triggering debate on how quickly they should wean their economies off stimulus.
With inflation well short of its 2% target, the BOJ is likely to lag well behind its counterparts in dialing back its massive monetary support to underpin a fragile recovery.
While global commodity inflation has pushed up wholesale prices in Japan, consumer prices have barely risen as companies remain cautious about passing on higher costs to households.
From the CPI data for July due on Aug. 20, the government will use a new base year that will lead to tweaks in the weighting of some items consisting the index.
Many analysts project the change to push core CPI back to negative territory due to an expected increase in the weighting of cellphone fees, which have been declining recently.
Mizuho Securities' Ueno expects the base year change to push down core CPI by around 0.2% point.
A resurgence in COVID-19 infections forced the government to impose new state of emergency curbs in Olympic host city Tokyo from Monday through August 22, dashing policymakers' hope for a solid rebound in economic growth in July-September.

In fresh quarterly projections released on Friday, the BOJ cut its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year ending in March 2022 to 3.8% from 4.0% due in part to the new curbs.
It revised up this year's core CPI forecast to 0.6% from 0.1% largely reflecting the boost from higher energy prices.

(Reuters) -U.S. homebuilder confidence in the market for single family homes fell in July to its lowest level since August 2020, driven by shortages in both supply and labor.
The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index declined to a reading of 80 this month from 81 in June. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index to advance marginally to a reading of at 82. A reading above 50 means more builders view market conditions as favorable than poor. The index hit an all-time high of 90 in November 2020.
""Builders are contending with shortages of building materials, buildable lots and skilled labor as well as a challenging regulatory environment,"" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. ""This is putting upward pressure on home prices and sidelining many prospective home buyers even as demand remains strong in a low-inventory environment.""
Surging home prices and limited supply has put a lid on home sales recently, and fewer U.S. consumers believe that now is a good time to buy a home.
The NAHB survey's measure of single-family home sales expectations in the next six months rose two points to a reading of 81 in July, while a gauge of current sales conditions decreased one point to 86.

The prospective buyers index fell six points to 65.
Housing starts in June are forecast to rise, according to a survey of economists polled by Reuters about the data due for release on Tuesday.

(Reuters) -U.S. consumer sentiment fell sharply and unexpectedly in early July to the lowest level in five months as inflation worries dented confidence in the economic recovery, a survey showed on Friday.
The University of Michigan said its preliminary consumer sentiment index fell to 80.8 in the first half of this month - the lowest since February - from a final reading of 85.5 in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would rise to 86.5.
""Consumers' complaints about rising prices on homes, vehicles, and household durables has reached an all-time record,"" Richard Curtin, the survey director, said in a statement.
Supply constraints nationwide have led to a surge in consumer prices, as they increased by the most in 13 years in June. 
The survey's gauge of current economic conditions also fell to a reading of 84.5, the lowest since August 2020, from 88.6 in June. Its measure of consumer expectations slid to 78.4, the lowest since February, from 83.5. 

The survey's one-year inflation expectation shot to the highest level since August 2008 at 4.8%, up from 4.2%, while its five-year inflation outlook ticked up to 2.9% from 2.8% in June.
""Inflation has put added pressure on living standards, especially on lower and middle income households, and caused postponement of large discretionary purchases, especially among upper income households,"" Curtin said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly increased in June as demand for goods remained strong even as spending is shifting back to services, supporting expectations that economic growth accelerated in the second quarter.
The rebound in sales reported by the Commerce Department on Friday was despite purchases of motor vehicles declining for a second straight month due to a lack of supply caused by a global semiconductor shortage. Sales were also flattered by higher prices resulting from supply constraints as COVID-19 vaccinations, low interest rates and massive fiscal stimulus fuel demand.
""Growing pains from reopening are on the supply side,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Inflation reports earlier this week confirm firms are still struggling to keep up with this demand, but another month of high retail spending should give companies confidence that consumer demand is not slowing down anytime soon.""
Retail sales rose 0.6% last month. Data for May was revised down to show sales falling 1.7% instead of declining 1.3% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales dropping 0.4% in June. 
Sales advanced 18.0% compared to June last year and are now 18.0% above their pre-pandemic level. Retail sales mostly capture the goods component of consumer spending, with services such as healthcare, education, travel and hotel accommodation making up the remaining portion. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report.

Demand shifted to goods like electronics and motor vehicles during the pandemic as millions of people worked from home, took online classes and avoided public transportation. Spending is now rotating back to services like travel and entertainment.
Though worries about inflation hurt consumer sentiment this month, spending was likely to remain underpinned by record savings and rising wealth. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to 80.8 early this month from 85.5 in June. The survey's inflation expectations over the next 12 months shot up to 4.8% from 4.2% in June.

Receipts at auto dealerships fell 2.0% after declining 4.6% in May. But sales at clothing stores increased 2.6%, likely as people venturing outside their homes spruced up their wardrobes. Sales at services stations also rose, reflecting increased mobility and higher gasoline prices. 
Consumers increased spending at restaurants and bars, leading to a 2.3% rise in receipts. Sales at restaurants and bars increased 40.2% compared to June 2020. Receipts at food and beverage stores gained 0.6%. 
Online retail sales rose 1.2%, a modest increase given Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime Day, which was emulated by other retailers. Sales at electronics and appliance stores rose 3.3%.

Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 1.1% last month after a downwardly revised 1.4% decrease in May. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have dropped 0.7% in May.
""Heading into the back-to-school season, we expect record sales as families purchase electronics, shoes and backpacks for in-person learning this year,"" said Matthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation. 

Despite the downward revision to May core retail sales, economists remained steadfast in their belief that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, logged double-digit growth in the second quarter. Consumer spending grew at an 11.4% annualized rate in the first quarter.
Gross domestic product growth estimates for this quarter are around a 9% rate, which would be an acceleration from the 6.4% pace notched in the first quarter. Economists believe the economy could achieve growth of at least 7% this year. That would be the fastest growth since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years.

Business inventories rose 0.5% after edging up 0.1% in April, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. May's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
Inventories increased 4.5% on a year-on-year basis in May.
Retail inventories decreased fell 0.8% in May as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 1.7% decrease in April. 
Motor vehicle inventories decreased 5.5%, rather than 5.3% as estimated in an advance report published last month. A global semiconductor shortage is undercutting auto production, leading to stocks being run down and prices of used car and trucks soaring, boosting inflation. 
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.9% as estimated last month. 
Raw material and labor shortages are making it difficult for businesses to restock. COVID-19 vaccinations, low interest rates and nearly $6 trillion in government relief since the pandemic started in the United States in March 2020 are fueling demand., straining the supply chain. 
Inventories were depleted in the first quarter. The inventory drawdown subtracted 2.7 points from GDP growth in the January-March quarter. Most economists are forecasting GDP growth just under a 10% annualized rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a strong 6.4% rate in first three months of the year after expanding at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter.

Wholesale inventories rose 1.3% in May. Stocks at manufacturers advanced 0.9%.
Business sales fell 0.3% in May after increasing 0.6% in April. At May's sales pace, it would take 1.26 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.25 months in April.

The median forecast from a poll of 10 economists expects export orders to jump 29.45% from the year-ago period. Forecasts for growth ranged from 19% to 32.4%.
Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asia's exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports likely soared in June thanks to robust global demand for machinery and technology-related goods and as shipments rebounded sharply from last year's pandemic-induced slump, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
Exports jumped 46.2% in June from a year earlier, the fourth straight month of double-digit gains, with the annual export growth rate largely skewed by a COVID-driven plunge in June 2020. Export growth has remained strong even as a global chip shortage has weighed on Japan's car output and shipments.
With consumer spending weakening due to a renewed state of coronavirus emergency curbs in Tokyo, policymakers are counting on external demand to pick up the slack in the world's third largest economy.
Japan's economy shrank an annualised 3.9% in January-March and likely barely grew in the second quarter, as the pandemic took a toll on service spending.
Core consumer inflation likely picked up just a tad in June, according to the Reuters poll, underscoring the challenge the Bank of Japan (BOJ) faces as it tries to meet its elusive 2% inflation target.
Investors will keep a close eye on the release of trade data on July 20 at 2350 GMT and consumer prices on July 19 at 2330 GMT after the BOJ stuck to its massive monetary stimulus on Friday.
The export growth in June comes after exports soared 49.6% in May, the sharpest monthly increase since April 1980. They plunged 26.2% in June of 2020.
Imports likely jumped 29.0% year-on-year last month, which would result in a trade surplus of 460.0 billion yen ($4.18 billion), the poll showed.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, is expected to have risen 0.2% in June from a year earlier, after a 0.1% increase in May, the Reuters poll showed.

The BOJ maintained its massive monetary stimulus at its policy review that ended on Friday, keeping its policy interest rate at minus 0.1% and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target at around 0%.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's consumer prices rose 3.2% in June, in line with analyst forecasts, taking 12-month inflation above 50% for the first time since early last year as the country grapples to bring down runaway inflation that hurts wages and growth.
The country's official INDEC statistics agency said on Thursday that prices rose 25.3% in the first half of the year and were up 50.2% versus a year earlier.
A Reuters poll of analysts had earlier predicted the monthly rise, which is the slowest of the year so far, but warned that prices would likely reheat as the country neared mid-term legislative elections in November.
""There is a slight slowdown that began in May due to seasonal factors,"" said Natalia Motyl, analyst at the Fundacion Libertad y Progreso.
""This slowdown is expected to reverse as we get closer to the elections, when the uncertainty of the year causes a greater run against the peso."" 
Argentina's Economy Ministry in a statement said it expected monthly price rises to continue to cool, though cited elevated global inflation and high commodities prices including grains such as soy and wheat which the country produces and exports.
""This disorderly inflation is a new phenomenon typical of the pandemic, not only in Argentina, but it is also making it difficult for other countries to meet their goals,"" it said.
Battling inflation: https://tmsnrt.rs/36BZUr1
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Alberto Ramos said the price rises came despite soft domestic demand, high unemployment and depressed real wages. Capital and pricing controls were creating ""a significant amount of repressed inflation in the system"".
""High inflation remains one of the key macroeconomic challenges facing the government, and a significant political liability for the government coalition,"" he said.
Argentina has been battling runaway inflation for years, with an annualized rate currently at an eye-watering 50%, far higher than the government's 29% target for the year.
""It looks very difficult that this year's inflation is not higher than that of 2020,"" said Tobías Pejkovich, an economist at the Abeceb consultancy, referring to the 36% rise last year.

Analysts estimates had ranged from a minimum monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) advance of 3.0% to a maximum of 3.6%.

(Reuters) - Applications to start new U.S. businesses dropped sharply in June, falling for the first time since February. 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that business applications decreased 9.8% to a seasonally adjusted 448,553 last month. The data is derived from business applications for tax identifications. 
There were a seasonally adjusted 51,543 applications from corporations, down 1.6% from May. Applications for businesses with planned wages totaled 52,325, a decrease of 7.6% from the prior month. 
Business applications fell in all four U.S. regions, led by a 12.25 drop in the Midwest last month and were lower across all industries. 

The largest drop was in mining, which recorded a 25.7% decline, with other sizable drops in ,accommodation and food services as well as the administrative and support category. 
Based on June's figures, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau, which compiles the data, projected about 32,990 new business start-ups with payroll tax liabilities would form within four quarters of application, down 6.9% compared with the estimates for May.

(Reuters) -Factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region slowed sharply for the third consecutive month to its lowest growth since December after hitting its highest pace in nearly half a century earlier this spring, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index fell to 21.9 from 30.7 in June. That was well below economists' expectations for a reading of 28.0, according to a Reuters poll.
Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. The survey covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
It is seen as one of the first monthly indicators of the health of U.S. manufacturing leading up to the national report by the Institute for Supply Management, next due out August 2.
Even though U.S. factory orders rebounded sharply in May, factories are still struggling to keep up with demand as the COVID-19 pandemic shattered supply chains and rattled the global shipping industry. Nationwide, manufacturing output at U.S. factories fell in June. 
In March, the Philly Fed's factory activity gauge hit its highest level since 1973.
The Philly Fed employment index decreased to 29.2 from 30.7 in June. 

Additionally, the price paid index fell sharply to 69.7 in July from 80.7 in the month prior, after reaching a 42-year high in June. While this marked the index's first decline in three months, it still remains at a historically elevated level.
In addition, the bank's six-month outlook index, a gauge of future business activity, tumbled to 48.6 in July from 69.2 the previous month, its lowest reading since February. It was also the largest drop in a year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a 16-month low last week as the labor market gains traction, but worker shortages and bottlenecks in the supply chain are frustrating efforts by businesses to ramp up production to meet strong demand for goods and services.
Manufacturing production fell in June, with motor vehicle assembly tumbling amid a relentless global shortage of semiconductor chips, other data showed on Thursday. The imbalance between supply and demand as the economy emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic is stoking inflation, with prices expected to remain high in the months ahead before moderating.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Thursday that he anticipated the shortages and high inflation would abate over time.
""The problem continues to be sourcing the input components and the skilled workers that remain in short supply, but there is evidence that the logjam is beginning to break up,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 360,000 for the week ended July 10, the lowest level since the middle of March in 2020, the Labor Department said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 13,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 360,000 applications for the latest week. Claims have struggled to make further progress since dropping below 400,000 in late May, even as at least 20 states led by Republican governors have pulled out of federal government-funded unemployment programs. 
Graphic: Jobless claims: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/qzjvqxrjypx/joblessclaims.png 
Unemployed people are required to file claims under the regular state programs to determine eligibility for federal benefits. The early termination of the federal programs followed complaints by businesses that the benefits, including a $300 weekly check, were encouraging unemployed Americans to stay at home. The economy is experiencing a shortage of workers, with a record 9.2 million job openings as of the end of May. 
About 9.5 million people are officially unemployed. The disconnect has also been blamed on lack of affordable child care, fears of contracting the coronavirus as well as pandemic-related career changes and retirements. 
Evidence is mixed on whether the early termination of federal benefits, which started on June 12 and will run through July 31, is encouraging job seeking. The expanded benefits will lapse on Sept. 6 for the rest of the country. 
The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid fell 126,000 to 3.241 million in the week ended July 3. Texas and Georgia accounted for the bulk of the decline in these so-called continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag.
""Claims in those two states, where top-off benefits ended June 26, fell to their lowest level since March 2020, suggesting the early end to benefits might be encouraging some people to return to work,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Florida and South Carolina, which have also terminated federal benefits early, reported big increases in continuing claims. Some states that have not prematurely ended expanded benefits also saw declines in people on the jobless rolls. 
At least 13.8 million people were collecting unemployment checks under all programs in late June.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS
In a separate report on Thursday, the Fed said manufacturing output dipped 0.1% in June after accelerating 0.9% in May. It was pulled down by a 6.6% plunge in production at auto plants. The global chip shortage is forcing automakers to adjust production schedules.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced on Thursday that its Lansing Delta Township Assembly plant in Michigan and Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee would take downtime from July 19 through July 26.
Auto production cuts have boosted demand for used cars and trucks, the major driver of consumer inflation in recent months.
Still, manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, grew at a 3.7% annualized rate in the second quarter after increasing at a 2.3% pace in the January-March period. Demand is being fueled by COVID-19 vaccinations, low interest rates and nearly $6 trillion in government relief since the pandemic started in the United States in March 2020.
Though vaccinations are boosting spending on travel-related services and dining out among other activities, demand for goods remains robust and inventories are extremely low, which should keep manufacturing supported. 
A third report from the New York Fed showed its measure of factory activity in New York state surged in July, with new orders and shipments rising strongly.
While a fourth report from the Philadelphia Fed showed a drop this month in its gauge of manufacturing in the region that covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, activity continued to expand at a solid clip.
""Anecdotal guidance suggests that supply issues could start to be resolved later this year and into 2022,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""As long as indications of demand remain strong, we expect production to remain supported into 2022 as supply issues eventually ease.""
An easing of bottlenecks is expected to relieve some of the inflation pressure. In a fifth report, the Labor Department said import prices rose 1.0% in June after surging 1.4% in May. In the 12 months through June, import prices advanced 11.2% compared to 11.6% in May.

The government reported this week that consumer prices increased by the most in 13 years in June, while producer prices accelerated.
""The U.S. is experiencing cost-push inflation, which historically has proven more temporary than other causes of inflation, primarily demand pull,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's economy grew slightly more slowly than expected in the second quarter, weighed down by higher raw material costs and new COVID-19 outbreaks, as expectations build that policymakers may have to do more to support the recovery.
Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 7.9% in the April-June quarter from a year earlier, official data showed on Thursday, missing expectations for a rise of 8.1% in a Reuters poll of economists.
Growth slowed significantly from a record 18.3% expansion in the January-March period, when the year-on-year growth rate was heavily skewed by the COVID-induced slump in the first quarter of 2020.
Retail sales and industrial output grew more slowly in June, the latter dragged by a sharp fall in motor vehicle production, while NBS data also showed a cooling in China's housing market, a key engine of growth.
But June activity data still beat expectations, providing some relief to investors concerned about a slowdown after the central bank announced policy easing last week.
""The numbers were marginally below our expectation and the market's expectation (but) I think the momentum is fairly strong,"" said UOB economist Woei Chen Ho in Singapore.
""Our greater concern is the uneven recovery that we've seen so far and for China the recovery in domestic consumption is very important...retail sales this month was fairly strong and that may allay some concerns.""
While the world's second-largest economy has rebounded strongly from the COVID-19 crisis, buoyed by solid export demand and policy support, data releases in recent months have suggested some loss in momentum.
Higher raw material costs, supply shortages and pollution controls are weighing on industrial activity, while small COVID-19 outbreaks have kept a lid on consumer spending.
Investors are watching to see if the central bank is shifting to an easier policy stance after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced last week it would cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, just as some other central banks begin or start thinking about exiting pandemic-era stimulus.
Average second quarter growth in 2020 and 2021 was 5.5%, up slightly from a 5% average for the first quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. 
On a quarterly basis, GDP expanded 1.3% in the April-June period, the NBS said, just beating expectations for a 1.2% rise in the Reuters poll. The NBS revised down growth in the first quarter from the fourth quarter last year to 0.4%.
POLICY EASING?
The PBOC move, which released about 1 trillion yuan ($154.64 billion) in long-term liquidity to bolster the recovery, comes even as policymakers have sought to normalise policy after the economy's strong rebound from the coronavirus crisis to contain financial risks.
It highlights the challenges policymakers will face in rolling back pandemic-era stimulus as the coronavirus continues to flare-up around the world.
""The domestic economic recovery is uneven,"" said Liu Aihua, an official at the NBS at a briefing on Thursday. 
""We must also see that the global epidemic continues to evolve, and there are many external instabilities and uncertain factors,"" she said. 
Premier Li Keqiang reiterated on Monday that China would not resort to flood-like stimulus.
Still, economists in the Reuters poll expected more support this year, forecasting a further cut in the bank reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in the fourth quarter.
Some market watchers say a cut in the country's benchmark loan prime rate may be next, possibly as early as next week.
""Based on the current situation, if policymakers do not act, the GDP figure in Q4 could fall out of the reasonable range as data from last Q4 was shining,"" said Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ in Shanghai.
""I expect the government to roll out targeted easing measures."" 
HEADWINDS
China's strong exports have been a key support to the country's post-COVID recovery, but a customs official said this week overall trade growth may slow in the second half of 2021, partly reflecting COVID-19 pandemic uncertainties.
""Headwinds to growth are likely to intensify during the second half of the year,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics in a note.
""China's COVID-19 export boom appears to have peaked and will unwind over the coming quarters as vaccine rollouts and reopening help to normalise global consumption patterns.""
New home prices rose in June at the slowest clip since April and property investment at its weakest pace this year as government measures to cool a hot housing market further tapped the brakes on growth.
The NBS data showed China's industrial output grew 8.3% in June from a year ago, slowing from a 8.8% rise in May. Economists in the poll had expected a 7.8% year-on-year rise. 
Retail sales grew 12.1% from a year earlier in June. Analysts in the poll had expected a 11.0% increase after May's 12.4% rise.
Economists in the Reuters poll expected a 8.6% GDP expansion in 2021, which would be the highest annual growth in a decade and well above the country's official target for growth higher than 6%. China was the only major economy to have avoided a contraction last year, expanding 2.3%.

Fixed asset investment grew 12.6% in the first six months of 2021 from the same period a year earlier, versus a forecast 12.1% uptick and down from a 15.4% jump in January-May.

LONDON (Reuters) -The number of employees on British company payrolls surged in June by the most since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data which painted a picture of a roaring jobs market and growing inflationary pressure from rising wages.
A day after a top Bank of England official said the time for the BoE to think about taking action on inflation might be approaching sooner than he had expected, tax data https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/earningsandemploymentfrompayasyouearnrealtimeinformationuk/july2021 showed a 356,000 leap in employment in June from May.
The increase was driven by 94,000 more accommodation and food jobs, which were hit by lockdowns that have now been largely lifted, and a 72,000 rise in jobs in administration and support services, including temporary staff at recruitment agencies.
The headline unemployment rate https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/july2021 for the three months to May stood at 4.8%, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected it to hold at 4.7% seen in the three months to April.
But the ONS said the population estimates used to calculate the unemployment rate had changed and the figure for the three months to April would have been 4.8% under the new system. 
Britain's labour market has been propped up by finance minister Rishi Sunak's job subsidies which paid the wages on 8.9 million jobs at its peak in May 2020, during the first COVID-19 lockdown, and supported 2.4 million jobs at the end of May 2021.
The scheme is being phased out by the end of September which could push unemployment back up.
""We anticipate the unemployment rate to rise to around 5.5% in winter this year as the furlough scheme ends, with around one in 10 furloughed workers potentially unable to return to their original job,"" Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said.
RECORD GROWTH IN PAY AND VACANCIES
Thursday's figures showed the fastest headline wage growth in the year to May since records began in 2000, although the comparisons have been skewed by greater job losses among low-paid workers and comparison with depressed wages a year ago.
Average weekly earnings in the three months to the end of May rose by 7.3% compared with a year earlier.
The ONS estimated underlying wage growth, excluding distortions caused by the pandemic, was between 3.9% and 5.1% for average weekly earnings. For average earnings excluding bonuses it was between 3.2% and 4.4%.
The pick-up in hiring and in pay added to signs of how fast Britain's economy is bouncing back from its nearly 10% crash last year when it was hit by one of the world's heaviest COVID death tolls and long lockdowns.
The number of job vacancies in the three months to June rose by 241,000 to 862,000, the biggest quarterly increase since records began in 2001 and just short of the record-high total number of vacancies seen in late 2018.
BoE Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Wednesday that the conditions set by the central bank for any tightening of monetary policy might be approaching.
Data earlier that day showed inflation hit 2.5% in May due to higher oil prices and bottlenecks as the economy reopened - a sharper rise than the BoE had been forecasting.
Ramsden said British inflation might rise as high as 4% ""for a period later this year"" - double the BoE's target - and the factors driving it up might take some time to ease off.
On Thursday, financial markets were pricing in a first rise in BoE interest rates to 0.25% by August 2022, little changed from Wednesday.
Ruth Gregory, an economist with Capital Economics, said the labour market was well on its way to recovery but revisions to past figures, including lower employment than previously reported, suggested it could still absorb inflation pressure.
""While there is growing evidence that firms are finding it more difficult to hire workers, we suspect that most of these labour shortages will prove temporary and that they will be confined to a few sectors,"" she said.

China's property market has rebounded quickly from the COVID-19 shock early last year, raising concerns about financial risks and overheating.
Late last year, authorities began stepping up curbs on the sector, including restricting debt accumulation by developers, capping banks' lending to the sector and guiding banks to increase mortgage rates.
But the moves are starting to drag on the property sector, a vital source of growth for the economy.
""Housing price growth is expected to soften in the future with ongoing tight credit and the possibility of more cities implementing pricing reference for resale homes,"" said Xu Xiaole, analyst at Beike Research Institute.

Despite a flurry of cooling measures, head of China's banking and insurance regulator Guo Shuqing warned last month that local real-estate bubbles remained serious.
The NBS data also showed 55 cities reported monthly gains, falling from 62 in May, and the fewest since January.

(Reuters) - Growth in East Asia and the Pacific this year will likely be slower than previously thought, the World Bank said on Thursday, as many countries in the region grapple with spikes in COVID-19 cases, new variants and vaccine supply constraints. 
The East Asia and Pacific region, excluding China, is expected to grow 4% this year, World Bank President David Malpass said, down from a 4.4% forecast in March, with countries like conflict-torn Myanmar facing a deeper-than-expected slump. 
Including China, which the global lender said will likely grow 8.5% in 2021, the region is expected to expand by 7.7% this year, faster than a 7.4% projection made in March, Malpass told a streamed news conference.
The speed by which nations could roll out vaccines remained a risk to the outlook, with many countries in the region unlikely to be able to fully vaccinate their population until 2024, Malpass said. 
""The immediate priority for developing countries is widespread access to COVID-19 vaccines that match their deployment programmes,"" Malpass said.
The World Bank chief said he is concerned about developing nations falling behind in what has become a two-speed recovery with advanced economies posting a stronger rebound as more of their people get fully vaccinated. 
""This is the reason why we have a major focus on expanding the reach of vaccines,"" said Malpass, who earlier this month announced the bank was raising financing for COVID-19 vaccine purchases and deployment to $20 billion from its previous target of $12 billion.
Malpass again urged advanced economies to give up excess doses of COVID-19 vaccines for developing countries which are facing greater needs. 

Unlike countries like Britain and Germany which are preparing to remove most remaining restrictions, many in the region are reimposing targeted lockdowns to arrest a surge in cases and control the spread of more contagious variants.
The worsening COVID-19 crisis in Myanmar, which has been in turmoil since its military took power in a coup on Feb. 1, could push its economy into a ""bigger contraction"" this year, Malpass said. The World Bank forecast a 10% slump in Myanmar's economy in March.

Investing.com – China’s GDP growth slowed in the second quarter of 2021, in a further sign that the economic recovery from COVID-19 continued to show signs of slowing down, according to second-quarter data released earlier in the day.
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data said China’s second-quarter GDP grew 7.9% year-on-year in the second quarter, lower than both the 8.1% growth in forecast prepared by Investing.com and the 18.3% growth from the first quarter. However, it grew 1.3% quarter-on-quarter, exceeding both the 1.2% growth in Investing.com forecasts and the previous quarter’s 0.6% growth.
The data also said industrial production grew 8.3% year-on-year in June, higher than the forecast 7.8% growth but lower than the 8.8% growth recorded in May. Fixed asset investment also grew 12.6% year-on-year in June, higher than the 12.1% in Investing.com forecasts but lower than the 15.4% growth recorded in the previous month.
The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was unchanged at 5%.
Trade data released earlier in the week showed a surprise growth in June exports alongside indications of the slowdown in economic recovery. Consumers have also been more cautious spenders as incomes decreased due to COVID-19 and sporadic outbreaks of the virus restrict travel.
The data also comes as the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in a surprise move during the previous week, thus freeing up about CNY 1 trillion yuan ($154.55 billion) in liquidity that can be used to boost the economic recovery. This cut came into effect earlier in the day.
The central bank also rolled over a portion of medium-term policy loans coming due, signaling its unwillingness to make big changes in monetary policy.
Investors remained cautious, with Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc head of China macro strategy Becky Liu warning the economy needs more support and there could be more RRR cuts ahead.
“China’s growth is decent, but it’s not good enough, and the economy will likely moderate further from here... the market underestimated the central bank’s determination to ease monetary policy and support growth... the RRR cut is an obvious signal that China has entered an easing cycle. RRR is never one-off, and I expect the PBOC to reduce RRR again by year-end,” she said.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang was also cautious about the economic outlook, saying earlier in the week that the country must prepare for cyclical risks and make appropriate counter-cyclical adjustments."
